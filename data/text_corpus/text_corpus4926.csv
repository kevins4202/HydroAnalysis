24630,urban tree cover contributes to human well being through a variety of ecosystem services in this study we focus on the role that trees can play in reducing temperature during warm seasons and associated impacts on human health and well being we introduce a method for quantifying and valuing changes in premature mortality from extreme heat due to the changes in urban tree cover and apply this method to baltimore city maryland the model i tree cool air uses a water and energy balance to estimate hourly changes in air temperature due to alternative scenarios of tree cover applied across 653 census block groups the changes in temperature are applied to existing temperature mortality models to estimate changes in health outcomes and associated values existing tree cover in baltimore is estimated to reduce annual mortality by 543 deaths as compared to a 0 tree cover scenario increasing the area of current tree cover by 10 of each census block group reduced baseline annual mortality by 83 to 247 deaths valued at 0 68 2 0 billion applying value of statistical life estimates over half of the reduced mortality is from the over 65 year age group who are among the most vulnerable to extreme heat reductions in air temperature due to increased tree cover were greatest in downtown baltimore where tree cover is relatively low and impervious cover is relatively high however the greatest reductions in mortality occurred in the outskirts of baltimore where a greater number of people who are over 65 years in age reside quantifying and valuing the health benefits of changes in air temperatures due to increased tree cover can inform climate adaptation and mitigation plans by decision makers developing adaptation strategies to effectively address these issues will become increasingly important in the future under changing climates and an aging population keywords ecosystem services heat related mortality vulnerability health impacts economic valuation human well being urban heat island modeling temperature changes i tree 1 introduction urban tree cover provides a myriad of ecosystem services and contributes to human health and well being at local regional national and global scales tree cover benefits include air and water filtration temperature climate and water regulation noise reduction increased biodiversity and pollination and esthetic improvements bolund and hunhammar 1999 g√≥mez baggethun and barton 2013 nowak and dwyer 2007 through quantification and valuing of these services tree cover effects can be incorporated within city actions to improve public health haase et al 2014 estimates of monetary benefits provide a common metric that can be compared with costs of implementing the policies and support the development and prioritization of optimal policies thus efforts to expand and improve the quantification and valuation of urban tree services are critical for improved decision making in urban environments and thereby advance the united nation s sustainable development goals u n general assembly 2015 air temperature reductions caused by the presence of trees are getting increasing attention due to changing climates npr 2019 although based on different data and methods and thus not directly comparable existing studies provide insights on the issue of heat related mortality in the united states an average of 702 heat related deaths occurred annually between 2004 and 2018 vaidyanathan et al 2020 however this estimate uses data from medical records which often do not capture the role of heat in exacerbating other causes of death not explicitly categorized as heat related usgcrp 2016 a study using statistical approaches estimated more than 1 300 deaths per summer during the 1975 2004 period kalkstein et al 2011 more recent studies provide evidence of even higher estimates for example weinberger et al 2020 estimate over 5 000 annual deaths between 1997 and 2006 in 297 counties representing 61 9 of the total population in the country and shindell et al 2020 estimate about 12 000 premature deaths annually due to heat related deaths over the last decade during a heat wave year the total number of deaths is estimated to be substantially larger for example a heat wave in chicago in july 1995 resulted in approximately 700 deaths kaiser et al 2007 and one in europe led to more than 70 000 deaths in summer 2003 robine et al 2008 the number of premature heat related deaths in the summer is projected to increase by the thousands under climate change scenarios in the united states and similar trends would be seen in different parts of the world usgcrp 2016 gasparrini et al 2017 extreme heat can also result in morbidity impacts such as heat exhaustion and heat cramps as well as exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses guo et al 2018 people with specific demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are more sensitive to extreme heat gamble et al 2016 among them are adults above the age of 65 who are more sensitive to extreme heat due to issues related to thermoregulation preexisting diseases need to rely on others and limited mobility balbus and malina 2009 basu and samet 2002 benmarhnia et al 2015 gamble et al 2013 projected increases in heat related health impacts and differences in population vulnerability to extreme heat have important implications for public health and environmental justice developing adaptation strategies to effectively address these issues will become increasingly important in the future quantifying and valuing the health benefits of changes in air temperatures due to increased tree cover can inform climate adaptation and mitigation plans made by decision makers evidence from the literature suggests that increasing tree cover in cities can reduce air temperatures and urban heat island effects e g akbari et al 2001 yet these findings are often limited to a few small empirical studies bowler et al 2010 heavily forested parks in baltimore have been shown to have up to 7 1 c cooler air temperatures in the evening and about 2 7 c cooler temperatures in the daytime relative to the inner city nowak and heisler 2010 cooler air temperatures have direct and indirect benefits for human health kovats and hajat 2008 even small differences in seasonal average temperatures can affect human mortality and public health usgcrp 2016 in new york city deaths during heat waves were less likely among residents living in areas with more green space madrigano et al 2015 the goal of this study was to introduce and demonstrate a method and tool for quantifying and valuing changes in mortality from extreme heat due to the presence of tree cover existing studies that quantify temperature mortality impacts of increased tree cover primarily use a greenspace exposure mortality dose response approach e g kondo et al 2020 without directly modeling temperature changes in our study we employ an approach similar to nowak et al 2013a 2014 who investigated air pollution removal effects of urban trees we first estimate air temperature changes due to changes in tree cover and then link these temperature changes to changes in premature mortality by applying estimated extreme temperature mortality relationships from the epidemiological literature to the best of our knowledge this direct link to temperature changes has not been explicitly modeled and incorporated in a tool before inclusion of this linkage can facilitate development of efficient adaptation strategies under different climate scenarios and enhanced tree cover in targeted areas to reduce human mortality this work adds to an existing suite of urban forest modeling tools developed by the u s department of agriculture usda forest service and its partners in the i tree consortium 1 1 www itreetools org i tree provides a framework for assessing various ecosystem services and associated benefits due to changes in tree cover such as effects on building energy use stormwater runoff volume and pollution reduction carbon sequestration and improvements in public health due to air pollution reduction nowak et al 2008 2013b 2014 2017 in this study we expand the suite of i tree benefits to include air temperature and human health impacts of trees during warm seasons and we also demonstrate how our approach can be implemented by others through use of an illustrative case study for the city of baltimore maryland 2 methods i tree generally uses a four step process to assess and value benefits from trees quantifying forest structure modeling the functions of that forest structure estimating the impacts that humans experience from those forest functions and applying economic valuation to those impacts in our study while keeping the same broad approach we tailor these steps for assessing the heat related mortality impacts and associated economic values due to tree cover change our first step is to quantify relevant structural features which include the amount of tree canopy cover and impervious cover present and baseline reference meteorological observations in the second step we estimate the impact of current and alternative tree cover scenarios on air temperature using the i tree cool air model yang et al 2013 the third step applies relationships between extreme temperature and mortality from the epidemiological literature to the population that is exposed to air temperature changes the last step involves conducting benefits transfers to value changes in premature mortality using evidence from economic valuation literature the methodology for this study was designed to work in cities across the united states and is demonstrated using the study area of baltimore md the city of baltimore consists of 653 census block groups and these polygon areas were used as the spatial unit for implementing each of the four steps u s census bureau 2010 census block groups were chosen to balance computational time and spatial resolution change in mortality results were aggregated up to the entire city area rounding to whole numbers as a last step in reporting 2 1 quantify urban tree and impervious cover existing tree cover and impervious cover percentages for each census block group were derived from 2011 national land cover database nlcd 30 m resolution tree cover and impervious cover maps mrlc 2015 finer resolution land cover data was available in baltimore but the dataset used was selected because its coverage extends throughout the united states and our goal is to develop a method that can be applied to other cities across the country zonal statistics in arcmap was applied to the 30 m resolution nlcd data to assign mean percent tree cover and impervious cover to each census block group polygon area and this defined the baseline conditions other land cover types including surface water may be present but only tree cover and impervious cover were simulated to isolate the effects of those land cover types for land management decision support the most important land cover types driving air temperature are impervious and tree canopy in a detailed field study of the urban heat island in madison wi the land cover types of impervious and tree canopy had the greatest effect on air temperature with no observed effects of elevation and the effect of three large adjacent water bodies limited to an average of 0 25 c along the shoreline ziter et al 2019 where tree cover percent and impervious cover percent summed to less than 100 remaining land cover was assumed to be bare soil as inputs for temperature modeling 2 2 this simplifies comparisons between land cover scenarios by avoiding evapotranspiration energy fluxes from short vegetation with impervious cover held constant in each census block group the effects of three alternative tree cover change scenarios on air temperature were assessed 1 increasing the existing tree cover by 10 of each census block group s area 2 removing 10 of each census block group s area from existing tree cover and 3 removing all existing tree cover in each census block group the alternative of increasing tree cover by 10 is intended to demonstrate a simple scenario that is broadly applicable and in line with goals historically adopted by cities for example baltimore s goal is to establish 40 tree cover by 2030 other assessments of increasing tree cover also use similar scenarios philadelphia has a goal of at least 30 tree cover in each of the city s neighborhoods and impacts of this goal were assessed by kondo et al 2020 for approaches on more nuanced development of canopy goals see leff 2016 the 0 tree cover alternative is commonly used by i tree to assess impact and costs avoided due to current tree cover the baseline tree and impervious cover and alternative tree and impervious cover scenarios served as the inputs to modeling temperature changes as described in section 2 2 2 2 modeling temperature changes due to tree cover air temperature and humidity for baseline and alternative scenarios were estimated using the i tree cool air model based on methods detailed by yang et al 2013 and an interpolation routine the cool air model estimates this weather at approximately 2 m elevation within the urban canopy layer using observed meteorological data land cover and topography data and hydrology and energy budget parameters 3 3 see table of temperature calculation parameters for i tree cool air in supplementary material the model assumes that all simulated locations within the city area have the same overlying mesoscale climate and uses the weather station record from one location to estimate the properties of temperature and humidity for all other locations the approach involves solving 10 coupled energy and water balance equations and is designed to consider effects of land cover albedo roughness height topographic slope and aspect and water storage in soil surface depressions and the tree canopy to clarify the impact of tree cover on temperature for this study simulations were simplified so that all census block groups used the same reference weather station neglected topographic slope effects on solar exposure and used the same set of parameters related to water and energy budget equations weather data from the baltimore washington international airport wban 93 721 station were obtained from the national centers for environmental information s ncei integrated surface database and preprocessed by a utility for i tree eco weather preprocessing hirabayashi and endreny 2016 weather inputs for the i tree cool air model include hourly air temperature dew point temperature wind speed precipitation observed and net radiation and direct and diffuse solar radiation estimated at the reference weather station for this case study 3 years of meteorology inputs were used to assess model sensitivity to weather year for the decade of 2007 2017 the typical maximum and minimum yearly average air temperatures nationwide were identified 4 4 nationwide temperatures were used for consistency when expanding this modeling framework to cities of various climates in a future study 2011 represents the typical annual average nationwide for that period 2012 represents the hottest annual average and 2008 represents the coolest annual average the i tree cool air model simulated hourly air temperature for the warm season months of april and october for what are identified as four edge cases of tree cover and impervious cover 0 tree cover and 0 impervious cover 100 tree cover and 0 impervious cover 0 tree cover and 100 impervious cover and 100 tree cover and 100 impervious cover percent impervious and tree cover in each census block group are not mutually exclusive in the nlcd dataset used as an input in this study it is possible that impervious cover and tree cover can sum to values greater than 100 since tree canopy cover can overlap impervious cover the impervious cover under tree canopy is not explicitly represented in the energy balance simulation because i tree cool air represents only one layer in the energy balance yang et al 2013 therefore the edge case of 100 tree cover and 100 impervious cover yields the same results and effectively we simulate three edge cases the reference weather defines the mesoscale climate that drives the energy budget of the three edge cases those edge case results were used to linearly interpolate hourly results for all 1 increments of impervious cover and tree cover from 0 to 100 the purpose of estimating results for a full range of tree cover and impervious cover combinations was to enable users to assess a range of land cover change scenarios when this model is incorporated into i tree tools interpolation was used to simplify smooth and improve efficiency of temperature results for the 10 201 land cover scenarios assessed 101 101 combinations of tree cover and impervious cover incremented from 0 to 100 at 1 intervals a lookup table was used to link the estimated air temperature and humidity data for the combinations of tree and impervious cover under baseline and alternative scenarios identified for each census block group using zonal means of the nlcd data the temperature and humidity records were used as inputs for the analysis of premature mortality as described in section 2 3 2 3 estimating the changes in premature mortality our approach for modeling the connection between human health extreme temperature and tree cover is similar to the connection developed between human health air pollution and tree cover in which epidemiological studies use either air pollution or extreme temperature as inputs and not the tree cover nowak et al 2013a 2014 we selected a set of studies from the epidemiological literature that estimated the relationship between extreme heat exposure and mortality ensuring they were applicable to the study area table 1 basu et al 2005 included data from 20 metropolitan areas across the country and covers a range of temperature conditions this study provides estimated coefficients for different regions and the coefficient for the northeast was applied to baltimore medina ramon et al 2006 and medina ramon and schwartz 2007 include data from baltimore in their analysis and provide nationwide estimates which we apply city specific studies although ideal are unavailable for all cities in the country since our goal is to provide a method that can be applied to different locations we apply these three studies as a starting point these relationships were then applied to the relevant population in each census block group a wide variety of definitions and measures including ambient temperature heat index a combination of temperature and dew point and heat waves exceeding predefined thresholds over a number of days represent extreme heat in the epidemiological literature different metrics such as average minimum or maximum daily temperatures nighttime temperatures or daytime temperatures have been used to define extremes predefined thresholds vary from specific temperatures such as 35 c to historical local averages or percentiles studies have shown that people can adapt at least partly to the temperature they are used to due to infrastructure and physiological acclimatization and that the health impact of temperature can vary with location medina ramon et al 2006 sarofim et al 2016 in other words a 35 c air temperature will impact people in phoenix arizona differently than people from boston massachusetts what is extreme is relative to the typical local conditions however there is also evidence suggesting that there are heat tolerance limits sherwood and huber 2010 this lack of a standard definition is well documented in the research on climate impacts on human health smith et al 2013 sarofim et al 2016 the epidemiological studies selected for this study table 1 represent a range of extreme heat metrics the heat metrics were calculated as per the definitions in the epidemiological studies basu et al 2005 use daily mean temperature as the heat metric medina ramon et al 2006 employ a city specific binary variable to determine whether it is an extremely hot day in this study extremely hot days are defined as those with daily minimum temperature at or greater than the 99th percentile for baltimore 5 5 since the estimated Œ≤ coefficients of the study represented deviations from the 99th percentile for 1989 2000 we used hourly measurements at the reference weather station wban 93721 for the same time period and our computed value for the 99th percentile of daily minimum temperature was 24 c the minimum temperature is used as an indication of nighttime relief from heat medina ramon and schwartz 2007 used the same heat metric as medina ramon et al 2006 but also used a piecewise linear metric where there are no impacts if the daily minimum temperature is 17 c or less and impacts are linear above that temperature as shown in table 1 the three studies encompass different months the data for these heat metric calculations were obtained from the baseline and alternative scenarios hourly temperature estimates from i tree cool air as described in section 2 2 changes in each heat metric heat were obtained by taking the difference in the heat metric under the alternative scenario and the baseline tree cover impervious cover conditions 6 6 for the heat metric corresponding to medina ramon et al 2006 that was based on the 99th percentile threshold binary indicator variables were used to calculate whether the threshold was exceeded under the baseline and alternative scenarios as follows 1 Œ¥ heat hea t alt hea t base mathematically estimating the changes in mortality y due to change in each heat metric entails applying a health impact function voorhees et al 2011 that transforms a change in heat exposure to a change in mortality as follows 2 Œ¥ y y 0 e Œ≤ Œ¥ heat 1 p where y0 is the baseline health incidence rate for mortality for each age group heat is the change in the heat metric p is the exposed population for each age group and Œ≤ represents the relationship between the change in the heat metric and mortality for the relevant age group and was derived from the heat exposure mortality response relationships in the selected epidemiological studies information on the functional form of the exposure response relationships in each study was used to mathematically derive Œ≤ and the associated confidence interval studies use various functional forms and covariates including air pollution that may be correlated with heat exposures as we are focusing on warm seasons ozone levels are likely to be high and there is emerging evidence of interactions between air pollution and temperature which impact human physiological response to each of those stressors analitis et al 2014 fann et al 2016 jhun et al 2014 madrigano et al 2015 medina ramon and schwartz 2007 not controlling for ozone which is correlated with temperature would result in biased estimates for the Œ≤ coefficient on the heat metric medina ramon and schwartz 2007 find that controlling for ozone reduces the Œ≤ coefficient on the heat metric applying coefficients without ozone controls would therefore result in overestimates of mortality reduction county level baseline incidence rates for cause specific mortality were obtained for each age group from benmap ce cdc 2015 sacks et al 2018 mortality classifications in the incidence data and epidemiological studies did not match exactly so we made the closest match possible as shown in the two columns for mortality classification one for the epidemiological study and the other for incidence data in table 1 population for 5 year age groups at the census block group level was obtained from the 2010 decennial census manson et al 2020 representing different age groups accurately is crucial because baseline incidence rates for cause specific mortality vary across age groups and exposure response functions are age specific since the younger age groups in data sources for baseline incidence rates and for population were not completely aligned an adjustment was performed more specifically benmap ce has baseline incidence rates for ages 0 and 1 to 17 while the decennial census has population for ages under 5 5 to 9 10 to 14 and 15 to 17 years assuming that the population under 5 is uniformly distributed across the ages 0 to 4 1 5 of the population under 5 years was used for the population for age 0 similarly 4 5 of the population under 5 years was used for the population for ages 1 4 which was summed with populations for 5 to 9 10 to 14 and 15 to 17 years to obtain the population for ages 1 to 17 above 18 years the age groups in the two data sources were matched and thus no adjustment was performed when applying each epidemiological study to calculate the mortality impacts we use the relevant months population age groups heat metrics and Œ≤ to obtain the total changes in mortality we added the mortality impacts across all age groups relevant for the study we also estimated lower and upper bounds for health impacts yub ylb using the confidence interval Œ≤ub Œ≤lb to represent the uncertainty in Œ≤ estimates results for each specification of the model run heat metric health endpoint Œ≤ population are presented separately since the model runs represent different heat metrics health endpoints and population groups it is not appropriate to average or aggregate results further retaining the full range of the results for different model runs allows us to compare results across the model specifications and provides options for considering research questions that are interesting to the reader 2 4 estimating the monetary value of human health benefits the monetary benefit of the change in mortality b was estimated using the above computed change in mortality y along with the value of a statistical life v and calculated as 3 b Œ¥ y v the value of a statistical life is defined in the economics literature as the willingness to pay for a small reduction in risk of death in the population for a group of people the estimate that is typically used in benefits analysis conducted by the u s epa 2018 was applied in this study 7 4 million in 2006 dollars we adjusted this value to 2011 dollars using the consumer price index inflation calculator from the u s bureau of labor statistics 2020 and obtained a value of 8 22 million as per the guidance of u s epa this same value is applied to the whole population regardless of age income or other population characteristics 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantify urban tree and impervious cover the amount of tree cover and impervious cover under baseline conditions in each of baltimore city s 653 census block groups in 2011 is shown in figs 1 a and 1b respectively tree cover estimates are conservative as nlcd is known to underestimate tree cover nowak and greenfield 2010 we expect that the nlcd underestimation of tree cover does not affect the impacts of adding tree cover because tree cover effects are linearly interpolated as described in section 2 2 the 0 tree cover scenario is affected by the nlcd underestimation of tree cover where the estimated impacts and economic values for the 0 tree cover scenario represent change from an underestimated baseline tree cover and therefore are a lower boundary of results tree cover in downtown baltimore was low 20 and higher in the city s outskirts 20 the most forested census block group had 73 tree cover and the least forested had 0 tree cover there were 93 census block groups with less than 10 tree cover and 81 of those had 0 tree cover conversely impervious cover in downtown baltimore tended to be high 60 while it was lower in the city s outskirts 40 the most impervious census block groups had 100 impervious cover and the least impervious had 10 impervious cover there were 55 census block groups with impervious cover of 90 or more and 3 of those had 100 impervious cover the effect on tree cover of removing or adding 10 tree cover in each of baltimore city s census block groups is shown in appendix figs a1 a and a1 b 7 7 when removing 10 tree cover the extent of tree cover for the 93 census block groups that had less than 10 tree cover was set at or left at 0 and thus not reduced by a full 10 this asymmetry is indicative of a limitation in simple alternative scenarios being broadly applied to all census block groups for example assessing the removal of 10 tree cover is irrelevant in the 81 out of 653 census block groups that have a baseline of 0 tree cover this asymmetry does not prevent the identification of overall trends in impact for this case study as described in section 2 1 surface water cover was not accounted for in this model and of the 653 census block groups in baltimore only 29 4 included water bodies 3 2 modeling temperature changes due to tree cover baseline average air temperatures from april to october for baltimore city s census block groups range from 19 2 c to 21 2 c with highest impervious cover and lowest tree cover being the hottest fig 2 8 temperatures are based on mesoscale climate calculated from a reference weather station baltimore washington international thurgood marshall airport located outside of the study area as described in section 2 2 a time series of baseline minimum average and maximum air temperature among all census block groups for the same period shows the months of may june and july have some of the hottest weather with maximum temperatures reaching 40 c fig 3 although the average temperature shown by the red line in fig 3 reaches its highest value near 35 c on july 22 approximately midway through the warm season there is considerable variation across the period and within each month the difference between the baseline minimum and maximum temperatures ranges from 1 2 c on september 6 to 22 7 c on april 4 analysis of the simulated years of 2008 2011 and 2012 showed common patterns in temperature changes between the baseline tree cover and the alternative scenarios and 2011 was selected as a representative case although we conduct our analysis for all three alternative scenarios we primarily focus on the alternative of increasing tree cover by 10 for the purposes below 9 9 the asymmetry of alternative scenario changes to tree cover has only a small effect on temperature impacts for all years and alternative scenarios when adding or removing 10 of tree cover from each census block group s area the interquartile range of impact on air temperature is equivalent with one significant figure of precision the 25th and 75th percentile impact for both alternative scenarios ranges from a 0 4 c to a 0 5 c change in mean temperature across all census block groups for the hottest day july 22 2011 as summarized in table 2 the heat metrics derived from the i tree cool air model results vary across the selected epidemiological studies and are based on either average or minimum temperatures maps of the reductions in average and minimum air temperatures with 10 increases in tree cover are shown for the hottest day of the season july 22 2011 fig 4 a and 4b while the spatial distribution of the reductions is similar for both the average and the minimum the reductions in average temperature range from 0 33 c to 0 57 c while the reductions in minimum temperature range from 0 09 c to 0 33 c this indicates that if other parameters including Œ≤ in eq 2 are held constant the health impacts would be lower for a heat metric that uses the minimum temperature the same pattern holds for reductions in the daily average and daily minimum air temperatures averaged across all the months between april and october figs 4c and 4d the greater magnitude reduction in average temperatures compared with minimum temperatures fits trends in the i tree cool air model where maximum temperatures and thus averages are more sensitive to changes in tree cover than are minimum temperatures all four maps show temperature change to be higher downtown which has a higher impervious cover and lower tree cover indicating the higher impact of increased tree cover in areas where the baseline tree cover is low and impervious cover is high to better understand how changes in premature mortality vary across the warm season months the monthly reductions in average and minimum air temperatures caused by increased tree cover are presented in figs 5 a and 5b overall a u shaped trend is seen where the temperature reduction is smallest in april and october and the greatest reduction in temperature is in july for both average and minimum these monthly average temperature reductions smooth out the much larger hourly and daily temperature reductions caused by increasing tree cover across all days and census block groups in the warm season the maximum reduction in average minimum temperature is 0 63 c 0 56 c and the minimum reduction in average minimum temperature is 0 01 c 0 06 c there is high variance across the census block groups with july having the greatest variance for both average and minimum air temperatures 3 3 estimating the changes in premature mortality 3 3 1 changes in heat metrics the heat metric of basu et al 2005 focuses on june july and august the summer season s three hottest months the heat metric in this study is the daily average temperature and as seen in fig 3 this metric averaged across all census block groups ranges from 20 c to 35 c during these three months in our study year of 2011 under the alternative scenario of increased tree cover the maximum and minimum reductions in the monthly mean of the average temperature for the three summer months of june july and august are 0 40 c and 0 19 c respectively fig 5 as with basu et al 2005 the heat metric of medina ramon and schwartz 2007 is also linear but is based on daily minimum temperature and assumes no heat exposure unless the minimum temperature exceeds 17 c the minimum temperature averaged across all census block groups ranged from 5 4 c to 27 4 c between may and september the maximum and minimum reductions in the monthly mean of the minimum temperature for the five months are 0 17 c and 0 04 c respectively as shown in fig 5 comparing the metrics from the two studies we see that as summarized in section 3 2 the reduction in minimum temperatures is less than that of average temperatures in addition the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 study assumes a truncated heat metric where any health impacts below a minimum temperature of the 17 c threshold are zero 10 10 figure a 2 in the appendix shows that the drop in heat metric values averaged across census block groups representing the piecewise linear metric from medina ramon and schwartz 2007 is always less than the basu et al 2005 metric since the line showing the latter is always below the former for medina ramon and schwartz 2007 the line coincides with the horizontal axis for some days which denotes a no changes in the heat metric in our study for about 33 of the time the minimum temperatures were below 17 c for both the baseline and alternative scenarios across the census block groups the change in heat metric in such instances is zero further about 0 4 of the time increased tree cover under the alternative scenario results in temperatures dropping from above 17 c to below 17 c in such cases the impacts on heat metrics are limited by the 17 c threshold 11 11 figure a 3 shows the number of days that minimum temperature was below 17 c under both the baseline and alternative scenarios for each census block group figure a 4 shows the number of days that minimum temperature changed from above 17 c to below 17 c under the alternative scenario of increasing tree cover by 10 of the census block group area the medina ramon et al 2006 and medina ramon and schwartz 2007 studies both use a binary heat metric to define extremely hot days for these studies reductions in heat metrics only occur if the increase in tree cover causes the minimum temperature to drop from above the historical threshold to below the threshold for this to happen two conditions must be satisfied first the minimum temperature under the baseline conditions must be above 24 c and second the increase in tree cover must cause enough of a temperature drop to change the binary heat metric from 1 to 0 extremely hot days are defined as days where minimum temperatures cross historical thresholds so a priori we expect that the number of days with temperature conditions satisfying the first condition for each census block group will be small this is evidenced in our data where there are 10 days where minimum temperature is above 24 c the number of days that the binary heat metric switched from a value of 1 to 0 varied across the study area with only 28 of census block groups experiencing a change of 1 or 2 days 151 23 had a change on 1 day 33 5 had a change on 2 days and the remainder experienced no change fig 6 3 3 2 changes in premature mortality estimated heat metric results applied using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 approach provide impacts for the broadest range of health endpoints all cause mortality and all age groups further this study also estimates exposure response relationships controlling for ozone applying the Œ≤ coefficient on the piecewise linear heat metric in medina ramon and schwartz 2007 we find that the estimated number of deaths avoided when tree cover is increased by 10 of census block group area is 247 with a 95 confidence interval of 141 to 353 table 2 12 12 table a 1 in the appendix also provides mortality impacts associated with the other 2 alternative scenarios these impacts are 17 lower than when applying Œ≤ coefficients without controlling for ozone to the same piecewise linear metric which yields 298 avoided deaths to incorporate another type of heat metric typically used in the public health literature we apply the binary metric from medina ramon and schwartz 2007 to assess the health impacts of the alternative scenario of increasing tree cover the Œ≤ coefficient for this binary metric is roughly 10 times higher than that of the piecewise linear metric from the same study indicating a much stronger mortality response to an extremely hot day as compared to less extreme temperatures however the number of extremely hot days are limited in 2011 this was 10 hence whether smaller or larger health impacts in total are expected with binary metrics versus piecewise linear metrics is an empirical question and will depend on the number of days that the binary heat metric changes from 1 to 0 applying the Œ≤ coefficient on the binary heat metric that also controls for ozone the mortality reduction is 83 with a confidence interval of 47 to 118 13 13 as shown in table 2 estimates with ozone controls for the binary metric are lower than with no controls by about 14 although this is a much smaller impact compared to the estimated avoided deaths from applying the piecewise linear metric this result is not surprising given the small number of days that the binary heat metric changes from 1 to 0 in 2011 as illustrated in fig 6 and described in detail in section 3 3 1 if the study year included a higher number of extreme heat days e g in a heat wave year the estimates would be much higher the public health literature shows that the population over 65 is more sensitive to extreme heat so we also show results for the basu et al 2005 approach which represents cardiorespiratory mortality for adults in this age group basu et al 2005 and medina ramon and schwartz 2007 differ in terms of the age groups months covered data and methods heat metrics and mortality causes thus making a direct comparison of results challenging the most meaningful comparison between the two is to consider the Œ≤ coefficient on the piecewise linear metric of medina ramon and schwartz 2007 that does not control for ozone with the linear metric of basu et al 2005 given the lower baseline incidence rates for cardiorespiratory mortality 14 14 mortality rates from all causes includes cardiorespiratory causes as well as other causes hence cardiorespiratory incidence rates are smaller and the reduced population represented by the elderly along with fewer months assessed smaller impacts were expected using basu et al 2005 however the larger Œ≤ coefficient in basu et al 2005 would be expected to result in greater impacts potentially due to a greater response for the hottest months and or vulnerability to the heat exposures for the population over 65 further as described in section 3 3 1 because the change in heat metrics is larger for basu et al 2005 reductions in mortality would also be expected to be lower using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 study which study yields a higher net impact is therefore an empirical question when applying the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 Œ≤ coefficient for all ages to only the adults over 65 the avoided mortality is 172 95 confidence interval is between 105 and 240 while the avoided mortality for basu et al 2005 is 423 95 confidence interval is between 213 and 632 the mean estimates for medina ramon and schwartz 2007 are lower despite being applied to a higher baseline incidence for all cause mortality and to a larger number of months this lower estimate is potentially due to a combination of the smaller reduction in heat metrics as described in section 3 3 1 and smaller Œ≤ coefficient of medina ramon and schwartz 2007 even if the same heat metrics were used the fact that the Œ≤ coefficient for medina ramon and schwartz 2007 is roughly half of basu et al 2005 highlights the importance of distinguishing vulnerable age groups and applying the age specific coefficients relevant for vulnerable age groups in addition to the mortality impacts another question that is extremely relevant for decision makers is the spatial distribution of the impacts the mortality impacts estimated with basu et al 2005 tend to be lowest near baltimore downtown and higher in the outskirts fig 7 a this result is not in line with the temperature reductions which occur more in the downtown area fig 4 however as fig 8 a shows the population over 65 is more concentrated in the outskirts and the spatial distribution of impacts lines up closely with that of the population the magnitude of the pearson s correlation coefficient is 0 94 as shown in fig 7b the distribution of mortality impacts using medina ramon and schwartz 2007 but applied to the population over 65 shows a similar pattern the magnitude of the pearson s correlation coefficient is 0 93 15 15 we expect the correlation between population and mortality impacts for medina ramon and schwartz 2007 to be different from basu et al 2005 this is because the spatial distribution of impacts although similar is not identical the different heat metrics used in the two studies combined with different Œ≤ coefficients account for the difference in the spatial distribution of impacts further applying the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 approach to all age groups we see that the mortality impacts fig 7c and total population fig 8b have similar spatial distribution patterns the magnitude of the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 58 with more impacts downtown than for the population over 65 years in age in comparison heat metric changes showed very low correlation with the mortality impacts estimated for the total population using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 approach the magnitude of the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 001 a key implication of these results is that in baltimore the largest impacts of increased tree cover are seen where the exposed population resides not necessarily where the temperature changes are the greatest if a policy goal is to reduce temperature risks to vulnerable populations it is important to increase tree cover in areas where susceptible populations reside not necessarily where there is low tree cover or where temperature reductions can be the greatest given the difference in estimates among the various studies and metrics the question is which metric is appropriate for decision makers the answer depends on the audience and context of the analysis as the piecewise linear metrics used by medina ramon and schwartz 2007 represent the entire population and all mortality causes it would provide average city wide estimates these estimates would be appropriate for decision makers such as city planners in typical years i e without heat waves the binary metric in this study assumes that there is no mortality impact of warmer temperatures unless they are extreme given that the piecewise linear metrics provide significant results for less extreme temperatures the use of binary metrics is more restrictive however in the context of climate change where the number of extremely hot days is projected to increase significantly assessments using the binary heat metric can potentially inform preparedness efforts e g cooling centers and response plans for heat waves and thus provide useful information to the public health community the results may be closer using these two types of metrics for heat wave years if minimum temperatures stay the same on average but there are more days with extreme heat if the focus is on the population over 65 the linear basu et al 2005 metric would yield estimates that can be considered as upper bounds for cardiorespiratory mortality specific to this age group and policies based on these estimates would be most protective of that group more detailed information about impacts on specific causes of mortality such as pneumonia stroke and cardiovascular diseases might be useful for the public health community as well we applied the same binary heat metric from medina ramon et al 2006 to calculate reductions in pneumonia stroke and cardiovascular disease related mortality which were 1 18 and 7 deaths respectively under the scenario of increasing trees 16 16 these estimates are not additive with the overall estimates from the other two studies rather they provide impacts on more detailed causes of mortality though this case study focuses primarily on impacts for the scenario of increasing tree cover by 10 two other scenarios were assessed described in section 2 1 for city wide mortality using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 study while the scenario of increasing tree cover by 10 of each census block group s area was estimated to result in 251 deaths avoided reducing tree cover by 10 of each census block group s area was estimated to result in 220 more deaths the asymmetry of health impacts when increasing and reducing tree cover by the same amount is expected because the health impact function is non linear and because of the asymmetry in structure and temperature impacts of these alternative scenarios as described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 17 17 each source of asymmetry acts in a different direction heat used as an exponential in the health impact function means reducing tree cover resulting in positive heat is expected to have a larger health impact but asymmetry when removing tree cover due to 14 2 of census block groups having 10 baseline tree cover reduces the city wide impact of the reduced tree cover scenario removing all tree cover from each census block group was estimated to result in 551 more deaths this 0 tree cover scenario indicated that baltimore s baseline tree cover in 2011 avoids 551 deaths from mortality city wide per year 3 4 estimating the monetary value of human health benefits the mean estimate for monetary values of reductions in mortality shown in table 2 using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 piecewise linear approach when controlling for ozone and applied to all age groups is 2 06 billion with a 95 confidence interval of 1 18 billion to 2 95 billion applying the binary heat metric from the same study the estimate is 692 63 million with a 95 confidence interval of 393 million to 986 04 million the monetary value of the reduced mortality for the population over 65 using the basu et al 2005 approach is 3 47 billion 95 confidence interval between 1 75 billion and 5 19 billion and using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 piecewise linear approach is 1 42 billion 95 confidence interval between 0 86 billion and 1 98 billion estimates from the basu et al 2005 study may be considered as upper bounds for cardiorespiratory mortality table a 1 in the appendix also provides monetary values associated with the other two alternative scenarios for basu et al 2005 and medina ramon and schwartz 2007 table a 2 shows the health and monetary impacts using the basu et al 2005 approach for all three years and fig a 5 shows the spatial distribution for mortality reductions in 2008 and 2012 to place these results in context with other impacts of ecosystem services provided by urban tree cover the monetary benefits of baltimore s current tree cover from reducing heat are more than 100 times larger than from reducing pm2 5 concentrations on average nowak et al 2013a the study of pm2 5 reduction is comparable in that both studies represented all causes of mortality associated with an environmental factor pm2 5 or heat metrics assessed a 0 tree cover alternative to estimate the impact of current tree cover and used the value of statistical life to estimate monetary benefits the studies differ in that nowak et al 2013a used different age group delineations 0 1 and 25 99 analysis year 2010 instead of 2011 dollar year 2015 instead of 2011 scale of result by city instead of by census block group and source of tree cover data 2005 field samples instead of 2011 nlcd although pm2 5 levels vary across cities and therefore the benefits of pollutant removal also vary baseline levels of pollution in the united states are in the range of the national ambient air quality standards and thus the marginal benefits of reducing pm2 5 are relatively small as compared to heat related mortality which is a leading cause of death from natural weather or environmental events in the united states apha 2018 increasing tree cover can therefore play a critical role in reducing heat related mortality impacts under current conditions and an even bigger role under future climate scenarios 4 conclusion and future research the goal of this study was to introduce and demonstrate a method for quantifying and valuing changes in mortality from extreme heat due to the presence of tree cover this method provides the foundation for the spatially explicit decision support tool i tree to incorporate heat related mortality this method will be implemented in the i tree model to allow users to assess mortality impacts of changes in tree cover across the warm season and provide valuable information to city planners and the public health community future work will explore the potential for i tree to include a range of health impact functions e g different heat metrics coefficients that are specific to vulnerable populations that will allow users to assess a wide set of research questions such as the role trees can play in reducing mortality impacts under different climate and population scenarios to further facilitate environmental policymaking we apply the national ecosystem services classification system nescs plus classification system newcomer johnson et al 2020 to the ecosystem service we quantify and value in this study mortality impacts of temperature reductions due to increased tree cover can be assigned a nescs plus code of 27 1 1092 211 environment class urban suburban 27 ecological end product atmosphere 1 direct use support of human health and life 1092 direct user households 211 using a common classification code can support policymaking by helping organize measures of ecosystem service benefits and providing a common language across disciplines results indicate that approximately 251 deaths 95 confidence interval of 143 to 358 can be avoided in the city of baltimore total population of 620 961 with a 10 increase in tree cover we also find that more than half of the reduced mortality impacts are for the population over the age of 65 which is about 12 of the total population who are known to be vulnerable to extreme heat controlling for ozone is important to account for interaction effects with temperature and we find that impacts on premature mortality are lower but remain in a similar range even under the most conservative approach with only extreme temperatures above 24 c assumed to have a mortality impact and therefore impacts in 2011 which is not a heat wave year are limited to a few days and census block groups 84 95 confidence interval of 48 to 120 deaths are avoided annually in baltimore alone the economic value of these avoided deaths is large ranging from 690 million to 2 1 billion when we consider ozone effects there is potential for even larger benefits given that tree cover can be increased by much more in some areas spatial distribution of impacts shows that the greatest reductions in mortality occurred in the outskirts of baltimore where a greater number of people who are over 65 years in age reside rather than downtown where the temperature reductions are greatest these spatial patterns have important policy implications for example our analysis highlights the importance of identifying areas with plantable space and vulnerable populations to maximize human health benefits from urban forests in each city further assessing spatially explicit impacts of alternative tree cover scenarios can help develop more targeted and efficient policies to promote environmental justice and equity our estimated results are broadly consistent with other studies that quantify mortality impacts of increased tree cover using different methods for example kondo et al 2020 project reducing premature deaths by about 400 95 confidence interval of 298 to 618 by increasing philadelphia s tree cover to 30 given that the spatial and temporal aspects as well as the study data and methods including the extent of tree cover change assessed are different between the two studies a direct comparison is difficult however the results appear to be in a similar range while this study is a first step to modeling temperature impacts of trees on human health there are several ways in which a more comprehensive assessment can be made in subsequent analysis on the temperature modeling side i tree cool air could be modified to simulate anthropogenic contributions to the urban heat island this would include heat released from human activities such as from combustion of fuels friction from machines and human metabolism the signature of anthropogenic heating is often clearest in nighttime temperatures where it can add 2 c to 3 c and during peak activity it can contribute on the order of 100 w m2 to net heat inputs sailor 2011 although the monetary value of avoided mortality impacts from increasing tree cover is large mortality is not the only impact of temperature on human well being further research should investigate temperature impacts on other health conditions such as heat stroke heat exhaustion heat cramps as well as respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses low birth weight and mental distress research could also investigate how these changes in air temperature affect human comfort e g sinha et al 2018 estimating the impacts of tree cover for different u s cities will also expand our knowledge on the variation of potential impacts of urban trees on air temperature and human health exploring whether the binary metrics and the piecewise linear metrics yield results that are more similar in analysis conducted for a heat wave year would be interesting further we find that more than half the impacts are for a vulnerable age group population over 65 for a more comprehensive assessment future models will need to incorporate other demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with health impacts from extreme heat usgcrp 2016 our findings for baltimore suggest that temperature reductions can potentially contribute to human health and well being significantly in the light of the large number approximately 12 000 of heat related deaths in the united states each year and the projected increases in such deaths due to changing climates increasing tree cover can therefore play an important role in adaptation strategies for cities to mitigate the effects of rising temperatures and reduce urban heat island effects the method demonstrated here can be applied to inform the development of climate adaptation strategies in an optimal manner for example estimates of monetary benefits provide a common metric that can be compared with the costs of implementing the policies further such holistic assessments of benefits provide evidence based support for policies which can provide significant public health and economic benefits to cities examining spatial variations of impacts among different socioeconomic and demographic groups could also

24630,urban tree cover contributes to human well being through a variety of ecosystem services in this study we focus on the role that trees can play in reducing temperature during warm seasons and associated impacts on human health and well being we introduce a method for quantifying and valuing changes in premature mortality from extreme heat due to the changes in urban tree cover and apply this method to baltimore city maryland the model i tree cool air uses a water and energy balance to estimate hourly changes in air temperature due to alternative scenarios of tree cover applied across 653 census block groups the changes in temperature are applied to existing temperature mortality models to estimate changes in health outcomes and associated values existing tree cover in baltimore is estimated to reduce annual mortality by 543 deaths as compared to a 0 tree cover scenario increasing the area of current tree cover by 10 of each census block group reduced baseline annual mortality by 83 to 247 deaths valued at 0 68 2 0 billion applying value of statistical life estimates over half of the reduced mortality is from the over 65 year age group who are among the most vulnerable to extreme heat reductions in air temperature due to increased tree cover were greatest in downtown baltimore where tree cover is relatively low and impervious cover is relatively high however the greatest reductions in mortality occurred in the outskirts of baltimore where a greater number of people who are over 65 years in age reside quantifying and valuing the health benefits of changes in air temperatures due to increased tree cover can inform climate adaptation and mitigation plans by decision makers developing adaptation strategies to effectively address these issues will become increasingly important in the future under changing climates and an aging population keywords ecosystem services heat related mortality vulnerability health impacts economic valuation human well being urban heat island modeling temperature changes i tree 1 introduction urban tree cover provides a myriad of ecosystem services and contributes to human health and well being at local regional national and global scales tree cover benefits include air and water filtration temperature climate and water regulation noise reduction increased biodiversity and pollination and esthetic improvements bolund and hunhammar 1999 g√≥mez baggethun and barton 2013 nowak and dwyer 2007 through quantification and valuing of these services tree cover effects can be incorporated within city actions to improve public health haase et al 2014 estimates of monetary benefits provide a common metric that can be compared with costs of implementing the policies and support the development and prioritization of optimal policies thus efforts to expand and improve the quantification and valuation of urban tree services are critical for improved decision making in urban environments and thereby advance the united nation s sustainable development goals u n general assembly 2015 air temperature reductions caused by the presence of trees are getting increasing attention due to changing climates npr 2019 although based on different data and methods and thus not directly comparable existing studies provide insights on the issue of heat related mortality in the united states an average of 702 heat related deaths occurred annually between 2004 and 2018 vaidyanathan et al 2020 however this estimate uses data from medical records which often do not capture the role of heat in exacerbating other causes of death not explicitly categorized as heat related usgcrp 2016 a study using statistical approaches estimated more than 1 300 deaths per summer during the 1975 2004 period kalkstein et al 2011 more recent studies provide evidence of even higher estimates for example weinberger et al 2020 estimate over 5 000 annual deaths between 1997 and 2006 in 297 counties representing 61 9 of the total population in the country and shindell et al 2020 estimate about 12 000 premature deaths annually due to heat related deaths over the last decade during a heat wave year the total number of deaths is estimated to be substantially larger for example a heat wave in chicago in july 1995 resulted in approximately 700 deaths kaiser et al 2007 and one in europe led to more than 70 000 deaths in summer 2003 robine et al 2008 the number of premature heat related deaths in the summer is projected to increase by the thousands under climate change scenarios in the united states and similar trends would be seen in different parts of the world usgcrp 2016 gasparrini et al 2017 extreme heat can also result in morbidity impacts such as heat exhaustion and heat cramps as well as exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses guo et al 2018 people with specific demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are more sensitive to extreme heat gamble et al 2016 among them are adults above the age of 65 who are more sensitive to extreme heat due to issues related to thermoregulation preexisting diseases need to rely on others and limited mobility balbus and malina 2009 basu and samet 2002 benmarhnia et al 2015 gamble et al 2013 projected increases in heat related health impacts and differences in population vulnerability to extreme heat have important implications for public health and environmental justice developing adaptation strategies to effectively address these issues will become increasingly important in the future quantifying and valuing the health benefits of changes in air temperatures due to increased tree cover can inform climate adaptation and mitigation plans made by decision makers evidence from the literature suggests that increasing tree cover in cities can reduce air temperatures and urban heat island effects e g akbari et al 2001 yet these findings are often limited to a few small empirical studies bowler et al 2010 heavily forested parks in baltimore have been shown to have up to 7 1 c cooler air temperatures in the evening and about 2 7 c cooler temperatures in the daytime relative to the inner city nowak and heisler 2010 cooler air temperatures have direct and indirect benefits for human health kovats and hajat 2008 even small differences in seasonal average temperatures can affect human mortality and public health usgcrp 2016 in new york city deaths during heat waves were less likely among residents living in areas with more green space madrigano et al 2015 the goal of this study was to introduce and demonstrate a method and tool for quantifying and valuing changes in mortality from extreme heat due to the presence of tree cover existing studies that quantify temperature mortality impacts of increased tree cover primarily use a greenspace exposure mortality dose response approach e g kondo et al 2020 without directly modeling temperature changes in our study we employ an approach similar to nowak et al 2013a 2014 who investigated air pollution removal effects of urban trees we first estimate air temperature changes due to changes in tree cover and then link these temperature changes to changes in premature mortality by applying estimated extreme temperature mortality relationships from the epidemiological literature to the best of our knowledge this direct link to temperature changes has not been explicitly modeled and incorporated in a tool before inclusion of this linkage can facilitate development of efficient adaptation strategies under different climate scenarios and enhanced tree cover in targeted areas to reduce human mortality this work adds to an existing suite of urban forest modeling tools developed by the u s department of agriculture usda forest service and its partners in the i tree consortium 1 1 www itreetools org i tree provides a framework for assessing various ecosystem services and associated benefits due to changes in tree cover such as effects on building energy use stormwater runoff volume and pollution reduction carbon sequestration and improvements in public health due to air pollution reduction nowak et al 2008 2013b 2014 2017 in this study we expand the suite of i tree benefits to include air temperature and human health impacts of trees during warm seasons and we also demonstrate how our approach can be implemented by others through use of an illustrative case study for the city of baltimore maryland 2 methods i tree generally uses a four step process to assess and value benefits from trees quantifying forest structure modeling the functions of that forest structure estimating the impacts that humans experience from those forest functions and applying economic valuation to those impacts in our study while keeping the same broad approach we tailor these steps for assessing the heat related mortality impacts and associated economic values due to tree cover change our first step is to quantify relevant structural features which include the amount of tree canopy cover and impervious cover present and baseline reference meteorological observations in the second step we estimate the impact of current and alternative tree cover scenarios on air temperature using the i tree cool air model yang et al 2013 the third step applies relationships between extreme temperature and mortality from the epidemiological literature to the population that is exposed to air temperature changes the last step involves conducting benefits transfers to value changes in premature mortality using evidence from economic valuation literature the methodology for this study was designed to work in cities across the united states and is demonstrated using the study area of baltimore md the city of baltimore consists of 653 census block groups and these polygon areas were used as the spatial unit for implementing each of the four steps u s census bureau 2010 census block groups were chosen to balance computational time and spatial resolution change in mortality results were aggregated up to the entire city area rounding to whole numbers as a last step in reporting 2 1 quantify urban tree and impervious cover existing tree cover and impervious cover percentages for each census block group were derived from 2011 national land cover database nlcd 30 m resolution tree cover and impervious cover maps mrlc 2015 finer resolution land cover data was available in baltimore but the dataset used was selected because its coverage extends throughout the united states and our goal is to develop a method that can be applied to other cities across the country zonal statistics in arcmap was applied to the 30 m resolution nlcd data to assign mean percent tree cover and impervious cover to each census block group polygon area and this defined the baseline conditions other land cover types including surface water may be present but only tree cover and impervious cover were simulated to isolate the effects of those land cover types for land management decision support the most important land cover types driving air temperature are impervious and tree canopy in a detailed field study of the urban heat island in madison wi the land cover types of impervious and tree canopy had the greatest effect on air temperature with no observed effects of elevation and the effect of three large adjacent water bodies limited to an average of 0 25 c along the shoreline ziter et al 2019 where tree cover percent and impervious cover percent summed to less than 100 remaining land cover was assumed to be bare soil as inputs for temperature modeling 2 2 this simplifies comparisons between land cover scenarios by avoiding evapotranspiration energy fluxes from short vegetation with impervious cover held constant in each census block group the effects of three alternative tree cover change scenarios on air temperature were assessed 1 increasing the existing tree cover by 10 of each census block group s area 2 removing 10 of each census block group s area from existing tree cover and 3 removing all existing tree cover in each census block group the alternative of increasing tree cover by 10 is intended to demonstrate a simple scenario that is broadly applicable and in line with goals historically adopted by cities for example baltimore s goal is to establish 40 tree cover by 2030 other assessments of increasing tree cover also use similar scenarios philadelphia has a goal of at least 30 tree cover in each of the city s neighborhoods and impacts of this goal were assessed by kondo et al 2020 for approaches on more nuanced development of canopy goals see leff 2016 the 0 tree cover alternative is commonly used by i tree to assess impact and costs avoided due to current tree cover the baseline tree and impervious cover and alternative tree and impervious cover scenarios served as the inputs to modeling temperature changes as described in section 2 2 2 2 modeling temperature changes due to tree cover air temperature and humidity for baseline and alternative scenarios were estimated using the i tree cool air model based on methods detailed by yang et al 2013 and an interpolation routine the cool air model estimates this weather at approximately 2 m elevation within the urban canopy layer using observed meteorological data land cover and topography data and hydrology and energy budget parameters 3 3 see table of temperature calculation parameters for i tree cool air in supplementary material the model assumes that all simulated locations within the city area have the same overlying mesoscale climate and uses the weather station record from one location to estimate the properties of temperature and humidity for all other locations the approach involves solving 10 coupled energy and water balance equations and is designed to consider effects of land cover albedo roughness height topographic slope and aspect and water storage in soil surface depressions and the tree canopy to clarify the impact of tree cover on temperature for this study simulations were simplified so that all census block groups used the same reference weather station neglected topographic slope effects on solar exposure and used the same set of parameters related to water and energy budget equations weather data from the baltimore washington international airport wban 93 721 station were obtained from the national centers for environmental information s ncei integrated surface database and preprocessed by a utility for i tree eco weather preprocessing hirabayashi and endreny 2016 weather inputs for the i tree cool air model include hourly air temperature dew point temperature wind speed precipitation observed and net radiation and direct and diffuse solar radiation estimated at the reference weather station for this case study 3 years of meteorology inputs were used to assess model sensitivity to weather year for the decade of 2007 2017 the typical maximum and minimum yearly average air temperatures nationwide were identified 4 4 nationwide temperatures were used for consistency when expanding this modeling framework to cities of various climates in a future study 2011 represents the typical annual average nationwide for that period 2012 represents the hottest annual average and 2008 represents the coolest annual average the i tree cool air model simulated hourly air temperature for the warm season months of april and october for what are identified as four edge cases of tree cover and impervious cover 0 tree cover and 0 impervious cover 100 tree cover and 0 impervious cover 0 tree cover and 100 impervious cover and 100 tree cover and 100 impervious cover percent impervious and tree cover in each census block group are not mutually exclusive in the nlcd dataset used as an input in this study it is possible that impervious cover and tree cover can sum to values greater than 100 since tree canopy cover can overlap impervious cover the impervious cover under tree canopy is not explicitly represented in the energy balance simulation because i tree cool air represents only one layer in the energy balance yang et al 2013 therefore the edge case of 100 tree cover and 100 impervious cover yields the same results and effectively we simulate three edge cases the reference weather defines the mesoscale climate that drives the energy budget of the three edge cases those edge case results were used to linearly interpolate hourly results for all 1 increments of impervious cover and tree cover from 0 to 100 the purpose of estimating results for a full range of tree cover and impervious cover combinations was to enable users to assess a range of land cover change scenarios when this model is incorporated into i tree tools interpolation was used to simplify smooth and improve efficiency of temperature results for the 10 201 land cover scenarios assessed 101 101 combinations of tree cover and impervious cover incremented from 0 to 100 at 1 intervals a lookup table was used to link the estimated air temperature and humidity data for the combinations of tree and impervious cover under baseline and alternative scenarios identified for each census block group using zonal means of the nlcd data the temperature and humidity records were used as inputs for the analysis of premature mortality as described in section 2 3 2 3 estimating the changes in premature mortality our approach for modeling the connection between human health extreme temperature and tree cover is similar to the connection developed between human health air pollution and tree cover in which epidemiological studies use either air pollution or extreme temperature as inputs and not the tree cover nowak et al 2013a 2014 we selected a set of studies from the epidemiological literature that estimated the relationship between extreme heat exposure and mortality ensuring they were applicable to the study area table 1 basu et al 2005 included data from 20 metropolitan areas across the country and covers a range of temperature conditions this study provides estimated coefficients for different regions and the coefficient for the northeast was applied to baltimore medina ramon et al 2006 and medina ramon and schwartz 2007 include data from baltimore in their analysis and provide nationwide estimates which we apply city specific studies although ideal are unavailable for all cities in the country since our goal is to provide a method that can be applied to different locations we apply these three studies as a starting point these relationships were then applied to the relevant population in each census block group a wide variety of definitions and measures including ambient temperature heat index a combination of temperature and dew point and heat waves exceeding predefined thresholds over a number of days represent extreme heat in the epidemiological literature different metrics such as average minimum or maximum daily temperatures nighttime temperatures or daytime temperatures have been used to define extremes predefined thresholds vary from specific temperatures such as 35 c to historical local averages or percentiles studies have shown that people can adapt at least partly to the temperature they are used to due to infrastructure and physiological acclimatization and that the health impact of temperature can vary with location medina ramon et al 2006 sarofim et al 2016 in other words a 35 c air temperature will impact people in phoenix arizona differently than people from boston massachusetts what is extreme is relative to the typical local conditions however there is also evidence suggesting that there are heat tolerance limits sherwood and huber 2010 this lack of a standard definition is well documented in the research on climate impacts on human health smith et al 2013 sarofim et al 2016 the epidemiological studies selected for this study table 1 represent a range of extreme heat metrics the heat metrics were calculated as per the definitions in the epidemiological studies basu et al 2005 use daily mean temperature as the heat metric medina ramon et al 2006 employ a city specific binary variable to determine whether it is an extremely hot day in this study extremely hot days are defined as those with daily minimum temperature at or greater than the 99th percentile for baltimore 5 5 since the estimated Œ≤ coefficients of the study represented deviations from the 99th percentile for 1989 2000 we used hourly measurements at the reference weather station wban 93721 for the same time period and our computed value for the 99th percentile of daily minimum temperature was 24 c the minimum temperature is used as an indication of nighttime relief from heat medina ramon and schwartz 2007 used the same heat metric as medina ramon et al 2006 but also used a piecewise linear metric where there are no impacts if the daily minimum temperature is 17 c or less and impacts are linear above that temperature as shown in table 1 the three studies encompass different months the data for these heat metric calculations were obtained from the baseline and alternative scenarios hourly temperature estimates from i tree cool air as described in section 2 2 changes in each heat metric heat were obtained by taking the difference in the heat metric under the alternative scenario and the baseline tree cover impervious cover conditions 6 6 for the heat metric corresponding to medina ramon et al 2006 that was based on the 99th percentile threshold binary indicator variables were used to calculate whether the threshold was exceeded under the baseline and alternative scenarios as follows 1 Œ¥ heat hea t alt hea t base mathematically estimating the changes in mortality y due to change in each heat metric entails applying a health impact function voorhees et al 2011 that transforms a change in heat exposure to a change in mortality as follows 2 Œ¥ y y 0 e Œ≤ Œ¥ heat 1 p where y0 is the baseline health incidence rate for mortality for each age group heat is the change in the heat metric p is the exposed population for each age group and Œ≤ represents the relationship between the change in the heat metric and mortality for the relevant age group and was derived from the heat exposure mortality response relationships in the selected epidemiological studies information on the functional form of the exposure response relationships in each study was used to mathematically derive Œ≤ and the associated confidence interval studies use various functional forms and covariates including air pollution that may be correlated with heat exposures as we are focusing on warm seasons ozone levels are likely to be high and there is emerging evidence of interactions between air pollution and temperature which impact human physiological response to each of those stressors analitis et al 2014 fann et al 2016 jhun et al 2014 madrigano et al 2015 medina ramon and schwartz 2007 not controlling for ozone which is correlated with temperature would result in biased estimates for the Œ≤ coefficient on the heat metric medina ramon and schwartz 2007 find that controlling for ozone reduces the Œ≤ coefficient on the heat metric applying coefficients without ozone controls would therefore result in overestimates of mortality reduction county level baseline incidence rates for cause specific mortality were obtained for each age group from benmap ce cdc 2015 sacks et al 2018 mortality classifications in the incidence data and epidemiological studies did not match exactly so we made the closest match possible as shown in the two columns for mortality classification one for the epidemiological study and the other for incidence data in table 1 population for 5 year age groups at the census block group level was obtained from the 2010 decennial census manson et al 2020 representing different age groups accurately is crucial because baseline incidence rates for cause specific mortality vary across age groups and exposure response functions are age specific since the younger age groups in data sources for baseline incidence rates and for population were not completely aligned an adjustment was performed more specifically benmap ce has baseline incidence rates for ages 0 and 1 to 17 while the decennial census has population for ages under 5 5 to 9 10 to 14 and 15 to 17 years assuming that the population under 5 is uniformly distributed across the ages 0 to 4 1 5 of the population under 5 years was used for the population for age 0 similarly 4 5 of the population under 5 years was used for the population for ages 1 4 which was summed with populations for 5 to 9 10 to 14 and 15 to 17 years to obtain the population for ages 1 to 17 above 18 years the age groups in the two data sources were matched and thus no adjustment was performed when applying each epidemiological study to calculate the mortality impacts we use the relevant months population age groups heat metrics and Œ≤ to obtain the total changes in mortality we added the mortality impacts across all age groups relevant for the study we also estimated lower and upper bounds for health impacts yub ylb using the confidence interval Œ≤ub Œ≤lb to represent the uncertainty in Œ≤ estimates results for each specification of the model run heat metric health endpoint Œ≤ population are presented separately since the model runs represent different heat metrics health endpoints and population groups it is not appropriate to average or aggregate results further retaining the full range of the results for different model runs allows us to compare results across the model specifications and provides options for considering research questions that are interesting to the reader 2 4 estimating the monetary value of human health benefits the monetary benefit of the change in mortality b was estimated using the above computed change in mortality y along with the value of a statistical life v and calculated as 3 b Œ¥ y v the value of a statistical life is defined in the economics literature as the willingness to pay for a small reduction in risk of death in the population for a group of people the estimate that is typically used in benefits analysis conducted by the u s epa 2018 was applied in this study 7 4 million in 2006 dollars we adjusted this value to 2011 dollars using the consumer price index inflation calculator from the u s bureau of labor statistics 2020 and obtained a value of 8 22 million as per the guidance of u s epa this same value is applied to the whole population regardless of age income or other population characteristics 3 results and discussion 3 1 quantify urban tree and impervious cover the amount of tree cover and impervious cover under baseline conditions in each of baltimore city s 653 census block groups in 2011 is shown in figs 1 a and 1b respectively tree cover estimates are conservative as nlcd is known to underestimate tree cover nowak and greenfield 2010 we expect that the nlcd underestimation of tree cover does not affect the impacts of adding tree cover because tree cover effects are linearly interpolated as described in section 2 2 the 0 tree cover scenario is affected by the nlcd underestimation of tree cover where the estimated impacts and economic values for the 0 tree cover scenario represent change from an underestimated baseline tree cover and therefore are a lower boundary of results tree cover in downtown baltimore was low 20 and higher in the city s outskirts 20 the most forested census block group had 73 tree cover and the least forested had 0 tree cover there were 93 census block groups with less than 10 tree cover and 81 of those had 0 tree cover conversely impervious cover in downtown baltimore tended to be high 60 while it was lower in the city s outskirts 40 the most impervious census block groups had 100 impervious cover and the least impervious had 10 impervious cover there were 55 census block groups with impervious cover of 90 or more and 3 of those had 100 impervious cover the effect on tree cover of removing or adding 10 tree cover in each of baltimore city s census block groups is shown in appendix figs a1 a and a1 b 7 7 when removing 10 tree cover the extent of tree cover for the 93 census block groups that had less than 10 tree cover was set at or left at 0 and thus not reduced by a full 10 this asymmetry is indicative of a limitation in simple alternative scenarios being broadly applied to all census block groups for example assessing the removal of 10 tree cover is irrelevant in the 81 out of 653 census block groups that have a baseline of 0 tree cover this asymmetry does not prevent the identification of overall trends in impact for this case study as described in section 2 1 surface water cover was not accounted for in this model and of the 653 census block groups in baltimore only 29 4 included water bodies 3 2 modeling temperature changes due to tree cover baseline average air temperatures from april to october for baltimore city s census block groups range from 19 2 c to 21 2 c with highest impervious cover and lowest tree cover being the hottest fig 2 8 temperatures are based on mesoscale climate calculated from a reference weather station baltimore washington international thurgood marshall airport located outside of the study area as described in section 2 2 a time series of baseline minimum average and maximum air temperature among all census block groups for the same period shows the months of may june and july have some of the hottest weather with maximum temperatures reaching 40 c fig 3 although the average temperature shown by the red line in fig 3 reaches its highest value near 35 c on july 22 approximately midway through the warm season there is considerable variation across the period and within each month the difference between the baseline minimum and maximum temperatures ranges from 1 2 c on september 6 to 22 7 c on april 4 analysis of the simulated years of 2008 2011 and 2012 showed common patterns in temperature changes between the baseline tree cover and the alternative scenarios and 2011 was selected as a representative case although we conduct our analysis for all three alternative scenarios we primarily focus on the alternative of increasing tree cover by 10 for the purposes below 9 9 the asymmetry of alternative scenario changes to tree cover has only a small effect on temperature impacts for all years and alternative scenarios when adding or removing 10 of tree cover from each census block group s area the interquartile range of impact on air temperature is equivalent with one significant figure of precision the 25th and 75th percentile impact for both alternative scenarios ranges from a 0 4 c to a 0 5 c change in mean temperature across all census block groups for the hottest day july 22 2011 as summarized in table 2 the heat metrics derived from the i tree cool air model results vary across the selected epidemiological studies and are based on either average or minimum temperatures maps of the reductions in average and minimum air temperatures with 10 increases in tree cover are shown for the hottest day of the season july 22 2011 fig 4 a and 4b while the spatial distribution of the reductions is similar for both the average and the minimum the reductions in average temperature range from 0 33 c to 0 57 c while the reductions in minimum temperature range from 0 09 c to 0 33 c this indicates that if other parameters including Œ≤ in eq 2 are held constant the health impacts would be lower for a heat metric that uses the minimum temperature the same pattern holds for reductions in the daily average and daily minimum air temperatures averaged across all the months between april and october figs 4c and 4d the greater magnitude reduction in average temperatures compared with minimum temperatures fits trends in the i tree cool air model where maximum temperatures and thus averages are more sensitive to changes in tree cover than are minimum temperatures all four maps show temperature change to be higher downtown which has a higher impervious cover and lower tree cover indicating the higher impact of increased tree cover in areas where the baseline tree cover is low and impervious cover is high to better understand how changes in premature mortality vary across the warm season months the monthly reductions in average and minimum air temperatures caused by increased tree cover are presented in figs 5 a and 5b overall a u shaped trend is seen where the temperature reduction is smallest in april and october and the greatest reduction in temperature is in july for both average and minimum these monthly average temperature reductions smooth out the much larger hourly and daily temperature reductions caused by increasing tree cover across all days and census block groups in the warm season the maximum reduction in average minimum temperature is 0 63 c 0 56 c and the minimum reduction in average minimum temperature is 0 01 c 0 06 c there is high variance across the census block groups with july having the greatest variance for both average and minimum air temperatures 3 3 estimating the changes in premature mortality 3 3 1 changes in heat metrics the heat metric of basu et al 2005 focuses on june july and august the summer season s three hottest months the heat metric in this study is the daily average temperature and as seen in fig 3 this metric averaged across all census block groups ranges from 20 c to 35 c during these three months in our study year of 2011 under the alternative scenario of increased tree cover the maximum and minimum reductions in the monthly mean of the average temperature for the three summer months of june july and august are 0 40 c and 0 19 c respectively fig 5 as with basu et al 2005 the heat metric of medina ramon and schwartz 2007 is also linear but is based on daily minimum temperature and assumes no heat exposure unless the minimum temperature exceeds 17 c the minimum temperature averaged across all census block groups ranged from 5 4 c to 27 4 c between may and september the maximum and minimum reductions in the monthly mean of the minimum temperature for the five months are 0 17 c and 0 04 c respectively as shown in fig 5 comparing the metrics from the two studies we see that as summarized in section 3 2 the reduction in minimum temperatures is less than that of average temperatures in addition the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 study assumes a truncated heat metric where any health impacts below a minimum temperature of the 17 c threshold are zero 10 10 figure a 2 in the appendix shows that the drop in heat metric values averaged across census block groups representing the piecewise linear metric from medina ramon and schwartz 2007 is always less than the basu et al 2005 metric since the line showing the latter is always below the former for medina ramon and schwartz 2007 the line coincides with the horizontal axis for some days which denotes a no changes in the heat metric in our study for about 33 of the time the minimum temperatures were below 17 c for both the baseline and alternative scenarios across the census block groups the change in heat metric in such instances is zero further about 0 4 of the time increased tree cover under the alternative scenario results in temperatures dropping from above 17 c to below 17 c in such cases the impacts on heat metrics are limited by the 17 c threshold 11 11 figure a 3 shows the number of days that minimum temperature was below 17 c under both the baseline and alternative scenarios for each census block group figure a 4 shows the number of days that minimum temperature changed from above 17 c to below 17 c under the alternative scenario of increasing tree cover by 10 of the census block group area the medina ramon et al 2006 and medina ramon and schwartz 2007 studies both use a binary heat metric to define extremely hot days for these studies reductions in heat metrics only occur if the increase in tree cover causes the minimum temperature to drop from above the historical threshold to below the threshold for this to happen two conditions must be satisfied first the minimum temperature under the baseline conditions must be above 24 c and second the increase in tree cover must cause enough of a temperature drop to change the binary heat metric from 1 to 0 extremely hot days are defined as days where minimum temperatures cross historical thresholds so a priori we expect that the number of days with temperature conditions satisfying the first condition for each census block group will be small this is evidenced in our data where there are 10 days where minimum temperature is above 24 c the number of days that the binary heat metric switched from a value of 1 to 0 varied across the study area with only 28 of census block groups experiencing a change of 1 or 2 days 151 23 had a change on 1 day 33 5 had a change on 2 days and the remainder experienced no change fig 6 3 3 2 changes in premature mortality estimated heat metric results applied using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 approach provide impacts for the broadest range of health endpoints all cause mortality and all age groups further this study also estimates exposure response relationships controlling for ozone applying the Œ≤ coefficient on the piecewise linear heat metric in medina ramon and schwartz 2007 we find that the estimated number of deaths avoided when tree cover is increased by 10 of census block group area is 247 with a 95 confidence interval of 141 to 353 table 2 12 12 table a 1 in the appendix also provides mortality impacts associated with the other 2 alternative scenarios these impacts are 17 lower than when applying Œ≤ coefficients without controlling for ozone to the same piecewise linear metric which yields 298 avoided deaths to incorporate another type of heat metric typically used in the public health literature we apply the binary metric from medina ramon and schwartz 2007 to assess the health impacts of the alternative scenario of increasing tree cover the Œ≤ coefficient for this binary metric is roughly 10 times higher than that of the piecewise linear metric from the same study indicating a much stronger mortality response to an extremely hot day as compared to less extreme temperatures however the number of extremely hot days are limited in 2011 this was 10 hence whether smaller or larger health impacts in total are expected with binary metrics versus piecewise linear metrics is an empirical question and will depend on the number of days that the binary heat metric changes from 1 to 0 applying the Œ≤ coefficient on the binary heat metric that also controls for ozone the mortality reduction is 83 with a confidence interval of 47 to 118 13 13 as shown in table 2 estimates with ozone controls for the binary metric are lower than with no controls by about 14 although this is a much smaller impact compared to the estimated avoided deaths from applying the piecewise linear metric this result is not surprising given the small number of days that the binary heat metric changes from 1 to 0 in 2011 as illustrated in fig 6 and described in detail in section 3 3 1 if the study year included a higher number of extreme heat days e g in a heat wave year the estimates would be much higher the public health literature shows that the population over 65 is more sensitive to extreme heat so we also show results for the basu et al 2005 approach which represents cardiorespiratory mortality for adults in this age group basu et al 2005 and medina ramon and schwartz 2007 differ in terms of the age groups months covered data and methods heat metrics and mortality causes thus making a direct comparison of results challenging the most meaningful comparison between the two is to consider the Œ≤ coefficient on the piecewise linear metric of medina ramon and schwartz 2007 that does not control for ozone with the linear metric of basu et al 2005 given the lower baseline incidence rates for cardiorespiratory mortality 14 14 mortality rates from all causes includes cardiorespiratory causes as well as other causes hence cardiorespiratory incidence rates are smaller and the reduced population represented by the elderly along with fewer months assessed smaller impacts were expected using basu et al 2005 however the larger Œ≤ coefficient in basu et al 2005 would be expected to result in greater impacts potentially due to a greater response for the hottest months and or vulnerability to the heat exposures for the population over 65 further as described in section 3 3 1 because the change in heat metrics is larger for basu et al 2005 reductions in mortality would also be expected to be lower using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 study which study yields a higher net impact is therefore an empirical question when applying the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 Œ≤ coefficient for all ages to only the adults over 65 the avoided mortality is 172 95 confidence interval is between 105 and 240 while the avoided mortality for basu et al 2005 is 423 95 confidence interval is between 213 and 632 the mean estimates for medina ramon and schwartz 2007 are lower despite being applied to a higher baseline incidence for all cause mortality and to a larger number of months this lower estimate is potentially due to a combination of the smaller reduction in heat metrics as described in section 3 3 1 and smaller Œ≤ coefficient of medina ramon and schwartz 2007 even if the same heat metrics were used the fact that the Œ≤ coefficient for medina ramon and schwartz 2007 is roughly half of basu et al 2005 highlights the importance of distinguishing vulnerable age groups and applying the age specific coefficients relevant for vulnerable age groups in addition to the mortality impacts another question that is extremely relevant for decision makers is the spatial distribution of the impacts the mortality impacts estimated with basu et al 2005 tend to be lowest near baltimore downtown and higher in the outskirts fig 7 a this result is not in line with the temperature reductions which occur more in the downtown area fig 4 however as fig 8 a shows the population over 65 is more concentrated in the outskirts and the spatial distribution of impacts lines up closely with that of the population the magnitude of the pearson s correlation coefficient is 0 94 as shown in fig 7b the distribution of mortality impacts using medina ramon and schwartz 2007 but applied to the population over 65 shows a similar pattern the magnitude of the pearson s correlation coefficient is 0 93 15 15 we expect the correlation between population and mortality impacts for medina ramon and schwartz 2007 to be different from basu et al 2005 this is because the spatial distribution of impacts although similar is not identical the different heat metrics used in the two studies combined with different Œ≤ coefficients account for the difference in the spatial distribution of impacts further applying the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 approach to all age groups we see that the mortality impacts fig 7c and total population fig 8b have similar spatial distribution patterns the magnitude of the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 58 with more impacts downtown than for the population over 65 years in age in comparison heat metric changes showed very low correlation with the mortality impacts estimated for the total population using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 approach the magnitude of the pearson correlation coefficient is 0 001 a key implication of these results is that in baltimore the largest impacts of increased tree cover are seen where the exposed population resides not necessarily where the temperature changes are the greatest if a policy goal is to reduce temperature risks to vulnerable populations it is important to increase tree cover in areas where susceptible populations reside not necessarily where there is low tree cover or where temperature reductions can be the greatest given the difference in estimates among the various studies and metrics the question is which metric is appropriate for decision makers the answer depends on the audience and context of the analysis as the piecewise linear metrics used by medina ramon and schwartz 2007 represent the entire population and all mortality causes it would provide average city wide estimates these estimates would be appropriate for decision makers such as city planners in typical years i e without heat waves the binary metric in this study assumes that there is no mortality impact of warmer temperatures unless they are extreme given that the piecewise linear metrics provide significant results for less extreme temperatures the use of binary metrics is more restrictive however in the context of climate change where the number of extremely hot days is projected to increase significantly assessments using the binary heat metric can potentially inform preparedness efforts e g cooling centers and response plans for heat waves and thus provide useful information to the public health community the results may be closer using these two types of metrics for heat wave years if minimum temperatures stay the same on average but there are more days with extreme heat if the focus is on the population over 65 the linear basu et al 2005 metric would yield estimates that can be considered as upper bounds for cardiorespiratory mortality specific to this age group and policies based on these estimates would be most protective of that group more detailed information about impacts on specific causes of mortality such as pneumonia stroke and cardiovascular diseases might be useful for the public health community as well we applied the same binary heat metric from medina ramon et al 2006 to calculate reductions in pneumonia stroke and cardiovascular disease related mortality which were 1 18 and 7 deaths respectively under the scenario of increasing trees 16 16 these estimates are not additive with the overall estimates from the other two studies rather they provide impacts on more detailed causes of mortality though this case study focuses primarily on impacts for the scenario of increasing tree cover by 10 two other scenarios were assessed described in section 2 1 for city wide mortality using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 study while the scenario of increasing tree cover by 10 of each census block group s area was estimated to result in 251 deaths avoided reducing tree cover by 10 of each census block group s area was estimated to result in 220 more deaths the asymmetry of health impacts when increasing and reducing tree cover by the same amount is expected because the health impact function is non linear and because of the asymmetry in structure and temperature impacts of these alternative scenarios as described in sections 3 1 and 3 2 17 17 each source of asymmetry acts in a different direction heat used as an exponential in the health impact function means reducing tree cover resulting in positive heat is expected to have a larger health impact but asymmetry when removing tree cover due to 14 2 of census block groups having 10 baseline tree cover reduces the city wide impact of the reduced tree cover scenario removing all tree cover from each census block group was estimated to result in 551 more deaths this 0 tree cover scenario indicated that baltimore s baseline tree cover in 2011 avoids 551 deaths from mortality city wide per year 3 4 estimating the monetary value of human health benefits the mean estimate for monetary values of reductions in mortality shown in table 2 using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 piecewise linear approach when controlling for ozone and applied to all age groups is 2 06 billion with a 95 confidence interval of 1 18 billion to 2 95 billion applying the binary heat metric from the same study the estimate is 692 63 million with a 95 confidence interval of 393 million to 986 04 million the monetary value of the reduced mortality for the population over 65 using the basu et al 2005 approach is 3 47 billion 95 confidence interval between 1 75 billion and 5 19 billion and using the medina ramon and schwartz 2007 piecewise linear approach is 1 42 billion 95 confidence interval between 0 86 billion and 1 98 billion estimates from the basu et al 2005 study may be considered as upper bounds for cardiorespiratory mortality table a 1 in the appendix also provides monetary values associated with the other two alternative scenarios for basu et al 2005 and medina ramon and schwartz 2007 table a 2 shows the health and monetary impacts using the basu et al 2005 approach for all three years and fig a 5 shows the spatial distribution for mortality reductions in 2008 and 2012 to place these results in context with other impacts of ecosystem services provided by urban tree cover the monetary benefits of baltimore s current tree cover from reducing heat are more than 100 times larger than from reducing pm2 5 concentrations on average nowak et al 2013a the study of pm2 5 reduction is comparable in that both studies represented all causes of mortality associated with an environmental factor pm2 5 or heat metrics assessed a 0 tree cover alternative to estimate the impact of current tree cover and used the value of statistical life to estimate monetary benefits the studies differ in that nowak et al 2013a used different age group delineations 0 1 and 25 99 analysis year 2010 instead of 2011 dollar year 2015 instead of 2011 scale of result by city instead of by census block group and source of tree cover data 2005 field samples instead of 2011 nlcd although pm2 5 levels vary across cities and therefore the benefits of pollutant removal also vary baseline levels of pollution in the united states are in the range of the national ambient air quality standards and thus the marginal benefits of reducing pm2 5 are relatively small as compared to heat related mortality which is a leading cause of death from natural weather or environmental events in the united states apha 2018 increasing tree cover can therefore play a critical role in reducing heat related mortality impacts under current conditions and an even bigger role under future climate scenarios 4 conclusion and future research the goal of this study was to introduce and demonstrate a method for quantifying and valuing changes in mortality from extreme heat due to the presence of tree cover this method provides the foundation for the spatially explicit decision support tool i tree to incorporate heat related mortality this method will be implemented in the i tree model to allow users to assess mortality impacts of changes in tree cover across the warm season and provide valuable information to city planners and the public health community future work will explore the potential for i tree to include a range of health impact functions e g different heat metrics coefficients that are specific to vulnerable populations that will allow users to assess a wide set of research questions such as the role trees can play in reducing mortality impacts under different climate and population scenarios to further facilitate environmental policymaking we apply the national ecosystem services classification system nescs plus classification system newcomer johnson et al 2020 to the ecosystem service we quantify and value in this study mortality impacts of temperature reductions due to increased tree cover can be assigned a nescs plus code of 27 1 1092 211 environment class urban suburban 27 ecological end product atmosphere 1 direct use support of human health and life 1092 direct user households 211 using a common classification code can support policymaking by helping organize measures of ecosystem service benefits and providing a common language across disciplines results indicate that approximately 251 deaths 95 confidence interval of 143 to 358 can be avoided in the city of baltimore total population of 620 961 with a 10 increase in tree cover we also find that more than half of the reduced mortality impacts are for the population over the age of 65 which is about 12 of the total population who are known to be vulnerable to extreme heat controlling for ozone is important to account for interaction effects with temperature and we find that impacts on premature mortality are lower but remain in a similar range even under the most conservative approach with only extreme temperatures above 24 c assumed to have a mortality impact and therefore impacts in 2011 which is not a heat wave year are limited to a few days and census block groups 84 95 confidence interval of 48 to 120 deaths are avoided annually in baltimore alone the economic value of these avoided deaths is large ranging from 690 million to 2 1 billion when we consider ozone effects there is potential for even larger benefits given that tree cover can be increased by much more in some areas spatial distribution of impacts shows that the greatest reductions in mortality occurred in the outskirts of baltimore where a greater number of people who are over 65 years in age reside rather than downtown where the temperature reductions are greatest these spatial patterns have important policy implications for example our analysis highlights the importance of identifying areas with plantable space and vulnerable populations to maximize human health benefits from urban forests in each city further assessing spatially explicit impacts of alternative tree cover scenarios can help develop more targeted and efficient policies to promote environmental justice and equity our estimated results are broadly consistent with other studies that quantify mortality impacts of increased tree cover using different methods for example kondo et al 2020 project reducing premature deaths by about 400 95 confidence interval of 298 to 618 by increasing philadelphia s tree cover to 30 given that the spatial and temporal aspects as well as the study data and methods including the extent of tree cover change assessed are different between the two studies a direct comparison is difficult however the results appear to be in a similar range while this study is a first step to modeling temperature impacts of trees on human health there are several ways in which a more comprehensive assessment can be made in subsequent analysis on the temperature modeling side i tree cool air could be modified to simulate anthropogenic contributions to the urban heat island this would include heat released from human activities such as from combustion of fuels friction from machines and human metabolism the signature of anthropogenic heating is often clearest in nighttime temperatures where it can add 2 c to 3 c and during peak activity it can contribute on the order of 100 w m2 to net heat inputs sailor 2011 although the monetary value of avoided mortality impacts from increasing tree cover is large mortality is not the only impact of temperature on human well being further research should investigate temperature impacts on other health conditions such as heat stroke heat exhaustion heat cramps as well as respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses low birth weight and mental distress research could also investigate how these changes in air temperature affect human comfort e g sinha et al 2018 estimating the impacts of tree cover for different u s cities will also expand our knowledge on the variation of potential impacts of urban trees on air temperature and human health exploring whether the binary metrics and the piecewise linear metrics yield results that are more similar in analysis conducted for a heat wave year would be interesting further we find that more than half the impacts are for a vulnerable age group population over 65 for a more comprehensive assessment future models will need to incorporate other demographic and socioeconomic factors associated with health impacts from extreme heat usgcrp 2016 our findings for baltimore suggest that temperature reductions can potentially contribute to human health and well being significantly in the light of the large number approximately 12 000 of heat related deaths in the united states each year and the projected increases in such deaths due to changing climates increasing tree cover can therefore play an important role in adaptation strategies for cities to mitigate the effects of rising temperatures and reduce urban heat island effects the method demonstrated here can be applied to inform the development of climate adaptation strategies in an optimal manner for example estimates of monetary benefits provide a common metric that can be compared with the costs of implementing the policies further such holistic assessments of benefits provide evidence based support for policies which can provide significant public health and economic benefits to cities examining spatial variations of impacts among different socioeconomic and demographic groups could also help address public health environmental justice and equity issues and reduce risks to vulnerable populations credit author statement paramita sinha conceptualization methodology investigation formal

24631,land use and land cover changes lulcc are recognized among the main drivers affecting biodiversity and ecosystem services especially in areas with high biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity the need to find optimal planning solutions to combine human and natural systems still remains an open issue this study aims to investigate how different planning strategies affecting the spatial arrangement of lulcc can produce different impacts in terms of ecosystem conditions in the lazio region central italy starting from the same lulcc magnitude observed in the past through an inventory approach three different future scenarios to 2030 were depicted by means of the invest tool scenario generator the business as usual bau and alternatively one avoiding changes within the natura 2000 sites n2k and another within the regional most degraded municipalities dm the ecological impacts of these scenarios were then assessed using the invest habitat quality model adopting habitat quality hq as a proxy for biodiversity in order to characterize lulcc impacts at multiple scales the assessment was carried out both at the regional level and within distinct ecological units independently from the spatial arrangement of projected lulcc hq decreased under all three scenarios nonetheless hq values varied among scenarios highlighting a strict relationship between the spatial arrangement and the ecological impact of lulcc compared to bau alternative scenarios as well as their combination into a best scenario reduced negative impacts on hq these results highlighted the weak sustainability of pursuing with past urban planning strategies while allowed to foster innovative planning approaches to mitigate habitats loss and degradation the proposed methodology was effective to localize the conservation priorities as well as ameliorating the reliability of planning strategies based on their ecological performance furthermore it supports the resolution of planning conflicts between contrasting demands e g urban expansion vs biodiversity conservation thus enhancing simultaneous benefits for both nature and people keywords land use change invest land use planning biodiversity conservation habitat quality 1 introduction landscape changes associated with exponential population growth currently pose major societal and environmental challenges shaker 2015 indeed land use and land cover changes lulcc are recognized among the main drivers affecting biodiversity and ecosystem services es verburg et al 2015 the negative impacts of lulcc are substantially due to habitats loss and destruction direct effect or habitats fragmentation and degradation indirect effect altering in turn the spatial configuration of ecosystems haddad et al 2015 several studies focused on lulcc drivers flows and ecological impacts lambin and meyfroidt 2011 vitousek et al 2008 since they affect the condition of ecosystems i e the capacity to provide multiple es supporting biodiversity and human well being european commission 2018 particularly the mediterranean region is one of the most significantly altered biodiversity hotspots in the world falcucci et al 2007 where lulcc are affecting traditional landscapes and related biodiversity camarretta et al 2018 malandra et al 2018 as an example in italy recent investigations showed that the biophysical variability of territories combined with socioeconomic aspects strongly affect the spatial location of different lulcc along both latitudinal and altitudinal gradients blasi et al 2017 capotorti et al 2012 marchetti et al 2017 the high rate of land take romano and zullo 2014 and agricultural intensification in lowlands and along the coasts are counterbalanced by land abandonment and subsequent forest expansion in the southern part of the peninsula as well as in mountain and economically marginal areas malandra et al 2018 in this regard there is a globally growing interest in how to enhance land planning reducing impacts on biodiversity and es sharma et al 2018 in this context lulcc scenarios play important roles concerning the major phases of the agenda setting brown et al 2013 representing valuable tools to better understand relationships between nature and human driven processes of changes for example a business as usual scenario represents a future with no interventions in the agenda setting this projection represents the starting point in which stakeholders and policymakers can hypothesize alternative strategies i e intervention scenarios and explore the potential impacts with respect both to the present and to the business as usual scenario kok et al 2007 van vliet and kok 2013 according to the phase and the aim of the decision making processes different modeling approaches can be used to project future changes i e machine learning cellular automata economic models agents based brown et al 2013 with various strengths and weaknesses ipbes 2016 for example the research of martellozzo et al 2018 focuses on the implications of lulcc projection on agriculture and natural lands under different policy oriented scenarios using a combination of multi criteria analysis and cellular automata ca model i e sleuth chaudhuri and clarke 2013 their analysis enables precisely the foresee of the spatial effects of current lulcc trends while requiring a robust dataset to calibrate the model chaudhuri and clarke 2013 martellozzo et al 2018 conversely there are some more user friendly approaches less data demanding and particularly appropriate to explore stakeholders visions or their uncertainties regarding the future rather than its strict prediction e g the invest software platform berg et al 2016 for example sharma et al 2018 run invest tools for modeling alternative scenarios expansion of exploitative land uses vs protection of natural ones and to assess their effects on biodiversity in developing countries like indonesia with usually limited data availability indeed alternative scenarios are generally built under both conservative and development approaches e g nelson et al 2009 to guide planning and identifying trade offs between es and economic benefits sandhu et al 2018 however the impacts on biodiversity and es are not only influenced by the magnitude of lulcc but they can also vary according to the spatial configuration of these changes schulp et al 2016 the influence of the spatial configuration of lulcc is particularly relevant in heterogeneous landscapes than homogeneous ones due to the increased difficulty to spatially identify and quantify both their dynamics and impacts gallant et al 2004 furthermore the heterogeneity of landscapes combined with the mismatch between administrative and ecological boundaries increases the complexity of decision making gallant et al 2004 quinn and wood 2017 reducing the effectiveness in reaching multiple targets i e economic development vs biodiversity conservation nelson et al 2008 2009 therefore to address this challenge many authors suggested a spatial stratification of the whole territory into functional subunits mart√≠nez fern√°ndez et al 2015 depending on the research question or policy issue this stratification was conducted by using ecoregions e g gallant et al 2004 zimmermann et al 2010 soilscapes e g rivieccio et al 2017 biophysical land units smiraglia et al 2013 anthromes e g gibson and quinn 2017 or potential natural vegetation pnv zerbe 1998 pnv played an important role in european landscape planning ricotta et al 2002 zerbe 1998 especially in italy pnv units were used for setting up an ecological framework to promote green infrastructure for the national ecosystems mapping and their conservation status assessment and the identification of restoration priorities capotorti et al 2015 2020a actually as detailed ecological settings within wider ecoregions they are increasingly being adopted in strategical analyses and regulations spanning from the annual reports on natural capital which should inform the national budget law and reform plan incc 2017 to the national strategy for the urban green which should guide sustainable development within the cities capotorti et al 2020b however the assessment of the spatial variability of potential lulcc within the pnv and the subsequent designing of regional spatial planning based on these units to reduce the impacts on ecosystems is still missing accordingly this study aims to test the effectiveness of alternative planning strategies in terms of biodiversity conservation through the implementation of a scenario based approach combined with a spatially explicit assessment of habitats condition the main objective is testing whether only changing the spatial location of future lulcc the overall negative impact on biodiversity can be reduced starting from a business as usual scenario two alternative scenarios depicting antithetical planning options were developed i e preservation of areas already designed for habitat and species conservation or preservation of already degraded areas and their effectiveness was tested through combining two invest tools integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs sharp et al 2018 future lulcc and their impacts were analysed at both regional and sub regional scales in order to i better characterize the ecological consequences of lulcc on different ecological units ii evaluate if the combination between planning strategies showing fewer impacts at the sub regional scale is effective in ameliorating the cumulative impacts throughout the region the methodological framework here proposed is valuable to support land planning strategies through evaluating their ecological performance as well as offering a theoretical and technical support for the resolution of future spatial disparities between urban development and nature conservation in human dominated and biophysically heterogeneous contexts 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lazio region is located in central italy spanning across 17 242 km2 and with a population of 5 8 million people in 2020 75 of whom in the metropolitan city of rome capital http dati istat it fig 1 a the region straddles between the apennine ecoregional sector in the inland with a temperate climate and the tyrrhenian ecoregional sector along the coast with mediterranean and sub mediterranean climatic conditions blasi et al 2018 2014 as shown in fig 1b the former sector is mainly dominated by natural and semi natural vegetation i e forests and grasslands and it is currently suffering a decrease in population that is typical of the inner areas marchetti et al 2017 conversely the second one is mainly dominated by croplands and built up areas due to orographic and pedological factors as well as to the presence of the metropolitan area of rome which tends to polarize both the urban and economic growth of the region fiorini et al 2011 sallustio et al 2015 this biophysical heterogeneity combined with anthropic drivers determines the spatial distribution of current vegetation land uses and their trends over time smiraglia et al 2013 2 2 methodological framework the present study is based on the assumption that past lulcc will continue in the next future with the same magnitude but with possible changes in their spatial allocation as a result of different planning strategies for this reason lulcc occurred in the lazio region from 1990 to 2008 were analysed using the italian land use inventory iuti corona et al 2012 and then projected to 2030 by using the invest tool scenario generator sharp et al 2018 three alternative scenarios were depicted the business as usual scenario bau represents the continuation of the same magnitude and spatial arrangement of the lulcc occurred in the 1990 2008 time period i e no intervention scenario then the same magnitude but with different lulcc allocation were projected under two alternative scenarios i the n2k where lulcc were not allowed within natura2000 sites i e areas designed for conservation of biodiversity values and ii the dm where lulcc were not allowed within the municipalities mostly threatened by anthropic sources of degradation for biodiversity until 2008 after that the impacts of lulcc on biodiversity under the three scenarios at 2030 were assessed using habitat quality hq as a proxy for biodiversity strongly linked to landscape configuration di febbraro et al 2018 the ecosystem mapping approach proposed by blasi et al 2017 for the national scale was used in this work to analyze lulcc and their impact by taking into account the biophysical heterogeneity of the study area consistently with the rationale that the combination of potential natural vegetation pnv and land use maps is a proxy for outlining ecosystems accordingly pnv types of the lazio region were derived from a generalization of the map of the vegetation series according to the physiognomic and structural characteristics of the respective mature stages blasi 2010 blasi et al 2017 potential impacts of expected lulcc on hq were assessed within each of the following 8 pnv types of the lazio region fig 2 psammophilous vegetation of the coasts psam meso hygrophilous vegetation of the plains plan evergreen forests evrg thermophilous oak forests toak mixed mesophilous forests mixm beech forests bchf high altitude shrublands shrb and hydrophytic vegetation hydr finally the scenarios showing the lowest impact on hq for each of the pnv types were selected and merged to create an optimized scenario at the regional scale best scenario fig 3 2 2 1 scenario generator the experimental tool scenario generator invest 3 4 1 was used to depict the three alternative scenarios represented by respective 2030 land use maps sharp et al 2018 the conversion of each pixel to another land use class is estimated by its suitability to conversion based on i the current land use i e basemap 2008 ii the past trends of lulcc and related flows in the study area i e transition matrix and iii the driving factors influencing the different lulcc the 2008 land use map of lazio https dati lazio it with a spatial resolution of 20 m was used as current land use basemap and the original legend was reclassified into 8 land use classes namely built up areas arable lands permanent crops forests other wooded lands grassland and pastures wetlands and water bodies other lands fig 1b the transition matrix pontius et al 2004 which contains the likelihood of different conversions from one land use class to another can occur in the future according to past trends was derived by means of the italian land use inventory iuti corona et al 2012 iuti adopts a statistical sampling procedure to estimate the area covered by land use categories in italy and associated uncertainty estimates besides the statistical accuracy iuti detects lulcc in italy with a spatial resolution of 0 5 ha thus allowing to consider even those changes that are usually neglected by large scale mapping initiatives such as corine land cover map in eu iuti was firstly used to estimate lulcc rates and flows among the different classes from 1990 to 2008 and to analyze the weight of the different driving factors on lulcc flows through time while the transition matrix provides the number of pixels to be converted from one land use to another i e magnitude of lulcc flows the driving factors provide the suitability of the single pixels to be converted thus a higher conversion priority was assigned to the pixels that based on the co occurrence of driving factors showed higher suitability of conversion from one land use type to another the total number of pixels converted is reached following a descending order of suitability thus starting from those with high values of suitability to those with lower values the considered driving factors are altitude slope distance from built up areas population density and distance from the roads see tab s4 s5 in supplementary materials for further details furthermore scenario generator allows the setting of limiting factors namely constraints as portions of the territory where all lulcc are not allowed according to the normative framework in this work the spatial allocation of constraints was modified to depict plausible effects of alternative planning strategies i e n2k and dm scenarios 2 2 2 habitat quality assessment the invest habitat quality model was used for mapping and assessing potential impacts of lulcc on biodiversity it is a spatially explicit model that uses hq as a proxy for biodiversity associated with different land use classes sharp et al 2018 this approach is particularly useful for an initial spatial assessment of the ecosystem status and its possible changes through time as reported by terrado et al 2016 the model is based on the hypothesis that areas with higher hq support higher richness of native species and that decreases in habitat extent and quality lead to a decline in species persistence hq is directly related to the suitability of each land use class to provide habitats for biodiversity this initial suitability value ranging from 0 no suitability to 1 maximum suitability leh et al 2013 is further affected by three main factors related to singular threats such as i the relative sensitivity of each land use class to each threat i e roads railways and built up areas ii the relative impact of each threat and iii the distance between land use class and threats six threats were used and parameterized according to sallustio et al 2017 and by combining the data two maps showing hq and habitat degradation hd were produced both maps show values ranging from 0 to 1 following an increasing gradient of hq or hd respectively considering the proposed parameterization forest expansion is associated with an increase in hq while urban expansion is associated with its decrease furthermore the hq decline is directly affected by lulcc dynamics via land use substitution e g change from agriculture to built up as well as by the effect of new threats e g new built up areas in the surrounding land uses 2 2 3 scenarios building three alternative planning strategies were designed to project three lulcc scenarios with a fixed magnitude but different spatial allocations the first is the business as usual bau scenario which would occur if the past 1990 2008 lulcc magnitude flows and spatial arrangement are assumed to persist in the future the strategy of the n2k scenario aims to stop future lulcc at the expense of community interest species and habitats as defined by the habitats and birds european directives council directive 92 43 eec and directive 2009 147 ec respectively accordingly changes within the natura 2000 sites which stretch for 400 000 ha in the lazio region were blocked through defining them as constraints in the scenario generator tool conversely the strategy of the dm scenario aims to stop future lulcc in areas with high hd in 2008 due to the coexistence of several threats thus lulcc within the municipalities showing the highest average values of hd in 2008 were blocked through defining them as constraints in the scenario generator tool see table s6 in supplementary materials for the list of the municipalities and their average hd in order to be consistent with the n2k scenario lulcc were blocked until an overall area of 400 000 assuming as stable the magnitude of future lulcc while stopping their flows within the constrained areas implies that the overall amount of projected lulcc for n2k and dm scenarios is allocated in a more restricted area with respect to bau where no constraints or spatial limitations were imposed hq was assessed and mapped for the 2008 basemap as well as for the three 2030 alternative scenarios changes in hq from 2008 to 2030 were then assessed by pairwise map comparisons in a gis environment esri arcgis to calculate the net impact value niv fig 3 resulting from the difference between hq values at 2030 with those at 2008 niv for each pixel can vary from 1 i e hq at 2030 is lower than its value at 2008 to 1 i e hq at 2030 is higher than its value at 2008 niv is then negative when lulcc occurring during the 2008 2030 period imply a reduction of the hq values e g decrease of the biodiversity status while positive when they imply an increase of hq values e g increase of the biodiversity status moreover niv tends to decrease as the negative impacts of lulcc are emphasized and vice versa after that both positive and negative changes calculated within every pixel were summed up within each of the eight pnv and through the region to calculate the total niv of the three alternative scenarios niv associated to the three alternative scenarios were compared within each pnv to identify strategies showing the best performance in terms of impacts on hq from 2008 to 2030 the land use maps related to the scenarios with the best performance in terms of niv for each pnv were then selected and merged into a unique layer hereafter named best scenario 3 results 3 1 lulcc scenarios at 2030 consistently with the past trends occurred in the 1990 2008 period urban expansion is the predominant process projected for the 2008 2030 period 39 007 ha table 1 fig 4 indeed in all scenarios built up areas increase by 31 with respect to their coverage in 2008 and exclusively at the expense of arable lands both forests and permanent crops gain 5 at the expense of other wooded lands and arable lands respectively other wooded lands simultaneously gain surfaces from arable lands grasslands and pastures and lose them to forests with a net decrease of about 23 000 ha this is mainly due to the fact that other wooded lands often represent a transitional class establishing after agricultural abandonment with shrubs encroachment but naturally evolving towards forests stands over time despite the projected magnitude is the same under the three scenarios the different spatial location of the constraints determined differences in the distribution of lulcc throughout the region fig 5 and within the different pnv table 2 in absolute terms the majority of lulcc are expected within toak and mixm for all the scenarios due to their wide extent together about 70 of the region particular emphasis was found for urban expansion in toak 55 59 and 58 of the total phenomenon for bau n2k and dm scenarios respectively despite the similar magnitude of the phenomenon among the three scenarios the difference in land availability for urban expansion due to different incidence of constraints within the pnv determined a spread over the whole toak territory in bau while urban expansion was blocked on 13 and 35 of its extent in n2k and dm scenarios respectively as a consequence urban expansion tended to assume different spatial configuration from less to more concentrated passing from bau to n2k and dm fig 5 a similar emphasis was found for forest and other wooded lands expansion considering that 65 of the phenomenon occurred in mixm differently from urban expansion this expansion resulted more compact in n2k than dm due to the higher incidence of constraints in n2k the expansion of permanent crops is quite evenly distributed among three pnv in the bau scenario 35 of the whole phenomenon both for toak and mixm and 24 for plan while it tends to be more polarized in toak and mixm for n2k and dm scenarios however the relatively limited magnitude of this phenomenon did not allow distinguishing clear alternative trends according to the different scenarios four pnv namely psam shrb hydr and bchf are characterized by small lulcc in absolute terms expected until 2030 urban and permanent crops expansions are not at all expected in the last three pnv while forest and other wooded lands expansions are expected in bchf but not in psam moreover it is relevant to highlight that urban expansion shows particular emphasis in psam for the bau scenario where built up areas raises from 31 to 39 of the pnv 3 2 quantitative impacts of lulcc the projected lulcc resulted in negative total niv i e negative impacts are greater than positives from 2008 to 2030 for all the three scenarios however these values vary with the three different scenarios and pnv bau shows the worst total niv 841 751 while dm scenario shows the best total niv 740 750 table 2 five pnv showed the best niv in the dm scenario psam plans evrg toak and shrb while the remaining three pnv in n2k mixm bchf and hydr future land use maps related to the scenarios with the best niv per each pnv n2k and dm were assembled as a mosaic to create the best scenario land use map in terms of coverage dm and n2k contribute almost equally to create this map respectively 48 and 52 of the region it is important to highlight how even if resulting from the merge of land use maps deriving from two different scenarios the differences in the single lulcc magnitude between best scenario and the other scenarios are negligible i e 2 2 urban expansion and 1 6 forest expansion thus enabling for their comparison the resulting best scenario land use map allowed checking the spatial location of lulcc able to maximize niv both within pnv as well as through the whole region total niv as visible in table 2 running the habitat quality model using the best scenario s land use map as an input the resulting total niv of 724 388 confirms the combination of the two planning strategies as the best performing in terms of hq values it is important to note that regarding to the best scenario three pnv show a relative contribution to total niv higher than their relative contribution to the regional surface this is the case for toak plan and evrg respectively contributing to 44 18 and 9 in terms of total niv against 32 11 and 5 in terms of regional surface conversely mixm and bchf are the pnv with a relative contribution to total niv 26 and 1 respectively lower than their contribution in terms of coverage 42 and 8 respectively furthermore the ratio among niv of the best scenario and the initial hq values in 2008 highlights that pnv with the highest relative decrease are plan psam and toak 10 8 and 7 in best scenario with respect to their hq values in 2008 4 discussion 4 1 lulcc projections to 2030 and their impacts at the regional and pnv scales although forest expansion forecasted to 2030 leads to an increase in hq the positive change is too limited if compared to the decrease in hq caused by urban expansion this is demonstrated by the fact that total niv is always negative under the three scenarios as well as at single pnv scale except for shrb where only forest expansion is expected to occur in the projection period indeed assuming as stable the magnitude of past lullc urban expansion would remain the main lulcc impacting on biodiversity conservation in the study area capotorti et al 2019 frondoni et al 2011 the negatives total niv under the three scenarios depict a generalized decay of hq whereas past lulcc magnitude will persist to the future independently from their spatial configuration under different planning strategies the worst performance was found in bau scenario niv 841 751 it seems consistent with the hypothesis of the generalized poor effectiveness of past municipal city plans in containing lulcc impacts reported by romano et al 2018 according to previous studies this poor effectiveness can be partly ascribable to their poor interconnection at the landscape and regional scale molecular planning romano et al 2019 and ghost planning scorza et al 2020 indeed as shown by romano et al 2018 past national and regional urban policies never really played a strategic control role in influencing local level decision making since italian municipalities enjoy total autonomy in the urban management this led to a chaotic over urbanization at odds with public interest regarding environmental and urban quality romano et al 2017 confirming the elusiveness of past planning strategies in italy to achieve both the objective of no zero net land uptake by 2050 and the sdgs european commission 2011 martellozzo et al 2018 however both total niv and niv at pnv scale vary under the three scenarios highlighting how different planning strategies i e location of constraints affect the spatial distribution of lulcc and in turn lead to different impacts on hq the different impact in terms of niv of the three scenarios can be indeed explained by the location of the constraints and their effect on spatial arrangement of projected lulcc a concentrated urban expansion is particularly visible for dm scenario in the rome municipality where new built up areas tend to fill the existing gaps represented by arable lands in 2008 in line with what was already observed for the 1990 2008 period quatrini et al 2015 this urban densification reduced the impact on hq with respect to the other scenarios particularly in toak and plan lower niv despite the similar projected magnitude of urban expansion respect to bau and n2k in general dm strategy resulted more performing for pnv with lower hq in 2008 i e psam plans evrg toak where constraints were located to limit further degradation as demonstrated by bau projection this is particularly relevant in coastal psam and plain ecosystems plan as well as forest ecosystems dominated by quercus pubescens and q virgiliana toak where conservation actions are urgently required due to the unsustainable anthropic pressures capotorti et al 2012 therefore in those highly threatened ecosystems increasing forest coverage represents a valuable restoration option to enhance biodiversity conservation and es provisioning endreny et al 2017 moreover the identification of such areas is particularly relevant in italy where the increase of forest coverage was also elected as a key climate change mitigation strategy marchetti et al 2019 salbitano and sanesi 2019 furthermore dm was effective in protecting ecological units with limited extent but many habitats and species of high conservation interests heavily threatened by future development activities i e psam including the implementation of recovery and restoration strategies these findings are consistent with he et al 2017 which show how the degrading impacts of urbanization could be weakened increase in hq projecting a scenario that impedes urban sprawl while also meeting the development demands in contrast the approach proposed in the dm scenario is opposite to the hypothesis e g by liu et al 2017 that the protection of high hq areas may represent a valuable strategy for hampering the impact of urban expansion at the municipal scale in fact the effectiveness of protecting areas with the highest hq values might not always be the optimal solution when passing from the municipal to the regional scale where i areas with the highest hq values often coincide with natural and seminatural ecosystems less impacted by threats e g national and regional parks sallustio et al 2017 ii development interests are concentrated around areas with relatively lower hq values due to the already high pressure of roads network and urban areas i e real estate investment quatrini et al 2015 for instance on a coarse scale urban expansion mainly affects lowlands with hq values lower than mountain areas sallustio et al 2017 conversely the n2k scenario minimized the impacts on hq in pnv mainly covered by natural and seminatural land uses with high hq values i e mixm bchf and hydr and high incidence of natura 2000 sites the application of constraints to halt lulcc in natura 2000 sites is particularly important due to the higher pressure of urban and agricultural patches on natural ones with respect to other types of protected areas i e national parks sallustio et al 2017 accordingly the implementation of a specific planning strategy aimed at protecting habitats from anthropic pressures is confirmed as a key action for biodiversity conservation in the study area and possibly replicable at national scale moreover further management and conservation efforts can ameliorate the effectiveness of such an approach through protecting areas surrounding natura 2000 sites especially when located in highly diversified landscapes extremely permeable to threats maiorano et al 2006 the lower impacts of alternative strategies n2k and dm scenarios on hq with respect to bau as well as their combination in the best scenario confirmed the essential role of regulatory tools acting on the arrangement of urban expansion to avoid habitat loss and fragmentation of natural and seminatural ecosystems amato et al 2015 while some authors already demonstrated how the ecological consequences of urban expansion are strongly related to the previous land use e g pickett et al 2008 it can be added that also the alteration of landscape configuration matters in terms of biodiversity conservation especially as regards structural and functional connectivity capotorti et al 2016 pirnat and hladnik 2016 similarly to the anthropogenic gradient affecting impact of the urban expansion on carbon loss reported by sallustio et al 2015 the presented findings confirmed a comparable trend for hq therefore the claim for which the higher the original naturalness of the territory the higher the carbon loss should be expanded to hq as a proxy for biodiversity conservation as a whole accordingly the proposed results are in line with the opportunity to build planning strategies towards a more nature friendly landscape matrix this would help to satisfy human needs but at a smaller cost on natural system through orienting future trajectories towards the so called working landscapes kremen and merenlender 2018 in this sense the combination of different strategies starting from their ecological performance within ecological units i e pnv would seem to be promising in ameliorating the effectiveness of planning instruments at both regional and sub regional scales in heterogeneous contexts furthermore the possibility to combine anthropogenic and ecological perspectives could be a concrete solution towards a comprehensive of sustainable principles into urban planning ferrari et al 2019 4 2 pros cons and future perspectives of the proposed methodological framework the combination of lulcc scenarios and spatially explicit hq model has proven to be effective to localize the different planning priorities throughout the territory and to identify the main threats for biodiversity sun et al 2019 both at regional and sub regional scale indeed frameworks that are unrelated or are weakly related to landscape variability would not offer these benefits gallant et al 2004 moreover the application of the invest habitat quality model was already proven to be particularly effective for solving spatial incongruities between urban development and ecological conservation e g liu et al 2017 even when expert based approaches are implemented in contexts characterized by poor data availability quality di febbraro et al 2018 sharma et al 2018 regarding the scenario modeling the parameterization of a flexible tool as scenario generator through studying past lulcc dynamics using inventory data has proven to be particularly promising indeed past lulcc inventory data have higher availability and accuracy as well as limited costs and time of realization with respect to mapping approaches sallustio et al 2016 accordingly the approach is suitable to be reproduced in contexts with poor data availability and budgetary constraints that might hamper the implementation of systematic conservation planning processes margules and pressey 2000 at the same time the proposed approach is promising to be implemented within participatory land planning arenas accastello et al 2019 the parameterization of the bau scenario based on past lulcc and the immediate visualization of its impacts on biodiversity conservation can represent a valuable starting point to open up the discussion among the different stakeholders on alternative strategies to orient land planning and local development kok et al 2007 accordingly stakeholders can immediately see possible impacts of alternative planning strategies and then suggest improvements that can be managed by modifying drivers factors and constraints location the proposed methodological framework might contribute to the general issue of fostering the operationalization of es into real decision making contexts through i overcoming limitations related to high data cost time demanding approaches not necessarily adherent with specific local issues and constraints e g technical monetary institutional bull et al 2016 ii showing quantitative and spatial potential consequences for biodiversity conservation of alternative strategies using maps and indexes iii creating confidence and discussion among decision makers around ecological issues often neglected ruckelshaus et al 2015 all these aspects create fertile grounds for a participative land planning arena fostering deliberativeness and cohesion within decision makers and local communities able to enhance the overall societal acceptance as well as the effectiveness of conservation strategies and sustainable land planning in general accastello et al 2019 kohler et al 2017 although the methodological framework based on the combination of scenario and es modeling produced relevant findings some limitations were raised deserving future studies and in depth analysis technical limitations are mainly related to the low thematic resolution of the land use maps i e a limited number of land use classes that could oversimplify landscape and ecological complexity especially in heterogeneous contexts blasi et al 2017 sallustio et al 2017 for instance the parameterization of habitat quality model using the same input values of habitat suitability and threats for different land uses e g different forest types and structure might represent an oversimplification not suitable when passing from regional to local scale i e municipal planning where a finer thematic detail and model parameterization is a key factor for a robust and reliable assessment di febbraro et al 2018 analogously using the same parameterization of the habitat quality model neglecting the different impacts that the same lulcc phenomenon can exert to different ecosystems might generate planning errors if not properly treated specifically in this study an hq increase is always associated with forest expansion although this can be a generally accepted hypothesis several studies and evidences rely on the importance of maintaining open areas grasslands and specific endemism particularly relevant for biodiversity conservation and currently threatened by trees encroachment e g pornaro et al 2013 even being conscious of this limitation considering that the study is not focused on a single species or species specific aspects but to the comparison of hq impacts under different land use planning scenarios even according to e g di febbraro et al 2018 and terrado et al 2016 findings the results obtained by an expert based parameterization approach actually represent a valuable surrogate tool for preliminary and or exploratory studies conversely when passing to local scale planning or facing species specific conservation issues in depth analysis based on the implementation of alternative modeling and parameterization approaches majorly fitting to the context specific planning issues should be preferred i e correlative vs expert based approaches di febbraro et al 2018 accordingly while niv can be used as a quick cost effective and easy to use index to evaluate the impact of different planning strategies on biodiversity its use should further explored and supported by further in depth ecological modeling approaches and species specific analyses able to better take into account specific and context related issues a last limitation is related to the impossibility of the scenario generator tool to selectively project stop a single lulcc phenomenon as it usually happens in the real world 5 conclusions even being conscious of these limitations as well as that the depicted scenarios are not predictions findings here obtained provide coherent pictures of alternative futures that may help to identify planning strategies able to reduce impacts of future lulcc kubiszewski et al 2017 sandhu et al 2018 schuwirth et al 2019 particularly the approach proposed in this work highlighted that i

24631,land use and land cover changes lulcc are recognized among the main drivers affecting biodiversity and ecosystem services especially in areas with high biophysical and socioeconomic heterogeneity the need to find optimal planning solutions to combine human and natural systems still remains an open issue this study aims to investigate how different planning strategies affecting the spatial arrangement of lulcc can produce different impacts in terms of ecosystem conditions in the lazio region central italy starting from the same lulcc magnitude observed in the past through an inventory approach three different future scenarios to 2030 were depicted by means of the invest tool scenario generator the business as usual bau and alternatively one avoiding changes within the natura 2000 sites n2k and another within the regional most degraded municipalities dm the ecological impacts of these scenarios were then assessed using the invest habitat quality model adopting habitat quality hq as a proxy for biodiversity in order to characterize lulcc impacts at multiple scales the assessment was carried out both at the regional level and within distinct ecological units independently from the spatial arrangement of projected lulcc hq decreased under all three scenarios nonetheless hq values varied among scenarios highlighting a strict relationship between the spatial arrangement and the ecological impact of lulcc compared to bau alternative scenarios as well as their combination into a best scenario reduced negative impacts on hq these results highlighted the weak sustainability of pursuing with past urban planning strategies while allowed to foster innovative planning approaches to mitigate habitats loss and degradation the proposed methodology was effective to localize the conservation priorities as well as ameliorating the reliability of planning strategies based on their ecological performance furthermore it supports the resolution of planning conflicts between contrasting demands e g urban expansion vs biodiversity conservation thus enhancing simultaneous benefits for both nature and people keywords land use change invest land use planning biodiversity conservation habitat quality 1 introduction landscape changes associated with exponential population growth currently pose major societal and environmental challenges shaker 2015 indeed land use and land cover changes lulcc are recognized among the main drivers affecting biodiversity and ecosystem services es verburg et al 2015 the negative impacts of lulcc are substantially due to habitats loss and destruction direct effect or habitats fragmentation and degradation indirect effect altering in turn the spatial configuration of ecosystems haddad et al 2015 several studies focused on lulcc drivers flows and ecological impacts lambin and meyfroidt 2011 vitousek et al 2008 since they affect the condition of ecosystems i e the capacity to provide multiple es supporting biodiversity and human well being european commission 2018 particularly the mediterranean region is one of the most significantly altered biodiversity hotspots in the world falcucci et al 2007 where lulcc are affecting traditional landscapes and related biodiversity camarretta et al 2018 malandra et al 2018 as an example in italy recent investigations showed that the biophysical variability of territories combined with socioeconomic aspects strongly affect the spatial location of different lulcc along both latitudinal and altitudinal gradients blasi et al 2017 capotorti et al 2012 marchetti et al 2017 the high rate of land take romano and zullo 2014 and agricultural intensification in lowlands and along the coasts are counterbalanced by land abandonment and subsequent forest expansion in the southern part of the peninsula as well as in mountain and economically marginal areas malandra et al 2018 in this regard there is a globally growing interest in how to enhance land planning reducing impacts on biodiversity and es sharma et al 2018 in this context lulcc scenarios play important roles concerning the major phases of the agenda setting brown et al 2013 representing valuable tools to better understand relationships between nature and human driven processes of changes for example a business as usual scenario represents a future with no interventions in the agenda setting this projection represents the starting point in which stakeholders and policymakers can hypothesize alternative strategies i e intervention scenarios and explore the potential impacts with respect both to the present and to the business as usual scenario kok et al 2007 van vliet and kok 2013 according to the phase and the aim of the decision making processes different modeling approaches can be used to project future changes i e machine learning cellular automata economic models agents based brown et al 2013 with various strengths and weaknesses ipbes 2016 for example the research of martellozzo et al 2018 focuses on the implications of lulcc projection on agriculture and natural lands under different policy oriented scenarios using a combination of multi criteria analysis and cellular automata ca model i e sleuth chaudhuri and clarke 2013 their analysis enables precisely the foresee of the spatial effects of current lulcc trends while requiring a robust dataset to calibrate the model chaudhuri and clarke 2013 martellozzo et al 2018 conversely there are some more user friendly approaches less data demanding and particularly appropriate to explore stakeholders visions or their uncertainties regarding the future rather than its strict prediction e g the invest software platform berg et al 2016 for example sharma et al 2018 run invest tools for modeling alternative scenarios expansion of exploitative land uses vs protection of natural ones and to assess their effects on biodiversity in developing countries like indonesia with usually limited data availability indeed alternative scenarios are generally built under both conservative and development approaches e g nelson et al 2009 to guide planning and identifying trade offs between es and economic benefits sandhu et al 2018 however the impacts on biodiversity and es are not only influenced by the magnitude of lulcc but they can also vary according to the spatial configuration of these changes schulp et al 2016 the influence of the spatial configuration of lulcc is particularly relevant in heterogeneous landscapes than homogeneous ones due to the increased difficulty to spatially identify and quantify both their dynamics and impacts gallant et al 2004 furthermore the heterogeneity of landscapes combined with the mismatch between administrative and ecological boundaries increases the complexity of decision making gallant et al 2004 quinn and wood 2017 reducing the effectiveness in reaching multiple targets i e economic development vs biodiversity conservation nelson et al 2008 2009 therefore to address this challenge many authors suggested a spatial stratification of the whole territory into functional subunits mart√≠nez fern√°ndez et al 2015 depending on the research question or policy issue this stratification was conducted by using ecoregions e g gallant et al 2004 zimmermann et al 2010 soilscapes e g rivieccio et al 2017 biophysical land units smiraglia et al 2013 anthromes e g gibson and quinn 2017 or potential natural vegetation pnv zerbe 1998 pnv played an important role in european landscape planning ricotta et al 2002 zerbe 1998 especially in italy pnv units were used for setting up an ecological framework to promote green infrastructure for the national ecosystems mapping and their conservation status assessment and the identification of restoration priorities capotorti et al 2015 2020a actually as detailed ecological settings within wider ecoregions they are increasingly being adopted in strategical analyses and regulations spanning from the annual reports on natural capital which should inform the national budget law and reform plan incc 2017 to the national strategy for the urban green which should guide sustainable development within the cities capotorti et al 2020b however the assessment of the spatial variability of potential lulcc within the pnv and the subsequent designing of regional spatial planning based on these units to reduce the impacts on ecosystems is still missing accordingly this study aims to test the effectiveness of alternative planning strategies in terms of biodiversity conservation through the implementation of a scenario based approach combined with a spatially explicit assessment of habitats condition the main objective is testing whether only changing the spatial location of future lulcc the overall negative impact on biodiversity can be reduced starting from a business as usual scenario two alternative scenarios depicting antithetical planning options were developed i e preservation of areas already designed for habitat and species conservation or preservation of already degraded areas and their effectiveness was tested through combining two invest tools integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs sharp et al 2018 future lulcc and their impacts were analysed at both regional and sub regional scales in order to i better characterize the ecological consequences of lulcc on different ecological units ii evaluate if the combination between planning strategies showing fewer impacts at the sub regional scale is effective in ameliorating the cumulative impacts throughout the region the methodological framework here proposed is valuable to support land planning strategies through evaluating their ecological performance as well as offering a theoretical and technical support for the resolution of future spatial disparities between urban development and nature conservation in human dominated and biophysically heterogeneous contexts 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the lazio region is located in central italy spanning across 17 242 km2 and with a population of 5 8 million people in 2020 75 of whom in the metropolitan city of rome capital http dati istat it fig 1 a the region straddles between the apennine ecoregional sector in the inland with a temperate climate and the tyrrhenian ecoregional sector along the coast with mediterranean and sub mediterranean climatic conditions blasi et al 2018 2014 as shown in fig 1b the former sector is mainly dominated by natural and semi natural vegetation i e forests and grasslands and it is currently suffering a decrease in population that is typical of the inner areas marchetti et al 2017 conversely the second one is mainly dominated by croplands and built up areas due to orographic and pedological factors as well as to the presence of the metropolitan area of rome which tends to polarize both the urban and economic growth of the region fiorini et al 2011 sallustio et al 2015 this biophysical heterogeneity combined with anthropic drivers determines the spatial distribution of current vegetation land uses and their trends over time smiraglia et al 2013 2 2 methodological framework the present study is based on the assumption that past lulcc will continue in the next future with the same magnitude but with possible changes in their spatial allocation as a result of different planning strategies for this reason lulcc occurred in the lazio region from 1990 to 2008 were analysed using the italian land use inventory iuti corona et al 2012 and then projected to 2030 by using the invest tool scenario generator sharp et al 2018 three alternative scenarios were depicted the business as usual scenario bau represents the continuation of the same magnitude and spatial arrangement of the lulcc occurred in the 1990 2008 time period i e no intervention scenario then the same magnitude but with different lulcc allocation were projected under two alternative scenarios i the n2k where lulcc were not allowed within natura2000 sites i e areas designed for conservation of biodiversity values and ii the dm where lulcc were not allowed within the municipalities mostly threatened by anthropic sources of degradation for biodiversity until 2008 after that the impacts of lulcc on biodiversity under the three scenarios at 2030 were assessed using habitat quality hq as a proxy for biodiversity strongly linked to landscape configuration di febbraro et al 2018 the ecosystem mapping approach proposed by blasi et al 2017 for the national scale was used in this work to analyze lulcc and their impact by taking into account the biophysical heterogeneity of the study area consistently with the rationale that the combination of potential natural vegetation pnv and land use maps is a proxy for outlining ecosystems accordingly pnv types of the lazio region were derived from a generalization of the map of the vegetation series according to the physiognomic and structural characteristics of the respective mature stages blasi 2010 blasi et al 2017 potential impacts of expected lulcc on hq were assessed within each of the following 8 pnv types of the lazio region fig 2 psammophilous vegetation of the coasts psam meso hygrophilous vegetation of the plains plan evergreen forests evrg thermophilous oak forests toak mixed mesophilous forests mixm beech forests bchf high altitude shrublands shrb and hydrophytic vegetation hydr finally the scenarios showing the lowest impact on hq for each of the pnv types were selected and merged to create an optimized scenario at the regional scale best scenario fig 3 2 2 1 scenario generator the experimental tool scenario generator invest 3 4 1 was used to depict the three alternative scenarios represented by respective 2030 land use maps sharp et al 2018 the conversion of each pixel to another land use class is estimated by its suitability to conversion based on i the current land use i e basemap 2008 ii the past trends of lulcc and related flows in the study area i e transition matrix and iii the driving factors influencing the different lulcc the 2008 land use map of lazio https dati lazio it with a spatial resolution of 20 m was used as current land use basemap and the original legend was reclassified into 8 land use classes namely built up areas arable lands permanent crops forests other wooded lands grassland and pastures wetlands and water bodies other lands fig 1b the transition matrix pontius et al 2004 which contains the likelihood of different conversions from one land use class to another can occur in the future according to past trends was derived by means of the italian land use inventory iuti corona et al 2012 iuti adopts a statistical sampling procedure to estimate the area covered by land use categories in italy and associated uncertainty estimates besides the statistical accuracy iuti detects lulcc in italy with a spatial resolution of 0 5 ha thus allowing to consider even those changes that are usually neglected by large scale mapping initiatives such as corine land cover map in eu iuti was firstly used to estimate lulcc rates and flows among the different classes from 1990 to 2008 and to analyze the weight of the different driving factors on lulcc flows through time while the transition matrix provides the number of pixels to be converted from one land use to another i e magnitude of lulcc flows the driving factors provide the suitability of the single pixels to be converted thus a higher conversion priority was assigned to the pixels that based on the co occurrence of driving factors showed higher suitability of conversion from one land use type to another the total number of pixels converted is reached following a descending order of suitability thus starting from those with high values of suitability to those with lower values the considered driving factors are altitude slope distance from built up areas population density and distance from the roads see tab s4 s5 in supplementary materials for further details furthermore scenario generator allows the setting of limiting factors namely constraints as portions of the territory where all lulcc are not allowed according to the normative framework in this work the spatial allocation of constraints was modified to depict plausible effects of alternative planning strategies i e n2k and dm scenarios 2 2 2 habitat quality assessment the invest habitat quality model was used for mapping and assessing potential impacts of lulcc on biodiversity it is a spatially explicit model that uses hq as a proxy for biodiversity associated with different land use classes sharp et al 2018 this approach is particularly useful for an initial spatial assessment of the ecosystem status and its possible changes through time as reported by terrado et al 2016 the model is based on the hypothesis that areas with higher hq support higher richness of native species and that decreases in habitat extent and quality lead to a decline in species persistence hq is directly related to the suitability of each land use class to provide habitats for biodiversity this initial suitability value ranging from 0 no suitability to 1 maximum suitability leh et al 2013 is further affected by three main factors related to singular threats such as i the relative sensitivity of each land use class to each threat i e roads railways and built up areas ii the relative impact of each threat and iii the distance between land use class and threats six threats were used and parameterized according to sallustio et al 2017 and by combining the data two maps showing hq and habitat degradation hd were produced both maps show values ranging from 0 to 1 following an increasing gradient of hq or hd respectively considering the proposed parameterization forest expansion is associated with an increase in hq while urban expansion is associated with its decrease furthermore the hq decline is directly affected by lulcc dynamics via land use substitution e g change from agriculture to built up as well as by the effect of new threats e g new built up areas in the surrounding land uses 2 2 3 scenarios building three alternative planning strategies were designed to project three lulcc scenarios with a fixed magnitude but different spatial allocations the first is the business as usual bau scenario which would occur if the past 1990 2008 lulcc magnitude flows and spatial arrangement are assumed to persist in the future the strategy of the n2k scenario aims to stop future lulcc at the expense of community interest species and habitats as defined by the habitats and birds european directives council directive 92 43 eec and directive 2009 147 ec respectively accordingly changes within the natura 2000 sites which stretch for 400 000 ha in the lazio region were blocked through defining them as constraints in the scenario generator tool conversely the strategy of the dm scenario aims to stop future lulcc in areas with high hd in 2008 due to the coexistence of several threats thus lulcc within the municipalities showing the highest average values of hd in 2008 were blocked through defining them as constraints in the scenario generator tool see table s6 in supplementary materials for the list of the municipalities and their average hd in order to be consistent with the n2k scenario lulcc were blocked until an overall area of 400 000 assuming as stable the magnitude of future lulcc while stopping their flows within the constrained areas implies that the overall amount of projected lulcc for n2k and dm scenarios is allocated in a more restricted area with respect to bau where no constraints or spatial limitations were imposed hq was assessed and mapped for the 2008 basemap as well as for the three 2030 alternative scenarios changes in hq from 2008 to 2030 were then assessed by pairwise map comparisons in a gis environment esri arcgis to calculate the net impact value niv fig 3 resulting from the difference between hq values at 2030 with those at 2008 niv for each pixel can vary from 1 i e hq at 2030 is lower than its value at 2008 to 1 i e hq at 2030 is higher than its value at 2008 niv is then negative when lulcc occurring during the 2008 2030 period imply a reduction of the hq values e g decrease of the biodiversity status while positive when they imply an increase of hq values e g increase of the biodiversity status moreover niv tends to decrease as the negative impacts of lulcc are emphasized and vice versa after that both positive and negative changes calculated within every pixel were summed up within each of the eight pnv and through the region to calculate the total niv of the three alternative scenarios niv associated to the three alternative scenarios were compared within each pnv to identify strategies showing the best performance in terms of impacts on hq from 2008 to 2030 the land use maps related to the scenarios with the best performance in terms of niv for each pnv were then selected and merged into a unique layer hereafter named best scenario 3 results 3 1 lulcc scenarios at 2030 consistently with the past trends occurred in the 1990 2008 period urban expansion is the predominant process projected for the 2008 2030 period 39 007 ha table 1 fig 4 indeed in all scenarios built up areas increase by 31 with respect to their coverage in 2008 and exclusively at the expense of arable lands both forests and permanent crops gain 5 at the expense of other wooded lands and arable lands respectively other wooded lands simultaneously gain surfaces from arable lands grasslands and pastures and lose them to forests with a net decrease of about 23 000 ha this is mainly due to the fact that other wooded lands often represent a transitional class establishing after agricultural abandonment with shrubs encroachment but naturally evolving towards forests stands over time despite the projected magnitude is the same under the three scenarios the different spatial location of the constraints determined differences in the distribution of lulcc throughout the region fig 5 and within the different pnv table 2 in absolute terms the majority of lulcc are expected within toak and mixm for all the scenarios due to their wide extent together about 70 of the region particular emphasis was found for urban expansion in toak 55 59 and 58 of the total phenomenon for bau n2k and dm scenarios respectively despite the similar magnitude of the phenomenon among the three scenarios the difference in land availability for urban expansion due to different incidence of constraints within the pnv determined a spread over the whole toak territory in bau while urban expansion was blocked on 13 and 35 of its extent in n2k and dm scenarios respectively as a consequence urban expansion tended to assume different spatial configuration from less to more concentrated passing from bau to n2k and dm fig 5 a similar emphasis was found for forest and other wooded lands expansion considering that 65 of the phenomenon occurred in mixm differently from urban expansion this expansion resulted more compact in n2k than dm due to the higher incidence of constraints in n2k the expansion of permanent crops is quite evenly distributed among three pnv in the bau scenario 35 of the whole phenomenon both for toak and mixm and 24 for plan while it tends to be more polarized in toak and mixm for n2k and dm scenarios however the relatively limited magnitude of this phenomenon did not allow distinguishing clear alternative trends according to the different scenarios four pnv namely psam shrb hydr and bchf are characterized by small lulcc in absolute terms expected until 2030 urban and permanent crops expansions are not at all expected in the last three pnv while forest and other wooded lands expansions are expected in bchf but not in psam moreover it is relevant to highlight that urban expansion shows particular emphasis in psam for the bau scenario where built up areas raises from 31 to 39 of the pnv 3 2 quantitative impacts of lulcc the projected lulcc resulted in negative total niv i e negative impacts are greater than positives from 2008 to 2030 for all the three scenarios however these values vary with the three different scenarios and pnv bau shows the worst total niv 841 751 while dm scenario shows the best total niv 740 750 table 2 five pnv showed the best niv in the dm scenario psam plans evrg toak and shrb while the remaining three pnv in n2k mixm bchf and hydr future land use maps related to the scenarios with the best niv per each pnv n2k and dm were assembled as a mosaic to create the best scenario land use map in terms of coverage dm and n2k contribute almost equally to create this map respectively 48 and 52 of the region it is important to highlight how even if resulting from the merge of land use maps deriving from two different scenarios the differences in the single lulcc magnitude between best scenario and the other scenarios are negligible i e 2 2 urban expansion and 1 6 forest expansion thus enabling for their comparison the resulting best scenario land use map allowed checking the spatial location of lulcc able to maximize niv both within pnv as well as through the whole region total niv as visible in table 2 running the habitat quality model using the best scenario s land use map as an input the resulting total niv of 724 388 confirms the combination of the two planning strategies as the best performing in terms of hq values it is important to note that regarding to the best scenario three pnv show a relative contribution to total niv higher than their relative contribution to the regional surface this is the case for toak plan and evrg respectively contributing to 44 18 and 9 in terms of total niv against 32 11 and 5 in terms of regional surface conversely mixm and bchf are the pnv with a relative contribution to total niv 26 and 1 respectively lower than their contribution in terms of coverage 42 and 8 respectively furthermore the ratio among niv of the best scenario and the initial hq values in 2008 highlights that pnv with the highest relative decrease are plan psam and toak 10 8 and 7 in best scenario with respect to their hq values in 2008 4 discussion 4 1 lulcc projections to 2030 and their impacts at the regional and pnv scales although forest expansion forecasted to 2030 leads to an increase in hq the positive change is too limited if compared to the decrease in hq caused by urban expansion this is demonstrated by the fact that total niv is always negative under the three scenarios as well as at single pnv scale except for shrb where only forest expansion is expected to occur in the projection period indeed assuming as stable the magnitude of past lullc urban expansion would remain the main lulcc impacting on biodiversity conservation in the study area capotorti et al 2019 frondoni et al 2011 the negatives total niv under the three scenarios depict a generalized decay of hq whereas past lulcc magnitude will persist to the future independently from their spatial configuration under different planning strategies the worst performance was found in bau scenario niv 841 751 it seems consistent with the hypothesis of the generalized poor effectiveness of past municipal city plans in containing lulcc impacts reported by romano et al 2018 according to previous studies this poor effectiveness can be partly ascribable to their poor interconnection at the landscape and regional scale molecular planning romano et al 2019 and ghost planning scorza et al 2020 indeed as shown by romano et al 2018 past national and regional urban policies never really played a strategic control role in influencing local level decision making since italian municipalities enjoy total autonomy in the urban management this led to a chaotic over urbanization at odds with public interest regarding environmental and urban quality romano et al 2017 confirming the elusiveness of past planning strategies in italy to achieve both the objective of no zero net land uptake by 2050 and the sdgs european commission 2011 martellozzo et al 2018 however both total niv and niv at pnv scale vary under the three scenarios highlighting how different planning strategies i e location of constraints affect the spatial distribution of lulcc and in turn lead to different impacts on hq the different impact in terms of niv of the three scenarios can be indeed explained by the location of the constraints and their effect on spatial arrangement of projected lulcc a concentrated urban expansion is particularly visible for dm scenario in the rome municipality where new built up areas tend to fill the existing gaps represented by arable lands in 2008 in line with what was already observed for the 1990 2008 period quatrini et al 2015 this urban densification reduced the impact on hq with respect to the other scenarios particularly in toak and plan lower niv despite the similar projected magnitude of urban expansion respect to bau and n2k in general dm strategy resulted more performing for pnv with lower hq in 2008 i e psam plans evrg toak where constraints were located to limit further degradation as demonstrated by bau projection this is particularly relevant in coastal psam and plain ecosystems plan as well as forest ecosystems dominated by quercus pubescens and q virgiliana toak where conservation actions are urgently required due to the unsustainable anthropic pressures capotorti et al 2012 therefore in those highly threatened ecosystems increasing forest coverage represents a valuable restoration option to enhance biodiversity conservation and es provisioning endreny et al 2017 moreover the identification of such areas is particularly relevant in italy where the increase of forest coverage was also elected as a key climate change mitigation strategy marchetti et al 2019 salbitano and sanesi 2019 furthermore dm was effective in protecting ecological units with limited extent but many habitats and species of high conservation interests heavily threatened by future development activities i e psam including the implementation of recovery and restoration strategies these findings are consistent with he et al 2017 which show how the degrading impacts of urbanization could be weakened increase in hq projecting a scenario that impedes urban sprawl while also meeting the development demands in contrast the approach proposed in the dm scenario is opposite to the hypothesis e g by liu et al 2017 that the protection of high hq areas may represent a valuable strategy for hampering the impact of urban expansion at the municipal scale in fact the effectiveness of protecting areas with the highest hq values might not always be the optimal solution when passing from the municipal to the regional scale where i areas with the highest hq values often coincide with natural and seminatural ecosystems less impacted by threats e g national and regional parks sallustio et al 2017 ii development interests are concentrated around areas with relatively lower hq values due to the already high pressure of roads network and urban areas i e real estate investment quatrini et al 2015 for instance on a coarse scale urban expansion mainly affects lowlands with hq values lower than mountain areas sallustio et al 2017 conversely the n2k scenario minimized the impacts on hq in pnv mainly covered by natural and seminatural land uses with high hq values i e mixm bchf and hydr and high incidence of natura 2000 sites the application of constraints to halt lulcc in natura 2000 sites is particularly important due to the higher pressure of urban and agricultural patches on natural ones with respect to other types of protected areas i e national parks sallustio et al 2017 accordingly the implementation of a specific planning strategy aimed at protecting habitats from anthropic pressures is confirmed as a key action for biodiversity conservation in the study area and possibly replicable at national scale moreover further management and conservation efforts can ameliorate the effectiveness of such an approach through protecting areas surrounding natura 2000 sites especially when located in highly diversified landscapes extremely permeable to threats maiorano et al 2006 the lower impacts of alternative strategies n2k and dm scenarios on hq with respect to bau as well as their combination in the best scenario confirmed the essential role of regulatory tools acting on the arrangement of urban expansion to avoid habitat loss and fragmentation of natural and seminatural ecosystems amato et al 2015 while some authors already demonstrated how the ecological consequences of urban expansion are strongly related to the previous land use e g pickett et al 2008 it can be added that also the alteration of landscape configuration matters in terms of biodiversity conservation especially as regards structural and functional connectivity capotorti et al 2016 pirnat and hladnik 2016 similarly to the anthropogenic gradient affecting impact of the urban expansion on carbon loss reported by sallustio et al 2015 the presented findings confirmed a comparable trend for hq therefore the claim for which the higher the original naturalness of the territory the higher the carbon loss should be expanded to hq as a proxy for biodiversity conservation as a whole accordingly the proposed results are in line with the opportunity to build planning strategies towards a more nature friendly landscape matrix this would help to satisfy human needs but at a smaller cost on natural system through orienting future trajectories towards the so called working landscapes kremen and merenlender 2018 in this sense the combination of different strategies starting from their ecological performance within ecological units i e pnv would seem to be promising in ameliorating the effectiveness of planning instruments at both regional and sub regional scales in heterogeneous contexts furthermore the possibility to combine anthropogenic and ecological perspectives could be a concrete solution towards a comprehensive of sustainable principles into urban planning ferrari et al 2019 4 2 pros cons and future perspectives of the proposed methodological framework the combination of lulcc scenarios and spatially explicit hq model has proven to be effective to localize the different planning priorities throughout the territory and to identify the main threats for biodiversity sun et al 2019 both at regional and sub regional scale indeed frameworks that are unrelated or are weakly related to landscape variability would not offer these benefits gallant et al 2004 moreover the application of the invest habitat quality model was already proven to be particularly effective for solving spatial incongruities between urban development and ecological conservation e g liu et al 2017 even when expert based approaches are implemented in contexts characterized by poor data availability quality di febbraro et al 2018 sharma et al 2018 regarding the scenario modeling the parameterization of a flexible tool as scenario generator through studying past lulcc dynamics using inventory data has proven to be particularly promising indeed past lulcc inventory data have higher availability and accuracy as well as limited costs and time of realization with respect to mapping approaches sallustio et al 2016 accordingly the approach is suitable to be reproduced in contexts with poor data availability and budgetary constraints that might hamper the implementation of systematic conservation planning processes margules and pressey 2000 at the same time the proposed approach is promising to be implemented within participatory land planning arenas accastello et al 2019 the parameterization of the bau scenario based on past lulcc and the immediate visualization of its impacts on biodiversity conservation can represent a valuable starting point to open up the discussion among the different stakeholders on alternative strategies to orient land planning and local development kok et al 2007 accordingly stakeholders can immediately see possible impacts of alternative planning strategies and then suggest improvements that can be managed by modifying drivers factors and constraints location the proposed methodological framework might contribute to the general issue of fostering the operationalization of es into real decision making contexts through i overcoming limitations related to high data cost time demanding approaches not necessarily adherent with specific local issues and constraints e g technical monetary institutional bull et al 2016 ii showing quantitative and spatial potential consequences for biodiversity conservation of alternative strategies using maps and indexes iii creating confidence and discussion among decision makers around ecological issues often neglected ruckelshaus et al 2015 all these aspects create fertile grounds for a participative land planning arena fostering deliberativeness and cohesion within decision makers and local communities able to enhance the overall societal acceptance as well as the effectiveness of conservation strategies and sustainable land planning in general accastello et al 2019 kohler et al 2017 although the methodological framework based on the combination of scenario and es modeling produced relevant findings some limitations were raised deserving future studies and in depth analysis technical limitations are mainly related to the low thematic resolution of the land use maps i e a limited number of land use classes that could oversimplify landscape and ecological complexity especially in heterogeneous contexts blasi et al 2017 sallustio et al 2017 for instance the parameterization of habitat quality model using the same input values of habitat suitability and threats for different land uses e g different forest types and structure might represent an oversimplification not suitable when passing from regional to local scale i e municipal planning where a finer thematic detail and model parameterization is a key factor for a robust and reliable assessment di febbraro et al 2018 analogously using the same parameterization of the habitat quality model neglecting the different impacts that the same lulcc phenomenon can exert to different ecosystems might generate planning errors if not properly treated specifically in this study an hq increase is always associated with forest expansion although this can be a generally accepted hypothesis several studies and evidences rely on the importance of maintaining open areas grasslands and specific endemism particularly relevant for biodiversity conservation and currently threatened by trees encroachment e g pornaro et al 2013 even being conscious of this limitation considering that the study is not focused on a single species or species specific aspects but to the comparison of hq impacts under different land use planning scenarios even according to e g di febbraro et al 2018 and terrado et al 2016 findings the results obtained by an expert based parameterization approach actually represent a valuable surrogate tool for preliminary and or exploratory studies conversely when passing to local scale planning or facing species specific conservation issues in depth analysis based on the implementation of alternative modeling and parameterization approaches majorly fitting to the context specific planning issues should be preferred i e correlative vs expert based approaches di febbraro et al 2018 accordingly while niv can be used as a quick cost effective and easy to use index to evaluate the impact of different planning strategies on biodiversity its use should further explored and supported by further in depth ecological modeling approaches and species specific analyses able to better take into account specific and context related issues a last limitation is related to the impossibility of the scenario generator tool to selectively project stop a single lulcc phenomenon as it usually happens in the real world 5 conclusions even being conscious of these limitations as well as that the depicted scenarios are not predictions findings here obtained provide coherent pictures of alternative futures that may help

24632,plants have evolved different strategies to withstand drought in general these strategies can be defined along a plant economics spectrum which classifies plants depending on whether their growth rate is fast or slow where fast growth is associated with high mortality high water use and high sensitivity to drought which strategy along this economy spectrum will be selected under different precipitation regimes is an open question we address this question with a minimal soil plant model in which a single plant economy trait related to growth rate characterizes the plant strategy this generic and dimensionless trait influences both recruitment and mortality but not background mortality we explore the evolution of this trait by quantifying its effects on birth mortality and transpiration rates furthermore we explore the influence of direct plant density dependence acting on recruitment and mortality in addition to the indirect density dependence caused by plant feedback on soil water content we show that 1 increasingly fast growing plants always evolve under increasing background mortality 2 when soil water only depends on plant density and is independent of precipitation and abiotic water losses the strategy minimizing soil water content is an evolutionarily stable strategy ess i e the evolutionary outcome is a tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 3 when precipitation abiotic water losses and trait dependent transpiration determine soil water content the ess lies between the strategy maximizing plant density and that minimizing soil water content i e no tragedy of the commons occurs 4 with a deterministic precipitation model and density dependence acting directly only on recruitment higher precipitation promotes the evolution of faster plants the opposite result is found when density dependence is acting directly only on mortality 5 similar trends in the economy trait are observed when forcing the model with stochastic precipitation events graphical abstract keywords evolutionarily stable strategy tragedy of the commons soil water content plant economics optimal strategy trait based model 1 introduction droughts have drastic consequences for vegetation which are likely to worsen with ongoing climatic changes allen et al 2010 both lower precipitation and higher temperature are causing increasing aridity leading to mortality of extant species and invasion of more drought tolerant ones allen and breshears 1998 for example 90 mortality was reported for some species in the chaparral shrublands in southern california during the extreme drought from 2012 to 2015 jacobsen and pratt 2018 also the agricultural sector struggles to adapt to the ongoing climate change partly because increasing yield via breeding of drought adapted crops has proved difficult araus et al 2002 a better understanding of plant adaptation to drought is thus a necessary step to i predict which species are more likely to thrive in natural ecosystems and ii predict which traits should be targeted in crop selection plants critically rely on water for their photosynthesis because acquiring co 2 from the atmosphere requires losing water via transpiration through the stomata lawlor and tezara 2009 hsiao 1973 plants have evolved many strategies to maintain hydration and withstand drought such as stomatal control of water losses sclerophyllous leaves high density wood able to withstand cavitation early reproduction time changes in leaf area and deep roots despite these strategies water stress can occur initially reducing plant growth rate later causing hydraulic failure and carbon starvation and ultimately resulting in plant mortality mencuccini et al 2015 the timing of damage depends on the available soil water and how fast it is depleted in turn available soil water depends on the balance of precipitation runoff deep percolation evaporation and transpiration which are mediated by soil properties rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 the main interaction between plants and soil water is through transpiration which is tightly controlled by stomatal regulation and variations in leaf area thus plants control the amount of water they use and different water use strategies may trigger competition when water becomes limiting rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 vico et al 2017 to estimate the transpiration rate per unit ground area for given soil moisture and atmospheric conditions both the transpiration rate per plant which depends on plant species and size wullschleger et al 1998 and the plant population size are needed transpiration varies widely between slow growing drought tolerant species typically conservative water users and fast growing drought intolerant species intensive water users the population size depends on the abiotic factors that constrain net primary productivity such as light intensity soil water content and nutrients but also on plant plant interactions such as resource competition eco evolutionary models by determining the trait values that are evolutionarily selected can describe changes in population size along gradients of water availability and predict how evolution or competition with encroaching species may affect the extant population previous models describing plant adaptation to water limitation range from highly idealized and missing potentially important processes e g no density dependent mortality in zea cabrera et al 2006 to physiologically detailed farrior et al 2013 2015 between these two classes of models there is an open niche for a low complexity model with low calibration data requirements to explore the evolutionary consequences of changes in water availability this low complexity model would be suitable to assess the sensitivity of the evolutionary outcomes to specific choices for the recruitment and mortality functions which has not been assessed so far any model dealing with resource limitation adaptation requires an evolving trait and population dynamics that depends on the evolving trait and the resource availability several functional traits are related to water availability and drought tolerance such as specific leaf area sla seed size height at maturation root to shoot mass ratio sperry et al 1998 leaf to sapwood area ratios mencuccini et al 2019 timing of leaf flush and senescence vico et al 2017 as well as the response of stomata and xylem conductance to changes in water potential manzoni et al 2014 and plant water storage scholz et al 2011 detailed plant eco physiological models use these traits to describe plant growth and water use e g xu et al 2016 feng et al 2018 huang et al 2017 lindh et al 2014 but these models are not amenable for analytical insights on how plants characterized by certain traits might invade an existing community this motivates developing a simpler modelling approach in which a single trait is used to characterize a species the underlying assumption is that variations in this trait capture changes of several coordinated traits that determine the species growth reproduction and responses to stress a similar approach has been used to parameterize predator prey models where the evolving trait affected prey population growth mortality and predation rates e g mendes and faria 2020 however to our knowledge this approach has not been used in models of water limited vegetation we identify this trait as the position of a species along one axis of the plant economy spectrum or analogously along a spectrum of life histories according to the plant economics theory species can be placed along a spectrum from fast to slow growth rates reich 2014 a fast growth rate is correlated to low survival thereby linking the two most vital ingredients in population dynamics birth rate or recruitment and mortality rate the inverse of survival rate furthermore a fast growth rate is also correlated with high resource use in particular water use transpiration in water limited ecosystems the plant economy spectrum theory has later been corroborated by salguero g√≥mez et al 2016 who found that a fast slow growth axis and a high low reproductive trait axis could capture 55 of the global variation in plant traits this study shows that growth rate is a major factor to consider in a one dimensional plant economics theory although not all the trait variability can be captured in this way to determine how the position of plants along the economy spectrum varies with climate via selection of this master trait we developed a minimal model of plant evolution for water limited ecosystems we focus on the response of plant economy to precipitation by comparing a soil water balance model using a deterministic structure with regular water input i e constant drizzle against a model with periodic water input i e more realistic intermittent rain the former approach allows for simple analytical solutions but neglects the variations in soil moisture caused by random precipitation events that impact plant mortality and that are accounted for in the stochastic model we compare optimal strategies maximizing plant density and minimizing soil water content with the evolutionarily stable strategy ess thereby identifying when evolution is optimizing a tragedy of the commons outcome emerges if evolution is minimizing the resource referring to an outcome in game theory when a common resource is used only in the self interest of the players hardin 1968 gersani et al 2001 first we focus on a model where plants are interacting only indirectly through their use of soil water which in turn is determined solely by plant dynamics then we explore the importance of plant density dependence acting directly only on recruitment and mortality in this case water availability is determined jointly by plant density and climatic conditions which is a more accurate representation of soil plant interactions 2 materials and methods a coupled plant population soil water model is developed to describe the evolution of plant traits under different climatic conditions fig 1 the plant model describes the temporal dynamics of the number of individuals rather than the average plant biomass the focus on the number of individuals is motivated by the fact that reproduction is carried out by the individuals and not by the biomass per se though these two metrics are related the rates of birth recruitment mortality and water uptake transpiration depend on an evolving trait x describing plant economics this trait represents a response trait sensu zakharova et al 2019 as it captures the macroscopic behaviour of the plant rather than the underlying physiological mechanisms two types of soil water models are explored one deterministic constant drizzle model and one where the rain events are stochastic in time and intensity the flexibility of the model formulation allows exploring different approaches to link plant traits to recruitment and mortality rates section plant population model and considering either deterministic or stochastic precipitation as driver of soil water dynamics section soil water model we consider the three end member cases 1 plant soil water dynamics independent of precipitation 2 plant soil water dynamics with deterministic constant drizzle precipitation 3 plant soil water dynamics with intermittent precipitation furthermore we studied the effect of density dependence in recruitment and mortality both recruitment and mortality are density dependent in natural forests but the density dependence is modulated by resource competition e g competition for water in dense forests with strong asymmetric competition large individuals have access to larger water volumes recruitment limitation can be expected to be density dependent in contrast in a xeric shrubland we can expect drought and water limitations to cause a high level of adult tree competition for water resulting in density dependent mortality note that density dependent mortality can be implemented in the verhulst equation when the negative term of the population dynamics is increasing with population size all symbols are listed and explained in table 1 and all functions in table 2 2 1 plant population model 2 1 1 dynamical equations as a proxy for the plant growth strategy we define a single evolving functional trait x encompassing multiple plant features representing its position along the plant economy spectrum e g sla for simplicity x is referred to as economy trait throughout the paper with reference to plant economics theory reich 2014 low values of x indicate a slow growing plant with low recruitment mortality and transpiration conversely high values of x identify fast growing plants with high mortality and water use all plants are assumed to be of the same size i e ontogenetic growth and size distribution are not modelled moreover we model plant recruitment rather than birth rate since a large number of seeds and seedlings may never germinate the model is designed to describe plant populations in semiarid ecosystems where plants compete for a common and limited water resource e g tropical dry forests and is based on the following assumptions on the relations between plant density n and soil water content w 1 recruitment rate is zero at w 0 2 recruitment rate saturates at high w 3 mortality is positive and non zero at w 0 4 mortality levels off to zero or to a constant background mortality m b at high w 5 water uptake rate transpiration is proportional to plant density n the normalized and non dimensional population density n is described as a function of per capita recruitment f and mortality g by the ordinary differential equation 1 d n d t f x n w n g x n w n which is coupled to the soil water dynamics through w the normalized plant density n 0 1 can be related to the actual plant density data n number of individuals per unit area by setting n n n m a x where n m a x is the maximum value in the data the recruitment rate per individual f x n w depends on plant density n and soil water content w 2 f x n w a x w b x w n s the recruitment rate saturates at a maximum value a x n s which simplifies to a x when s 0 here b x is the half saturation constant for recruitment rate with respect to w the direct density dependence of n is controlled by the exponent s assumed to be either s 0 no direct density dependence or s 1 negative effect of n on recruitment the plant mortality rate g x n w is assumed to decrease with increasing soil water content 3 g x n w c x d x w n q m b where the trait x affects mortality through both the asymptotic mortality rate c x n q which simplifies to c x if q 0 and the half saturation constant d x density dependence is controlled by the exponent q in n q which is assumed to have values of either q 0 or q 1 leading to a linear or quadratic mortality term respectively the background mortality m b is related to disturbances other than water stress e g storms fires pests or pathogens and as such is independent of w and x when both recruitment and mortality are linear functions of n s q 0 as shown in section 3 1 the dynamics of soil water are decoupled from precipitation which implies that precipitation and water loss are not influencing the plant dynamics model variants a and b presented in section 2 5 in contrast when s 1 and or q 1 plant and soil water dynamics are fully coupled leading to a more complex and realistic model model variant c 2 1 2 plant trait influence on recruitment and mortality for simplicity we restrict a b c and d to constant or monotonically increasing power functions of the economy trait x expressed in the form p x k i x e i with i a b c d with e i 0 we obtain a constant function p k i whereas e i 1 yields a linear function p k i x for mathematical convenience the values of x are regarded as dimensionless and we assume that x 1 when fitting the recruitment and mortality rates to observed tree densities along a moisture gradient in a tropical dry forest supporting information s4 the trait x controls f x n w and g x n w as illustrated in fig 2 see fig 1 2 2 soil water model 2 2 1 constant drizzle precipitation for simplicity we first assume that precipitation p is time invariant i e a constant drizzle abiotic water losses evaporation percolation and runoff follow a first order function with rate constant v and transpiration rate y x n depends only on plant density n and the economy trait x via the per capita transpiration rate y x when relative volumetric soil moisture ranges between field capacity s f c and wilting point s w these two extreme values of soil moisture allow defining the soil water storage capacity u n z r s f c s w with n being soil porosity under these assumptions the soil water balance averaged over the rooting depth z r is written in terms of a water volume per unit ground area as rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 4 u d w d t p v w y x n where w represents the plant available water and is normalized between 0 at the plant wilting point and 1 at saturation it is now convenient to re write the soil water balance in non dimensional form by normalizing all fluxes as p p u v v u and y x y x u per capita normalized transpiration rate 5 d w d t p v w y x n the term v w represents a combination of water losses via runoff percolation and evaporation from the soil surface runoff and percolation should be modelled as nonlinear functions of soil moisture as they are largest near saturation or in case of runoff when rainfall exceeds infiltration capacity see section intermittent precipitation but to retain analytical tractability this water loss rate is assumed to be a linear function of soil moisture with a proportionality constant v water exceeding the soil storage capacity is assumed to be leave the system as runoff i e w is bound to one the transpiration rate can be described as a function of soil water content e g rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 but here for simplicity we assume that transpiration is only a function of plant density n and the trait x and that transpiration stops when the wilting point is reached e g milly 1993 guswa 2008 the dependence of transpiration on plant density is motivated by the observation that in water limited environments transpiration scales with leaf area goldstein et al 2008 bucci et al 2008 which in our simplified framework is proportional to plant density following this simplification and assuming as before a power law effect of x the per capita transpiration rate is defined as 6 y x k y x e y where the k y is estimated from data and the exponent e y 1 4 is chosen such that y x is less sensitive to the trait value at high x 2 2 2 intermittent precipitation for a more realistic representation of precipitation we now consider the case of intermittent stochastic precipitation occurrences following rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 precipitation p is described as a marked poisson process with mean frequency Œª and rainfall depths extracted from an exponential distribution with mean Œ± the stochastic nature of precipitation results in a distribution of soil moisture values which can be calculated analytically thus the plant population growth and mortality vary depending on the mean soil moisture value attained under a given density n the mean soil moisture also varies in response to the population temporal evolution due to the coupling of plant density and transpiration rate eq 5 following rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 the mean soil water content is found as 7 w x n 1 Œ∑ x n Œ≥ Œª Œ∑ x n Œ≥ Œª Œ∑ x n Œ≥ Œª Œ∑ x n Œ≥ Œª Œ∑ x n Œ≥ e Œ≥ where Œ∑ x n is the transpiration rate normalized by the water storage capacity i e Œ∑ y x n u y x n Œ≥ is the inverse of the mean rainfall depth normalized by the water storage capacity Œ≥ u Œ± Œ≥ is the gamma function and Œ≥ is the incomplete gamma function in this model the total precipitation rate is given by the product of mean rain event frequency Œª and mean rain depth per event Œ± so different rainfall scenarios can be considered by independently changing Œª and Œ± as in the constant drizzle model we assume that the transpiration rate is proportional to plant density and is constant with soil moisture between the field capacity and the wilting point so that Œ∑ x n y x n where y x is defined in eq 6 as a result w in eq 7 becomes a function of both n and x w w x n at equilibrium where d n d t 0 the equation for population dynamics eq 1 yields a relation n n x w solving numerically the system of equations n n x w and w w x n we can find the equilibrium state for any given strategy x denoted by w and n 2 3 evolutionary invasion analysis and optimal strategies the invasion fitness s is defined as the mutant population growth per capita according to the framework of adaptive dynamics geritz et al 1998 the s for a rare mutant strategy x is analysed at the ecological equilibrium w where the resident strategy x population is also at equilibrium n in such conditions the invasion fitness is defined as the per capita growth rate of a mutant strategy x in an environment at equilibrium n x w x produced by the resident strategy x fig 1 8 s x x 1 n d n d t n w where n n x w w x a singular point x is defined where the invasion fitness is zero i e d s d x 0 when x x if the sign of the second derivative of s is negative in the singular point we have an evolutionary stable strategy ess i e d s 2 d x 2 x x x 0 the ess is defined as convergence stable if d 2 s d x 2 x x x d 2 s d x 2 x x x in the following we focus our analysis on ess because we did not find any branching points i e evolutionary divergence points geritz et al 1998 note that the ess is a result of competition between strategies but there is no way to know how long time it takes to reach the ess unless genetic details such as mutation rates are known dieckmann and law 1996 the ess can be used to study trends resulting from climate change under the assumption that evolution or plant community composition changes are faster than climate change johansson and jonz√©n 2012 in addition to the ess black solid curves in the figures in results we can define two additional optimal strategies by randomly extracting values of x between zero and one we find those values that maximize plant density n denoted as plant density maximum strategy green dashed curves we use the same method to obtain values of x that cause soil water content to be minimized denoted as the soil water minimum strategy purple dashed curves 2 4 model parameterization details on the model parameterization can be found in supporting information s4 and here only a short summary is provided plant recruitment and mortality are parameterized based on data collected in a tropical dry forest by chaturvedi et al 2017 soil properties are also selected based for the sandy soil typical of that forest precipitation rate and characteristics Œª and Œ± and abiotic water loss rate are varied to assess how the trait x varies in response to changes in climate parameter values are listed in table 1 2 5 roadmap for analysis of model results the proposed model includes a number of parameters and exponents that can change the dynamics of soil moisture and population density and thus the occurrence of equilibrium points and ess the exponents of the relationships between rate constants and trait x e i with i a b c d y and the exponents s and q controlling density dependencies in the recruitment and mortality functions eqs 2 and 3 respectively are allowed to vary to proceed in a systematic way we first explored different combinations of the values of e i exponents in minimal models where recruitment and mortality were linear functions of plant density i e no density dependencies and s q 0 referred to as models a and b these minimal models are simple enough to allow insights on the emergence of ess from analytical results second we selected linear relations between rate constants and trait x i e e i 1 except for e d 0 and e y 1 4 and assessed the effects of density dependencies in the mortality s 0 q 1 and recruitment functions s 1 q 0 resulting in model c this is a more realistic and dynamically rich model that offers insights of more general applicability than the minimal models a and b model c is applied under both the constant drizzle and the stochastic precipitation scenarios to summarize the model variants used in our analyses are as follows see resulting recruitment and mortality functions in fig 2 model a e a e c 0 e b 2 and e d 1 no direct density dependence on recruitment and mortality s q 0 supporting information s1 model b e a e b 2 e c 1 and e d 0 no direct density dependence on recruitment and mortality s q 0 section 3 1 fig 3 model c e a e b e c 1 and e d 0 with direct density dependence on recruitment s 1 q 0 or mortality s 0 q 1 section 3 2 figs 4 5 see also supporting information s2 s3 model c is also analysed under both constant drizzle and intermittent precipitation both models a and c have lower exponent sums 3 and thus lower complexity compared to model b exponent sum 5 however model c is the most realistic because the birth rate is increasing monotonically with both increasing economy trait x d f d x 0 and increasing soil water content w d f d w 0 while mortality is increasing monotonically with increasing economy trait x d g d x 0 but decreasing with increasing soil water content w d g d w 0 in the results we start by showing the outcomes of the simpler and less realistic models a and b and then continue with the more complex and realistic model c 3 results for each of the model scenarios proposed models a b and c we calculate the steady state of soil water content and plant population density and the values of the trait x that maximize plant density minimize soil water content and define the ess fig 1 these values are obtained along gradients of precipitation regimes abiotic water losses and background mortality 3 1 plant dynamics independent of precipitation models a b we start by exploring the model variant a in which the soil water availability at equilibrium is independent of climatic conditions and is entirely determined by the plant population dynamics eq 1 in this case all density dependencies enter the population equation only indirectly implicitly via soil water content s q 0 imposing steady state conditions for n d n d t 0 yields the soil water content at equilibrium 9 w b b 2 4 a c 2 a where a a m b b a d c m b b d and c b c m b d note that the equilibrium soil water content w depends on the plant trait x because a b c and d are functions of x for some parameter choices there are limiting cases with simple trivial solutions e g w 1 if m b 0 and 1 a b c d or 2 a c and b d in this case the invasion fitness is independent of the resident strategy and therefore there is no ess or any other type of singular point another simple solution is found when a c and b d which gives w c a here there is no ess since the invasion fitness s is a monotonically increasing function of w for an ess to exist the s must have at least one maximum and this cannot occur if a and c are power functions of x since then w is either constant monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing when a c and b d we can have an ess and in this case w is independent of a some of the assumptions in the limiting cases explored above can be relaxed to allow some of the parameters a b c and d to have different values with the specific choice e a e c 0 e b 2 and e d 1 with zero background mortality m b 0 an ess is found see details in supporting information s1 moreover the economy trait at the ess minimizes soil water we now explore the more realistic model b whose invasion fitness and corresponding pairwise invasibility plot pip are shown in fig 3a b the invasion fitness s x x shown in fig 3a refers to the per capita growth of rare mutant strategy with trait x in the environment set by the resident strategy with trait x fig 3a positive values indicate that the mutant population can grow in the environmental context set by the resident to visualize areas in the trait space where this occurs a pip is produced fig 3b where positive values of fitness are shown in yellow and negative values in blue along the diagonal x x the invasion fitness is always zero in the case illustrated in fig 3 there is a globally attracting ess around x 0 5 this is the point where evolution converges because variations in the mutant trait will not be beneficial to the mutant this is a stable attracting point because d s 2 d x 2 0 below and above x blue area whereas d s 2 d x 2 0 to the left and right of x yellow areas the existence of an attracting ess depends on the parameter choice for example when background mortality m b is increasing in fig 3c the ess of x is also increasing almost linearly in model b as also in model a the ess of x is always minimizing soil water content w which can be seen as contours in the background of fig 3c in other words the ess is a tragedy of the commons an evolutionary outcome minimizing the resources it is also clear from the symmetric pip that selection is optimizing metz et al 1996 3 2 plant dynamics with direct density dependence acting on mortality and or recruitment model c so far we have assumed that recruitment and mortality depend on plant density only indirectly through soil water here we explore direct density dependence acting only on mortality s 0 and q 1 supporting information s2 only on recruitment s 1 and q 0 supporting information s3 or on both s 1 and q 1 supporting information s3 density dependent mortality increases when densities are high eq 3 while density dependent recruitment decreases when densities are high eq 2 in addition density dependence through soil water is acting indirectly both on recruitment and mortality by adding direct density dependencies we are also coupling the plant density equation to the soil water balance equation and in that case both n and w appear in the equilibrium solution of eq 1 in figs 4 and 5 the impacts of density dependent mortality and recruitment are explored when varying precipitation and abiotic water loss rates moreover three types of plant growth strategies are considered the strategy maximizing plant density dashed green the strategy minimizing soil water dashed purple and the ess solid black again we focus on a tropical dry forest as a case study and now use exponents from model c i e e a e b e c 1 and e d 0 the most realistic of the three models presented in section 3 1 plant densities and soil water content at equilibrium corresponding to the traits shown in figs 4 and 5 are presented in the supporting information figs s1 s4 in general we find that the ess x is intermediate between the soil water minimum strategy highest x of the three optimal strategies and the plant density maximum strategy lowest x of the three optimal strategies additionally the trends of the three strategies are almost always consistent notably only when e y 0 the strategies are distinct here we chose e y 1 4 highlighting the importance of having the transpiration rate dependent on the trait x in model c we have chosen low values for exponents e i higher exponent values would widen the gap between the plant density maximum strategy and the soil water minimum strategy result not shown in contrast by setting e y 0 all the three strategies would coincide the trait x and thus plant growth rate at the ess increases with precipitation p when recruitment is density dependent and precipitation rate is constant fig 4d whereas x decreases with increasing abiotic water losses as represented by v fig 4e the opposite result is found with density dependent mortality fig 4a b here plants are predicted to grow slower when precipitation is increasing and slightly faster when the water loss rate is increasing in fig 5 we show the influence of mean rain event frequency Œª and mean rain amount per event Œ± on the three strategies note that p Œ± Œª whereas in this soil water model v is not included explicitly because it is assumed that water is primarily lost via saturation excess runoff increasing rainfall frequency or mean rain event depth have similar effects both increasing x at the ess when recruitment is density dependent and decreasing x at the ess when mortality is density dependent regardless of the chosen hydrological model background mortality always increases the ess for any plant strategy fig 4c f fig 5c f it should be noted that values of m b were chosen such that the ess would be comparable across scenarios i e x 1 this resulted in lower values of m b when density dependence acted on recruitment figs 4f and 5f in addition to comparing the effects of direct density dependence in recruitment to those caused by density dependence in mortality we also studied the combined effect of density dependent recruitment and mortality for the case of drizzle precipitation s 1 q 1 fig s5 the resulting trends were the same as those shown in fig 4d f with only direct density dependent recruitment s 1 q 0 i e increasing x at the ess with increasing water availability or mortality to summarize the trends in the economy trait ess for density dependent recruitment and mortality are opposite along gradients of water availability but consistent when background mortality m b is changed table 3 for constant drizzle precipitation both direct density dependent recruitment and mortality s q 1 resulted in the same economy trait trends as those found with only direct density dependent recruitment however since we do not know if s q 1 is accurately balancing recruitment and mortality we did not include this result in table 3 4 discussion we developed a plant population model coupled to a soil water balance model that allows analytical explorations of how plants may respond to changes in precipitation and soil water losses we presented results obtained from a large number of simple models some did not have an internal ess suggesting that not all model structures are amenable to studying ess or were based on non intuitive assumptions such as a mortality increasing with increasing soil water content moreover our models rest on assumptions required to maintain analytical tractability for example the size structure of the population kohyama 1992 and positive interactions between individuals were not considered e g larger plant protecting saplings from excessive radiation also we do not describe resource acquisition stress damage and recruitment in a process based way but lump the consequences of physiological processes into simple recruitment and mortality functions these simplifications do not allow us to mechanistically link the economy trait x to specific processes e g distinguishing reproductive effort from recruitment while these complexities can be included in future developments here we focus on the relations of our results to previous theories section 4 1 the effect of density dependencies on the ess section 4 2 the relation of x to measurable traits section 4 3 and the broader implications of our results section 4 4 4 1 relations to ecological theories we studied plant adaptation to dry conditions as emerging from a system of plant dynamics coupled with hydrological dynamics where transpiration represents the mechanistic linkage between the two we focused on one evolving trait the economy trait x which links recruitment to mortality and transpiration sensu reich 2014 in turn x was found based on three plant strategies 1 maximizing biomass 2 minimizing soil water or 3 evolutionarily stable ess higher values of x correspond to higher rates of recruitment mortality and water use thus capturing the coordinated variation occurring in plant traits reich 2014 we found that when recruitment and mortality were both independent of plant density when there is no direct density dependency s q 0 evolution was always minimizing soil water content such that the soil water minimum and the ess were coinciding which can be shown both analytically and graphically supporting information s1 and fig 3 this is a tragedy of the commons outcome where the species at the ess minimize the resource soil water resulting in resource limitation for the whole community hardin 1968 a similar result was also found by zea cabrera et al 2006 when all competing species had the same drought tolerance the minimization of resources at the ess is a common outcome in eco evolutionary models with resource competition e g boudsocq et al 2010 the ess is not minimizing the water resource when 1 transpiration is trait dependent and 2 mortality q 1 or recruitment s 1 directly depend on plant density n under these conditions we found that x at the ess was higher faster plant growth rate compared to the strategy maximizing plant density and lower slower plant growth rate than the strategy minimizing soil water content figs 4 5 this result is in line with everard et al 2010 where the competitive ability of a strategy was found to be a function both of limiting resource depletion and maximization of total biomass in other words the success of an invader or a resident species cannot be explained solely by its limiting resource in contrast to the r theory where the dominant species can survive at the lowest resource level tilman 1982 the occurrence of an intermediate ess can be explained intuitively by considering that slow growing plants with low transpiration rate maintain high soil water content and also high plant density since high soil water content implies high recruitment rate and low mortality in contrast fast growing plants with high transpiration decrease soil water resulting in low plant density at the ess therefore maximizing plant density implies minimizing transpiration slow plants whereas minimizing soil water content implies maximizing transpiration fast plants our model thus provides an alternative interpretation of plant competition outcomes compared to the results by farrior et al 2013 where the time under water stress was the main mechanism for avoiding a tragedy of the commons our results are simpler to interpret in terms of overall plant water use strategies but lack the mechanistic underpinning allowed by the more physiologically complex model by farrior et al 2013 4 2 how does model structure affect predicted plant adaptation direct density dependence has a major influence on the plant economics response to changes in precipitation water loss or background mortality we find that direct density dependence acting only on recruitment produces a model where plants grow faster higher x with increasing precipitation but slower when direct density dependence is acting only on mortality compare fig 4a d or fig 5a d the exact mechanisms causing opposite responses of the two direct density dependencies are difficult to identify analytically because of the nonlinear character of the plant density trait relations but it can be shown that these responses depend on the chosen exponents in the a x b x c x functions and not on d x or y x results not shown the exponent of the transpiration function y x does not affect the trends of the ess with precipitation however if transpiration is independent of x the plant maximum density soil water minimum and ess will coincide earlier models of plant adaptation in water limited environments were based on plant biomass per unit area rather than plant density zea cabrera et al 2006 everard et al 2010 vico et al 2017 and except for vico et al 2017 farrior et al 2013 2015 a constant rainfall rate was assumed these models were thus structurally different from the one proposed here which describes population density rather than biomass moreover different from our approach everard et al 2010 and vico et al 2017 accounted for nitrogen dynamics via a mass balance for nitrogen and implicitly respectively in the former contribution soil moisture mediates nitrogen availability and thus affects plant growth indirectly in the latter water limitation acts directly on vegetation while nitrogen availability is treated as a constraint for a given annual rainfall drought deciduous species are predicted to invade when the wet season is short whereas evergreen species dominate when the wet season is long this result is obtained when the available nitrogen is allocated to produce a larger leaf area with lower nitrogen concentration in evergreen than in deciduous species a trade off between fast and slow nitrogen allocation strategies at the core of the plant economy spectrum in our simpler model instead of assuming a trade off in nitrogen allocation we assumed that trade offs occur among recruitment and mortality in addition we did not prescribe a position along the plant economy spectrum e g by defining leaf habit but let the model define it through the value of the trait x in addition to models of different complexity driven by constant rainfall fig 4 we also linked plant population dynamics to a stochastic soil water balance model via plant density effects on transpiration fig 5 with this stochastic model we conducted an evolutionary invasion analysis of the plant economy response to rain event frequency and rain depth per rain event we found that the plant economy was correlated with rain frequency Œª and event depth Œ± such that faster and more drought sensitive plants higher x are evolving under more frequent or intense rain when recruitment is directly density dependent this is an expected result and is also in line with the results from the deterministic precipitation model where faster plants were evolving as a response to increased precipitation note that both increasing rain frequency Œª and increasing rain depth per event Œ± would increase precipitation because p Œ± Œª the opposite trend slower plants with increasing Œª or Œ± was found when mortality is density dependent this result is also in line with the deterministic case other parameters in the soil water balance equation could cause changes in x in addition to altered precipitation regimes in particular increased rooting depth and the corresponding higher soil water storage capacity u benefits plants in mesic conditions by reducing runoff and percolation and increasing transpiration but not in dry conditions where it would dilute the available soil water in a large soil volume guswa 2008 rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 therefore higher values of storage capacity u are expected to decrease x in dry conditions as the long term mean w would be lower but to increase x in moist conditions mean w would increase thanks to reduced abiotic water losses 4 3 model parameterization and interpretation of the economy trait x to obtain values for the constants k a k b k c and k d we fitted the recruitment and mortality functions to data from chaturvedi et al 2017 fig s6 despite a thorough literature search we did not find other field studies besides chaturvedi et al 2017 with a dataset on soil water dependent recruitment and mortality other studies focused on recruitment and mortality changes with precipitation as opposed to soil moisture per se suggesting higher plant growth and recruitment rates during wet periods in tropical dry forests and savannas maza villalobos et al 2013 fensham et al 2017 in contrast martinez ramos et al 2018 showed that recruitment decreased with precipitation in a neotropical dry forest this counter intuitive result could be explained by a short term regeneration pulse triggered by an unusually long period of drought e g after el ni√±o events wright and calder√≥n 2006 the forests sampled by chaturvedi et al 2017 were disturbed by partial wood harvesting which means that they could be far from natural conditions where selection acts freely a heavily managed forest would have minimal recruitment and controlled thinnings independent of soil moisture e g mrad et al 2020 ideally the model should be fitted to recruitment and mortality data from a natural forest at population equilibrium i e a late successional forest where all plants have comparable plant economy though we recognize that different strategies can also coexist in a plant community a more complex size structured model could be used to characterize populations with differently aged individuals kohyama 1992 but this was beyond our goal which traits are good proxies for the overall plant economy or plant position along a life history strategy axis is an open question for example wood density chave et al 2009 and specific leaf area wright et al 2004 have been proposed as candidates as they co vary with several other plant characteristics reich 2014 with specific reference to plant water use strategies in addition to wood density the leaf area to sapwood area ratio maximum stomatal conductance and leaf area specific xylem conductivity are all correlated or aligned along common relations across species in tropical dry forests as the case study examined here bucci et al 2004 but also more broadly mencuccini et al 2019 this coordination is necessary to avoid hydraulic failure manzoni et al 2014 supporting the choice of a single trait as indicator of a species position along the economy spectrum among these traits wood density is perhaps the most straightforward trait to use as such indicator but wood density is less related to precipitation when accounting for phylogeny than other climatic drivers swenson and enquist 2007 trees with high wood density are characterized by slow growth low recruitment rate high water stress tolerance low water stress mortality and low transpiration rates bucci et al 2004 we found that the plant trait x is a saturating function of precipitation see figs 4d and 5d consistent with observed sla trends madani et al 2018 this suggests that sla would also be a suitable candidate indicator trait to test predicted trends in x 4 4 implications for forests under climate change even though the model presented is simple and our results are only showing the endpoint of evolution or competition we can still gain insights on the expected plant economy trends under climate change and associated increased disturbance frequency the plant economy is expected to become faster under increasing background mortality this means that with more frequent storms fires and disease outbreaks fast growing species are selected for this result is consistent with the conceptual view that r strategists which would be characterized by high values of x are selected in environments where disturbances keep the plant community far from the carrying capacity of the system whereas a more conservative strategy low x would be selected at a low disturbance level taylor et al 1990 drought is a more complex evolutionary driver because less frequent rainfall could either favour slower growing fig 5d or faster growing plant species fig 5a depending on whether the forest is mostly recruitment limited or mortality limited respectively we expect that late successional forests are recruitment limited due to asymmetric resource competition favouring large individuals that can pre empt resources craine and dybzinski 2013 note that pre emption does not necessarily depend on size since for example both small and large plants can pre empt resources in the top soil layer to understand the evolutionary response of plants to lowering precipitation it is important to consider the stochastic nature of rain events rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 farrior et al 2015 our results show that slower growing species are expected to be favoured under less frequent rain while faster growing species are favoured by larger rain events in recruitment limited forests fig 5e if less frequent rain is associated with larger rain events as expected in future climate scenarios ipcc 2012 then these two effects could partly cancel out if climatic changes lower water availability by decreasing mean precipitation rainfall frequency or mean rain depth we predict slower growing species being selected future climate adapted recruitment limited forests i e density dependence acting directly only on recruitment will be characterized by slow growing species where water availability decreases such species would invest more resources in traits conferring them resistance to drought stress and less on growth and reproduction i e improved adaptation to environments with low carrying capacity taylor et al 1990 this does not necessarily imply forests with lower productivity as these forests could grow at higher plant density low x along the green curves in figs 4 and 5 denser stands could also reduce evaporation from the soil via shading even though this effect was not considered here thus we suggest that denser stands with slow growing plants could reduce the risk of over exploiting the water resource while maintaining productivity 5 conclusions using evolutionary invasion analysis we found that the evolutionarily stable plant economy strategy is intermediate between the strategies maximizing plant population slower growth and the strategy minimizing soil water content faster growth this result was obtained only when recruitment mortality and transpiration are linked by a plant trait that represents the position of a species along the plant economy spectrum in a future drier climate as projected by climate models for large parts of the globe ipcc 2019 our model suggests that recruitment limited plant communities could transition towards species at the slow end of the plant economy spectrum if water availability decreases or at the fast end if the

24632,plants have evolved different strategies to withstand drought in general these strategies can be defined along a plant economics spectrum which classifies plants depending on whether their growth rate is fast or slow where fast growth is associated with high mortality high water use and high sensitivity to drought which strategy along this economy spectrum will be selected under different precipitation regimes is an open question we address this question with a minimal soil plant model in which a single plant economy trait related to growth rate characterizes the plant strategy this generic and dimensionless trait influences both recruitment and mortality but not background mortality we explore the evolution of this trait by quantifying its effects on birth mortality and transpiration rates furthermore we explore the influence of direct plant density dependence acting on recruitment and mortality in addition to the indirect density dependence caused by plant feedback on soil water content we show that 1 increasingly fast growing plants always evolve under increasing background mortality 2 when soil water only depends on plant density and is independent of precipitation and abiotic water losses the strategy minimizing soil water content is an evolutionarily stable strategy ess i e the evolutionary outcome is a tragedy of the commons hardin 1968 3 when precipitation abiotic water losses and trait dependent transpiration determine soil water content the ess lies between the strategy maximizing plant density and that minimizing soil water content i e no tragedy of the commons occurs 4 with a deterministic precipitation model and density dependence acting directly only on recruitment higher precipitation promotes the evolution of faster plants the opposite result is found when density dependence is acting directly only on mortality 5 similar trends in the economy trait are observed when forcing the model with stochastic precipitation events graphical abstract keywords evolutionarily stable strategy tragedy of the commons soil water content plant economics optimal strategy trait based model 1 introduction droughts have drastic consequences for vegetation which are likely to worsen with ongoing climatic changes allen et al 2010 both lower precipitation and higher temperature are causing increasing aridity leading to mortality of extant species and invasion of more drought tolerant ones allen and breshears 1998 for example 90 mortality was reported for some species in the chaparral shrublands in southern california during the extreme drought from 2012 to 2015 jacobsen and pratt 2018 also the agricultural sector struggles to adapt to the ongoing climate change partly because increasing yield via breeding of drought adapted crops has proved difficult araus et al 2002 a better understanding of plant adaptation to drought is thus a necessary step to i predict which species are more likely to thrive in natural ecosystems and ii predict which traits should be targeted in crop selection plants critically rely on water for their photosynthesis because acquiring co 2 from the atmosphere requires losing water via transpiration through the stomata lawlor and tezara 2009 hsiao 1973 plants have evolved many strategies to maintain hydration and withstand drought such as stomatal control of water losses sclerophyllous leaves high density wood able to withstand cavitation early reproduction time changes in leaf area and deep roots despite these strategies water stress can occur initially reducing plant growth rate later causing hydraulic failure and carbon starvation and ultimately resulting in plant mortality mencuccini et al 2015 the timing of damage depends on the available soil water and how fast it is depleted in turn available soil water depends on the balance of precipitation runoff deep percolation evaporation and transpiration which are mediated by soil properties rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 the main interaction between plants and soil water is through transpiration which is tightly controlled by stomatal regulation and variations in leaf area thus plants control the amount of water they use and different water use strategies may trigger competition when water becomes limiting rodriguez iturbe et al 2001 vico et al 2017 to estimate the transpiration rate per unit ground area for given soil moisture and atmospheric conditions both the transpiration rate per plant which depends on plant species and size wullschleger et al 1998 and the plant population size are needed transpiration varies widely between slow growing drought tolerant species typically conservative water users and fast growing drought intolerant species intensive water users the population size depends on the abiotic factors that constrain net primary productivity such as light intensity soil water content and nutrients but also on plant plant interactions such as resource competition eco evolutionary models by determining the trait values that are evolutionarily selected can describe changes in population size along gradients of water availability and predict how evolution or competition with encroaching species may affect the extant population previous models describing plant adaptation to water limitation range from highly idealized and missing potentially important processes e g no density dependent mortality in zea cabrera et al 2006 to physiologically detailed farrior et al 2013 2015 between these two classes of models there is an open niche for a low complexity model with low calibration data requirements to explore the evolutionary consequences of changes in water availability this low complexity model would be suitable to assess the sensitivity of the evolutionary outcomes to specific choices for the recruitment and mortality functions which has not been assessed so far any model dealing with resource limitation adaptation requires an evolving trait and population dynamics that depends on the evolving trait and the resource availability several functional traits are related to water availability and drought tolerance such as specific leaf area sla seed size height at maturation root to shoot mass ratio sperry et al 1998 leaf to sapwood area ratios mencuccini et al 2019 timing of leaf flush and senescence vico et al 2017 as well as the response of stomata and xylem conductance to changes in water potential manzoni et al 2014 and plant water storage scholz et al 2011 detailed plant eco physiological models use these traits to describe plant growth and water use e g xu et al 2016 feng et al 2018 huang et al 2017 lindh et al 2014 but these models are not amenable for analytical insights on how plants characterized by certain traits might invade an existing community this motivates developing a simpler modelling approach in which a single trait is used to characterize a species the underlying assumption is that variations in this trait capture changes of several coordinated traits that determine the species growth reproduction and responses to stress a similar approach has been used to parameterize predator prey models where the evolving trait affected prey population growth mortality and predation rates e g mendes and faria 2020 however to our knowledge this approach has not been used in models of water limited vegetation we identify this trait as the position of a species along one axis of the plant economy spectrum or analogously along a spectrum of life histories according to the plant economics theory species can be placed along a spectrum from fast to slow growth rates reich 2014 a fast growth rate is correlated to low survival thereby linking the two most vital ingredients in population dynamics birth rate or recruitment and mortality rate the inverse of survival rate furthermore a fast growth rate is also correlated with high resource use in particular water use transpiration in water limited ecosystems the plant economy spectrum theory has later been corroborated by salguero g√≥mez et al 2016 who found that a fast slow growth axis and a high low reproductive trait axis could capture 55 of the global variation in plant traits this study shows that growth rate is a major factor to consider in a one dimensional plant economics theory although not all the trait variability can be captured in this way to determine how the position of plants along the economy spectrum varies with climate via selection of this master trait we developed a minimal model of plant evolution for water limited ecosystems we focus on the response of plant economy to precipitation by comparing a soil water balance model using a deterministic structure with regular water input i e constant drizzle against a model with periodic water input i e more realistic intermittent rain the former approach allows for simple analytical solutions but neglects the variations in soil moisture caused by random precipitation events that impact plant mortality and that are accounted for in the stochastic model we compare optimal strategies maximizing plant density and minimizing soil water content with the evolutionarily stable strategy ess thereby identifying when evolution is optimizing a tragedy of the commons outcome emerges if evolution is minimizing the resource referring to an outcome in game theory when a common resource is used only in the self interest of the players hardin 1968 gersani et al 2001 first we focus on a model where plants are interacting only indirectly through their use of soil water which in turn is determined solely by plant dynamics then we explore the importance of plant density dependence acting directly only on recruitment and mortality in this case water availability is determined jointly by plant density and climatic conditions which is a more accurate representation of soil plant interactions 2 materials and methods a coupled plant population soil water model is developed to describe the evolution of plant traits under different climatic conditions fig 1 the plant model describes the temporal dynamics of the number of individuals rather than the average plant biomass the focus on the number of individuals is motivated by the fact that reproduction is carried out by the individuals and not by the biomass per se though these two metrics are related the rates of birth recruitment mortality and water uptake transpiration depend on an evolving trait x describing plant economics this trait represents a response trait sensu zakharova et al 2019 as it captures the macroscopic behaviour of the plant rather than the underlying physiological mechanisms two types of soil water models are explored one deterministic constant drizzle model and one where the rain events are stochastic in time and intensity the flexibility of the model formulation allows exploring different approaches to link plant traits to recruitment and mortality rates section plant population model and considering either deterministic or stochastic precipitation as driver of soil water dynamics section soil water model we consider the three end member cases 1 plant soil water dynamics independent of precipitation 2 plant soil water dynamics with deterministic constant drizzle precipitation 3 plant soil water dynamics with intermittent precipitation furthermore we studied the effect of density dependence in recruitment and mortality both recruitment and mortality are density dependent in natural forests but the density dependence is modulated by resource competition e g competition for water in dense forests with strong asymmetric competition large individuals have access to larger water volumes recruitment limitation can be expected to be density dependent in contrast in a xeric shrubland we can expect drought and water limitations to cause a high level of adult tree competition for water resulting in density dependent mortality note that density dependent mortality can be implemented in the verhulst equation when the negative term of the population dynamics is increasing with population size all symbols are listed and explained in table 1 and all functions in table 2 2 1 plant population model 2 1 1 dynamical equations as a proxy for the plant growth strategy we define a single evolving functional trait x encompassing multiple plant features representing its position along the plant economy spectrum e g sla for simplicity x is referred to as economy trait throughout the paper with reference to plant economics theory reich 2014 low values of x indicate a slow growing plant with low recruitment mortality and transpiration conversely high values of x identify fast growing plants with high mortality and water use all plants are assumed to be of the same size i e ontogenetic growth and size distribution are not modelled moreover we model plant recruitment rather than birth rate since a large number of seeds and seedlings may never germinate the model is designed to describe plant populations in semiarid ecosystems where plants compete for a common and limited water resource e g tropical dry forests and is based on the following assumptions on the relations between plant density n and soil water content w 1 recruitment rate is zero at w 0 2 recruitment rate saturates at high w 3 mortality is positive and non zero at w 0 4 mortality levels off to zero or to a constant background mortality m b at high w 5 water uptake rate transpiration is proportional to plant density n the normalized and non dimensional population density n is described as a function of per capita recruitment f and mortality g by the ordinary differential equation 1 d n d t f x n w n g x n w n which is coupled to the soil water dynamics through w the normalized plant density n 0 1 can be related to the actual plant density data n number of individuals per unit area by setting n n n m a x where n m a x is the maximum value in the data the recruitment rate per individual f x n w depends on plant density n and soil water content w 2 f x n w a x w b x w n s the recruitment rate saturates at a maximum value a x n s which simplifies to a x when s 0 here b x is the half saturation constant for recruitment rate with respect to w the direct density dependence of n is controlled by the exponent s assumed to be either s 0 no direct density dependence or s 1 negative effect of n on recruitment the plant mortality rate g x n w is assumed to decrease with increasing soil water content 3 g x n w c x d x w n q m b where the trait x affects mortality through both the asymptotic mortality rate c x n q which simplifies to c x if q 0 and the half saturation constant d x density dependence is controlled by the exponent q in n q which is assumed to have values of either q 0 or q 1 leading to a linear or quadratic mortality term respectively the background mortality m b is related to disturbances other than water stress e g storms fires pests or pathogens and as such is independent of w and x when both recruitment and mortality are linear functions of n s q 0 as shown in section 3 1 the dynamics of soil water are decoupled from precipitation which implies that precipitation and water loss are not influencing the plant dynamics model variants a and b presented in section 2 5 in contrast when s 1 and or q 1 plant and soil water dynamics are fully coupled leading to a more complex and realistic model model variant c 2 1 2 plant trait influence on recruitment and mortality for simplicity we restrict a b c and d to constant or monotonically increasing power functions of the economy trait x expressed in the form p x k i x e i with i a b c d with e i 0 we obtain a constant function p k i whereas e i 1 yields a linear function p k i x for mathematical convenience the values of x are regarded as dimensionless and we assume that x 1 when fitting the recruitment and mortality rates to observed tree densities along a moisture gradient in a tropical dry forest supporting information s4 the trait x controls f x n w and g x n w as illustrated in fig 2 see fig 1 2 2 soil water model 2 2 1 constant drizzle precipitation for simplicity we first assume that precipitation p is time invariant i e a constant drizzle abiotic water losses evaporation percolation and runoff follow a first order function with rate constant v and transpiration rate y x n depends only on plant density n and the economy trait x via the per capita transpiration rate y x when relative volumetric soil moisture ranges between field capacity s f c and wilting point s w these two extreme values of soil moisture allow defining the soil water storage capacity u n z r s f c s w with n being soil porosity under these assumptions the soil water balance averaged over the rooting depth z r is written in terms of a water volume per unit ground area as rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 4 u d w d t p v w y x n where w represents the plant available water and is normalized between 0 at the plant wilting point and 1 at saturation it is now convenient to re write the soil water balance in non dimensional form by normalizing all fluxes as p p u v v u and y x y x u per capita normalized transpiration rate 5 d w d t p v w y x n the term v w represents a combination of water losses via runoff percolation and evaporation from the soil surface runoff and percolation should be modelled as nonlinear functions of soil moisture as they are largest near saturation or in case of runoff when rainfall exceeds infiltration capacity see section intermittent precipitation but to retain analytical tractability this water loss rate is assumed to be a linear function of soil moisture with a proportionality constant v water exceeding the soil storage capacity is assumed to be leave the system as runoff i e w is bound to one the transpiration rate can be described as a function of soil water content e g rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 but here for simplicity we assume that transpiration is only a function of plant density n and the trait x and that transpiration stops when the wilting point is reached e g milly 1993 guswa 2008 the dependence of transpiration on plant density is motivated by the observation that in water limited environments transpiration scales with leaf area goldstein et al 2008 bucci et al 2008 which in our simplified framework is proportional to plant density following this simplification and assuming as before a power law effect of x the per capita transpiration rate is defined as 6 y x k y x e y where the k y is estimated from data and the exponent e y 1 4 is chosen such that y x is less sensitive to the trait value at high x 2 2 2 intermittent precipitation for a more realistic representation of precipitation we now consider the case of intermittent stochastic precipitation occurrences following rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 precipitation p is described as a marked poisson process with mean frequency Œª and rainfall depths extracted from an exponential distribution with mean Œ± the stochastic nature of precipitation results in a distribution of soil moisture values which can be calculated analytically thus the plant population growth and mortality vary depending on the mean soil moisture value attained under a given density n the mean soil moisture also varies in response to the population temporal evolution due to the coupling of plant density and transpiration rate eq 5 following rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 the mean soil water content is found as 7 w x n 1 Œ∑ x n Œ≥ Œª Œ∑ x n Œ≥ Œª Œ∑ x n Œ≥ Œª Œ∑ x n Œ≥ Œª Œ∑ x n Œ≥ e Œ≥ where Œ∑ x n is the transpiration rate normalized by the water storage capacity i e Œ∑ y x n u y x n Œ≥ is the inverse of the mean rainfall depth normalized by the water storage capacity Œ≥ u Œ± Œ≥ is the gamma function and Œ≥ is the incomplete gamma function in this model the total precipitation rate is given by the product of mean rain event frequency Œª and mean rain depth per event Œ± so different rainfall scenarios can be considered by independently changing Œª and Œ± as in the constant drizzle model we assume that the transpiration rate is proportional to plant density and is constant with soil moisture between the field capacity and the wilting point so that Œ∑ x n y x n where y x is defined in eq 6 as a result w in eq 7 becomes a function of both n and x w w x n at equilibrium where d n d t 0 the equation for population dynamics eq 1 yields a relation n n x w solving numerically the system of equations n n x w and w w x n we can find the equilibrium state for any given strategy x denoted by w and n 2 3 evolutionary invasion analysis and optimal strategies the invasion fitness s is defined as the mutant population growth per capita according to the framework of adaptive dynamics geritz et al 1998 the s for a rare mutant strategy x is analysed at the ecological equilibrium w where the resident strategy x population is also at equilibrium n in such conditions the invasion fitness is defined as the per capita growth rate of a mutant strategy x in an environment at equilibrium n x w x produced by the resident strategy x fig 1 8 s x x 1 n d n d t n w where n n x w w x a singular point x is defined where the invasion fitness is zero i e d s d x 0 when x x if the sign of the second derivative of s is negative in the singular point we have an evolutionary stable strategy ess i e d s 2 d x 2 x x x 0 the ess is defined as convergence stable if d 2 s d x 2 x x x d 2 s d x 2 x x x in the following we focus our analysis on ess because we did not find any branching points i e evolutionary divergence points geritz et al 1998 note that the ess is a result of competition between strategies but there is no way to know how long time it takes to reach the ess unless genetic details such as mutation rates are known dieckmann and law 1996 the ess can be used to study trends resulting from climate change under the assumption that evolution or plant community composition changes are faster than climate change johansson and jonz√©n 2012 in addition to the ess black solid curves in the figures in results we can define two additional optimal strategies by randomly extracting values of x between zero and one we find those values that maximize plant density n denoted as plant density maximum strategy green dashed curves we use the same method to obtain values of x that cause soil water content to be minimized denoted as the soil water minimum strategy purple dashed curves 2 4 model parameterization details on the model parameterization can be found in supporting information s4 and here only a short summary is provided plant recruitment and mortality are parameterized based on data collected in a tropical dry forest by chaturvedi et al 2017 soil properties are also selected based for the sandy soil typical of that forest precipitation rate and characteristics Œª and Œ± and abiotic water loss rate are varied to assess how the trait x varies in response to changes in climate parameter values are listed in table 1 2 5 roadmap for analysis of model results the proposed model includes a number of parameters and exponents that can change the dynamics of soil moisture and population density and thus the occurrence of equilibrium points and ess the exponents of the relationships between rate constants and trait x e i with i a b c d y and the exponents s and q controlling density dependencies in the recruitment and mortality functions eqs 2 and 3 respectively are allowed to vary to proceed in a systematic way we first explored different combinations of the values of e i exponents in minimal models where recruitment and mortality were linear functions of plant density i e no density dependencies and s q 0 referred to as models a and b these minimal models are simple enough to allow insights on the emergence of ess from analytical results second we selected linear relations between rate constants and trait x i e e i 1 except for e d 0 and e y 1 4 and assessed the effects of density dependencies in the mortality s 0 q 1 and recruitment functions s 1 q 0 resulting in model c this is a more realistic and dynamically rich model that offers insights of more general applicability than the minimal models a and b model c is applied under both the constant drizzle and the stochastic precipitation scenarios to summarize the model variants used in our analyses are as follows see resulting recruitment and mortality functions in fig 2 model a e a e c 0 e b 2 and e d 1 no direct density dependence on recruitment and mortality s q 0 supporting information s1 model b e a e b 2 e c 1 and e d 0 no direct density dependence on recruitment and mortality s q 0 section 3 1 fig 3 model c e a e b e c 1 and e d 0 with direct density dependence on recruitment s 1 q 0 or mortality s 0 q 1 section 3 2 figs 4 5 see also supporting information s2 s3 model c is also analysed under both constant drizzle and intermittent precipitation both models a and c have lower exponent sums 3 and thus lower complexity compared to model b exponent sum 5 however model c is the most realistic because the birth rate is increasing monotonically with both increasing economy trait x d f d x 0 and increasing soil water content w d f d w 0 while mortality is increasing monotonically with increasing economy trait x d g d x 0 but decreasing with increasing soil water content w d g d w 0 in the results we start by showing the outcomes of the simpler and less realistic models a and b and then continue with the more complex and realistic model c 3 results for each of the model scenarios proposed models a b and c we calculate the steady state of soil water content and plant population density and the values of the trait x that maximize plant density minimize soil water content and define the ess fig 1 these values are obtained along gradients of precipitation regimes abiotic water losses and background mortality 3 1 plant dynamics independent of precipitation models a b we start by exploring the model variant a in which the soil water availability at equilibrium is independent of climatic conditions and is entirely determined by the plant population dynamics eq 1 in this case all density dependencies enter the population equation only indirectly implicitly via soil water content s q 0 imposing steady state conditions for n d n d t 0 yields the soil water content at equilibrium 9 w b b 2 4 a c 2 a where a a m b b a d c m b b d and c b c m b d note that the equilibrium soil water content w depends on the plant trait x because a b c and d are functions of x for some parameter choices there are limiting cases with simple trivial solutions e g w 1 if m b 0 and 1 a b c d or 2 a c and b d in this case the invasion fitness is independent of the resident strategy and therefore there is no ess or any other type of singular point another simple solution is found when a c and b d which gives w c a here there is no ess since the invasion fitness s is a monotonically increasing function of w for an ess to exist the s must have at least one maximum and this cannot occur if a and c are power functions of x since then w is either constant monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing when a c and b d we can have an ess and in this case w is independent of a some of the assumptions in the limiting cases explored above can be relaxed to allow some of the parameters a b c and d to have different values with the specific choice e a e c 0 e b 2 and e d 1 with zero background mortality m b 0 an ess is found see details in supporting information s1 moreover the economy trait at the ess minimizes soil water we now explore the more realistic model b whose invasion fitness and corresponding pairwise invasibility plot pip are shown in fig 3a b the invasion fitness s x x shown in fig 3a refers to the per capita growth of rare mutant strategy with trait x in the environment set by the resident strategy with trait x fig 3a positive values indicate that the mutant population can grow in the environmental context set by the resident to visualize areas in the trait space where this occurs a pip is produced fig 3b where positive values of fitness are shown in yellow and negative values in blue along the diagonal x x the invasion fitness is always zero in the case illustrated in fig 3 there is a globally attracting ess around x 0 5 this is the point where evolution converges because variations in the mutant trait will not be beneficial to the mutant this is a stable attracting point because d s 2 d x 2 0 below and above x blue area whereas d s 2 d x 2 0 to the left and right of x yellow areas the existence of an attracting ess depends on the parameter choice for example when background mortality m b is increasing in fig 3c the ess of x is also increasing almost linearly in model b as also in model a the ess of x is always minimizing soil water content w which can be seen as contours in the background of fig 3c in other words the ess is a tragedy of the commons an evolutionary outcome minimizing the resources it is also clear from the symmetric pip that selection is optimizing metz et al 1996 3 2 plant dynamics with direct density dependence acting on mortality and or recruitment model c so far we have assumed that recruitment and mortality depend on plant density only indirectly through soil water here we explore direct density dependence acting only on mortality s 0 and q 1 supporting information s2 only on recruitment s 1 and q 0 supporting information s3 or on both s 1 and q 1 supporting information s3 density dependent mortality increases when densities are high eq 3 while density dependent recruitment decreases when densities are high eq 2 in addition density dependence through soil water is acting indirectly both on recruitment and mortality by adding direct density dependencies we are also coupling the plant density equation to the soil water balance equation and in that case both n and w appear in the equilibrium solution of eq 1 in figs 4 and 5 the impacts of density dependent mortality and recruitment are explored when varying precipitation and abiotic water loss rates moreover three types of plant growth strategies are considered the strategy maximizing plant density dashed green the strategy minimizing soil water dashed purple and the ess solid black again we focus on a tropical dry forest as a case study and now use exponents from model c i e e a e b e c 1 and e d 0 the most realistic of the three models presented in section 3 1 plant densities and soil water content at equilibrium corresponding to the traits shown in figs 4 and 5 are presented in the supporting information figs s1 s4 in general we find that the ess x is intermediate between the soil water minimum strategy highest x of the three optimal strategies and the plant density maximum strategy lowest x of the three optimal strategies additionally the trends of the three strategies are almost always consistent notably only when e y 0 the strategies are distinct here we chose e y 1 4 highlighting the importance of having the transpiration rate dependent on the trait x in model c we have chosen low values for exponents e i higher exponent values would widen the gap between the plant density maximum strategy and the soil water minimum strategy result not shown in contrast by setting e y 0 all the three strategies would coincide the trait x and thus plant growth rate at the ess increases with precipitation p when recruitment is density dependent and precipitation rate is constant fig 4d whereas x decreases with increasing abiotic water losses as represented by v fig 4e the opposite result is found with density dependent mortality fig 4a b here plants are predicted to grow slower when precipitation is increasing and slightly faster when the water loss rate is increasing in fig 5 we show the influence of mean rain event frequency Œª and mean rain amount per event Œ± on the three strategies note that p Œ± Œª whereas in this soil water model v is not included explicitly because it is assumed that water is primarily lost via saturation excess runoff increasing rainfall frequency or mean rain event depth have similar effects both increasing x at the ess when recruitment is density dependent and decreasing x at the ess when mortality is density dependent regardless of the chosen hydrological model background mortality always increases the ess for any plant strategy fig 4c f fig 5c f it should be noted that values of m b were chosen such that the ess would be comparable across scenarios i e x 1 this resulted in lower values of m b when density dependence acted on recruitment figs 4f and 5f in addition to comparing the effects of direct density dependence in recruitment to those caused by density dependence in mortality we also studied the combined effect of density dependent recruitment and mortality for the case of drizzle precipitation s 1 q 1 fig s5 the resulting trends were the same as those shown in fig 4d f with only direct density dependent recruitment s 1 q 0 i e increasing x at the ess with increasing water availability or mortality to summarize the trends in the economy trait ess for density dependent recruitment and mortality are opposite along gradients of water availability but consistent when background mortality m b is changed table 3 for constant drizzle precipitation both direct density dependent recruitment and mortality s q 1 resulted in the same economy trait trends as those found with only direct density dependent recruitment however since we do not know if s q 1 is accurately balancing recruitment and mortality we did not include this result in table 3 4 discussion we developed a plant population model coupled to a soil water balance model that allows analytical explorations of how plants may respond to changes in precipitation and soil water losses we presented results obtained from a large number of simple models some did not have an internal ess suggesting that not all model structures are amenable to studying ess or were based on non intuitive assumptions such as a mortality increasing with increasing soil water content moreover our models rest on assumptions required to maintain analytical tractability for example the size structure of the population kohyama 1992 and positive interactions between individuals were not considered e g larger plant protecting saplings from excessive radiation also we do not describe resource acquisition stress damage and recruitment in a process based way but lump the consequences of physiological processes into simple recruitment and mortality functions these simplifications do not allow us to mechanistically link the economy trait x to specific processes e g distinguishing reproductive effort from recruitment while these complexities can be included in future developments here we focus on the relations of our results to previous theories section 4 1 the effect of density dependencies on the ess section 4 2 the relation of x to measurable traits section 4 3 and the broader implications of our results section 4 4 4 1 relations to ecological theories we studied plant adaptation to dry conditions as emerging from a system of plant dynamics coupled with hydrological dynamics where transpiration represents the mechanistic linkage between the two we focused on one evolving trait the economy trait x which links recruitment to mortality and transpiration sensu reich 2014 in turn x was found based on three plant strategies 1 maximizing biomass 2 minimizing soil water or 3 evolutionarily stable ess higher values of x correspond to higher rates of recruitment mortality and water use thus capturing the coordinated variation occurring in plant traits reich 2014 we found that when recruitment and mortality were both independent of plant density when there is no direct density dependency s q 0 evolution was always minimizing soil water content such that the soil water minimum and the ess were coinciding which can be shown both analytically and graphically supporting information s1 and fig 3 this is a tragedy of the commons outcome where the species at the ess minimize the resource soil water resulting in resource limitation for the whole community hardin 1968 a similar result was also found by zea cabrera et al 2006 when all competing species had the same drought tolerance the minimization of resources at the ess is a common outcome in eco evolutionary models with resource competition e g boudsocq et al 2010 the ess is not minimizing the water resource when 1 transpiration is trait dependent and 2 mortality q 1 or recruitment s 1 directly depend on plant density n under these conditions we found that x at the ess was higher faster plant growth rate compared to the strategy maximizing plant density and lower slower plant growth rate than the strategy minimizing soil water content figs 4 5 this result is in line with everard et al 2010 where the competitive ability of a strategy was found to be a function both of limiting resource depletion and maximization of total biomass in other words the success of an invader or a resident species cannot be explained solely by its limiting resource in contrast to the r theory where the dominant species can survive at the lowest resource level tilman 1982 the occurrence of an intermediate ess can be explained intuitively by considering that slow growing plants with low transpiration rate maintain high soil water content and also high plant density since high soil water content implies high recruitment rate and low mortality in contrast fast growing plants with high transpiration decrease soil water resulting in low plant density at the ess therefore maximizing plant density implies minimizing transpiration slow plants whereas minimizing soil water content implies maximizing transpiration fast plants our model thus provides an alternative interpretation of plant competition outcomes compared to the results by farrior et al 2013 where the time under water stress was the main mechanism for avoiding a tragedy of the commons our results are simpler to interpret in terms of overall plant water use strategies but lack the mechanistic underpinning allowed by the more physiologically complex model by farrior et al 2013 4 2 how does model structure affect predicted plant adaptation direct density dependence has a major influence on the plant economics response to changes in precipitation water loss or background mortality we find that direct density dependence acting only on recruitment produces a model where plants grow faster higher x with increasing precipitation but slower when direct density dependence is acting only on mortality compare fig 4a d or fig 5a d the exact mechanisms causing opposite responses of the two direct density dependencies are difficult to identify analytically because of the nonlinear character of the plant density trait relations but it can be shown that these responses depend on the chosen exponents in the a x b x c x functions and not on d x or y x results not shown the exponent of the transpiration function y x does not affect the trends of the ess with precipitation however if transpiration is independent of x the plant maximum density soil water minimum and ess will coincide earlier models of plant adaptation in water limited environments were based on plant biomass per unit area rather than plant density zea cabrera et al 2006 everard et al 2010 vico et al 2017 and except for vico et al 2017 farrior et al 2013 2015 a constant rainfall rate was assumed these models were thus structurally different from the one proposed here which describes population density rather than biomass moreover different from our approach everard et al 2010 and vico et al 2017 accounted for nitrogen dynamics via a mass balance for nitrogen and implicitly respectively in the former contribution soil moisture mediates nitrogen availability and thus affects plant growth indirectly in the latter water limitation acts directly on vegetation while nitrogen availability is treated as a constraint for a given annual rainfall drought deciduous species are predicted to invade when the wet season is short whereas evergreen species dominate when the wet season is long this result is obtained when the available nitrogen is allocated to produce a larger leaf area with lower nitrogen concentration in evergreen than in deciduous species a trade off between fast and slow nitrogen allocation strategies at the core of the plant economy spectrum in our simpler model instead of assuming a trade off in nitrogen allocation we assumed that trade offs occur among recruitment and mortality in addition we did not prescribe a position along the plant economy spectrum e g by defining leaf habit but let the model define it through the value of the trait x in addition to models of different complexity driven by constant rainfall fig 4 we also linked plant population dynamics to a stochastic soil water balance model via plant density effects on transpiration fig 5 with this stochastic model we conducted an evolutionary invasion analysis of the plant economy response to rain event frequency and rain depth per rain event we found that the plant economy was correlated with rain frequency Œª and event depth Œ± such that faster and more drought sensitive plants higher x are evolving under more frequent or intense rain when recruitment is directly density dependent this is an expected result and is also in line with the results from the deterministic precipitation model where faster plants were evolving as a response to increased precipitation note that both increasing rain frequency Œª and increasing rain depth per event Œ± would increase precipitation because p Œ± Œª the opposite trend slower plants with increasing Œª or Œ± was found when mortality is density dependent this result is also in line with the deterministic case other parameters in the soil water balance equation could cause changes in x in addition to altered precipitation regimes in particular increased rooting depth and the corresponding higher soil water storage capacity u benefits plants in mesic conditions by reducing runoff and percolation and increasing transpiration but not in dry conditions where it would dilute the available soil water in a large soil volume guswa 2008 rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 therefore higher values of storage capacity u are expected to decrease x in dry conditions as the long term mean w would be lower but to increase x in moist conditions mean w would increase thanks to reduced abiotic water losses 4 3 model parameterization and interpretation of the economy trait x to obtain values for the constants k a k b k c and k d we fitted the recruitment and mortality functions to data from chaturvedi et al 2017 fig s6 despite a thorough literature search we did not find other field studies besides chaturvedi et al 2017 with a dataset on soil water dependent recruitment and mortality other studies focused on recruitment and mortality changes with precipitation as opposed to soil moisture per se suggesting higher plant growth and recruitment rates during wet periods in tropical dry forests and savannas maza villalobos et al 2013 fensham et al 2017 in contrast martinez ramos et al 2018 showed that recruitment decreased with precipitation in a neotropical dry forest this counter intuitive result could be explained by a short term regeneration pulse triggered by an unusually long period of drought e g after el ni√±o events wright and calder√≥n 2006 the forests sampled by chaturvedi et al 2017 were disturbed by partial wood harvesting which means that they could be far from natural conditions where selection acts freely a heavily managed forest would have minimal recruitment and controlled thinnings independent of soil moisture e g mrad et al 2020 ideally the model should be fitted to recruitment and mortality data from a natural forest at population equilibrium i e a late successional forest where all plants have comparable plant economy though we recognize that different strategies can also coexist in a plant community a more complex size structured model could be used to characterize populations with differently aged individuals kohyama 1992 but this was beyond our goal which traits are good proxies for the overall plant economy or plant position along a life history strategy axis is an open question for example wood density chave et al 2009 and specific leaf area wright et al 2004 have been proposed as candidates as they co vary with several other plant characteristics reich 2014 with specific reference to plant water use strategies in addition to wood density the leaf area to sapwood area ratio maximum stomatal conductance and leaf area specific xylem conductivity are all correlated or aligned along common relations across species in tropical dry forests as the case study examined here bucci et al 2004 but also more broadly mencuccini et al 2019 this coordination is necessary to avoid hydraulic failure manzoni et al 2014 supporting the choice of a single trait as indicator of a species position along the economy spectrum among these traits wood density is perhaps the most straightforward trait to use as such indicator but wood density is less related to precipitation when accounting for phylogeny than other climatic drivers swenson and enquist 2007 trees with high wood density are characterized by slow growth low recruitment rate high water stress tolerance low water stress mortality and low transpiration rates bucci et al 2004 we found that the plant trait x is a saturating function of precipitation see figs 4d and 5d consistent with observed sla trends madani et al 2018 this suggests that sla would also be a suitable candidate indicator trait to test predicted trends in x 4 4 implications for forests under climate change even though the model presented is simple and our results are only showing the endpoint of evolution or competition we can still gain insights on the expected plant economy trends under climate change and associated increased disturbance frequency the plant economy is expected to become faster under increasing background mortality this means that with more frequent storms fires and disease outbreaks fast growing species are selected for this result is consistent with the conceptual view that r strategists which would be characterized by high values of x are selected in environments where disturbances keep the plant community far from the carrying capacity of the system whereas a more conservative strategy low x would be selected at a low disturbance level taylor et al 1990 drought is a more complex evolutionary driver because less frequent rainfall could either favour slower growing fig 5d or faster growing plant species fig 5a depending on whether the forest is mostly recruitment limited or mortality limited respectively we expect that late successional forests are recruitment limited due to asymmetric resource competition favouring large individuals that can pre empt resources craine and dybzinski 2013 note that pre emption does not necessarily depend on size since for example both small and large plants can pre empt resources in the top soil layer to understand the evolutionary response of plants to lowering precipitation it is important to consider the stochastic nature of rain events rodr√≠guez iturbe and porporato 2004 farrior et al 2015 our results show that slower growing species are expected to be favoured under less frequent rain while faster growing species are favoured by larger rain events in recruitment limited forests fig 5e if less frequent rain is associated with larger rain events as expected in future climate scenarios ipcc 2012 then these two effects could partly cancel out if climatic changes lower water availability by decreasing mean precipitation rainfall frequency or mean rain depth we predict slower growing species being selected future climate adapted recruitment limited forests i e density dependence acting directly only on recruitment will be characterized by slow growing species where water availability decreases such species would invest more resources in traits conferring them resistance to drought stress and less on growth and reproduction i e improved adaptation to environments with low carrying capacity taylor et al 1990 this does not necessarily imply forests with lower productivity as these forests could grow at higher plant density low x along the green curves in figs 4 and 5 denser stands could also reduce evaporation from the soil via shading even though this effect was not considered here thus we suggest that denser stands with slow growing plants could reduce the risk of over exploiting the water resource while maintaining productivity 5 conclusions using evolutionary invasion analysis we found that the evolutionarily stable plant economy strategy is intermediate between the strategies maximizing plant population slower growth and the strategy minimizing soil water content faster growth this result was obtained only when recruitment mortality and transpiration are linked by a plant trait that represents the position of a species along the plant economy spectrum in a future drier climate as projected by climate models for large parts of the globe ipcc 2019 our model suggests that recruitment limited plant communities could transition towards species at the slow end of the plant economy spectrum if water availability decreases or at the fast end if the

24633,with rapid urbanization some cities are integrating within urban agglomerations to obtain more opportunities for cooperation sustainable development of these agglomerations requires successful management of the material flows and this requires an in depth understanding of urban material consumption and its metabolic characteristics to describe these characteristics we used flow analysis factor decomposition coupling and decoupling status analysis and power law analysis to examine the metabolic characteristics of beijing tianjin langfang and tangshan central cities in the beijing tianjin hebei region we focused on the domestic material consumption dmc to analyze inter city differences in the material metabolism the driving factors responsible for these differences and each city s development characteristics beijing and langfang had similar material metabolic fluxes dmc as did tianjin and tangshan mainly from the construction and manufacturing sectors the economic size per capita gdp and population of the four cities were important drivers of material consumption but the contributions and trends varied among the cities three of the four cities except tianjin have achieved distinct decoupling between consumption growth and per capita gdp growth and the trends were dominated by relative decoupling 75 of the years beijing s and langfang s dmc become economies of scales as gdp per capita multiplies whereas tianjin s and tangshan s dmc increased simultaneously with increasing per capita gdp based on these differences in metabolic characteristics and driving factors we propose suggestions such as carefully regulating the manufacturing construction transportation and household sectors as well as implementing policies and technologies to conserve and recycle materials and energy thereby providing guidance for coordinated and more sustainable development of the beijing tianjin hebei region graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban metabolism material flow analysis urban metabolic consumption driving factors decoupling analysis beijing tianjin hebei region 1 introduction cities are home to a high proportion of a country s population they also represent a key component of the country s economic growth and their unique socioeconomic features play an increasingly important role in modern society the united nations united nations 2018 reports that the urban population accounted for 55 of the world s population in 2018 and this proportion is expected to reach 68 by 2050 although cities only account for 2 to 3 of the world s land area they account for about 75 of a country s consumption of natural resources and 67 of its consumption of fossil fuels and contribute more than 70 of global greenhouse gas emissions each year these facts reveal that successful urban management has become the key to sustainable development china s beijing tianjin hebei region is not only a core engine for development of the bohai economic rim but is also one of china s three strategic zones for implementation of measures to foster domestic economic development beijing tianjin tangshan and langfang as the four key cities in the core development zone of the beijing tianjin hebei region are crucial for successful implementation of the government s coordinated development for the beijing tianjin hebei region strategy beijing the core city has undergone rapid urbanization tianjin a key industrial city has undergone rapid industrialization tangshan is rich in coal resources so its steel industry has been well developed langfang located in the beijing tianjin corridor will also play an important role for economic development in this region the economic development of tangshan and langfang is among the intermediate or above level in hebei province and it is likely that the same urbanization problems experienced by beijing and tianjin will also affect these cities however the four cities have different resource and environmental problems due to differences in their resource potential industrial structure and development rate to solve the problems described above it is necessary to understand the consumption of resources the flows that sustain this consumption and the consequences of the consumption an affective way to accomplish this is to consider cities based on the analogy with the flows in a living organism i e from the perspective of urban metabolism this approach lets us explore the city s consumption characteristics from a metabolic perspective analyze the dependence of material consumption on urban population growth and economic development and identify the main drivers behind these processes such an analysis will provide scientific support for efforts to optimize resource utilization efficiency and each city s metabolic structure urban metabolism describes the material and energy supply processes and the resulting output processes products and wastes within an urban system the background of this approach is the need to understand the constraints created by a limited supply of resources and the environmental pollution created during urban development this understanding can reveal effective ways to assess and redesign the resources a city needs to survive and ways to make its development more sustainable early scholars used a black box approach in which inputs and outputs were quantified for the city as a whole rather than for its internal components wolman 1965 zucchetto 1975 with deeper understanding of urban metabolism the black box has been opened to reveal the storage and flows of resources among a city s components and the cycling of inputs and outputs among these components can reflect the hierarchical relationships brunner 2007 douglas 1981 however these studies were largely static i e they examined the metabolism at a given point in time rather than its changes over time since then urban metabolic research has become a research hotspot the creation of network models wang and chen 2016 zhang et al 2010 quantification of the dynamics of the flows bratteb√∏ et al 2009 lundin and morrison 2002 and description of their spatial distribution krausmann et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 have compensated for the inadequacy of the original static analyses some scholars have refined the accounting methods to provide an in depth explanation of the metabolic processes i e inputs and outputs imports and exports of the interactions among the components of an urban system hu and mu 2018 zhang et al 2014 of the quantities of specific materials qu et al 2012 th√©riault and laroche 2009 and of the quantities of specific elements villarroel walker and beck 2012 xia et al 2017 other researchers have evaluated the characteristics of an urban metabolism such as its strength barles 2010 bristow and kennedy 2013 and efficiency marull et al 2010 or have analyzed the driving factors li et al 2019 liang and zhang 2011 including studies from an interdisciplinary perspective newman 1999 many of these studies have examined trends in these factors over time and have thus been dynamic more recently scholars focused on urban metabolisms with different scales and territories laschefski 2019 pulido barrera et al 2018 attempted to develop a more standard accounting model for practical use papageorgiou et al 2020 perrotti 2019 wang et al 2020 and attempted to design more sustainable cities davoudi and sturzaker 2017 thomson and newman 2018 as a result new fields of research have emerged such as political industrial ecology newell et al 2017 the theoretical basis for urban metabolism and the methods for studying it have been continuously improved leading to the evaluation of more diverse factors and expansion of the research scale standardization of methods and deepening of the analysis have become common in recent research and appear to be the future direction of this field material flow analysis mfa is a widely used method in urban metabolic research mfa originated in europe in the 20th century and was first applied to developed countries in the 1990s then was introduced to developing countries with the support of the world resource institute adriaanse et al 1997 matthews et al 2000 to promote standardization of the mfa method eurostat published a guide eurostat 2001 currently national scale mfa research has matured but research at a regional level has not yet developed a unified framework due to the limited data availability or data quality although a great number of scholars have narrowed the research scale to cities bahers et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and urban agglomerations fragkias et al 2013 virtanen et al 2019 researchers have developed models that link human activities with environmental conditions by coupling socioeconomic factors with mfa binder 2007a 2007b or by establishing a flow and stock model niza et al 2009 these models have contributed greatly to improving the computational accuracy of mfa and standardizing the methods therefore it has become increasingly necessary to follow a standard framework for coupling mfa with socioeconomic factors to allow comparisons between studies however the identification and quantification of all factors that potentially control the flows remains challenging it is difficult to define the points where materials enter or leave a component of the metabolic system and this makes it difficult to design appropriate control schemes index decomposition analysis is now frequently used to identify the driving factors behind material flows and the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi method is particularly useful in this context in this method an aggregate quantity is divided into several factors that contribute to changes in the aggregate ang 2005 this method has relatively small data requirements and strong applicability hoekstra and van der bergh 2003 and it can completely decompose the remaining items as a result it has been used extensively ang 2004 since its introduction many scholars have used the lmdi decomposition model to achieve breakthroughs in understanding of carbon emissions and energy consumption bhattacharyya and ussanarassamee 2004 wang et al 2005 and the approach has been developed to support the study of specific materials such as water geng et al 2014 food xu et al 2015 and particulate matter smaller than 2 5 ¬µm in diameter pm2 5 zhang et al 2019 research has also been done at a small scale usually with a focus on a specific industry especially for industries or sectors with high consumption and emission such as manufacturing liu et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 and transportation lu et al 2007 wang et al 2011 researchers have also focused on sectors responsible for economic growth such as commerce wang and lin 2017 and building tan et al 2018 more recently researchers have begun to focus on the overall industrial structure fern√°ndez gonz√°lez et al 2015 liu et al 2012 this literature review shows that research on the quantitative decomposition of changes in the flows of a certain material or in a certain industry using the lmdi method is relatively mature but this approach has been rarely applied to the analysis of metabolic processes with a focus on the overall socioeconomic impact on a city composed of multiple sectors li et al 2019 thus there is little theoretical support for managing industrial transformations it is increasingly urgent to understand how socioeconomic development depends on material consumption one possible way to solve this problem is decoupling analysis the concept of decoupling analysis came from physics where it represents the measurement of simultaneous relative trends for two or more physical quantities the decoupling state was first introduced by german scholars von weizs√§cker 1989 and later was defined as using less sic resources per unit of economic output and reducing the environmental impact of any resources that are used or economic activities that are undertaken united nations 2011 the approach can be further divided into resource decoupling and impact decoupling in the context of the present study we focused on an analysis of resource decoupling by describing the divergence of the trend for a city s material consumption from the trend for its per capita gdp growth if gdp grows faster than material consumption then resource utilization efficiency is increasing and this may increase sustainability the organization for economic co operation and development built a decoupling model to support research on agricultural policies oecd 2002 in which they divided the relative decoupling status from the absolute decoupling status to more clearly quantify the relative trends a few years later tapio 2005 proposed a concept of elasticity in the calculation of decoupling by introducing an intermediate value they changed a single decoupling index into several decoupling indexes and then divided the decoupling into eight states thus improving the power of this approach the tapio model has been improved continuously resulting in the birth of numerous decoupling index calculation methods among which index decomposition analysis based on the lmdi zhang and wang 2013 is the most frequently used making the division of decoupling states more closely associated with socioeconomic conditions decoupling analysis has been widely used to study subjects such as material consumption q wang et al 2019 the circular economy qiu et al 2011 and pollution emission song and zhang 2019 because changes in complex systems such as a metabolism are often non linear the power law can quantitatively describe the dynamic relationship between urban material resources and development status the results have strong predictive power bettencourt et al 2007 models based on a power law have been widely used in many areas of research such as energy consumption poumanyvong and kaneko 2010 pollutant emissions lamsal et al 2013 and the change of cities built up area chen and feng 2017 many aspects of life have been described in this manner but most studies have focused on multi city cross sectional data or single city sequential data a recently published paper depersin and barthelemy 2018 explored the difference in fitting between the relationship of delay due to traffic congestion and population for all cities in a group and the values for individual cities in a long term sequence and found that despite similar trends different cities follow different development paths therefore a comparative analysis of a city s dynamics over a period of time is necessary especially in multi city case studies since this approach will more clearly reveal the processes that constrain and drive a city s development this will let urban planners propose more appropriate measures targeted at specific problems in recent years a serious shortage of materials and resources has begun to develop and combining mfa with decoupling analysis and power law analysis should provide insights into how to solve these shortages in the present study we developed an mfa framework that accounts for multiple materials and sectors and used the framework to analyze the metabolic characteristics of four cities with different characteristics in the beijing tianjin hebei region and the material consumption structure and contribution of each city s sectors as the cities were at different developmental stages we also used factor decomposition to calculate the contribution of each metabolic driving factor by combining identification of the key factors with the city s metabolic consumption characteristics we carried out decoupling analysis to develop a power law relationship between material consumption and urban development the multi city comparison provides more information about different city types to enhance our collection of urban metabolic data and provide a practical framework for classifying and managing the development of urban agglomerations 2 methodology based on the eu s ew mfa framework eurostat 2018 the characteristics of material utilization in the beijing tianjin hebei region and the availability of data for the four cities we divided the socioeconomic sectors of the four cities into six metabolic components li et al 2019 agriculture mining manufacturing household consumption construction and transportation we then obtained data on the consumption of biomass metal ores non metallic minerals fossil fuels and industrial products by the six sectors it should be noted that we excluded water and wastewater flows although they are included in the eu s framework their weight for any city is so much greater than the weights of the other kinds of materials by several orders of magnitude in some cases that accounting for water and wastewater flows would hide the important roles of the other materials fig 1 shows the resulting accounting framework for the urban metabolism of the four cities to explore the characteristics of the material inputs and outputs as well as the associated consumption and emission structures the accounting system required us to clearly define the boundaries of the system being studied to do so we chose the physical and administrative boundaries of the cities we do not discuss the flows between cities because data on these flows was unavailable among the sectors agriculture and mining introduce resources to the socioeconomic subsystem together they supply biomass metal ores non metallic minerals and fossil fuels to other sectors but the agriculture sector also provided agricultural products i e food to the household consumption sector manufacturing played an important role in the urban metabolism as it required both natural resources and intermediate products such as raw materials which it then converted into industrial products for consumption the household consumption construction and transportation sectors represented consumers as they all require materials from the other sectors to ensure their regular operation in addition we accounted for imports from and exports to the system s external environment as these were meaningful for metabolic processes in almost all sectors based on our accounting for the flows in the urban metabolism we integrated the consumption of each metabolic component imports local extraction exports as the domestic material consumption dmc index as dmc is closely connected with socioeconomic indicators we constructed a decomposition model to analyze how dmc was driven by the urban consumption structure i e which sectors consumed which materials and the intensity i e the average material consumption per unit gdp industrial structure i e the percentage of total gdp accounted for by each sector s gdp economic scale i e per capita gdp and population size li et al 2019 1 m t œÉ i j m t i j œÉ i j m t i j m t i m t i g d p t i g d p t i g d p t g d p t p t p t where t represents the year i represents the sector j represents the material pt represents the population in year t mtij represents the consumption of material j by sector i in year t mti represents the total consumption by sector i in year t gdpti represents the gross domestic product gdp of sector i in year t and gdpt represents the city s gdp in year t based on the availability of data and the desire to choose sufficiently long periods to reveal changes in consumption over time we divided our data into three periods 2000 to 2005 2005 to 2010 and 2010 to 2015 using the delta Œ¥ value to represent the difference between the first year and the last year in each period we divided the driving forces into a structure effect the consumption structure and industrial structure a size effect the economic size and population size and an intensity effect consumption intensity we constructed a model based on tapio s 2005 decoupling model to reveal relationships between metabolic characteristics and socioeconomic development of the four cities in this context decoupling means a divergence in the growth trends for two variables in the present study consumption and per capita gdp our model was based on the changes in dmc and per capita gdp which represent respectively the pressure on the environment and the intensity of socioeconomic development we used these data to define the elastic decoupling index edi 2 e d i Œ¥ d m c Œ¥ g d p where Œ¥dmc and Œ¥gdp represent the change in dmc and per capita gdp because we divided the study into three 5 year periods the changes could be expressed as follows 3 Œ¥ dmc dm c p 1 dm c p dm c p Œ¥ gdp gd p p 1 gd p p gd p p where p represents the value at the start of period p and p 1 represents the value at the end of that period the decoupling status can be visualized based on the quadrant map by zhang et al 2017 in fig 2 the horizontal and vertical axes of the map represent the growth rates of per capita gdp and dmc respectively and the slopes of the lines separate the different types of coupling and decoupling considering the potential for misleading information due to inaccuracies in the data we assumed that transitions within 10 of the boundary lines should not be recognized as the coupling or decoupling status may not be distinct in addition we used a power law equation bettencourt et al 2007 to analyze the quantitative relationship between dmc and per capita gdp during the development process of each city to explore the relationship between the state of material consumption and the stage of urban development the formula is as follows 4 y t y 0 n t Œ≤ where y t represents the measurement standard for consumption of material resources at time t and represents dmc in the present study y 0 is the normalization constant n t is the per capita gdp and Œ≤ is the scaling index which reflects the general dynamic behavior of the urban system Œ≤ 1 is sub linear Œ≤ 1 is near linear and Œ≤ 1 is super linear we obtained the data we used in this study from government statistical yearbooks published from 2000 to 2016 the beijing statistical yearbook bmbs 2001 2016 the tianjin statistical yearbook tianjin mbs 2001 2016 the economic statistical yearbook of langfang lmbs 2001 2016 and the tangshan statistical yearbook tangshan mbs 2001 2016 we obtained any data that were missing from these yearbooks from the cnki china economic and social development statistics database https data cnki net and the eps data platform https www epsnet com cn index html where data were missing for 1 or 2 years we obtained the values using linear interpolation between the years before and after the missing data when data were missing for more than three consecutive years we estimated their value based on the ratio of the output value of the sector to the value for comparable sectors in other years or in other cities consumption of local material was estimated based on the material balance principle that is consumption of locally supplied material equaled total consumption minus the imports of that material we assumed that locally mined or produced materials would be preferentially allocated to meet local needs and any needs that could not be met locally were imported the missing data that had to be estimated or assumed amounted to about 10 of the total when local production exceeded local demand the excess material was allocated to sectors in the orders shown in supplementary text s1 because the units of measurement differed among the materials e g mass units for rocks and sand volume units for oil and gas it was necessary to convert all values to the same units mt so that they could be combined in the accounting 3 results 3 1 analysis of consumption and the consumption structure the consumption increase differed among the four cities but there were pairs with similar patterns fig 3 beijing and langfang had relatively slow growth with consumption that increased to 1 8 and 2 7 times the 2000 value respectively whereas tianjin and tangshan grew much faster with consumption that increased to 6 4 and 10 9 times the 2000 value respectively non metallic minerals was the main material category consumed by beijing and langfang and biomass consumption was also prominent for langfang metal ores was the main material category consumed to support dmc growth in tianjin and tangshan but growth of the other types of materials in tangshan was faster than that in tianjin the construction and manufacturing sectors were the main sectors that consumed materials in beijing and langfang and the manufacturing sector also played a leading role in tianjin and tangshan the growth rates of dmc in beijing and langfang were similar both increased to less than 3 times the 2000 value but the scales were quite different langfang s consumption was roughly one third of beijing s consumption although the difference has been decreasing during this period the dominant material consumption category in beijing and langfang was non metallic minerals which accounted for 54 and 34 of total consumption respectively and beijing s growth of consumption of non metallic minerals to about 2 2 times the 2000 level was consistent with the overall increase of dmc although the increased consumption of non metallic minerals in langfang to about 8 5 times the 2000 level was much higher than that in beijing consumption of other materials was relatively flat which slowed the overall growth rate of dmc in langfang in addition langfang s consumption of biomass and fossil fuels accounted for 36 and 17 of total consumption respectively and remained relatively constant creating a similar stabilizing effect moreover langfang s consumption of industrial products which increased to about 19 7 times the 2000 level and metal ores to about 11 3 times the 2000 level increased greatly but due to their small proportion of the total the effects on dmc growth were not obvious the dmc values in tianjin and tangshan were comparable in size the latter was about 1 4 times the former and both grew rapidly to about 6 4 and 10 9 times the 2000 level respectively the consumption of metal ores was the dominant form of consumption increasing to about 14 5 and 20 8 times the 2000 level respectively the absolute amounts were larger than those of any other type of materials and accounted for the largest proportion of dmc 48 and 69 respectively in 2015 for tianjin other types of material consumption also increased and supported the growth of dmc but both the proportions and the absolute increase were much less than those for metal ores which slowed dmc growth to some extent for tangshan biomass consumption remained relatively constant increasing to about 1 2 times the 2000 level and the increased consumption of non metallic minerals to about 4 8 times the 2000 level was similar to that in tianjin and there were also large increases in tangshan s consumption of industrial products to about 19 5 times the 2000 level and fossil fuels to about 8 0 times the 2000 level resulting in a larger increase of dmc than in tianjin 3 2 contributions of the socioeconomic drivers fig 4 shows that the size effects economic size and population size strongly drove the growth of dmc in the four cities with the economic sizes having a stronger influence than population the intensity effect consumption intensity was also a strong driver though the direction of the effect was negative for beijing and tianjin i e decreased consumption due to increased efficiency positive for langfang and changed from positive to negative for tangshan the structure effect consumption structure and industrial structure had intermediate strength but generally increased the dmc value the structure effect was generally stronger than the intensity effect the size effect increased consumption dmc in the four cities during the study the influence of beijing s economic size decreased continuously with contributions of 47 30 and 25 of the total respectively during the three periods whereas the contribution of population size increased to about 12 25 and 40 of the total the overall contribution of the size effect was at least 50 of the total in the four cities throughout the study period the economic size effect was also the primary driver of dmc in tianjin but with a decreasing contribution to 87 61 and 51 however the population size effect in tianjin differed slightly from that in beijing since it initially increased dmc and then stabilized the population size had a small effect during the early period a 4 contribution but it became much more important during the middle and late periods 20 and 28 contributions the economic size effect was strongest in langfang and tangshan with an initial decrease and then an increase for langfang to 69 50 and 61 versus an initial increase and then a decrease for tangshan to 65 76 and 62 the effects of population size in langfang and tangshan were totally different the contribution increased for tangshan but remained less than 8 of the total in all three periods whereas the value was stable at around 18 for langfang the intensity effect varied from city to city in beijing it played a negative role throughout the study period but the strength of the effect decreased over time with contributions of 40 29 and 10 of the total in the other three cities the intensity effect caused both promotion and inhibition of consumption for tianjin the intensity effect increased dmc slightly in the early period and strongly decreased dmc in the middle and late periods with contributions of 4 15 and 19 this indicated that the inhibitory effect was increasing steadily reflecting an improvement of tianjin s material utilization efficiency although the intensity effect increased dmc in langfang and decreased it in tangshan it showed a general transition from promotion of consumption to inhibition it s also worth noting that the material consumption intensity of langfang greatly increased dmc in the middle period the structural effect changed between increasing and decreasing consumption but was weaker than the other effects the industrial structure effect was more prominent than the consumption structure effect during the study period the industrial structure increased dmc growth in beijing and the effect during the late period a contribution of 25 was similar to that of the population size effect and was much stronger than that in the early period 1 and the middle period 6 at the same time the consumption structure effect less than 1 was increasing for tianjin and tangshan the effects of the industrial structure were both an initial stability or promotion of consumption followed by inhibition with contributions of 4 5 and 2 for tianjin and 8 12 and 3 for tangshan in contrast the consumption structure effect decreased throughout the study to less than 1 of the total the industrial structure effect in langfang was variable with initial promotion of consumption followed by inhibition and then promotion again however in terms of its contribution the significant growth during the late period to more than 4 times that in the early and middle periods was close to the effect of population size in addition the consumption structure effect in langfang was more obvious than that in the other three cities with an initial decrease followed by a decrease and then an increase and contributed about 7 of the total in the last period 3 3 power law analysis our analysis of the strengths of the drivers in section 3 2 showed that the size effect was the primary driver of dmc growth in the four cities to understand how economic growth is related to material consumption it is necessary to explore the coupling and decoupling between dmc and per capita gdp to support efforts to optimize urban material utilization efficiency fig 5 shows that three of the four cities except tianjin have achieved a distinct decoupling status and a trend of reduced material consumption with three kinds of decoupling status relative decoupling 75 of the years expansive decoupling 17 and weak absolute decoupling 8 it is worth noting that in some periods tianjin throughout the study and langfang during the first two periods the edi was in the transition range between coupling and decoupling therefore the status may not be distinct fig 6 shows the results of the power law analysis for the relationship between dmc and per capita gdp the regression analyses produced a moderate to strong statistically significant positive relationship between the two variables r 2 0 51 p 0 05 the slope of the curve i e the increase in dmc per unit increase of per capita gdp was greatest for tangshan followed by tianjin and langfang and was lowest for beijing beijing s per capita gdp increased continuously reaching 4 6 times the 2000 value dmc grew more slowly reaching only 1 8 times the 2000 value beijing therefore showed relative decoupling throughout the study period in detail beijing s elastic decoupling index edi the change in dmc per unit change in per capita gdp increased throughout the study period 0 20 0 40 and 0 42 during the three periods which reflected a slight decrease in material utilization efficiency in the range where relative decoupling occurred beijing showed a low edi value which means that it consumed less material to achieve economic growth therefore beijing s scaling index Œ≤ was only 0 27 which represents a sub linear relationship indicating that every time gdp per capita increases by some multiple the additional dmc consumed by the city continues to decrease in langfang dmc was relatively tortuous but eventually increased to 2 7 times the 2000 value and the per capita gdp increased more rapidly reaching 5 2 times the 2000 value langfang showed a transition from relative decoupling to weak absolute decoupling in the first two stages edi was 0 9 which is at the boundary between relative decoupling and weak absolute decoupling but in the third stage edi was only 0 2 which represents weak absolute decoupling although the three stages all showed reductions in material consumption dmc during the period with weak absolute decoupling decreased while per capita gdp increased indicating that socioeconomic development relied less heavily on specific types of material consumption this also meant that the pressure on the environment decreased somewhat and the material utilization efficiency improved the scaling index for langfang Œ≤ 0 67 also represented a sub linear relationship but the value was about 2 5 times that of beijing in addition the power law regression showed that langfang s dmc in the second stage was higher than the theoretical expectation that is the edi value should have been lower in the relative decoupling range which suggests that there is a deviation between the actual development and the predicted path in tianjin and tangshan dmc growth was relatively rapid to 6 4 times the 2000 value for tianjin versus 10 9 times for tangshan and the trend for per capita gdp was also significant to 6 3 times the 2000 value for tianjin versus 6 0 times for tangshan both cities showed no decoupling or a limited decoupling status tianjin showed no distinct decoupling throughout the study period with a gradually decreasing edi to 1 1 1 0 and 0 9 indicating that the city s material utilization efficiency improved but that there was still much room for improvement compared with beijing in contrast during the early part of the study period tangshan s edi 2 9 was about 2 6 times that in tianjin but in the middle and late parts of the study period tangshan s edi decreased to 0 8 and 1 0 which were similar to the values in tianjin indicating that the material utilization efficiency in tangshan improved greatly and continuously during the study period the edi values for tianjin and tangshan were generally higher than that of beijing and langfang so the scaling index of both cities showed near linear relationships Œ≤ 0 98 and 1 10 respectively representing a situation in which dmc increased simultaneously with the per capita gdp the scaling index of tangshan was slightly higher than that of tianjin because the edi of tangshan was larger than that of tianjin during the first stage raising the overall level the power law regression showed that tangshan was divided into two sections with 2003 as the boundary the fourth data point in the figure indicating that tangshan reversed its original development path and became more economical in scale in that year this was also why the edi values of tianjin and tangshan were similar during the latter two stages of our study period 4 discussion according to our analysis the urban metabolic features differed among the different city types to clarify the pattern we compared per capita consumption in the four cities we studied with values from other parts of the world to reveal differences in the characteristics of their urban development fig 7 these examples varied in the time period economic and population levels and industrial characteristics but because the consumption values were expressed as per capita values they nonetheless permitted simplistic comparisons that may reveal the future states of our four chinese cities the united states and tangshan had the highest per capita consumption at around 84 t followed by seven cities with values of more than 30 t uzbekistan s per capita dmc was lowest at 2 t and taiwan madrid paris and cape town had per capita dmc less than 6 t there was a difference of 82 t between the highest and lowest per capita consumption and the highest level was about 41 times the lowest for the four cities in the present study per capita dmc was relatively high in tangshan and tianjin mainly due to the domination of the two cities by manufacturing about 63 and 37 of gdp respectively in fact other study areas with similar industrial characteristics also had high per capita material consumption e g germany and japan and large increases in the consumption of metal ores have also been seen in the czech republic and poland tianjin and tangshan had similar consumption structures driving factors and development status so the reason for the large difference in their per capita dmc is not obvious tianjin s per capita dmc was less than half of that of tangshan the main reason appears to be the population difference tianjin had a much higher population than tangshan in 2000 and tianjin experienced rapid population growth in 2015 tangshan s population about 7 8 million was about half that of tianjin 15 5 million beijing s per capita dmc was in the middle of the other countries although manufacturing was also its leading industry 57 of gdp most of the city s material consumption was related to the construction and household consumption sectors at the same time beijing had a higher material utilization efficiency in recent years so the per capita dmc was well controlled langfang had the smallest per capita dmc among the four cities 10 t and represents a typical transitional economy with industrial transformation to advanced and clustered manufacturing guided by government policy however it is worth noting that per capita dmc in other areas e g the czech republic and malm√∂ with similar transitional characteristics was higher which may be due to the high consumption by industrial production in the two latter areas the smaller city size and the importance of agriculture 22 of gdp are likely why the per capita dmc of langfang was lower than that of similar cities from a socioeconomic perspective there were differences in the main driving factors for dmc in the four cities the economic size was the primary factor but its driving strength gradually decreased with increasing industrialization which was consistent with previous research on energy consumption and carbon emissions which are common areas for lmdi research for example guo and meng 2019 showed that the driving effect of economic scale was similar to the environmental kuznets curve in fact the effect of economic size reflects improvements of the quality of economic development and of residents living standards achour and belloumi 2016 therefore for langfang and tangshan which were undergoing accelerated urbanization their dmc growth which was driven by economic size might appear to show different long term trends the factors used in the present study involved the key components of socioeconomic systems population gdp but reflected the study s focus on material consumption these factors can characterize other socioeconomic drivers such as inequalities of consumption deindustrialization versus servicization of the economy to some extent but do not account for the effects of geographical characteristics such as climate and access to market at the same time the population size also played a significant role in promoting the growth of dmc in beijing and tianjin which had the largest populations of the four cities the driving effect of population increased during the study period and in the late part of the study period the contribution of population in beijing exceeded the economic size effect these phenomena were related at least in part to the jobs and development opportunities created by the 2008 olympic games in beijing and construction of the binhai new area in tianjin however the population increase exacerbated pressure on the environment the intensity effect was a key inhibitor of consumption although the trends differed among the cities they generally showed a tendency for the intensity effect to inhibit consumption or to show a transition from promotion of consumption to inhibition the intensity effect slowed the growth of dmc to a certain extent although a reversal of the growing consumption caused by the size effect has not yet appeared this reversal has been observed in some developed countries fern√°ndez gonz√°lez et al 2014 and is therefore likely to also occur in china in the future by analyzing the dependence of material consumption on the most important drivers we assessed the coupling or decoupling between consumption and gdp growth in the four cities at present all cities except tianjin have achieved decoupling of dmc from per capita gdp in our framework and relative decoupling was the dominant status 25 of the years during the study period this suggests a decreasing pressure on the environment during economic growth but doesn t mean that all environmental issues will soon been solved the decoupling status is one of the requirements of sustainable development but the four cities must still work to reduce dmc by setting goals and developing specific measures to meet those goals in fact our results could be affected by the accounting framework we developed because it does not account for all environmental impacts of consumption and economic growth i e we did not study the indirect environment impacts as stated in the eu s handbook 2018 the raw material consumption rmc represents the domestic final use of products and it can be used to analyze which final products have the largest impact on material extraction and hence the largest material footprint this indicates that the rmc is not bound to the dmc but depends more on imports and exports so a city can see its dmc increase while rmc simultaneously increases this problem must be solved in future research due to its high material utilization efficiency beijing remained in a decoupling status during the last two parts of the study period however utilization efficiency decreased slightly so the dependence on consumption of materials is increasing langfang was in a decoupling status only during the last part of the study period owing to a high agricultural contribution to the industrial structure recent research suggests that new technologies could be promoted and implemented more easily in agriculture than in the other sectors leal et al 2019 however in langfang the contribution of agriculture was decreasing while the contributions of construction and manufacturing were growing so the decoupling status is not stable tianjin and tangshan had a larger scale of the manufacturing sector than in the other cities leading to high material consumption however tianjin exhibited a transition between coupling and decoupling during the study period whereas tangshan exhibited decoupling right from the start of the study period power law analysis suggests that cities of different sizes should be scaled versions of one another and that they have similar laws that govern their development however our results show that even when the per capita gdp of the four cities is at or near the same level the scaling index differs among the cities for example beijing has a relatively mature manufacturing industry and is beginning to transform into a service oriented city whereas langfang is facing a transition from agriculture to industry the scaling index of these two cities represents a sub linear relationship although langfang s index is 2 5 times beijing s index the two cities show different goodness of fit for the power law regressions with r 2 0 51 for beijing and r 2 0 81 for langfang tianjin and tangshan are industrial cities dominated by the manufacturing sector and their scaling indices both showed a near linear relationship both Œ≤ values are around 1 and the goodness of fit of the power law regression was high with r 2 0 99 for tianjin and r 2 0 94 for tangshan this indicates that cities can be more accurately described as a scaled version of another city with similar characteristics and not a scaled version of a city with different characteristics which provides important information for the future classification of more than 300 prefecture level cities in china our results for Œ≤ are different from the relationship between mass and volume with Œ≤ 3 4 in biological allometric growth theory west et al 1997 and they do not fully fit the finding that relationships based on a city s material infrastructure are mostly sub linear bettencourt et al 2007 in fact scholars have explored many relationships including those for energy use ramaswami et al 2018 pollutant emission zhao et al 2018 the city s built up area lang et al 2019 and wages lobo et al 2020 and have found that cities at different development stages or with different income levels have different scaling indices poumanyvong and kaneko 2010 ramaswami et al 2018 this suggests that the scaling law for cities represents an evolutionary rule that changes as the nature of the development changes rather than an invariable one chen and feng 2017 our findings agree with previous research in which the analysis revealed the potential for urban self organization schiller 2016 and can therefore be influenced by government policies this explains why the scaling indices for cities fall within a range of values rather than having a specific number as in the case of biological allometric growth theory therefore although the four cities had achieved some improvement in their efficiency of material use during the study period they differed in their coupling or decoupling status because of rapid economic and population growth in all four cities they will all face development problems that might prevent or threaten the decoupling similar studies dai and liu 2018 q wang et al 2019 wu et al 2018 have also indicated that the study area has usually experienced relative decoupling for periods as long as 50 years with fluctuations then gradually evolved into a state of absolute decoupling therefore the four cities will need to optimize the organization of their technological industrial and economic growth to achieve absolute decoupling a lack of statistical data made it possible to obtain some of the data we analyzed only by converting output values and population size from cities with similar industrial structures and the sectoral distribution of various materials was based on artificial choices that could be affected by a certain subjectivity in fact the conversion coefficients used to calculated each kind of material consumptions may not have accurately reflected the actual conversion coefficients in our four cities as we used values obtained in previous studies and these values may not accurately reflect the current status for example industrial technology has become more efficient so the present material requirements might be lower than the values used in our accounting at the same time the lack of accurate data may have made some cities too similar blurring the differences in their development characteristics mfa can display material processes more intuitively than input output tables but requires more data future research should obtain additional and more accurate data through methods such as telephone consultations field interviews and more accurate allocation of various materials based on field research to clarify their flows supported by efforts to obtain more current values for the conversion coefficients the resulting metabolic accounting framework would be more consistent with the actual situation and would provide better support for management of cities in addition we could not identify whether the decoupling status was derived primarily from the contribution of a single industry within a given sector or from contributions by multiple industries in the future decoupling analysis should be combined with an analysis of key industries in each sector to improve our ability to identify the city s metabolic characteristics and metabolic problems more accurately based on the above discussion and the city status management of the four cities can be optimized by adopting the following approaches on the one hand the regulation and control of sectors with high material consumption should be strengthened the manufacturing and construction sectors play important roles in the industrial structures of the four cities and are therefore key targets for regulation to improve the material utilization efficiency for example architects should be encouraged to design structures that are more compact and that generate less construction waste since the consumption of non metallic minerals was prominent in the four cities in addition the wastes from the construction sector should be collected for reuse wherever this is feasible in addition cities with less advanced manufacturing industries should provide incentives for factories to adopt cleaner and more efficient machines and to redesign their material and energy supply systems to conserve and recycle resources such strategies could mitigate problems such as the large increase in tangshan s fossil fuel consumption governments should also provide policy and financial support for enterprises that are willing to integrate their operations with those of other companies in eco industrial or industrial parks to share cleaner production facilities since the economic size effect was an important driver of consumption governments should offer specific grants or tax incentives to encourage more efficient consumption for industries with relatively advanced manufacturing it would be more appropriate to improve worker training to reduce the rate of products with unacceptable quality that must be remanufactured or thrown away as wastes in addition as a city s industrial structure changes e g decreasing manufacturing industries and increasing service industries as in beijing and as the standard of living for residents improves transportation will become an increasingly important sector for material consumption achour and belloumi 2016 this agrees with the present study in which the consumption of transportation services is growing in fact transportation integration was implemented as part of the in beijing tianjin hebei integration strategy in 2016 with the goal of improving the overall transportation network within the region for example a single public transit pass can now be used within the whole region and this has greatly encouraged people to choose public transportation instead of individual cars there is also a growing trend to promote the use of shared bikes the integration strategy also contains measures to control car use such as registration policies e g lotteries to award new car ownership permits and traffic regulations e g allowing cars with even numbered and odd numbered license plates to drive only on alternate days common vehicle emission standards and a requirement to use higher quality gasoline and oils to reduce pressure on the environment such policies will need support from fiscal policies supervision of operations and technology optimization on the other hand it will be necessary to develop and implement policies and technologies to improve energy conservation for example industry universities and researchers should work more closely together to improve production factors and encourage technological innovation specific measures could include government funding for relevant projects and the creation of simple safe and fast technology and knowledge transfer channels to encourage enterprises to adopt scientific research results to improve their production perhaps by starting with government affiliated institutions and state owned enterprises to provide examples of successful projects that will encourage the private sector to participate the promotion of new policies and technologies can significantly improve the efficiency of material use and reduce the intensity of material consumption thereby mitigating or reversing the magnitude of the intensity effect and its ability to increase dmc especially for high consumption sectors such as manufacturing in the meantime the household consumption sector deserves more attention although it is not currently the major consumption sector it will increasingly drive resource flows when construction stops and residents begin to improve their standard of living by increasing consumption the population effect is not negligible and its impact on dmc will only increase as residents demand better lives so increasing urban resident awareness through environmental education programs would be a great way to mitigate the impacts of this change 5 conclusion in this study we quantified the masses of the materials consumed by urban development from a metabolic perspective and combined mfa with data on socioeconomic factors to identify the importance of the driving factors that are responsible for material consumption this let us quantitatively describe the characteristics and rules of urban material consumption and the connection between these characteristics and the socioeconomic characteristics of four representative chinese cities the results provide scientific guidance for management and prediction of future development and will therefore support management decision making for the urban ecosystem of each city the domestic material consumption dmc of the four cities generally grew throughout the study period with beijing and langfang showing similar increases and structures as did tianjin and tangshan non metallic minerals was the main consumption category in beijing and langfang and the manufacturing and construction sectors most strongly affected the changes of dmc metal ores was the dominant category driving dmc changes in tianjin and tangshan and reflected the substantial growth of manufacturing in these cities the dmc of the four cities had similar driving factors although their magnitude varied among the cities the size effect strongly increased dmc growth primarily based on the economic size effect whereas the intensity effect generally slowed consumption growth except for tianjin which showed a slight transition from coupling to decoupling throughout the study period the cities achieved distinct decoupling between dmc and per capita gdp with relative decoupling as the dominant form the dmc of beijing and langfang became more efficient as per capita gdp increased whereas the dmc of tianjin and tangshan increased with increasing per capita gdp as the per capita gdp grew the growth rates of dmc in beijing and langfang were slower than that of tianjin and tangshan which both grew fast based on the results of our analysis we revealed several possible strategies to reduce dmc by the manufacturing construction transportation and household consumption sectors declaration of

24633,with rapid urbanization some cities are integrating within urban agglomerations to obtain more opportunities for cooperation sustainable development of these agglomerations requires successful management of the material flows and this requires an in depth understanding of urban material consumption and its metabolic characteristics to describe these characteristics we used flow analysis factor decomposition coupling and decoupling status analysis and power law analysis to examine the metabolic characteristics of beijing tianjin langfang and tangshan central cities in the beijing tianjin hebei region we focused on the domestic material consumption dmc to analyze inter city differences in the material metabolism the driving factors responsible for these differences and each city s development characteristics beijing and langfang had similar material metabolic fluxes dmc as did tianjin and tangshan mainly from the construction and manufacturing sectors the economic size per capita gdp and population of the four cities were important drivers of material consumption but the contributions and trends varied among the cities three of the four cities except tianjin have achieved distinct decoupling between consumption growth and per capita gdp growth and the trends were dominated by relative decoupling 75 of the years beijing s and langfang s dmc become economies of scales as gdp per capita multiplies whereas tianjin s and tangshan s dmc increased simultaneously with increasing per capita gdp based on these differences in metabolic characteristics and driving factors we propose suggestions such as carefully regulating the manufacturing construction transportation and household sectors as well as implementing policies and technologies to conserve and recycle materials and energy thereby providing guidance for coordinated and more sustainable development of the beijing tianjin hebei region graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords urban metabolism material flow analysis urban metabolic consumption driving factors decoupling analysis beijing tianjin hebei region 1 introduction cities are home to a high proportion of a country s population they also represent a key component of the country s economic growth and their unique socioeconomic features play an increasingly important role in modern society the united nations united nations 2018 reports that the urban population accounted for 55 of the world s population in 2018 and this proportion is expected to reach 68 by 2050 although cities only account for 2 to 3 of the world s land area they account for about 75 of a country s consumption of natural resources and 67 of its consumption of fossil fuels and contribute more than 70 of global greenhouse gas emissions each year these facts reveal that successful urban management has become the key to sustainable development china s beijing tianjin hebei region is not only a core engine for development of the bohai economic rim but is also one of china s three strategic zones for implementation of measures to foster domestic economic development beijing tianjin tangshan and langfang as the four key cities in the core development zone of the beijing tianjin hebei region are crucial for successful implementation of the government s coordinated development for the beijing tianjin hebei region strategy beijing the core city has undergone rapid urbanization tianjin a key industrial city has undergone rapid industrialization tangshan is rich in coal resources so its steel industry has been well developed langfang located in the beijing tianjin corridor will also play an important role for economic development in this region the economic development of tangshan and langfang is among the intermediate or above level in hebei province and it is likely that the same urbanization problems experienced by beijing and tianjin will also affect these cities however the four cities have different resource and environmental problems due to differences in their resource potential industrial structure and development rate to solve the problems described above it is necessary to understand the consumption of resources the flows that sustain this consumption and the consequences of the consumption an affective way to accomplish this is to consider cities based on the analogy with the flows in a living organism i e from the perspective of urban metabolism this approach lets us explore the city s consumption characteristics from a metabolic perspective analyze the dependence of material consumption on urban population growth and economic development and identify the main drivers behind these processes such an analysis will provide scientific support for efforts to optimize resource utilization efficiency and each city s metabolic structure urban metabolism describes the material and energy supply processes and the resulting output processes products and wastes within an urban system the background of this approach is the need to understand the constraints created by a limited supply of resources and the environmental pollution created during urban development this understanding can reveal effective ways to assess and redesign the resources a city needs to survive and ways to make its development more sustainable early scholars used a black box approach in which inputs and outputs were quantified for the city as a whole rather than for its internal components wolman 1965 zucchetto 1975 with deeper understanding of urban metabolism the black box has been opened to reveal the storage and flows of resources among a city s components and the cycling of inputs and outputs among these components can reflect the hierarchical relationships brunner 2007 douglas 1981 however these studies were largely static i e they examined the metabolism at a given point in time rather than its changes over time since then urban metabolic research has become a research hotspot the creation of network models wang and chen 2016 zhang et al 2010 quantification of the dynamics of the flows bratteb√∏ et al 2009 lundin and morrison 2002 and description of their spatial distribution krausmann et al 2003 zhang et al 2014 have compensated for the inadequacy of the original static analyses some scholars have refined the accounting methods to provide an in depth explanation of the metabolic processes i e inputs and outputs imports and exports of the interactions among the components of an urban system hu and mu 2018 zhang et al 2014 of the quantities of specific materials qu et al 2012 th√©riault and laroche 2009 and of the quantities of specific elements villarroel walker and beck 2012 xia et al 2017 other researchers have evaluated the characteristics of an urban metabolism such as its strength barles 2010 bristow and kennedy 2013 and efficiency marull et al 2010 or have analyzed the driving factors li et al 2019 liang and zhang 2011 including studies from an interdisciplinary perspective newman 1999 many of these studies have examined trends in these factors over time and have thus been dynamic more recently scholars focused on urban metabolisms with different scales and territories laschefski 2019 pulido barrera et al 2018 attempted to develop a more standard accounting model for practical use papageorgiou et al 2020 perrotti 2019 wang et al 2020 and attempted to design more sustainable cities davoudi and sturzaker 2017 thomson and newman 2018 as a result new fields of research have emerged such as political industrial ecology newell et al 2017 the theoretical basis for urban metabolism and the methods for studying it have been continuously improved leading to the evaluation of more diverse factors and expansion of the research scale standardization of methods and deepening of the analysis have become common in recent research and appear to be the future direction of this field material flow analysis mfa is a widely used method in urban metabolic research mfa originated in europe in the 20th century and was first applied to developed countries in the 1990s then was introduced to developing countries with the support of the world resource institute adriaanse et al 1997 matthews et al 2000 to promote standardization of the mfa method eurostat published a guide eurostat 2001 currently national scale mfa research has matured but research at a regional level has not yet developed a unified framework due to the limited data availability or data quality although a great number of scholars have narrowed the research scale to cities bahers et al 2019 wang et al 2019 and urban agglomerations fragkias et al 2013 virtanen et al 2019 researchers have developed models that link human activities with environmental conditions by coupling socioeconomic factors with mfa binder 2007a 2007b or by establishing a flow and stock model niza et al 2009 these models have contributed greatly to improving the computational accuracy of mfa and standardizing the methods therefore it has become increasingly necessary to follow a standard framework for coupling mfa with socioeconomic factors to allow comparisons between studies however the identification and quantification of all factors that potentially control the flows remains challenging it is difficult to define the points where materials enter or leave a component of the metabolic system and this makes it difficult to design appropriate control schemes index decomposition analysis is now frequently used to identify the driving factors behind material flows and the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi method is particularly useful in this context in this method an aggregate quantity is divided into several factors that contribute to changes in the aggregate ang 2005 this method has relatively small data requirements and strong applicability hoekstra and van der bergh 2003 and it can completely decompose the remaining items as a result it has been used extensively ang 2004 since its introduction many scholars have used the lmdi decomposition model to achieve breakthroughs in understanding of carbon emissions and energy consumption bhattacharyya and ussanarassamee 2004 wang et al 2005 and the approach has been developed to support the study of specific materials such as water geng et al 2014 food xu et al 2015 and particulate matter smaller than 2 5 ¬µm in diameter pm2 5 zhang et al 2019 research has also been done at a small scale usually with a focus on a specific industry especially for industries or sectors with high consumption and emission such as manufacturing liu et al 2007 zhao et al 2010 and transportation lu et al 2007 wang et al 2011 researchers have also focused on sectors responsible for economic growth such as commerce wang and lin 2017 and building tan et al 2018 more recently researchers have begun to focus on the overall industrial structure fern√°ndez gonz√°lez et al 2015 liu et al 2012 this literature review shows that research on the quantitative decomposition of changes in the flows of a certain material or in a certain industry using the lmdi method is relatively mature but this approach has been rarely applied to the analysis of metabolic processes with a focus on the overall socioeconomic impact on a city composed of multiple sectors li et al 2019 thus there is little theoretical support for managing industrial transformations it is increasingly urgent to understand how socioeconomic development depends on material consumption one possible way to solve this problem is decoupling analysis the concept of decoupling analysis came from physics where it represents the measurement of simultaneous relative trends for two or more physical quantities the decoupling state was first introduced by german scholars von weizs√§cker 1989 and later was defined as using less sic resources per unit of economic output and reducing the environmental impact of any resources that are used or economic activities that are undertaken united nations 2011 the approach can be further divided into resource decoupling and impact decoupling in the context of the present study we focused on an analysis of resource decoupling by describing the divergence of the trend for a city s material consumption from the trend for its per capita gdp growth if gdp grows faster than material consumption then resource utilization efficiency is increasing and this may increase sustainability the organization for economic co operation and development built a decoupling model to support research on agricultural policies oecd 2002 in which they divided the relative decoupling status from the absolute decoupling status to more clearly quantify the relative trends a few years later tapio 2005 proposed a concept of elasticity in the calculation of decoupling by introducing an intermediate value they changed a single decoupling index into several decoupling indexes and then divided the decoupling into eight states thus improving the power of this approach the tapio model has been improved continuously resulting in the birth of numerous decoupling index calculation methods among which index decomposition analysis based on the lmdi zhang and wang 2013 is the most frequently used making the division of decoupling states more closely associated with socioeconomic conditions decoupling analysis has been widely used to study subjects such as material consumption q wang et al 2019 the circular economy qiu et al 2011 and pollution emission song and zhang 2019 because changes in complex systems such as a metabolism are often non linear the power law can quantitatively describe the dynamic relationship between urban material resources and development status the results have strong predictive power bettencourt et al 2007 models based on a power law have been widely used in many areas of research such as energy consumption poumanyvong and kaneko 2010 pollutant emissions lamsal et al 2013 and the change of cities built up area chen and feng 2017 many aspects of life have been described in this manner but most studies have focused on multi city cross sectional data or single city sequential data a recently published paper depersin and barthelemy 2018 explored the difference in fitting between the relationship of delay due to traffic congestion and population for all cities in a group and the values for individual cities in a long term sequence and found that despite similar trends different cities follow different development paths therefore a comparative analysis of a city s dynamics over a period of time is necessary especially in multi city case studies since this approach will more clearly reveal the processes that constrain and drive a city s development this will let urban planners propose more appropriate measures targeted at specific problems in recent years a serious shortage of materials and resources has begun to develop and combining mfa with decoupling analysis and power law analysis should provide insights into how to solve these shortages in the present study we developed an mfa framework that accounts for multiple materials and sectors and used the framework to analyze the metabolic characteristics of four cities with different characteristics in the beijing tianjin hebei region and the material consumption structure and contribution of each city s sectors as the cities were at different developmental stages we also used factor decomposition to calculate the contribution of each metabolic driving factor by combining identification of the key factors with the city s metabolic consumption characteristics we carried out decoupling analysis to develop a power law relationship between material consumption and urban development the multi city comparison provides more information about different city types to enhance our collection of urban metabolic data and provide a practical framework for classifying and managing the development of urban agglomerations 2 methodology based on the eu s ew mfa framework eurostat 2018 the characteristics of material utilization in the beijing tianjin hebei region and the availability of data for the four cities we divided the socioeconomic sectors of the four cities into six metabolic components li et al 2019 agriculture mining manufacturing household consumption construction and transportation we then obtained data on the consumption of biomass metal ores non metallic minerals fossil fuels and industrial products by the six sectors it should be noted that we excluded water and wastewater flows although they are included in the eu s framework their weight for any city is so much greater than the weights of the other kinds of materials by several orders of magnitude in some cases that accounting for water and wastewater flows would hide the important roles of the other materials fig 1 shows the resulting accounting framework for the urban metabolism of the four cities to explore the characteristics of the material inputs and outputs as well as the associated consumption and emission structures the accounting system required us to clearly define the boundaries of the system being studied to do so we chose the physical and administrative boundaries of the cities we do not discuss the flows between cities because data on these flows was unavailable among the sectors agriculture and mining introduce resources to the socioeconomic subsystem together they supply biomass metal ores non metallic minerals and fossil fuels to other sectors but the agriculture sector also provided agricultural products i e food to the household consumption sector manufacturing played an important role in the urban metabolism as it required both natural resources and intermediate products such as raw materials which it then converted into industrial products for consumption the household consumption construction and transportation sectors represented consumers as they all require materials from the other sectors to ensure their regular operation in addition we accounted for imports from and exports to the system s external environment as these were meaningful for metabolic processes in almost all sectors based on our accounting for the flows in the urban metabolism we integrated the consumption of each metabolic component imports local extraction exports as the domestic material consumption dmc index as dmc is closely connected with socioeconomic indicators we constructed a decomposition model to analyze how dmc was driven by the urban consumption structure i e which sectors consumed which materials and the intensity i e the average material consumption per unit gdp industrial structure i e the percentage of total gdp accounted for by each sector s gdp economic scale i e per capita gdp and population size li et al 2019 1 m t œÉ i j m t i j œÉ i j m t i j m t i m t i g d p t i g d p t i g d p t g d p t p t p t where t represents the year i represents the sector j represents the material pt represents the population in year t mtij represents the consumption of material j by sector i in year t mti represents the total consumption by sector i in year t gdpti represents the gross domestic product gdp of sector i in year t and gdpt represents the city s gdp in year t based on the availability of data and the desire to choose sufficiently long periods to reveal changes in consumption over time we divided our data into three periods 2000 to 2005 2005 to 2010 and 2010 to 2015 using the delta Œ¥ value to represent the difference between the first year and the last year in each period we divided the driving forces into a structure effect the consumption structure and industrial structure a size effect the economic size and population size and an intensity effect consumption intensity we constructed a model based on tapio s 2005 decoupling model to reveal relationships between metabolic characteristics and socioeconomic development of the four cities in this context decoupling means a divergence in the growth trends for two variables in the present study consumption and per capita gdp our model was based on the changes in dmc and per capita gdp which represent respectively the pressure on the environment and the intensity of socioeconomic development we used these data to define the elastic decoupling index edi 2 e d i Œ¥ d m c Œ¥ g d p where Œ¥dmc and Œ¥gdp represent the change in dmc and per capita gdp because we divided the study into three 5 year periods the changes could be expressed as follows 3 Œ¥ dmc dm c p 1 dm c p dm c p Œ¥ gdp gd p p 1 gd p p gd p p where p represents the value at the start of period p and p 1 represents the value at the end of that period the decoupling status can be visualized based on the quadrant map by zhang et al 2017 in fig 2 the horizontal and vertical axes of the map represent the growth rates of per capita gdp and dmc respectively and the slopes of the lines separate the different types of coupling and decoupling considering the potential for misleading information due to inaccuracies in the data we assumed that transitions within 10 of the boundary lines should not be recognized as the coupling or decoupling status may not be distinct in addition we used a power law equation bettencourt et al 2007 to analyze the quantitative relationship between dmc and per capita gdp during the development process of each city to explore the relationship between the state of material consumption and the stage of urban development the formula is as follows 4 y t y 0 n t Œ≤ where y t represents the measurement standard for consumption of material resources at time t and represents dmc in the present study y 0 is the normalization constant n t is the per capita gdp and Œ≤ is the scaling index which reflects the general dynamic behavior of the urban system Œ≤ 1 is sub linear Œ≤ 1 is near linear and Œ≤ 1 is super linear we obtained the data we used in this study from government statistical yearbooks published from 2000 to 2016 the beijing statistical yearbook bmbs 2001 2016 the tianjin statistical yearbook tianjin mbs 2001 2016 the economic statistical yearbook of langfang lmbs 2001 2016 and the tangshan statistical yearbook tangshan mbs 2001 2016 we obtained any data that were missing from these yearbooks from the cnki china economic and social development statistics database https data cnki net and the eps data platform https www epsnet com cn index html where data were missing for 1 or 2 years we obtained the values using linear interpolation between the years before and after the missing data when data were missing for more than three consecutive years we estimated their value based on the ratio of the output value of the sector to the value for comparable sectors in other years or in other cities consumption of local material was estimated based on the material balance principle that is consumption of locally supplied material equaled total consumption minus the imports of that material we assumed that locally mined or produced materials would be preferentially allocated to meet local needs and any needs that could not be met locally were imported the missing data that had to be estimated or assumed amounted to about 10 of the total when local production exceeded local demand the excess material was allocated to sectors in the orders shown in supplementary text s1 because the units of measurement differed among the materials e g mass units for rocks and sand volume units for oil and gas it was necessary to convert all values to the same units mt so that they could be combined in the accounting 3 results 3 1 analysis of consumption and the consumption structure the consumption increase differed among the four cities but there were pairs with similar patterns fig 3 beijing and langfang had relatively slow growth with consumption that increased to 1 8 and 2 7 times the 2000 value respectively whereas tianjin and tangshan grew much faster with consumption that increased to 6 4 and 10 9 times the 2000 value respectively non metallic minerals was the main material category consumed by beijing and langfang and biomass consumption was also prominent for langfang metal ores was the main material category consumed to support dmc growth in tianjin and tangshan but growth of the other types of materials in tangshan was faster than that in tianjin the construction and manufacturing sectors were the main sectors that consumed materials in beijing and langfang and the manufacturing sector also played a leading role in tianjin and tangshan the growth rates of dmc in beijing and langfang were similar both increased to less than 3 times the 2000 value but the scales were quite different langfang s consumption was roughly one third of beijing s consumption although the difference has been decreasing during this period the dominant material consumption category in beijing and langfang was non metallic minerals which accounted for 54 and 34 of total consumption respectively and beijing s growth of consumption of non metallic minerals to about 2 2 times the 2000 level was consistent with the overall increase of dmc although the increased consumption of non metallic minerals in langfang to about 8 5 times the 2000 level was much higher than that in beijing consumption of other materials was relatively flat which slowed the overall growth rate of dmc in langfang in addition langfang s consumption of biomass and fossil fuels accounted for 36 and 17 of total consumption respectively and remained relatively constant creating a similar stabilizing effect moreover langfang s consumption of industrial products which increased to about 19 7 times the 2000 level and metal ores to about 11 3 times the 2000 level increased greatly but due to their small proportion of the total the effects on dmc growth were not obvious the dmc values in tianjin and tangshan were comparable in size the latter was about 1 4 times the former and both grew rapidly to about 6 4 and 10 9 times the 2000 level respectively the consumption of metal ores was the dominant form of consumption increasing to about 14 5 and 20 8 times the 2000 level respectively the absolute amounts were larger than those of any other type of materials and accounted for the largest proportion of dmc 48 and 69 respectively in 2015 for tianjin other types of material consumption also increased and supported the growth of dmc but both the proportions and the absolute increase were much less than those for metal ores which slowed dmc growth to some extent for tangshan biomass consumption remained relatively constant increasing to about 1 2 times the 2000 level and the increased consumption of non metallic minerals to about 4 8 times the 2000 level was similar to that in tianjin and there were also large increases in tangshan s consumption of industrial products to about 19 5 times the 2000 level and fossil fuels to about 8 0 times the 2000 level resulting in a larger increase of dmc than in tianjin 3 2 contributions of the socioeconomic drivers fig 4 shows that the size effects economic size and population size strongly drove the growth of dmc in the four cities with the economic sizes having a stronger influence than population the intensity effect consumption intensity was also a strong driver though the direction of the effect was negative for beijing and tianjin i e decreased consumption due to increased efficiency positive for langfang and changed from positive to negative for tangshan the structure effect consumption structure and industrial structure had intermediate strength but generally increased the dmc value the structure effect was generally stronger than the intensity effect the size effect increased consumption dmc in the four cities during the study the influence of beijing s economic size decreased continuously with contributions of 47 30 and 25 of the total respectively during the three periods whereas the contribution of population size increased to about 12 25 and 40 of the total the overall contribution of the size effect was at least 50 of the total in the four cities throughout the study period the economic size effect was also the primary driver of dmc in tianjin but with a decreasing contribution to 87 61 and 51 however the population size effect in tianjin differed slightly from that in beijing since it initially increased dmc and then stabilized the population size had a small effect during the early period a 4 contribution but it became much more important during the middle and late periods 20 and 28 contributions the economic size effect was strongest in langfang and tangshan with an initial decrease and then an increase for langfang to 69 50 and 61 versus an initial increase and then a decrease for tangshan to 65 76 and 62 the effects of population size in langfang and tangshan were totally different the contribution increased for tangshan but remained less than 8 of the total in all three periods whereas the value was stable at around 18 for langfang the intensity effect varied from city to city in beijing it played a negative role throughout the study period but the strength of the effect decreased over time with contributions of 40 29 and 10 of the total in the other three cities the intensity effect caused both promotion and inhibition of consumption for tianjin the intensity effect increased dmc slightly in the early period and strongly decreased dmc in the middle and late periods with contributions of 4 15 and 19 this indicated that the inhibitory effect was increasing steadily reflecting an improvement of tianjin s material utilization efficiency although the intensity effect increased dmc in langfang and decreased it in tangshan it showed a general transition from promotion of consumption to inhibition it s also worth noting that the material consumption intensity of langfang greatly increased dmc in the middle period the structural effect changed between increasing and decreasing consumption but was weaker than the other effects the industrial structure effect was more prominent than the consumption structure effect during the study period the industrial structure increased dmc growth in beijing and the effect during the late period a contribution of 25 was similar to that of the population size effect and was much stronger than that in the early period 1 and the middle period 6 at the same time the consumption structure effect less than 1 was increasing for tianjin and tangshan the effects of the industrial structure were both an initial stability or promotion of consumption followed by inhibition with contributions of 4 5 and 2 for tianjin and 8 12 and 3 for tangshan in contrast the consumption structure effect decreased throughout the study to less than 1 of the total the industrial structure effect in langfang was variable with initial promotion of consumption followed by inhibition and then promotion again however in terms of its contribution the significant growth during the late period to more than 4 times that in the early and middle periods was close to the effect of population size in addition the consumption structure effect in langfang was more obvious than that in the other three cities with an initial decrease followed by a decrease and then an increase and contributed about 7 of the total in the last period 3 3 power law analysis our analysis of the strengths of the drivers in section 3 2 showed that the size effect was the primary driver of dmc growth in the four cities to understand how economic growth is related to material consumption it is necessary to explore the coupling and decoupling between dmc and per capita gdp to support efforts to optimize urban material utilization efficiency fig 5 shows that three of the four cities except tianjin have achieved a distinct decoupling status and a trend of reduced material consumption with three kinds of decoupling status relative decoupling 75 of the years expansive decoupling 17 and weak absolute decoupling 8 it is worth noting that in some periods tianjin throughout the study and langfang during the first two periods the edi was in the transition range between coupling and decoupling therefore the status may not be distinct fig 6 shows the results of the power law analysis for the relationship between dmc and per capita gdp the regression analyses produced a moderate to strong statistically significant positive relationship between the two variables r 2 0 51 p 0 05 the slope of the curve i e the increase in dmc per unit increase of per capita gdp was greatest for tangshan followed by tianjin and langfang and was lowest for beijing beijing s per capita gdp increased continuously reaching 4 6 times the 2000 value dmc grew more slowly reaching only 1 8 times the 2000 value beijing therefore showed relative decoupling throughout the study period in detail beijing s elastic decoupling index edi the change in dmc per unit change in per capita gdp increased throughout the study period 0 20 0 40 and 0 42 during the three periods which reflected a slight decrease in material utilization efficiency in the range where relative decoupling occurred beijing showed a low edi value which means that it consumed less material to achieve economic growth therefore beijing s scaling index Œ≤ was only 0 27 which represents a sub linear relationship indicating that every time gdp per capita increases by some multiple the additional dmc consumed by the city continues to decrease in langfang dmc was relatively tortuous but eventually increased to 2 7 times the 2000 value and the per capita gdp increased more rapidly reaching 5 2 times the 2000 value langfang showed a transition from relative decoupling to weak absolute decoupling in the first two stages edi was 0 9 which is at the boundary between relative decoupling and weak absolute decoupling but in the third stage edi was only 0 2 which represents weak absolute decoupling although the three stages all showed reductions in material consumption dmc during the period with weak absolute decoupling decreased while per capita gdp increased indicating that socioeconomic development relied less heavily on specific types of material consumption this also meant that the pressure on the environment decreased somewhat and the material utilization efficiency improved the scaling index for langfang Œ≤ 0 67 also represented a sub linear relationship but the value was about 2 5 times that of beijing in addition the power law regression showed that langfang s dmc in the second stage was higher than the theoretical expectation that is the edi value should have been lower in the relative decoupling range which suggests that there is a deviation between the actual development and the predicted path in tianjin and tangshan dmc growth was relatively rapid to 6 4 times the 2000 value for tianjin versus 10 9 times for tangshan and the trend for per capita gdp was also significant to 6 3 times the 2000 value for tianjin versus 6 0 times for tangshan both cities showed no decoupling or a limited decoupling status tianjin showed no distinct decoupling throughout the study period with a gradually decreasing edi to 1 1 1 0 and 0 9 indicating that the city s material utilization efficiency improved but that there was still much room for improvement compared with beijing in contrast during the early part of the study period tangshan s edi 2 9 was about 2 6 times that in tianjin but in the middle and late parts of the study period tangshan s edi decreased to 0 8 and 1 0 which were similar to the values in tianjin indicating that the material utilization efficiency in tangshan improved greatly and continuously during the study period the edi values for tianjin and tangshan were generally higher than that of beijing and langfang so the scaling index of both cities showed near linear relationships Œ≤ 0 98 and 1 10 respectively representing a situation in which dmc increased simultaneously with the per capita gdp the scaling index of tangshan was slightly higher than that of tianjin because the edi of tangshan was larger than that of tianjin during the first stage raising the overall level the power law regression showed that tangshan was divided into two sections with 2003 as the boundary the fourth data point in the figure indicating that tangshan reversed its original development path and became more economical in scale in that year this was also why the edi values of tianjin and tangshan were similar during the latter two stages of our study period 4 discussion according to our analysis the urban metabolic features differed among the different city types to clarify the pattern we compared per capita consumption in the four cities we studied with values from other parts of the world to reveal differences in the characteristics of their urban development fig 7 these examples varied in the time period economic and population levels and industrial characteristics but because the consumption values were expressed as per capita values they nonetheless permitted simplistic comparisons that may reveal the future states of our four chinese cities the united states and tangshan had the highest per capita consumption at around 84 t followed by seven cities with values of more than 30 t uzbekistan s per capita dmc was lowest at 2 t and taiwan madrid paris and cape town had per capita dmc less than 6 t there was a difference of 82 t between the highest and lowest per capita consumption and the highest level was about 41 times the lowest for the four cities in the present study per capita dmc was relatively high in tangshan and tianjin mainly due to the domination of the two cities by manufacturing about 63 and 37 of gdp respectively in fact other study areas with similar industrial characteristics also had high per capita material consumption e g germany and japan and large increases in the consumption of metal ores have also been seen in the czech republic and poland tianjin and tangshan had similar consumption structures driving factors and development status so the reason for the large difference in their per capita dmc is not obvious tianjin s per capita dmc was less than half of that of tangshan the main reason appears to be the population difference tianjin had a much higher population than tangshan in 2000 and tianjin experienced rapid population growth in 2015 tangshan s population about 7 8 million was about half that of tianjin 15 5 million beijing s per capita dmc was in the middle of the other countries although manufacturing was also its leading industry 57 of gdp most of the city s material consumption was related to the construction and household consumption sectors at the same time beijing had a higher material utilization efficiency in recent years so the per capita dmc was well controlled langfang had the smallest per capita dmc among the four cities 10 t and represents a typical transitional economy with industrial transformation to advanced and clustered manufacturing guided by government policy however it is worth noting that per capita dmc in other areas e g the czech republic and malm√∂ with similar transitional characteristics was higher which may be due to the high consumption by industrial production in the two latter areas the smaller city size and the importance of agriculture 22 of gdp are likely why the per capita dmc of langfang was lower than that of similar cities from a socioeconomic perspective there were differences in the main driving factors for dmc in the four cities the economic size was the primary factor but its driving strength gradually decreased with increasing industrialization which was consistent with previous research on energy consumption and carbon emissions which are common areas for lmdi research for example guo and meng 2019 showed that the driving effect of economic scale was similar to the environmental kuznets curve in fact the effect of economic size reflects improvements of the quality of economic development and of residents living standards achour and belloumi 2016 therefore for langfang and tangshan which were undergoing accelerated urbanization their dmc growth which was driven by economic size might appear to show different long term trends the factors used in the present study involved the key components of socioeconomic systems population gdp but reflected the study s focus on material consumption these factors can characterize other socioeconomic drivers such as inequalities of consumption deindustrialization versus servicization of the economy to some extent but do not account for the effects of geographical characteristics such as climate and access to market at the same time the population size also played a significant role in promoting the growth of dmc in beijing and tianjin which had the largest populations of the four cities the driving effect of population increased during the study period and in the late part of the study period the contribution of population in beijing exceeded the economic size effect these phenomena were related at least in part to the jobs and development opportunities created by the 2008 olympic games in beijing and construction of the binhai new area in tianjin however the population increase exacerbated pressure on the environment the intensity effect was a key inhibitor of consumption although the trends differed among the cities they generally showed a tendency for the intensity effect to inhibit consumption or to show a transition from promotion of consumption to inhibition the intensity effect slowed the growth of dmc to a certain extent although a reversal of the growing consumption caused by the size effect has not yet appeared this reversal has been observed in some developed countries fern√°ndez gonz√°lez et al 2014 and is therefore likely to also occur in china in the future by analyzing the dependence of material consumption on the most important drivers we assessed the coupling or decoupling between consumption and gdp growth in the four cities at present all cities except tianjin have achieved decoupling of dmc from per capita gdp in our framework and relative decoupling was the dominant status 25 of the years during the study period this suggests a decreasing pressure on the environment during economic growth but doesn t mean that all environmental issues will soon been solved the decoupling status is one of the requirements of sustainable development but the four cities must still work to reduce dmc by setting goals and developing specific measures to meet those goals in fact our results could be affected by the accounting framework we developed because it does not account for all environmental impacts of consumption and economic growth i e we did not study the indirect environment impacts as stated in the eu s handbook 2018 the raw material consumption rmc represents the domestic final use of products and it can be used to analyze which final products have the largest impact on material extraction and hence the largest material footprint this indicates that the rmc is not bound to the dmc but depends more on imports and exports so a city can see its dmc increase while rmc simultaneously increases this problem must be solved in future research due to its high material utilization efficiency beijing remained in a decoupling status during the last two parts of the study period however utilization efficiency decreased slightly so the dependence on consumption of materials is increasing langfang was in a decoupling status only during the last part of the study period owing to a high agricultural contribution to the industrial structure recent research suggests that new technologies could be promoted and implemented more easily in agriculture than in the other sectors leal et al 2019 however in langfang the contribution of agriculture was decreasing while the contributions of construction and manufacturing were growing so the decoupling status is not stable tianjin and tangshan had a larger scale of the manufacturing sector than in the other cities leading to high material consumption however tianjin exhibited a transition between coupling and decoupling during the study period whereas tangshan exhibited decoupling right from the start of the study period power law analysis suggests that cities of different sizes should be scaled versions of one another and that they have similar laws that govern their development however our results show that even when the per capita gdp of the four cities is at or near the same level the scaling index differs among the cities for example beijing has a relatively mature manufacturing industry and is beginning to transform into a service oriented city whereas langfang is facing a transition from agriculture to industry the scaling index of these two cities represents a sub linear relationship although langfang s index is 2 5 times beijing s index the two cities show different goodness of fit for the power law regressions with r 2 0 51 for beijing and r 2 0 81 for langfang tianjin and tangshan are industrial cities dominated by the manufacturing sector and their scaling indices both showed a near linear relationship both Œ≤ values are around 1 and the goodness of fit of the power law regression was high with r 2 0 99 for tianjin and r 2 0 94 for tangshan this indicates that cities can be more accurately described as a scaled version of another city with similar characteristics and not a scaled version of a city with different characteristics which provides important information for the future classification of more than 300 prefecture level cities in china our results for Œ≤ are different from the relationship between mass and volume with Œ≤ 3 4 in biological allometric growth theory west et al 1997 and they do not fully fit the finding that relationships based on a city s material infrastructure are mostly sub linear bettencourt et al 2007 in fact scholars have explored many relationships including those for energy use ramaswami et al 2018 pollutant emission zhao et al 2018 the city s built up area lang et al 2019 and wages lobo et al 2020 and have found that cities at different development stages or with different income levels have different scaling indices poumanyvong and kaneko 2010 ramaswami et al 2018 this suggests that the scaling law for cities represents an evolutionary rule that changes as the nature of the development changes rather than an invariable one chen and feng 2017 our findings agree with previous research in which the analysis revealed the potential for urban self organization schiller 2016 and can therefore be influenced by government policies this explains why the scaling indices for cities fall within a range of values rather than having a specific number as in the case of biological allometric growth theory therefore although the four cities had achieved some improvement in their efficiency of material use during the study period they differed in their coupling or decoupling status because of rapid economic and population growth in all four cities they will all face development problems that might prevent or threaten the decoupling similar studies dai and liu 2018 q wang et al 2019 wu et al 2018 have also indicated that the study area has usually experienced relative decoupling for periods as long as 50 years with fluctuations then gradually evolved into a state of absolute decoupling therefore the four cities will need to optimize the organization of their technological industrial and economic growth to achieve absolute decoupling a lack of statistical data made it possible to obtain some of the data we analyzed only by converting output values and population size from cities with similar industrial structures and the sectoral distribution of various materials was based on artificial choices that could be affected by a certain subjectivity in fact the conversion coefficients used to calculated each kind of material consumptions may not have accurately reflected the actual conversion coefficients in our four cities as we used values obtained in previous studies and these values may not accurately reflect the current status for example industrial technology has become more efficient so the present material requirements might be lower than the values used in our accounting at the same time the lack of accurate data may have made some cities too similar blurring the differences in their development characteristics mfa can display material processes more intuitively than input output tables but requires more data future research should obtain additional and more accurate data through methods such as telephone consultations field interviews and more accurate allocation of various materials based on field research to clarify their flows supported by efforts to obtain more current values for the conversion coefficients the resulting metabolic accounting framework would be more consistent with the actual situation and would provide better support for management of cities in addition we could not identify whether the decoupling status was derived primarily from the contribution of a single industry within a given sector or from contributions by multiple industries in the future decoupling analysis should be combined with an analysis of key industries in each sector to improve our ability to identify the city s metabolic characteristics and metabolic problems more accurately based on the above discussion and the city status management of the four cities can be optimized by adopting the following approaches on the one hand the regulation and control of sectors with high material consumption should be strengthened the manufacturing and construction sectors play important roles in the industrial structures of the four cities and are therefore key targets for regulation to improve the material utilization efficiency for example architects should be encouraged to design structures that are more compact and that generate less construction waste since the consumption of non metallic minerals was prominent in the four cities in addition the wastes from the construction sector should be collected for reuse wherever this is feasible in addition cities with less advanced manufacturing industries should provide incentives for factories to adopt cleaner and more efficient machines and to redesign their material and energy supply systems to conserve and recycle resources such strategies could mitigate problems such as the large increase in tangshan s fossil fuel consumption governments should also provide policy and financial support for enterprises that are willing to integrate their operations with those of other companies in eco industrial or industrial parks to share cleaner production facilities since the economic size effect was an important driver of consumption governments should offer specific grants or tax incentives to encourage more efficient consumption for industries with relatively advanced manufacturing it would be more appropriate to improve worker training to reduce the rate of products with unacceptable quality that must be remanufactured or thrown away as wastes in addition as a city s industrial structure changes e g decreasing manufacturing industries and increasing service industries as in beijing and as the standard of living for residents improves transportation will become an increasingly important sector for material consumption achour and belloumi 2016 this agrees with the present study in which the consumption of transportation services is growing in fact transportation integration was implemented as part of the in beijing tianjin hebei integration strategy in 2016 with the goal of improving the overall transportation network within the region for example a single public transit pass can now be used within the whole region and this has greatly encouraged people to choose public transportation instead of individual cars there is also a growing trend to promote the use of shared bikes the integration strategy also contains measures to control car use such as registration policies e g lotteries to award new car ownership permits and traffic regulations e g allowing cars with even numbered and odd numbered license plates to drive only on alternate days common vehicle emission standards and a requirement to use higher quality gasoline and oils to reduce pressure on the environment such policies will need support from fiscal policies supervision of operations and technology optimization on the other hand it will be necessary to develop and implement policies and technologies to improve energy conservation for example industry universities and researchers should work more closely together to improve production factors and encourage technological innovation specific measures could include government funding for relevant projects and the creation of simple safe and fast technology and knowledge transfer channels to encourage enterprises to adopt scientific research results to improve their production perhaps by starting with government affiliated institutions and state owned enterprises to provide examples of successful projects that will encourage the private sector to participate the promotion of new policies and technologies can significantly improve the efficiency of material use and reduce the intensity of material consumption thereby mitigating or reversing the magnitude of the intensity effect and its ability to increase dmc especially for high consumption sectors such as manufacturing in the meantime the household consumption sector deserves more attention although it is not currently the major consumption sector it will increasingly drive resource flows when construction stops and residents begin to improve their standard of living by increasing consumption the population effect is not negligible and its impact on dmc will only increase as residents demand better lives so increasing urban resident awareness through environmental education programs would be a great way to mitigate the impacts of this change 5 conclusion in this study we quantified the masses of the materials consumed by urban development from a metabolic perspective and combined mfa with data on socioeconomic factors to identify the importance of the driving factors that are responsible for material consumption this let us quantitatively describe the characteristics and rules of urban material consumption and the connection between these characteristics and the socioeconomic characteristics of four representative chinese cities the results provide scientific guidance for management and prediction of future development and will therefore support management decision making for the urban ecosystem of each city the domestic material consumption dmc of the four cities generally grew throughout the study period with beijing and langfang showing similar increases and structures as did tianjin and tangshan non metallic minerals was the main consumption category in beijing and langfang and the manufacturing and construction sectors most strongly affected the changes of dmc metal ores was the dominant category driving dmc changes in tianjin and tangshan and reflected the substantial growth of manufacturing in these cities the dmc of the four cities had similar driving factors although their magnitude varied among the cities the size effect strongly increased dmc growth primarily based on the economic size effect whereas the intensity effect generally slowed consumption growth except for tianjin which showed a slight transition from coupling to decoupling throughout the study period the cities achieved distinct decoupling between dmc and per capita gdp with relative decoupling as the dominant form the dmc of beijing and langfang became more efficient as per capita gdp increased whereas the dmc of tianjin and tangshan increased with increasing per capita gdp as the per capita gdp grew the growth rates of dmc in beijing and langfang were slower than that of tianjin and tangshan which both grew fast based on the results of our analysis we revealed several possible strategies to reduce dmc by the manufacturing construction transportation and household consumption sectors declaration of

24634,the harsh environmental conditions and poor management of agricultural fields in many parts of the tropics lead to rapid soil degradation and low crop yields once native lands are converted to agriculture the assessment and management of degraded fields is constrained by the low resource availability to support field data collection crop simulation models offer tools for assessing the degradation problem and support improved management decisions though a host of comprehensive crop models have been published their wide scale application in the tropics especially as decision support tools continues to lag largely due to the types and fine scale data requirements for model execution which are often lacking in the tropical regions in this paper we present a simple modelling framework that is capable of simulating the impact of soil degradation on maize yields using field scale agriculture data the major departure of this new modelling framework is the description of erosion in terms of soil depth loss instead of soil mass loss the framework which was developed from an assembly of relevant theory and equations in the published literature is designed to address the data paucity challenges often encountered in many tropical regions the model was programmed in excel and tested against published observed maize yields for situations where the maize was grown on simulated eroded soils of varying severity and nitrogen application rates the model simulated well the decline in maize yields with increased erosion severity and varying nitrogen application rates r2 0 79 nrmse 28 and willmott d index 0 95 it is concluded that the model though simple provided a framework for assessing maize yield response to varied soil degradation conditions keywords erosion maize yield simulation soil degradation 1 introduction soil degradation is a major constraint to soil and crop productivity sustenance especially in tropical agricultural systems the degradation process which often begins once native or uncultivated tropical lands are converted to cropping can be attributed to several causes such as i the rapid decline in soil organic matter som and fertility ii the deterioration of soil biological activity iii changes in soil erosion and its associated som loss and increased compaction lal and moldenhauer 1987 and iv the loss of soil profile depth leading to the reduction of soil water and nutrient availability the rapid decline in fertility is associated with som loss because the som is a major nutrient reservoir in low input tropical agricultural systems brams 1971 observed a loss of 50 som stock within a period of 5 years following the clearing of a native forest land in sierra leone studies in ghana also showed that under poor soil management som decreased from 18 0 to 7 0 g kg over a 4 year period after converting a long term fallow land to crop land adiku et al 2009 tropical agricultural literature is full of evidence of soil productivity decline due to som loss e g reeves 1997 oldfield et al 2019 the severity of the fertility decline is often compounded by the nature of the cropping practices studies have shown significant loss of nutrients in monoculture compared with intercropping systems in the semi deciduous zone of ghana bashagaluke et al 2018 reduced biological activity is also commonly found in degraded soils tete mensah et al 1999 observed substantially higher earthworm density of 80 m2 in a protected forest than that 10 m2 of an adjacent maize farm in a forest savannah transition zone of ghana a number of studies have shown that microbial biomass carbon mbc differed significantly between native or uncultivated lands and long term cropped fields nunes et al 2012 by far however the physical human interactions such as agriculture with natural ecosystems often set in a degradation spiral that rapidly deteriorates soil productivity rodriguez et al 2020 observed that peat in the usa everglades that naturally accumulated at 0 08 cm yr now exhibit subsidence rates of 0 65 cm yr due to agricultural use of these peatlands within the tropical agricultural context soil erosion and its associated som loss and soil profile changes can have profound impact on soil productivity studies in the upper east region of ghana by senayah et al 2005 showed a top soil reduction of about 40 cm on croplands over a period of 24 years 1969 1993 due to soil erosion averaging a depth loss rate of almost 2 0 cm yr more commonly the average top soil depth loss rate in ghanaian cropping systems ranges from 0 6 to 1 0 cm yr amegashie et al 2012 the adverse impact of erosion on soil functions and crop productivity has been long observed by many researchers adu 1972 showed that some farming areas within the sudan savanah zone lost more than 90 cm of top soil leading to the disappearance of an entire solum a and b horizons exposing a stiff impervious substratum that restricted root penetration decreased infiltration and increased runoff available evidence also indicated that the loss of soil depth resulted in a decreased soil water holding capacity increased drainage eck et al 1965 sur et al 1992 and increased nitrogen leaching eck 1968 the overall effect of soil degradation is the decline in crop yield farm income and an eventual loss of livelihood adiku et al 2009 observed more than 50 maize yield decline over a 4 year period after converting a long term fallow land to continuous maize cropping system with poor residue management mbagwu et al 1984 observed that the loss of top soil depth between 5 and 20 cm reduced maize yield by 75 to 99 on an alfisol in a sub humid zone of nigeria lal 1983 showed for a nigerian alfisol cropped to maize under natural inherent fertility conditions that the removal of more than 10 cm top soil reduced the yield to less than 0 40 ton ha whereas the yield obtained for the non eroded soil exceeded 1 5 ton ha the application of more than 60 kg n ha did not improve the maize yield beyond 0 50 ton ha on the eroded soil whereas yield for the non eroded soil reached 2 5 ton ha andraski and lowery 1992 attributed the decline in maize yields on eroded soils to the decline in water holding capacity information on soil degradation impacts on crop yields is required to develop appropriate soil management practices however as the impact of soil degradation is often insidious with the effects only observable in the medium to long term the traditional short term field experimentation approaches are insufficient to capture the long term full impact on crop yield alternatively simulation modelling approaches may provide more effective tools for investigating the impacts of soil degradation over various time scales in more timely and cost effective manner indeed advances in crop modelling enable the assessment of the impact of climate soil and management effects on crop growth development and yield a host of dynamic comprehensive functional models such as dssat jones et al 2003 and apsim mccown et al 1996 are currently applied world wide and some of these have been validated for tropical agricultural systems and used in management decision making adiku et al 1998 naab et al 2004 dzotsi et al 2010 fosu mensah et al 2012 maccarthy et al 2017a the inclusion of soil degradation modules in comprehensive models will require the simulation of soil erosion amongst others indeed erosion modelling has advanced over the years with more mechanistic approaches becoming widely available some flow driven soil mass loss based erosion models such as guest rose et al 1998 require detailed characterization of overland flow such as stream power and entrainment high frequency with time steps of minutes hydrological data and soil information e g settling velocity of sediments some crop models such as perfect littleboy et al 1989 and epic sharpley and williams 1990 link soil erosion to crop growth processes enabling the assessment of erosion impact on crop yields there is a renewed effort to include soil erosion modules in apsim holzworth et al 2014 yet the general progress on the application of models for soil degradation impact assessment continues to lag especially in tropical regions it is conceivable that the major handicap to apply these models for soil degradation assessment lies with the types of data required to parameterize and execute them in many data sparse tropical regions the information required by the models are simply unavailable it is our view that for the current soil erosion crop models to find wide scale application in soil degradation impact assessment in tropical agricultural systems the issue of data paucity and the challenges of resource limitation for the conduct of the necessary long term experiments on soil mass loss sediment nutrient loss and crop yields must be addressed adiku et al 2015 have enumerated a number of such challenges in applying the dssat model for agricultural decision making within in a number of locations within the west african agricultural systems it was noted that the main sources of soil information were soil survey manuals that provided general classifications with occasional limited data on texture and depth there were no data on soil mass loss for weather rainfall temperature the data were more readily available at annual seasonal or in limited situations monthly time scales for crop husbandry exact planting dates were not recorded instead the data comprised planting windows often spanning 3 months or more freduah et al 2019 in the case of nutrient management fertilizer and manure application were commonly lumped and expressed as application cost requiring some knowledge of fertilizer prices to estimate applied fertilizer quantities and there was often little or no information on manure quality crop yields were reported on seasonal time scales and in some situations the yields were aggregated at districts and regional scales maccarthy et al 2017b have also discussed a host of other challenges that continue to handicap the wide scale adoption and use of comprehensive crop models in sub saharan africa for agricultural decision support in effect special efforts are required to arrive at plausible input data for running and applying the comprehensive crop models yet it is for these agricultural fields that tropical country governments seek to develop policies to improve output for which crop models could play effective roles as decision support tools the question of interest is whether other alternative modelling concepts can be developed to match the types and quality of data available at the many data sparse locations of interest to assess the impact of soil degradation on crop performance we conjecture that this is feasible provided that the complexity of the models is guided by data availability for example soil erosion could be described in terms of soil depth loss instead of soil mass loss because the former can be more readily estimated from changes in soil profile depths furthermore the data intensity for the modelling could be scaled down with larger response time steps of months and seasons where possible we opine that there is ample published theory and relationships to support the development of such simpler models even if experimentation proceeds slowly due to resource constraints our aim in this study is therefore to present a simple modelling framework for assessing the impact of soil degradation on maize yields especially for the coarse textured soils that abound in many tropical regions the modelling framework is conceived within the context of limited data and resource availability easy comprehension and application by users and the need to minimize computing demand it is envisaged that such a model would complement the crop modelling tool box and provide a bridge to the more comprehensive models 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling framework conceptually our framework considers the soil degradation processes and the overall impact on crop growth for situations of sheet erosion the concept has 4 process stages first given an initial soil depth fig 1 there is an annual loss of soil depth and associated som stock from a finite soil depth fig 1 event 1 second following the physical soil and som loss the remaining som undergoes biochemical decomposition fig 1 event 2 leading to a final som stock at the end of the annual cycle fig 1 it is assumed that the two processes of physical som loss and biochemical decomposition are not concurrent third the changes in the som stock and loss of top soil affect the soil physical properties such as the bulk density which in turn may alter the soil water characteristics e g field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp fourth the overall changes in soil profile depth and soil water characteristics impact plant growth through soil water and nutrient availability the task now is to formulate these process stages mathematically 2 1 1 modelling soil depth and associated som loss the first task is to describe the first process of the concept the soil depth loss is assumed to proceed at some constant rate er cm y taken as an input into the model the value of er is derived from the changes of soil profile depth over a given period of time the actual depth loss dz after time t will be er x t so that for a soil profile with initial depth of depth ztot the actual depth after time t will be ztot dz assuming that the som comprising soil organic carbon soc and nitrogen son is uniformly distributed over a soil top depth zc fig 1 then the total soc stock cst kg ha within the depth zc can be determined as 1a c s t œÅ b a s o c z c where a is the soil area 1 ha and œÅb is the bulk density further assuming a carbon nitrogen c n ratio the organic nitrogen stock n st can also be determined from 1b n s t c s t c n we designate the proportion of c st and n st lost physically with the soil depth loss as c ster and n ster respectively since the soil depth diminishes by dz annually then the c ster and n ster lost with depth dz can be determined as 2a c s t e r d z z c c s t and 2b n s t e r d z z c n s t 2 1 2 modelling som decomposition the second soil degradation process involves the biochemical decomposition of som following the physical loss of som the remaining portion of carbon and nitrogen stocks are assumed to decompose biochemically fig 1 according to a first order kinetic 3a d c s t d t a d d c k c c s t and 3b d n s t d t a d d n k n n s t where addc and addn are the addition of carbon and nitrogen respectively from residues if any and k c and k n are the decomposition rate constants for organic carbon and nitrogen respectively it is assumed that carbon and nitrogen stock below the depth z c will remain at some minimum passive level fig 1 equation 3 can be solved either analytically or numerically to obtain the mineralized carbon c min or nitrogen n min at any time t here we follow the numerical approach to obtain 4a c m i n t c m i n t 1 d c s t d t d t and for mineralized nitrogen n min as 4b n m i n t n m i n t 1 d n s t d t d t therefore at the end of an annual crop cycle the total loss of c st and n st is the sum of that lost by physical erosion and biochemical decomposition and can be determined as 5a c s t t c s t t 1 c s t e r c m i n and that for nitrogen stock would be 5b n s t t n s t t 1 n s t e r n m i n the n min and any applied n become available for plant uptake and or leached as explained below 2 1 3 modelling the interactions between som and soil properties the third soil degradation process involves the interactions between som and soil properties following the analysis of a large dataset of soil bulk density œÅb g cm3 and the soc r√ºhlmann and koerschens 2009 derived the relationship 6 œÅ b c d b exp b s o c where the values of the constants were provided by the authors as c 2 68 d 140 93 and b 0 0085 in this study we focus on coarse textured sandy or good structured soils with pores through which water can drain readily to a constant value fc cm3 cm3 and will dry to pwp for such soils som and œÅb induced changes in the water characteristics can be described using pedo transfer equations gupta and larson 1979 7a f c 0 00308 s a n d 0 00589 s i l t 0 00804 c l a y 0 00221 s o m 1 43 œÅ b 7b p w p 0 000059 s a n d 0 00114 s i l t 0 00577 c l a y 0 00223 s o m 0 026 œÅ b the total porosity f can thus be estimated using 8 f 1 œÅ b œÅ s where œÅs 2 65 g cm3 is the average particle density for mineral soils the changes in fc and pwp will alter the soil available water capacity awc fc pwp hence as the degradation proceeds the awc must be continuously updated the fc is of particular importance in water balance modelling because it determines the maximum water holding capacity whc of soil against gravity drainage for a soil profile that is uniform with depth with an initial total depth z tot from which a soil depth of dz has been stripped off by sheet erosion the resultant whc would be given by 9 w h c f c z t o t d z hence the whc of the soil profile will diminish as the erosion proceeds due to the combined effect of dz and the decline in som 2 1 4 modelling the impact of water and nutrient availability on crop yield the final process of our degradation concept relates to the impact of water and nutrient availability on crop yield the assessment of soil water availability requires the solution of the water balance equation given by 10 Œ¥ w p e t a r d in eq 10 Œ¥w is the change in soil water storage w 2 w 1 where w 2 and w 1 are the final and initial water storage respectively p is the rainfall et a is the actual evapotranspiration and r d is a lumped runoff drainage term all the terms are expressed in mm eq 10 can be reformulated as 11 w 2 w 1 p e t a r d the time step chosen for solving eq 11 will depend on the data availability and can range from hours to years for our context we consider the monthly time scale as appropriate based on data available according to rose 2004 mass balance can be applied to eq 11 to arrive at the final soil water storage w f in two ways fig 2 assuming that the soil has a maximum water holding capacity of whc then in the first case where the solution of eq 11 leads to w 2 whc the lumped term r d will be 0 hence for a given initial water storage w 1 and known values of p and eta w 2 can be determined without the need to know r d for this situation w f w 2 however for the second situation where the solution of eq 11 indicates that w 2 whc then r d 0 and the magnitude of r d can be calculated as 12a r d w 2 w h c since the soil can hold a maximum of whc then the final water storage must be set to the whc i e 12b w f w h c the average profile soil water content cm3 cm3 can be determined as 13 Œ∏ w f z t o t d z for the next time step w f becomes the initial water storage and the calculation process is repeated until the end of the simulation there is a need to partition the lumped r d term into its component runoff r and drainage d because d is required to determine nutrient leaching as explained below there are several formulations for runoff determination in the literature for most crop models that operate on a daily time step the usda natural resource conservation service nrsc 1986 curve number technique is employed in other soil physics literature runoff is estimated from infiltration equations requiring knowledge of physical parameters such as sorptivity hydraulic conductivity initial soil water content etc such models operate on very short time steps e g minutes to hours given our context of data paucity the runoff in this study was estimated from the monthly p following sen and altunkaynak 2003 as 14 r 0 2411 x p 3 923 r r d though this estimation does not consider all the important determinants of runoff such as the initial water content that become important at shorter time steps e g daily the equation was shown to perform well by the authors for the types of soils considered in this study furthermore the condition imposed in eq 14 provides an upper bound for r other factors such as increased bulk density commonly observed for eroded soils can impede infiltration sur et al 1998 thereby increasing runoff assuming that runoff increases as porosity declines a bulk density adjustment factor œÅb fact was derived from the inverse of porosity f in eq 6 to arrive at 15 œÅ b f a c t 0 974 œÅ b 0 3636 so that the actual runoff œÅb fact r with r known d can also be determined the monthly r and d are summed over the season the et a term of eq 11 provides the link between the water availability and crop growth for crop yield data that are reported seasonally we select the simple seasonal water production function of doorenbos and kassam 1979 to calculate the relative yield as 16 y a y p 1 k y 1 e t a e t m where y a and y p are the actual and potential yield kg ha respectively et a and et m are seasonal actual and maximum evapotranspiration and k y is the yield response factor 1 25 for maize this equation has been used widely in fao literature and has basis in the studies on the relation between transpiration and crop yields by de wit 1958 the maximum evapotranspiration et m was determined as 17 e t m e t p k c where et p the potential evapotranspiration estimated from meteorological formula or input as measured data and kc is the fao crop coefficient allen et al 1998 the actual evapotranspiration term et a is obtained as 18 e t a Œ± e t m where Œ± is the soil water availability or stress factor determined according to feddes et al 1978 as Œ± Œ∏ Œ∏ p w p Œ∏ c Œ∏ p w p f o r

dependence of w 2 or w f and hence whc on the changing soil profile depth has implications for drainage d because as erosion proceeds and whc decreases d would increase increasing d also has implications for nutrient leaching consider the nutrient balance given by 20 Œ¥ n n m i n n f n l n u where Œ¥n is the change in soil nutrient storage n min is the mineralized nutrient n f is applied fertilizer nutrient n l is the nutrient leached and n u is plant nutrient uptake with all the terms expressed in kg ha clearly increasing d will also increase the n l term the literature abounds with many descriptions of nutrient leaching ranging from convective dispersion equations to simple mass flow a simple formulation derived from the principles of chromatography was put forward by burns 1975 to describe the seasonal nitrate n leaching if the nitrate n is uniformly distributed throughout the soil profile then the seasonal fraction f r leached from the soil profile is related to d in cm and fc by 21a f r d d Œ∏ f c h 2 where h the effective rooting depth in this case z tot dz and Œ∏fc is the field capacity water content cm3 cm3 however if nitrate n is applied to the soil surface then f r is given by 21b f r d d Œ∏ f c h the quantity of nitrogen leached will be n fr this seasonal nutrient leaching estimation would suffice for data sparse situations where the within seasonal nutrient leaching is not the focus as for the water balance n u provides the link between the nutrient balance and crop growth a nitrogen stress factor n str was derived for maize as a function of seasonal nitrogen uptake nu using published data from sources such as fosu et al 2004 22 n s t r 1 10 6 n u 3 0 0002 n u 2 0 0104 n u r 2 0 96 the seasonal nitrogen limited maize yield y n is then calculated as y p x n str given the situation of multiple resource stresses simulated actual maize yield y a was estimated as 23 y a m i n n s t r w s t r y p where the function min selects the minimum of the terms in the bracket following liebig s law 2 1 5 model parametrization and implementation equations 1 to 23 constitute our soil degradation modelling framework which was programmed in excel spreadsheet excel was chosen as the computing platform because of the relative simplicity of the model a flow chart for the operation sequences is given in fig 3 the soil depth loss is input at an annual time step also the carbon and nitrogen dynamics are executed on an annual time step but the water balance simulation operates on a monthly time step from january to december with maize growth estimated from a 4 month growing season at the end of the growing season the simulated monthly runoff drainage and evapotranspiration are summed up to obtain seasonal values the seasonal d is used to compute nitrate n leaching while the seasonal eta was used to estimate the maize yield the potential maize yield is an input parameter parameters and other input data with their units and sources required for the model execution are summarized in table 1 the model can be executed for single or multiple years in the case of the latter the water balance is executed continuously over the years from january with the water storage in december becoming the initial value for the next january 2 1 6 model evaluation the modelling framework was evaluated by comparing observed and simulated soc n min and maize yields for the various soil degradation conditions the observed data were from three published studies in the literature i e munodawafa 2011 sur et al 1998 adiku et al 2009 the agreement between the observed and simulated data were based on three statistical measures i coefficient of determination r 2 ii normalized rmse nrmse and iii willmott et al 2012 d statistic the nrmse is given by 24a n r m s e r m s e o i 100 where o i is observed mean and the rmse is defined as 24b r m s e 1 n y i e l d s i m u l a t e d i y i e l d o b s e r v d i 2 0 5 values of nrmse beyond 30 of the overall mean indicate unsatisfactory agreement the willmott d statistic is given by 25 d 1 1 1 i n s i o i 2 i 1 i n s i o o i o 2 where s i is simulated data and o is the mean of the observed data perfect agreement between the simulated and observed is attained when d 1 2 2 data sources three sources of data were used to test the model framework the first two studies used de surfaced soils or scalping i e physical removal of soil to a specified depth as surrogates for eroded soils even though it is known that scalping approaches do not adequately represent the gradual and selective removal of humus and fine materials under natural erosion processes lal 1985 actual data from long term erosion impact studies were not readily available to us especially in tropical agriculture conditions hence our current study was limited largely to such scalping datasets in addition however we also include data from a relatively short term study that investigated the effect of soil degradation following differential residue management on maize yield the first data source by munodawafa 2011 was a study conducted to assess erosion impact on maize yield in zimbabwe the soil was sandy sand content 82 with relatively low som of 5 g kg equivalent to 3 0 g kg soc and 0 70 g kg total nitrogen tn soil depth reached about 80 cm with stone lining at 50 and 80 cm depth in this study maize was cultivated on a base soil no erosion and on soils from which the surfaces were scalped to 5 10 15 and 20 cm resulting in 4 eroded scenarios all making 5 levels thus dz values in our model were set to 0 no erosion 5 10 15 and 20 cm in the model there were two fertilizer application levels 35 and 69 kg n ha all making a total of 10 treatments and maize yields were published for each of the treatments furthermore the author also provided measured data on the bulk density and total organic matter for each eroded soil the latter was converted to soil carbon and used in simulating soc and son dynamics and the mineralized nitrogen n min by employing equations 2 to 4 for those input data required by the model that were not available in these publications other relevant sources were consulted the generic long term monthly rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data were obtained from munodawafa 2012 the second study was conducted by sur et al 1998 at the punjab agricultural research station india this study also employed the scalping approach of de surfaced soils to represent eroded soils there were 3 eroded treatments 0 6 12 and 18 cm making 4 levels of erosion therefore for this study dz values were set to 0 6 12 and 18 cm in the model maize was cultivated under 6 different nitrogen fertilizer application rates ranging from 0 to 200 kg n ha resulting in 24 treatments and the yields were reported for each treatment our simulations considered up to 120 kg n ha application rates only soil depth reached about 60 cm and the bulk density for each de surfaced soil was provided additionally data were reported for mineralized n n min over the growing season for each de surfaced soil condition the latter served as validation data for the simulated n min though sur et al 1998 only indicated soc content for this sandy loam soil as 2 9 g kg detailed data on soc distribution with depth for this soil was published by jalota et al 2010 this enabled the assignment of different soc values to the different de surfaced soils and subsequent n min simulation the monthly rainfall during the maize growing season was provided by sur et al 1998 however long term average monthly evapo transpiration data taken from saha et al 2018 were used for water balance modelling the third study reported by adiku et al 2009 was conducted in a forest savannah transition zone of ghana the soils belong to haplic lixisols which are sandy with appreciable concretions at a depth of 70 cm prior to the commencement of the study the field soil was fallowed for 5 years the initial soc was 18 0 g kg and the average bulk density was 1 50 g cm3 the study investigated the impact of 7 different maize fallow rotation treatments on maize yields and soil carbon over a 4 year period from 2003 to 2006 of these the treatment of interest to our current study is the maize bare fallow rotation where all residues were removed and the fields kept weed free following each maize harvest the soc was measured at 6 month intervals during the 4 years and used as validation data using the first year soc to initialize the model the soc variation over the 4 year period was simulated using equations 2 and 3 with no carbon input add c 0 at annual time scales monthly rainfall data were available for the 4 years the average monthly temperature t av c data recorded over the 4 years were used to compute the etp following blaney and criddle 1962 the seasonal rainfall data for the maize growing periods were reported as 550 480 245 and 420 mm for years 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively maize yield was determined for each season though not measured there were visible signs of severe soil erosion by the commencement of year 3 therefore the rate of soil depth loss er was estimated at 1 0 cm yr which is comparable to rates published for severe eroding ghanaian soils amegashie et al 2012 3 results 3 1 simulation of carbon and nitrogen the test of the soc and son dynamics modelling was somewhat handicapped by the limited measured data available for this study despite this limitation it could be shown that the modelling framework captured correctly r2 0 96 nrmse 9 4 the temporal soc decline fig 4 with time as observed in the adiku et al 2009 by the 4th year of the study soc reduced by 50 and this was well reproduced by the model even though the model tended to somewhat overestimate the soc with regard to n dynamics the decreasing amounts of n mineralized with the severity of de surfacing as observed by sur et al 1998 was also well r2 0 76 nrmse 13 simulated fig 5 thus in general the soc and son dynamics aspects of the modelling framework could be considered reliable 3 2 simulation of water and nitrogen balance components total soil profile depth for the munodawafa 2011 soils declined from 80 cm to 60 cm with a corresponding reduction in the whc from 69 to 38 mm table 2 constituting a 45 reduction in whc though the measured water balance components were not reported by munodawafa 2011 the simulation results showed that r increased only slightly 9 5 with erosion severity on the contrary d increased sharply 4 fold with erosion severity overall the proportion of rainfall seasonal p 502 mm lost as runoff and drainage increased from 39 for the non eroded soils to 62 for the severely eroded soils the simulated eta decreased with erosion severity by about 48 suggesting less water availability to maize crop upon the reduction in soil depth additionally the reduction of the rooting depth could affect plant nutrient uptake lal and moldenhauer 1987 with regard to n economy the simulated n min decreased with erosion severity table 2 ranging from 69 kg n ha for the non eroded soil down to 22 0 kg n ha for the severely eroded soil on the contrary leached n nl increased with erosion severity for the low n application rate of 35 kg n ha the simulated leached n was 45 kg n ha for the non eroded soil and 47 kg n ha for the severely eroded soil corresponding to 41 and 83 respectively of the total applied and mineralized n nitrogen leaching was much more pronounced for the higher nitrogen application rate of 69 kg n ha the proportion of n leached increased from 37 non eroded to 80 severely eroded soil this would have serious implications for the efficiency of mineral fertilizer use in smallholder systems where external inputs are usually low kihara et al 2015 in the case of sur et al 1998 study with a relatively shallow soil z tot 60 cm the effective depth for the severely eroded soil was only 42 cm table 3 the decline in whc ranged from 107 mm for the non eroded soil down to 66 mm for the severely eroded soil indicating about 38 loss in whc similar to the munodawafa 2011 study the simulated runoff r increased less rapidly than the drainage d the seasonal rainfall was generally high p 839 mm resulting in a high proportion of r d losses i e 57 for the non eroded to 70 for the severely eroded soil the simulated eta decreased by about 34 on the severely eroded soil compared to the non eroded soil unlike the munodawafa 2011 study the model showed that the initial contribution from n min to the overall nitrogen economy was fairly high ranging from about 96 kg n ha for the non eroded soil down to 49 kg n ha for the severely eroded soil table 3 thus even with no fertilizer n application n availability was still appreciable to support good maize yield for the non eroded soil however for the severely eroded soil even very high n application rates of 120 kg n ha could still not sustain high yields probably due to the very high 88 leaching rates table 3 the short term study by adiku et al 2009 suggested that soil depth loss was not pronounced within the period of the investigation the total soil profile depth was estimated to decline from 70 to 67 cm by year 4 table 4 resulting in the whc reductions by 8 from 74 to 68 mm as rainfall patterns varied with time so did the proportions of r d losses but in general most of the years lost 35 of the rainfall as r d the simulated eta also varied with rainfall with year 3 which was particularly dry recording the least value 84 mm whereas year 1 recorded the highest eta of 334 mm the simulations suggest that n min was initially very high but decreased by about 50 with time from 413 kg n ha in year 1 to 198 kg n ha by year 4 nitrogen leaching followed the rainfall pattern and was negligible in the low rainfall year 3 3 maize yield simulation the simulation of soil degradation impact on maize yield suggested that in most cases the nitrogen economy dominated the yield determination compared to rainfall except where rainfall was exceptionally low in the case of the munodawafa 2011 dataset fig 6 observed maize yields were highest for the non eroded soils declining sharply with erosion severity apparently due to the declining n availability at the relatively low n application rate of 35 kg n ha observed maize yield decreased from 2000 for the non eroded soil to less than 800 kg ha for the severely eroded soil representing a 60 reduction in yield though doubling the fertilizer application rate to 69 kg n ha increased the yield to 1170 kg ha for the severely eroded soil it was about 65 less than the yield 3305 kg ha observed for the non eroded soil thus increased fertilizer application did not significantly improve maize yields especially on the severely degraded soil the efficiency of fertilizer applied reduced markedly as soil degradation set in partial factor of productivity of n applied at 39 kg ha declined from 70 kg grain kg n applied for the non eroded soil to 10 kg grain kg n applied for the severely eroded soil similar patterns of maize yield response were also simulated for the sur et al 1998 dataset fig 7 in that yield declined with erosion severity at zero n application rate the simulated n min was 96 kg n ha for the non eroded soil thus even if as much as 64 was lost by leaching table 3 the available n could still support an appreciable yield of 1980 kg ha for the severely eroded situation however n min reduced sharply to 49 kg n ha table 3 so that after leaching the remaining n would be very low resulting in a sharp decline in yield fig 7 it is worth to note that even at high n application rate of 120 kg n ha the maize yield 1069 kg ha under the severely eroded soils was still significantly lower than the corresponding yield from the non eroded soil 2900 kg ha in effect increasing n application to the severely eroded soil did not engender commensurate yield response much of the fertilizer applied was simply lost by leaching table 3 earlier studies have also confirmed these tendencies lal 1983 with regard to the adiku et al 2009 dataset maize yield varied not only with n economy but also with water availability fig 8 when rainfall was adequate in years 1 and 2 n availability determined the maize yield however year 3 recorded no yield because of the lack of rainfall during the critical reproductive stage of the crop even though the maize received about 240 mm rainfall earlier in the season any prior water uptake by the maize crop in may and june estimated as et a 84 mm table 4 did not translate into maize yield even though n may not have been limiting in year 4 when rainfall improved maize yield also improved overall the model simulations of maize yields under the various erosion and n application rates compared reasonably well with the observed fig 9 with r2 0 79 normalized rmse of 28 and willmott d index 0 93 4 discussion the major limitation to this study was our inability to validate the water and nutrient balance components due to the lack of measured data in all the three datasets studies that document simultaneously soil erosion water and nutrient balance and crop yields over long term are often lacking in tropical agricultural systems and this challenge limited a more rigorous examination of the model furthermore the use of soil depth loss as a surrogate for soil mass loss in erosion studies may not fully capture the erosion process but for many situations where data on sediment loss is lacking this may be a useful approach as demonstrated a modelling framework assemblage of existing equations that utilizes soil depth loss as a proxy for erosion can be easily verified using calibrated erosion pins the important issue which relates to the inadequacy of using soil scalping as surrogate for erosion under natural conditions has been discussed elsewhere lal 1985 though the study by adiku et al 2009 could have captured the natural erosion phenomenon better the focus was not on erosion and hence the relevant water balance components were not documented also the period of study was relatively short given that whc decreased by only 6 mm over the 4 year duration of the study suggests that the initial impact of physical soil depth loss on water storage and hence maize yield was negligible presumably it was the rapid fall of the soc from 18 g kg to 7 0 g kg within the first 4 years that accounted for the soil degradation impact on crop yields at the early stages of the degradation process with time however the reduction in whc and increased nitrogen loss via leaching would become the dominant processes that determine crop yields the modelling framework also has limitations that would require improvement first the sequence of the som loss processes as shown in fig 1 stipulated that the loss by the physical processes was complete before the remainder of the som decomposed for the scalping de surfaced soils situations as in datasets 1 and 2 this may be valid because the soil was de surfaced before the maize experiments were conducted however for more real time field situations such as in dataset 3 the erosion and som decomposition would concur over the duration of the season or over the years some of the n derived from the decomposing som in the eroding soil depth may be available for plant uptake our model was not designed to capture such within season events even if the model had the capability to assess these within season processes a rigorous test would still be handicapped by the lack of the relevant test data second our assumption of a constant soil depth loss rate e r cm yr over time may not be entirely valid as the erosion rate is generally a function of tillage and soil management nearing et al 2017 apart it is conceivable that e r may be low soon after the conversion of native land to agriculture because of initial relatively high som and structural stability however e r would increase rapidly as som declined with time and finally decline to some minimum as the erodible fine materials diminish an analysis of the time variation of erosion rates or in our situation soil depth loss rates by megahan 1974 indicated that erosion dynamics can be described by a negative exponential equation therefore in applying our model over long periods of time the time variation in e r must be considered third our sole reliance on published theory relations and data sources for model development and testing has both advantages and disadvantages on the one hand we could make progress with regard to the assembly of equations to construct the model without the need to embark on field experimentation which would be handicapped by resource unavailability on the other hand errors inherent in the adopted equations may propagate and diminish the accuracy of the simulations the tradeoff between model accuracy and the need for a model applicable within the context of data paucity would remain a debate in simulation studies it is our view that the simple modelling framework as put forward in this study could provide a starting tool for investigating soil degradation impact on crop performance in data sparse situations for many resource poor countries this approach could be a starting point to transit later more comprehensive models as data availability improves 5 conclusion we have presented a modelling framework for simulating the impact of soil degradation on maize yields under varied environmental and management conditions the overarching aim was to present the model at the level of detail that matched the types of input and observations that are commonly available for many agricultural fields in data sparse environments the framework used soil depth loss instead of soil mass loss in its description of soil erosion furthermore theory and relations from the published literature were used for model development the evaluation of the model was on limited published data of maize yields under varying degradation severity and management conditions the results showed that the model captured well the decreasing trends of maize yields with increasing erosion severity also the year to year variation of maize yields as soil degradation progressed could be well simulated by the model we conclude that for many resource poor and data sparse countries this model could provide a starting tool for investigating the impact of soil degradation on crop performance credit authroship adiku s g k model

24634,the harsh environmental conditions and poor management of agricultural fields in many parts of the tropics lead to rapid soil degradation and low crop yields once native lands are converted to agriculture the assessment and management of degraded fields is constrained by the low resource availability to support field data collection crop simulation models offer tools for assessing the degradation problem and support improved management decisions though a host of comprehensive crop models have been published their wide scale application in the tropics especially as decision support tools continues to lag largely due to the types and fine scale data requirements for model execution which are often lacking in the tropical regions in this paper we present a simple modelling framework that is capable of simulating the impact of soil degradation on maize yields using field scale agriculture data the major departure of this new modelling framework is the description of erosion in terms of soil depth loss instead of soil mass loss the framework which was developed from an assembly of relevant theory and equations in the published literature is designed to address the data paucity challenges often encountered in many tropical regions the model was programmed in excel and tested against published observed maize yields for situations where the maize was grown on simulated eroded soils of varying severity and nitrogen application rates the model simulated well the decline in maize yields with increased erosion severity and varying nitrogen application rates r2 0 79 nrmse 28 and willmott d index 0 95 it is concluded that the model though simple provided a framework for assessing maize yield response to varied soil degradation conditions keywords erosion maize yield simulation soil degradation 1 introduction soil degradation is a major constraint to soil and crop productivity sustenance especially in tropical agricultural systems the degradation process which often begins once native or uncultivated tropical lands are converted to cropping can be attributed to several causes such as i the rapid decline in soil organic matter som and fertility ii the deterioration of soil biological activity iii changes in soil erosion and its associated som loss and increased compaction lal and moldenhauer 1987 and iv the loss of soil profile depth leading to the reduction of soil water and nutrient availability the rapid decline in fertility is associated with som loss because the som is a major nutrient reservoir in low input tropical agricultural systems brams 1971 observed a loss of 50 som stock within a period of 5 years following the clearing of a native forest land in sierra leone studies in ghana also showed that under poor soil management som decreased from 18 0 to 7 0 g kg over a 4 year period after converting a long term fallow land to crop land adiku et al 2009 tropical agricultural literature is full of evidence of soil productivity decline due to som loss e g reeves 1997 oldfield et al 2019 the severity of the fertility decline is often compounded by the nature of the cropping practices studies have shown significant loss of nutrients in monoculture compared with intercropping systems in the semi deciduous zone of ghana bashagaluke et al 2018 reduced biological activity is also commonly found in degraded soils tete mensah et al 1999 observed substantially higher earthworm density of 80 m2 in a protected forest than that 10 m2 of an adjacent maize farm in a forest savannah transition zone of ghana a number of studies have shown that microbial biomass carbon mbc differed significantly between native or uncultivated lands and long term cropped fields nunes et al 2012 by far however the physical human interactions such as agriculture with natural ecosystems often set in a degradation spiral that rapidly deteriorates soil productivity rodriguez et al 2020 observed that peat in the usa everglades that naturally accumulated at 0 08 cm yr now exhibit subsidence rates of 0 65 cm yr due to agricultural use of these peatlands within the tropical agricultural context soil erosion and its associated som loss and soil profile changes can have profound impact on soil productivity studies in the upper east region of ghana by senayah et al 2005 showed a top soil reduction of about 40 cm on croplands over a period of 24 years 1969 1993 due to soil erosion averaging a depth loss rate of almost 2 0 cm yr more commonly the average top soil depth loss rate in ghanaian cropping systems ranges from 0 6 to 1 0 cm yr amegashie et al 2012 the adverse impact of erosion on soil functions and crop productivity has been long observed by many researchers adu 1972 showed that some farming areas within the sudan savanah zone lost more than 90 cm of top soil leading to the disappearance of an entire solum a and b horizons exposing a stiff impervious substratum that restricted root penetration decreased infiltration and increased runoff available evidence also indicated that the loss of soil depth resulted in a decreased soil water holding capacity increased drainage eck et al 1965 sur et al 1992 and increased nitrogen leaching eck 1968 the overall effect of soil degradation is the decline in crop yield farm income and an eventual loss of livelihood adiku et al 2009 observed more than 50 maize yield decline over a 4 year period after converting a long term fallow land to continuous maize cropping system with poor residue management mbagwu et al 1984 observed that the loss of top soil depth between 5 and 20 cm reduced maize yield by 75 to 99 on an alfisol in a sub humid zone of nigeria lal 1983 showed for a nigerian alfisol cropped to maize under natural inherent fertility conditions that the removal of more than 10 cm top soil reduced the yield to less than 0 40 ton ha whereas the yield obtained for the non eroded soil exceeded 1 5 ton ha the application of more than 60 kg n ha did not improve the maize yield beyond 0 50 ton ha on the eroded soil whereas yield for the non eroded soil reached 2 5 ton ha andraski and lowery 1992 attributed the decline in maize yields on eroded soils to the decline in water holding capacity information on soil degradation impacts on crop yields is required to develop appropriate soil management practices however as the impact of soil degradation is often insidious with the effects only observable in the medium to long term the traditional short term field experimentation approaches are insufficient to capture the long term full impact on crop yield alternatively simulation modelling approaches may provide more effective tools for investigating the impacts of soil degradation over various time scales in more timely and cost effective manner indeed advances in crop modelling enable the assessment of the impact of climate soil and management effects on crop growth development and yield a host of dynamic comprehensive functional models such as dssat jones et al 2003 and apsim mccown et al 1996 are currently applied world wide and some of these have been validated for tropical agricultural systems and used in management decision making adiku et al 1998 naab et al 2004 dzotsi et al 2010 fosu mensah et al 2012 maccarthy et al 2017a the inclusion of soil degradation modules in comprehensive models will require the simulation of soil erosion amongst others indeed erosion modelling has advanced over the years with more mechanistic approaches becoming widely available some flow driven soil mass loss based erosion models such as guest rose et al 1998 require detailed characterization of overland flow such as stream power and entrainment high frequency with time steps of minutes hydrological data and soil information e g settling velocity of sediments some crop models such as perfect littleboy et al 1989 and epic sharpley and williams 1990 link soil erosion to crop growth processes enabling the assessment of erosion impact on crop yields there is a renewed effort to include soil erosion modules in apsim holzworth et al 2014 yet the general progress on the application of models for soil degradation impact assessment continues to lag especially in tropical regions it is conceivable that the major handicap to apply these models for soil degradation assessment lies with the types of data required to parameterize and execute them in many data sparse tropical regions the information required by the models are simply unavailable it is our view that for the current soil erosion crop models to find wide scale application in soil degradation impact assessment in tropical agricultural systems the issue of data paucity and the challenges of resource limitation for the conduct of the necessary long term experiments on soil mass loss sediment nutrient loss and crop yields must be addressed adiku et al 2015 have enumerated a number of such challenges in applying the dssat model for agricultural decision making within in a number of locations within the west african agricultural systems it was noted that the main sources of soil information were soil survey manuals that provided general classifications with occasional limited data on texture and depth there were no data on soil mass loss for weather rainfall temperature the data were more readily available at annual seasonal or in limited situations monthly time scales for crop husbandry exact planting dates were not recorded instead the data comprised planting windows often spanning 3 months or more freduah et al 2019 in the case of nutrient management fertilizer and manure application were commonly lumped and expressed as application cost requiring some knowledge of fertilizer prices to estimate applied fertilizer quantities and there was often little or no information on manure quality crop yields were reported on seasonal time scales and in some situations the yields were aggregated at districts and regional scales maccarthy et al 2017b have also discussed a host of other challenges that continue to handicap the wide scale adoption and use of comprehensive crop models in sub saharan africa for agricultural decision support in effect special efforts are required to arrive at plausible input data for running and applying the comprehensive crop models yet it is for these agricultural fields that tropical country governments seek to develop policies to improve output for which crop models could play effective roles as decision support tools the question of interest is whether other alternative modelling concepts can be developed to match the types and quality of data available at the many data sparse locations of interest to assess the impact of soil degradation on crop performance we conjecture that this is feasible provided that the complexity of the models is guided by data availability for example soil erosion could be described in terms of soil depth loss instead of soil mass loss because the former can be more readily estimated from changes in soil profile depths furthermore the data intensity for the modelling could be scaled down with larger response time steps of months and seasons where possible we opine that there is ample published theory and relationships to support the development of such simpler models even if experimentation proceeds slowly due to resource constraints our aim in this study is therefore to present a simple modelling framework for assessing the impact of soil degradation on maize yields especially for the coarse textured soils that abound in many tropical regions the modelling framework is conceived within the context of limited data and resource availability easy comprehension and application by users and the need to minimize computing demand it is envisaged that such a model would complement the crop modelling tool box and provide a bridge to the more comprehensive models 2 materials and methods 2 1 modelling framework conceptually our framework considers the soil degradation processes and the overall impact on crop growth for situations of sheet erosion the concept has 4 process stages first given an initial soil depth fig 1 there is an annual loss of soil depth and associated som stock from a finite soil depth fig 1 event 1 second following the physical soil and som loss the remaining som undergoes biochemical decomposition fig 1 event 2 leading to a final som stock at the end of the annual cycle fig 1 it is assumed that the two processes of physical som loss and biochemical decomposition are not concurrent third the changes in the som stock and loss of top soil affect the soil physical properties such as the bulk density which in turn may alter the soil water characteristics e g field capacity fc permanent wilting point pwp fourth the overall changes in soil profile depth and soil water characteristics impact plant growth through soil water and nutrient availability the task now is to formulate these process stages mathematically 2 1 1 modelling soil depth and associated som loss the first task is to describe the first process of the concept the soil depth loss is assumed to proceed at some constant rate er cm y taken as an input into the model the value of er is derived from the changes of soil profile depth over a given period of time the actual depth loss dz after time t will be er x t so that for a soil profile with initial depth of depth ztot the actual depth after time t will be ztot dz assuming that the som comprising soil organic carbon soc and nitrogen son is uniformly distributed over a soil top depth zc fig 1 then the total soc stock cst kg ha within the depth zc can be determined as 1a c s t œÅ b a s o c z c where a is the soil area 1 ha and œÅb is the bulk density further assuming a carbon nitrogen c n ratio the organic nitrogen stock n st can also be determined from 1b n s t c s t c n we designate the proportion of c st and n st lost physically with the soil depth loss as c ster and n ster respectively since the soil depth diminishes by dz annually then the c ster and n ster lost with depth dz can be determined as 2a c s t e r d z z c c s t and 2b n s t e r d z z c n s t 2 1 2 modelling som decomposition the second soil degradation process involves the biochemical decomposition of som following the physical loss of som the remaining portion of carbon and nitrogen stocks are assumed to decompose biochemically fig 1 according to a first order kinetic 3a d c s t d t a d d c k c c s t and 3b d n s t d t a d d n k n n s t where addc and addn are the addition of carbon and nitrogen respectively from residues if any and k c and k n are the decomposition rate constants for organic carbon and nitrogen respectively it is assumed that carbon and nitrogen stock below the depth z c will remain at some minimum passive level fig 1 equation 3 can be solved either analytically or numerically to obtain the mineralized carbon c min or nitrogen n min at any time t here we follow the numerical approach to obtain 4a c m i n t c m i n t 1 d c s t d t d t and for mineralized nitrogen n min as 4b n m i n t n m i n t 1 d n s t d t d t therefore at the end of an annual crop cycle the total loss of c st and n st is the sum of that lost by physical erosion and biochemical decomposition and can be determined as 5a c s t t c s t t 1 c s t e r c m i n and that for nitrogen stock would be 5b n s t t n s t t 1 n s t e r n m i n the n min and any applied n become available for plant uptake and or leached as explained below 2 1 3 modelling the interactions between som and soil properties the third soil degradation process involves the interactions between som and soil properties following the analysis of a large dataset of soil bulk density œÅb g cm3 and the soc r√ºhlmann and koerschens 2009 derived the relationship 6 œÅ b c d b exp b s o c where the values of the constants were provided by the authors as c 2 68 d 140 93 and b 0 0085 in this study we focus on coarse textured sandy or good structured soils with pores through which water can drain readily to a constant value fc cm3 cm3 and will dry to pwp for such soils som and œÅb induced changes in the water characteristics can be described using pedo transfer equations gupta and larson 1979 7a f c 0 00308 s a n d 0 00589 s i l t 0 00804 c l a y 0 00221 s o m 1 43 œÅ b 7b p w p 0 000059 s a n d 0 00114 s i l t 0 00577 c l a y 0 00223 s o m 0 026 œÅ b the total porosity f can thus be estimated using 8 f 1 œÅ b œÅ s where œÅs 2 65 g cm3 is the average particle density for mineral soils the changes in fc and pwp will alter the soil available water capacity awc fc pwp hence as the degradation proceeds the awc must be continuously updated the fc is of particular importance in water balance modelling because it determines the maximum water holding capacity whc of soil against gravity drainage for a soil profile that is uniform with depth with an initial total depth z tot from which a soil depth of dz has been stripped off by sheet erosion the resultant whc would be given by 9 w h c f c z t o t d z hence the whc of the soil profile will diminish as the erosion proceeds due to the combined effect of dz and the decline in som 2 1 4 modelling the impact of water and nutrient availability on crop yield the final process of our degradation concept relates to the impact of water and nutrient availability on crop yield the assessment of soil water availability requires the solution of the water balance equation given by 10 Œ¥ w p e t a r d in eq 10 Œ¥w is the change in soil water storage w 2 w 1 where w 2 and w 1 are the final and initial water storage respectively p is the rainfall et a is the actual evapotranspiration and r d is a lumped runoff drainage term all the terms are expressed in mm eq 10 can be reformulated as 11 w 2 w 1 p e t a r d the time step chosen for solving eq 11 will depend on the data availability and can range from hours to years for our context we consider the monthly time scale as appropriate based on data available according to rose 2004 mass balance can be applied to eq 11 to arrive at the final soil water storage w f in two ways fig 2 assuming that the soil has a maximum water holding capacity of whc then in the first case where the solution of eq 11 leads to w 2 whc the lumped term r d will be 0 hence for a given initial water storage w 1 and known values of p and eta w 2 can be determined without the need to know r d for this situation w f w 2 however for the second situation where the solution of eq 11 indicates that w 2 whc then r d 0 and the magnitude of r d can be calculated as 12a r d w 2 w h c since the soil can hold a maximum of whc then the final water storage must be set to the whc i e 12b w f w h c the average profile soil water content cm3 cm3 can be determined as 13 Œ∏ w f z t o t d z for the next time step w f becomes the initial water storage and the calculation process is repeated until the end of the simulation there is a need to partition the lumped r d term into its component runoff r and drainage d because d is required to determine nutrient leaching as explained below there are several formulations for runoff determination in the literature for most crop models that operate on a daily time step the usda natural resource conservation service nrsc 1986 curve number technique is employed in other soil physics literature runoff is estimated from infiltration equations requiring knowledge of physical parameters such as sorptivity hydraulic conductivity initial soil water content etc such models operate on very short time steps e g minutes to hours given our context of data paucity the runoff in this study was estimated from the monthly p following sen and altunkaynak 2003 as 14 r 0 2411 x p 3 923 r r d though this estimation does not consider all the important determinants of runoff such as the initial water content that become important at shorter time steps e g daily the equation was shown to perform well by the authors for the types of soils considered in this study furthermore the condition imposed in eq 14 provides an upper bound for r other factors such as increased bulk density commonly observed for eroded soils can impede infiltration sur et al 1998 thereby increasing runoff assuming that runoff increases as porosity declines a bulk density adjustment factor œÅb fact was derived from the inverse of porosity f in eq 6 to arrive at 15 œÅ b f a c t 0 974 œÅ b 0 3636 so that the actual runoff œÅb fact r with r known d can also be determined the monthly r and d are summed over the season the et a term of eq 11 provides the link between the water availability and crop growth for crop yield data that are reported seasonally we select the simple seasonal water production function of doorenbos and kassam 1979 to calculate the relative yield as 16 y a y p 1 k y 1 e t a e t m where y a and y p are the actual and potential yield kg ha respectively et a and et m are seasonal actual and maximum evapotranspiration and k y is the yield response factor 1 25 for maize this equation has been used widely in fao literature and has basis in the studies on the relation between transpiration and crop yields by de wit 1958 the maximum evapotranspiration et m was determined as 17 e t m e t p k c where et p the potential evapotranspiration estimated from meteorological formula or input as measured data and kc is the fao crop coefficient allen et al 1998 the actual evapotranspiration term et a is obtained as 18 e t a Œ± e t m where Œ± is the soil water availability or stress factor determined according to feddes et al 1978 as Œ± Œ∏ Œ∏ p w p Œ∏ c Œ∏ p w p f o r Œ∏ p w p Œ∏ Œ∏ c 19 a Œ∏ s Œ∏ Œ∏ s Œ∏ f c f o r Œ∏ f c Œ∏ Œ∏ s 19 b 1 f o r Œ∏ c Œ∏ Œ∏ f c 19 c where Œ∏c is the critical water content below which water availability declines set to 65 of whc the dependence of w 2 or w f and hence whc on the changing soil profile depth has implications for drainage d because as erosion proceeds and whc decreases d would increase increasing d also has implications for nutrient leaching consider the nutrient balance given by 20 Œ¥ n n m i n n f n l n u where Œ¥n is the change in soil nutrient storage n min is the mineralized nutrient n f is applied fertilizer nutrient n l is the nutrient leached and n u is plant nutrient uptake with all the terms expressed in kg ha clearly increasing d will also increase the n l term the literature abounds with many descriptions of nutrient leaching ranging from convective dispersion equations to simple mass flow a simple formulation derived from the principles of chromatography was put forward by burns 1975 to describe the seasonal nitrate n leaching if the nitrate n is uniformly distributed throughout the soil profile then the seasonal fraction f r leached from the soil profile is related to d in cm and fc by 21a f r d d Œ∏ f c h 2 where h the effective rooting depth in this case z tot dz and Œ∏fc is the field capacity water content cm3 cm3 however if nitrate n is applied to the soil surface then f r is given by 21b f r d d Œ∏ f c h the quantity of nitrogen leached will be n fr this seasonal nutrient leaching estimation would suffice for data sparse situations where the within seasonal nutrient leaching is not the focus as for the water balance n u provides the link between the nutrient balance and crop growth a nitrogen stress factor n str was derived for maize as a function of seasonal nitrogen uptake nu using published data from sources such as fosu et al 2004 22 n s t r 1 10 6 n u 3 0 0002 n u 2 0 0104 n u r 2 0 96 the seasonal nitrogen limited maize yield y n is then calculated as y p x n str given the situation of multiple resource stresses simulated actual maize yield y a was estimated as 23 y a m i n n s t r w s t r y p where the function min selects the minimum of the terms in the bracket following liebig s law 2 1 5 model parametrization and implementation equations 1 to 23 constitute our soil degradation modelling framework which was programmed in excel spreadsheet excel was chosen as the computing platform because of the relative simplicity of the model a flow chart for the operation sequences is given in fig 3 the soil depth loss is input at an annual time step also the carbon and nitrogen dynamics are executed on an annual time step but the water balance simulation operates on a monthly time step from january to december with maize growth estimated from a 4 month growing season at the end of the growing season the simulated monthly runoff drainage and evapotranspiration are summed up to obtain seasonal values the seasonal d is used to compute nitrate n leaching while the seasonal eta was used to estimate the maize yield the potential maize yield is an input parameter parameters and other input data with their units and sources required for the model execution are summarized in table 1 the model can be executed for single or multiple years in the case of the latter the water balance is executed continuously over the years from january with the water storage in december becoming the initial value for the next january 2 1 6 model evaluation the modelling framework was evaluated by comparing observed and simulated soc n min and maize yields for the various soil degradation conditions the observed data were from three published studies in the literature i e munodawafa 2011 sur et al 1998 adiku et al 2009 the agreement between the observed and simulated data were based on three statistical measures i coefficient of determination r 2 ii normalized rmse nrmse and iii willmott et al 2012 d statistic the nrmse is given by 24a n r m s e r m s e o i 100 where o i is observed mean and the rmse is defined as 24b r m s e 1 n y i e l d s i m u l a t e d i y i e l d o b s e r v d i 2 0 5 values of nrmse beyond 30 of the overall mean indicate unsatisfactory agreement the willmott d statistic is given by 25 d 1 1 1 i n s i o i 2 i 1 i n s i o o i o 2 where s i is simulated data and o is the mean of the observed data perfect agreement between the simulated and observed is attained when d 1 2 2 data sources three sources of data were used to test the model framework the first two studies used de surfaced soils or scalping i e physical removal of soil to a specified depth as surrogates for eroded soils even though it is known that scalping approaches do not adequately represent the gradual and selective removal of humus and fine materials under natural erosion processes lal 1985 actual data from long term erosion impact studies were not readily available to us especially in tropical agriculture conditions hence our current study was limited largely to such scalping datasets in addition however we also include data from a relatively short term study that investigated the effect of soil degradation following differential residue management on maize yield the first data source by munodawafa 2011 was a study conducted to assess erosion impact on maize yield in zimbabwe the soil was sandy sand content 82 with relatively low som of 5 g kg equivalent to 3 0 g kg soc and 0 70 g kg total nitrogen tn soil depth reached about 80 cm with stone lining at 50 and 80 cm depth in this study maize was cultivated on a base soil no erosion and on soils from which the surfaces were scalped to 5 10 15 and 20 cm resulting in 4 eroded scenarios all making 5 levels thus dz values in our model were set to 0 no erosion 5 10 15 and 20 cm in the model there were two fertilizer application levels 35 and 69 kg n ha all making a total of 10 treatments and maize yields were published for each of the treatments furthermore the author also provided measured data on the bulk density and total organic matter for each eroded soil the latter was converted to soil carbon and used in simulating soc and son dynamics and the mineralized nitrogen n min by employing equations 2 to 4 for those input data required by the model that were not available in these publications other relevant sources were consulted the generic long term monthly rainfall and potential evapotranspiration data were obtained from munodawafa 2012 the second study was conducted by sur et al 1998 at the punjab agricultural research station india this study also employed the scalping approach of de surfaced soils to represent eroded soils there were 3 eroded treatments 0 6 12 and 18 cm making 4 levels of erosion therefore for this study dz values were set to 0 6 12 and 18 cm in the model maize was cultivated under 6 different nitrogen fertilizer application rates ranging from 0 to 200 kg n ha resulting in 24 treatments and the yields were reported for each treatment our simulations considered up to 120 kg n ha application rates only soil depth reached about 60 cm and the bulk density for each de surfaced soil was provided additionally data were reported for mineralized n n min over the growing season for each de surfaced soil condition the latter served as validation data for the simulated n min though sur et al 1998 only indicated soc content for this sandy loam soil as 2 9 g kg detailed data on soc distribution with depth for this soil was published by jalota et al 2010 this enabled the assignment of different soc values to the different de surfaced soils and subsequent n min simulation the monthly rainfall during the maize growing season was provided by sur et al 1998 however long term average monthly evapo transpiration data taken from saha et al 2018 were used for water balance modelling the third study reported by adiku et al 2009 was conducted in a forest savannah transition zone of ghana the soils belong to haplic lixisols which are sandy with appreciable concretions at a depth of 70 cm prior to the commencement of the study the field soil was fallowed for 5 years the initial soc was 18 0 g kg and the average bulk density was 1 50 g cm3 the study investigated the impact of 7 different maize fallow rotation treatments on maize yields and soil carbon over a 4 year period from 2003 to 2006 of these the treatment of interest to our current study is the maize bare fallow rotation where all residues were removed and the fields kept weed free following each maize harvest the soc was measured at 6 month intervals during the 4 years and used as validation data using the first year soc to initialize the model the soc variation over the 4 year period was simulated using equations 2 and 3 with no carbon input add c 0 at annual time scales monthly rainfall data were available for the 4 years the average monthly temperature t av c data recorded over the 4 years were used to compute the etp following blaney and criddle 1962 the seasonal rainfall data for the maize growing periods were reported as 550 480 245 and 420 mm for years 2003 2004 2005 and 2006 respectively maize yield was determined for each season though not measured there were visible signs of severe soil erosion by the commencement of year 3 therefore the rate of soil depth loss er was estimated at 1 0 cm yr which is comparable to rates published for severe eroding ghanaian soils amegashie et al 2012 3 results 3 1 simulation of carbon and nitrogen the test of the soc and son dynamics modelling was somewhat handicapped by the limited measured data available for this study despite this limitation it could be shown that the modelling framework captured correctly r2 0 96 nrmse 9 4 the temporal soc decline fig 4 with time as observed in the adiku et al 2009 by the 4th year of the study soc reduced by 50 and this was well reproduced by the model even though the model tended to somewhat overestimate the soc with regard to n dynamics the decreasing amounts of n mineralized with the severity of de surfacing as observed by sur et al 1998 was also well r2 0 76 nrmse 13 simulated fig 5 thus in general the soc and son dynamics aspects of the modelling framework could be considered reliable 3 2 simulation of water and nitrogen balance components total soil profile depth for the munodawafa 2011 soils declined from 80 cm to 60 cm with a corresponding reduction in the whc from 69 to 38 mm table 2 constituting a 45 reduction in whc though the measured water balance components were not reported by munodawafa 2011 the simulation results showed that r increased only slightly 9 5 with erosion severity on the contrary d increased sharply 4 fold with erosion severity overall the proportion of rainfall seasonal p 502 mm lost as runoff and drainage increased from 39 for the non eroded soils to 62 for the severely eroded soils the simulated eta decreased with erosion severity by about 48 suggesting less water availability to maize crop upon the reduction in soil depth additionally the reduction of the rooting depth could affect plant nutrient uptake lal and moldenhauer 1987 with regard to n economy the simulated n min decreased with erosion severity table 2 ranging from 69 kg n ha for the non eroded soil down to 22 0 kg n ha for the severely eroded soil on the contrary leached n nl increased with erosion severity for the low n application rate of 35 kg n ha the simulated leached n was 45 kg n ha for the non eroded soil and 47 kg n ha for the severely eroded soil corresponding to 41 and 83 respectively of the total applied and mineralized n nitrogen leaching was much more pronounced for the higher nitrogen application rate of 69 kg n ha the proportion of n leached increased from 37 non eroded to 80 severely eroded soil this would have serious implications for the efficiency of mineral fertilizer use in smallholder systems where external inputs are usually low kihara et al 2015 in the case of sur et al 1998 study with a relatively shallow soil z tot 60 cm the effective depth for the severely eroded soil was only 42 cm table 3 the decline in whc ranged from 107 mm for the non eroded soil down to 66 mm for the severely eroded soil indicating about 38 loss in whc similar to the munodawafa 2011 study the simulated runoff r increased less rapidly than the drainage d the seasonal rainfall was generally high p 839 mm resulting in a high proportion of r d losses i e 57 for the non eroded to 70 for the severely eroded soil the simulated eta decreased by about 34 on the severely eroded soil compared to the non eroded soil unlike the munodawafa 2011 study the model showed that the initial contribution from n min to the overall nitrogen economy was fairly high ranging from about 96 kg n ha for the non eroded soil down to 49 kg n ha for the severely eroded soil table 3 thus even with no fertilizer n application n availability was still appreciable to support good maize yield for the non eroded soil however for the severely eroded soil even very high n application rates of 120 kg n ha could still not sustain high yields probably due to the very high 88 leaching rates table 3 the short term study by adiku et al 2009 suggested that soil depth loss was not pronounced within the period of the investigation the total soil profile depth was estimated to decline from 70 to 67 cm by year 4 table 4 resulting in the whc reductions by 8 from 74 to 68 mm as rainfall patterns varied with time so did the proportions of r d losses but in general most of the years lost 35 of the rainfall as r d the simulated eta also varied with rainfall with year 3 which was particularly dry recording the least value 84 mm whereas year 1 recorded the highest eta of 334 mm the simulations suggest that n min was initially very high but decreased by about 50 with time from 413 kg n ha in year 1 to 198 kg n ha by year 4 nitrogen leaching followed the rainfall pattern and was negligible in the low rainfall year 3 3 maize yield simulation the simulation of soil degradation impact on maize yield suggested that in most cases the nitrogen economy dominated the yield determination compared to rainfall except where rainfall was exceptionally low in the case of the munodawafa 2011 dataset fig 6 observed maize yields were highest for the non eroded soils declining sharply with erosion severity apparently due to the declining n availability at the relatively low n application rate of 35 kg n ha observed maize yield decreased from 2000 for the non eroded soil to less than 800 kg ha for the severely eroded soil representing a 60 reduction in yield though doubling the fertilizer application rate to 69 kg n ha increased the yield to 1170 kg ha for the severely eroded soil it was about 65 less than the yield 3305 kg ha observed for the non eroded soil thus increased fertilizer application did not significantly improve maize yields especially on the severely degraded soil the efficiency of fertilizer applied reduced markedly as soil degradation set in partial factor of productivity of n applied at 39 kg ha declined from 70 kg grain kg n applied for the non eroded soil to 10 kg grain kg n applied for the severely eroded soil similar patterns of maize yield response were also simulated for the sur et al 1998 dataset fig 7 in that yield declined with erosion severity at zero n application rate the simulated n min was 96 kg n ha for the non eroded soil thus even if as much as 64 was lost by leaching table 3 the available n could still support an appreciable yield of 1980 kg ha for the severely eroded situation however n min reduced sharply to 49 kg n ha table 3 so that after leaching the remaining n would be very low resulting in a sharp decline in yield fig 7 it is worth to note that even at high n application rate of 120 kg n ha the maize yield 1069 kg ha under the severely eroded soils was still significantly lower than the corresponding yield from the non eroded soil 2900 kg ha in effect increasing n application to the severely eroded soil did not engender commensurate yield response much of the fertilizer applied was simply lost by leaching table 3 earlier studies have also confirmed these tendencies lal 1983 with regard to the adiku et al 2009 dataset maize yield varied not only with n economy but also with water availability fig 8 when rainfall was adequate in years 1 and 2 n availability determined the maize yield however year 3 recorded no yield because of the lack of rainfall during the critical reproductive stage of the crop even though the maize received about 240 mm rainfall earlier in the season any prior water uptake by the maize crop in may and june estimated as et a 84 mm table 4 did not translate into maize yield even though n may not have been limiting in year 4 when rainfall improved maize yield also improved overall the model simulations of maize yields under the various erosion and n application rates compared reasonably well with the observed fig 9 with r2 0 79 normalized rmse of 28 and willmott d index 0 93 4 discussion the major limitation to this study was our inability to validate the water and nutrient balance components due to the lack of measured data in all the three datasets studies that document simultaneously soil erosion water and nutrient balance and crop yields over long term are often lacking in tropical agricultural systems and this challenge limited a more rigorous examination of the model furthermore the use of soil depth loss as a surrogate for soil mass loss in erosion studies may not fully capture the erosion process but for many situations where data on sediment loss is lacking this may be a useful approach as demonstrated a modelling framework assemblage of existing equations that utilizes soil depth loss as a proxy for erosion can be easily verified using calibrated erosion pins the important issue which relates to the inadequacy of using soil scalping as surrogate for erosion under natural conditions has been discussed elsewhere lal 1985 though the study by adiku et al 2009 could have captured the natural erosion phenomenon better the focus was not on erosion and hence the relevant water balance components were not documented also the period of study was relatively short given that whc decreased by only 6 mm over the 4 year duration of the study suggests that the initial impact of physical soil depth loss on water storage and hence maize yield was negligible presumably it was the rapid fall of the soc from 18 g kg to 7 0 g kg within the first 4 years that accounted for the soil degradation impact on crop yields at the early stages of the degradation process with time however the reduction in whc and increased nitrogen loss via leaching would become the dominant processes that determine crop yields the modelling framework also has limitations that would require improvement first the sequence of the som loss processes as shown in fig 1 stipulated that the loss by the physical processes was complete before the remainder of the som decomposed for the scalping de surfaced soils situations as in datasets 1 and 2 this may be valid because the soil was de surfaced before the maize experiments were conducted however for more real time field situations such as in dataset 3 the erosion and som decomposition would concur over the duration of the season or over the years some of the n derived from the decomposing som in the eroding soil depth may be available for plant uptake our model was not designed to capture such within season events even if the model had the capability to assess these within season processes a rigorous test would still be handicapped by the lack of the relevant test data second our assumption of a constant soil depth loss rate e r cm yr over time may not be entirely valid as the erosion rate is generally a function of tillage and soil management nearing et al 2017 apart it is conceivable that e r may be low soon after the conversion of native land to agriculture because of initial relatively high som and structural stability however e r would increase rapidly as som declined with time and finally decline to some minimum as the erodible fine materials diminish an analysis of the time variation of erosion rates or in our situation soil depth loss rates by megahan 1974 indicated that erosion dynamics can be described by a negative exponential equation therefore in applying our model over long periods of time the time variation in e r must be considered third our sole reliance on published theory relations and data sources for model development and testing has both advantages and disadvantages on the one hand we could make progress with regard to the assembly of equations to construct the model without the need to embark on field experimentation which would be handicapped by resource unavailability on the other hand errors inherent in the adopted equations may propagate and diminish the accuracy of the simulations the tradeoff between model accuracy and the need for a model applicable within the context of data paucity would remain a debate in simulation studies it is our view that the simple modelling framework as put forward in this study could provide a starting tool for investigating soil degradation impact on crop performance in data sparse situations for many resource poor countries this approach could be a starting point to transit later more comprehensive models as data availability improves 5 conclusion we have presented a modelling framework for simulating the impact of soil degradation on maize yields under varied environmental and management conditions the overarching aim was to present the model at the level of detail that matched the types of input and observations that are commonly available for many agricultural fields in data sparse environments the framework used soil depth loss instead of soil mass loss in its description of soil erosion furthermore theory and relations from the published literature were used for model development the evaluation of the model was on limited published data of maize yields under varying degradation severity and management conditions the results showed that the model captured well the decreasing trends of maize yields with increasing erosion severity also the year to year variation of maize yields as soil degradation progressed could be well simulated by the model we conclude that for many resource poor and data sparse countries this model could provide a starting tool for investigating the impact of soil degradation on crop performance credit authroship adiku s g k model
