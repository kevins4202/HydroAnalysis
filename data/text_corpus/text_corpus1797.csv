8985,seasonal agricultural droughts sad often cause yield loss for the farming community around the world reinforcing the need to optimize both water saving measures and irrigation schedules to improve irrigation water use efficiency this study proposed a copula based stochastic multiobjective programming c smp model for optimizing irrigation strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of sad the model uses the regional net irrigation water demand and stream runoff to formulate the copula which better characterizes sad drought scenarios are selected based on reservoir storage capacity and irrigation water use efficiency then randomness of drought scenarios from copula model multiple conflicting objectives selecting of water saving measures and deficit irrigation strategy optimization were addressed via the stochastic multiobjective programming technique a case study was conducted in the dongfeng reservoir irrigation district dfrid meishan city of sichuan province southwest china to optimize both water saving measures and deficit irrigation schedules for different crops during their growth periods the results showed that 1 the joint distribution model established by the frank copula function had the best performance in measuring sad and the probability of drought occurrence was 25 in dfrid 2 optimal irrigation strategies improved the yield of wheat and citrus by around 12 51 32 22 and 8 33 12 83 respectively compared with the average level of meishan city only the yield of rape was reduced by 27 68 1 42 under the extreme dry condition of net irrigation water demand while it increased by 1 84 4 56 when the net irrigation water demand niwd was in a dry condition 3 the c smp demonstrated clear advantages in dealing with multiple conflicting objectives and the randomness of sad scenarios the proposed approach is applicable for irrigation districts suffering from sad and can help formulate more effective and sustainable irrigation strategies keywords seasonal agricultural drought copula stochastic multiobjective programming irrigation strategy optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought constitutes a prominent meteorological and natural hazards leading to significant economic for the global farming community narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 it is not limited to arid and semi arid regions but also occurs in humid regions with uneven precipitation distribution within a year named seasonal drought rhee et al 2010 the agricultural sector is particularly susceptible to the impact of drought due to its high reliance on water meza et al 2020 moreover the exacerbation of global warming is projected to escalate the frequency and severity of seasonal drought sheffield et al 2012 which could further jeopardize agricultural production and food security besides with the increasing population the capacity of food production has become insufficient to meet the growing demand godfray et al 2010 leading to an inevitable food crisis in light of these challenges effective irrigation strategies are imperative to mitigate the adverse impacts of seasonal agricultural drought sad on crop yields and improve water use efficiency generally drought can be categorized into four types namely meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic droughts zhou et al 2021 to identify these types of drought events several indicators have been proposed including the standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the effective reconnaissance drought index erdi tigkas et al 2017 the integrated monitoring index idmi kumar et al 2021 and the standardized streamflow index ssi among others most of these indicators were developed using historical data on univariate variables such as precipitation reference crop evapotranspiration et0 and stream runoff however the drought events are interdependent because there are complex interactions among these variables for example sad is greatly affected by both irrigation and meteorological conditions li et al 2023 and artificial irrigation plays a crucial role in preventing sad the imbalance between available irrigation water and crop water demand is one of the main reasons for sad vergni and todisco 2011 and these two aspects should be analyzed together to consider the mutual impacts of variables thereupon univariate analysis cannot adequately capture the correlations among multiple variables leading to inaccurate evaluations of sad it is essential to use multivariate models to integrate various factors for multilateral analysis bhuyan erhardt et al 2019 among various methods copula is regarded as a promising approach for assessing multivariate probability distribution as it can handle variables without the information of independence normality or equality of marginal distribution zhang and singh 2007 copulas have been widely used to analyze joint distribution characteristics of various factors such as water and energy cai et al 2019 precipitation and evapotranspiration liu and yang 2021 available water and precipitation li et al 2017 and severity peak duration of meteorological droughts nabaei et al 2019 numerous attempts have been made in the field of sad using copula models for example ribeiro et al 2019 employed copula functions to establish the relationship between crop yield and drought indicators evapotranspiration index spei vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci and effectively evaluated the probability of crop loss with varying drought severity in italy wang et al 2022 constructed a copula function that incorporated drought severity and duration to estimate the return period of sad across china although these studies effectively described the multivariable nature of sad certain key factors such as the water consumption characteristics of regional crops and the effect of reservoir on available water resources for irrigation were not considered in the copula formulation to better depict sad in a seasonal drought region we endeavored to build copula models that incorporated regional net irrigation water demand and stream runoff we selected drought scenarios based on reservoir storage capacity and irrigation water use efficiency additionally very few studies have integrated sad analysis and coping strategies for sad in one framework but such studies hold significant practical significance for regions severely impacted by sad mathematical modeling is an effective tool for formulating optimal strategies and numerous mathematical models have been developed to capture the complex characteristics of irrigation management system li et al 2022 yue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the primary objective of these models has been to optimally allocate limited resources of irrigation water and land but few of them have focused on optimizing water saving measures which is a critical technical method for enhancing irrigation water use efficiency various water saving irrigation measures such as canal sprinkling drip low pressure pipe irrigation possess differences in construction cost and water saving efficiency therefore irrigation strategies should be formulated to alleviate crop yield loss under sad by selecting appropriate water saving measures and optimizing irrigation schedules previous agricultural water management studies have successfully addressed multiple complexities through corresponding models for example interval programming zhang et al 2018 fuzzy programming yue et al 2020 stochastic programming wang et al 2020 and multiobjective programming lence et al 2017 have been proposed to handle statistical data uncertainties fuzziness of subjective judgment of decision makers randomness of hydrometeorological events and conflicting multiple objectives respectively however these models have not been effectively coupled with the copula method which hinders their applications in practical droughts therefore this paper endeavors to propose a copula based stochastic multiobjective programming c smp model considering the randomness of drought scenarios from copula model multiple conflicting objectives for optimizing irrigation strategy the proposed approach offers the following contributions 1 identification of sad by integrating the water consumption characteristics of regional crops and the impact of the reservoir on the available water resources for irrigation using copula model 2 concurrent optimization of water saving measures and deficit irrigation schedules to mitigate the crop yield loss caused by sad 3 resolution of tradeoffs between multiple conflicting objectives and benefit cost analysis when generating optimal alternatives under uncertainty the proposed approach can be employed to optimize irrigation strategies in irrigation districts that suffer from sad 2 methodology 2 1 problem statement drought is one of most important factors hindering agricultural production for irrigation district with sad decision makers usually have to deal with the following problems in practical irrigation management 1 the dynamic change of water resources in irrigation districts with sad is fast precisely identifying drought scenarios and determining their probability of occurrence are fundamental challenges for optimizing irrigation strategies in multi crop systems 2 water saving measures and deficit irrigation strategies are required for some crops to enhance the irrigation water use efficiency the economic benefits and irrigation efficiency should be balanced when selecting the best irrigation mode 3 multiple complexities such as conflicting objectives and randomness of drought scenarios should be considered simultaneously in the decision making process developing satisfactory irrigation strategies to address these complexities poses a challenge to decision makers to tackle above issues this study proposes an optimal modeling approach for optimizing irrigation strategies as presented in fig 1 the reminder of the paper comprises three sections 1 the copula method for generating sad scenarios and determining their probability 2 the formulation of a copula based stochastic multiobjective programming model considering multiple complexities and 3 a real world case study to demonstrate the approach s application additional details are provided in the following sections 2 2 probability of combined seasonal agricultural drought scenarios sad is characterized by a deficiency of water in crops resulting from a continuous shortage of soil water this deficit is primarily caused by two factors the persistent aridity of climate and the scarcity of available irrigation water resources to accurately represent sad scenarios it is necessary to consider both meteorological and hydrological droughts which can be reflected through the net irrigation water demand niwd of crops and stream runoff respectively the data on stream runoff can be collected directly while the nind during a given time period t can be calculated through following equation 1 n i w d t 10 j j a j k c j t e t 0 j t e p t where the t and j indicate the time period and crop type a j is the planting area of crop j ha k c jt is the crop coefficient of crop j during time period t 10 is the unit conversion factor from millimeter to cubic meter per hectare et 0 jt is reference crop evapotranspiration of crop j during time period t mm which can be obtained by the fao pm equation allan et al 1998 ep t represents the effective precipitation during time period t mm which can be obtained formulas follows kang cai 1996 zhang et al 2022 2 e p t p t p t 50 m m 0 75 p t 5 0 m m p t 150 m m 0 7 p t 150 m m p t where p t is the precipitation observed from meteorological station during period t mm then the copula function is used to calculate the joint probability of combined scenarios of niwd and stream runoff the copula function is a powerful tool for deriving joint distributions given the marginal distributions sklar 1959 and has been widely used to define non parametric measures of dependence for pairs of random variables li et al 2017 setting x and y as random variables of niwd and stream runoff the joint distribution function c x y can be expressed as 3 c x y c θ f x x f y y where c θ u v is the copula function which includes many types such as gaussian copula function t copula gumbel copula frank copula and clayton copula θ is the parameter of copula function f x x and f y y are the marginal distribution functions of x and y with the help of copula function the joint probability for two variables x and y can be generated and the detailed steps are introduced as follows 1 the correlation between niwd and stream runoff should be clarified via pearson spearman and kendall correlation coefficients cai et al 2019 2 establishing the individual marginal distribution functions of niwd and stream runoff through kernel density estimation kamalov 2020 hasan et al 2016 which is a nonparametric method to estimate nonparametric marginal distribution functions for random variables the goodness of fit is tested by kolmogorov smirnov method goodman 1954 3 correlation index method is used to estimate unknown parameters of the two dimensional archimedean copula function including gumbel clayton and frank copula and the maximum likelihood method was applied to estimate parameters of the copula function liu and yang 2021 4 based on the empirical copula function c u v the squared euclidean distance ed formula 4 was used to measure each copula function and the copula function with the smallest value can be chosen to construct the joint function of niwd and stream runoff 4 e d 2 n 1 n c u n v n c 0 u n v n 2 where n stands for the sample size c 0 u v is the jointly probability calculated through raw data 1 to focus drought conditions we assumed both niwd and stream runoff had three hydrological characteristics extreme dry dry and normal condition including normal wet and other conditions and thus nine combination scenarios were generated as shown table 1 2 the bivariate joint probability for two variables x and y are described in table 1 li et al 2017 nabaei et al 2019 where u 1 u 2 v 1 v 2 are the marginal distribution values of x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 2 3 copula based stochastic multiobjective programming for optimizing irrigation strategy in this section a copula based stochastic multiobjective programming c smp model was developed with the aid of generated scenarios and joint probability to address the issue of sad the optimization of water allocation and water saving transformation should be simultaneously conducted consequently the decision variables in the c smp model corresponded to the amount of irrigation water and area proportion of water saving transformation for each crop across multiple scenarios the model parameters were defined in table 2 2 3 1 objective functions three objectives are considered in this study to reflect the main concerns of decision makers to simultaneously optimize the irrigation water under stochastic scenarios each objective is expressed by expected value as follows 5 max f n k k p k f k x 1 maximum economic benefit economic benefit is the primary objective in crop planting and the objective function can be expressed as formula 6 economic benefit of each scenario k can be obtained via total economic benefit minus total cost formula 7 and jensen model jensen 1968 was used for simulate the yield of crop j under scenario k formula 8 the total economic cost includes the cost of irrigation water cost and water saving transformation cost which can be written as 6 max f 1 k k p k e b k 7 e b k j 1 j a j y j k m p j j 1 j a j cost j k 8 y j k y max j t t m j t k e p t k e t max j t k λ j t 9 cost j k

one of the most important problems faced by decision makers is how to ensure the crop yield therefore the second objective is to maximize the expected yield under multiple scenarios the objective function can be written as 10 max f 2 k k p k t y k 11 t y k j 1 j a j y j k 3 maximum irrigation water productivity irrigation water productivity is another main factor that should be considered by decision makers especially when water deficit occurs in irrigation districts this objective can help improve water use efficiency and thus it should be maximized and the corresponding objective function can be written as 12 max f 3 k k p k i w p k 13 i w p k j j a j y j k 10 j j t t a j g i j t k 14 g i j t k s 1 j k m j t k η 1 s 2 j k m j t k η 2 s 3 j k m j t k η 3 s 4 j k m j t k η 4 2 3 2 constraints 1 water supply constraint irrigation water allocation for crops should not be larger than total surface water supply generally the available surface water is taken from reservoirs and the total water availability during whole growth period should not be larger than the available reservoir volume for irrigation this constraint can be expressed as 15 j 1 j t 1 t 10 a j g i j t k α i r w t t r t k ε t t k 2 water demand constraint in different scenarios irrigation water allocation of crops during each period should be larger than the minimum water demand of crops only in this way can the crops survive and grow normally this constraint can be expressed as 16 w d min j t k m j t k e p j t k j t k 3 irrigation quota constraint when facing sad deficit irrigation is necessary for guaranteeing the crop yield and water use efficiency english and raja 1996 in order to ensure crop growth under deficit irrigation mode the net irrigation water allocation during whole growth period should be less than the irrigation quota of deficit irrigation this constraint can be expressed as 17 t t m j t k m j j k 4 water saving transformation constraint four widely used water saving measures in drought regions including canal sprinkling drip and low pressure pipe irrigation were considered in this study zou et al 2013 this constraint is to screen the optimal water saving irrigation measures under different drought scenarios and define their use proportions this constraint can be expressed as 18 s 1 j k s 2 j k s 3 j k s 4 j k 1 j k 5 maximum investment in water saving transformation constraint for conducting water saving transformation on the existing farmland economic investments are needed the average cost of water saving transformation should be less than the maximum available investment this constraint can be expressed as 19 j j a j s 1 j k c c 1 s 2 j k c c 2 s 3 j k c c 3 s 4 j k c c 4 i v j j a j 6 non negative constraint the decision variables should not be negative 20 m i j k 0 i j k 21 s 1 j k s 2 j k s 3 j k s 4 j k 0 j k 2 4 model solution to solve the conflicting objectives of c smp model the minimum deviation method li et al 2019 was applied the steps of solving c smp model can be summarized as following steps in details 1 model the c smp problem 2 calculate best value f 1 b f 2 b f 3 b and worst value f 1 w f 2 w f 3 w of each objective under the constraints 3 generate the single objective model the objective function can be written as following equation 22 f ω 1 f 1 b f 1 f 1 b f 1 w ω 2 f 1 f 2 b f 2 w f 2 b ω 3 f 3 f 3 b f 3 w f 3 b where ɷ 1 ɷ 2 and ɷ 3 are important weights of each objective which is usually obtained by analytic hierarchy process ahp method 4 solve the single objective model in lingo software and generate optimal schemes under different scenarios 3 application in real world case 3 1 study area the study area is the dongfeng reservoir irrigation district dfrid situated in meishan city of sichuan province in southwest china 103 14 24 3 103 35 24 2 e 29 52 19 4 30 08 15 6 n fig 2 the dfrid exhibits a typical subtropical humid climate with an annual average temperature relative humidity duration of sunshine evaporation precipitation and wind speed of 16 5 c 83 1079 2 h 968 4 mm 1250 3 mm and 1 2 m s respectively despite the annual precipitation being greater than the annual evaporation sad is a common issue in the dfrid about 81 of the annual rainfall and 85 of the stream runoff occur between may and september whereas irrigation water deficits are often experienced from october to april seriously affecting regional agricultural production dfrid adopts multiple a multi cropping system with the primary crops consisting of wheat rice maize rape and citrus which collectively occupy approximately 86 of the total cultivated area among these crops wheat and rape are planted during early october to next early may while citrus is cultivated perennially given their vulnerability to sad these three crops are selected as research object in this study irrigation of all crops in dfrid is performed using surface water from the dongfeng reservoir located on the anxi river the irrigation water use efficiency of the study area is about 0 53 when sad occurs irrigation strategies must be optimized to mitigate water shortages thereby improving crop yield and water use efficiency 3 2 data collection and processing 3 2 1 data collection to solve the c smp model many parameters should be collected these parameters were acquired through various sources including field survey hydrometric station government reports of dfrid statistical yearbooks and published references meteorological data during 1970 2000 were downloaded from china meteorological data network http data cma cn with the meteorological station of no 56385 runoff data for the dongfeng reservoir were collected through field surveys within the study area because the large time scale can hardly reflect the generation and impact of sad we analyze all the data in ten day time step during 1970 2000 each month was divided into three parts including the early ten days e the middle ten days m and the late ten days l fig 3 shows the stream runoff precipitation and et0 value of dfrid as previously noted stream runoff and precipitation exhibit similar trends with the majority of values concentrated between may and september during this time period et0 values were also relatively high according to the field survey precipitation and stream runoff during this period were sufficient to meet the irrigation demands of the dfrid and sad almost never occurs table 3 displays basic data of dfrid including planting area market price maximum yield limitation of deficit irrigation and crop coefficients kc for crops sourced from the statistical yearbook of meishan city table 4 shows the transformation costs and irrigation water use efficiency of canal sprinkling drip and low pressure pipe irrigation acquired through field surveys the cost of irrigation water was 0 08 cny m3 the available irrigation water from reservoir and acceptable economic investment pre unit area was 2 6 million m3 and 9000 cny ha respectively 3 3 temporal downscaling of jensen model parameters as the important parameter in simulating crop yield through the jensen model crop water sensitive indexes are usually derived by dividing the entire crop growth period into several distinct stages as shown in table 5 however in this study the time step is ten days and the crop water sensitive index necessitates a downscaling to align with the time step of the c smp model according to pertinent literatures tsakiris 1982 han et al 2010 it is apparent that there is a clear correlation between the cumulative value of water sensitivity index and growth stage which can be reflected through a cumulative function of the water sensitivity index the logistic model is widely applied to depict such a relationship 23 y a 1 e k x x c where a k and x c are the parameters of logistic model table 6 shows the fitting results of the logistic model the results indicate that the determination coefficient r 2 for all three crops surpassed 0 95 indicating the logistic model performed well subsequently the crop water sensitivity index was divided into ten day time scale fig 4 portrays the fitting of the cumulative function fig 4 a and the derived ten daily value fig 4 b of the water sensitivity index the water sensitive index of three crops had similar trend exhibiting an initial increase followed by a subsequent decreased as this study only focused on the drought period from october to april concerning citrus crops it was assumed that irrigation water resources would be sufficient during the period from may to september that is the value of m ep equaled to et max during this period 4 results analysis 4 1 joint probabilities of agricultural drought scenarios the niwd of dfrid was generated through formula 1 subsequently both niwd and stream runoff were converted into ten day intervals from october to next early may to measure the correlation pearson kendall and spearman coefficient were calculated the marginal distribution function of niwd and stream runoff as well as their respective marginal distribution function parameter values were shown in fig 5 a and b to construct the joint probability distribution model of niwd and stream runoff we employed two dimensional symmetric archime dean models frank clayton gumbel copula function kolmogorov smirnov k s test was used to examine the statistical d values and all obtained values were less than the critical value showing that all copula functions could be used to establish joint probability distribution function models the copula function s fitting performance was evaluated by the squared euclidean distance the squared euclidean distance of clayton frank and gumbel copula function was 0 0304 0 0298 and 0 0333 respectively illustrating that the joint distribution model established by the frank copula function had the best performance fig 5 c the combined distribution probabilities under different scenarios of niwd and stream runoff were generated according to the following categories 1 the normal dry and extreme dry scenarios of niwd were divided by the frequency of 75 u 1 and 95 u 2 2 the extreme dry dry and normal scenarios of stream runoff were divided by the frequency of 5 v 1 and 25 v 2 thus probabilities of nine combination scenarios were obtained according to table 1 and the calculated results can be found in table 7 furthermore assuming canal irrigation was adopted in the irrigation district the gross irrigation water demand of the normal dry and extreme dry scenarios of niwd was 3 97 3 30 and 2 52 million m3 therefore the shortage of irrigation water resources only occurred in dry and extreme dry scenarios and the probability of drought occurrence was 25 thus only 1 6 scenarios were incorporated in the c smp model when optimizing irrigation strategies 4 2 optimization results analysis by incorporating all the essential data into the c smp model the optimization results can be generated field survey reveals that water saving irrigation measures for grain crops were not implemented because of their low economic benefit and thus the irrigation mode of wheat was fixed as canal irrigation in the model fig 6 a shows the optimization results of water saving measures under six different scenarios the water deficit progressively reduced from scenario 1 to scenario 6 the water shortage gradually decreased although the optimal water saving measures changed with scenarios the citrus was consistently applied water saving measures sprinkling and low pressure pipeline irrigation in every scenario owing to its high yield and market price the irrigation method of rape was noticeably influenced by the available irrigation water as the severity of sad lessened the proportion of water saving irrigation area gradually declined although drip irrigation exhibited the highest water use efficiency it was not applied in any scenario possibly due to its expensive cost and investment restrictions these optimization results can assist the decision makers of dfrid in effectively designing water saving measures to against sad simultaneously the optimal irrigation schedule of each crop under six scenarios fig 6 b can be generated through solving the c smp model once the water saving measures are determined the optimization of the irrigation schedule can provide directly guidance to decision makers to manage the limited irrigation water effectively fig 7 a shows the optimization results of net irrigation water allocation total irrigation water allocation water use efficiency of crops under six scenarios net irrigation water pertains to the water used directly by the field crops whereas total irrigation water includes the leakage loss in water transportation and field the water consumption of wheat and rape were higher than citrus but the water use efficiency of citrus was the highest among three crops signifying that water use efficiency of crops was closely related to the application of water saving measures during irrigation the optimization results reminded us that when water deficit occurred in dfrid the adjustment of water saving irrigation measures for rape could reduce the water shortage risk caused by sad besides the irrigation satisfaction degree of three crops under different scenarios are displayed in fig 7 b irrigation satisfaction degree sd is an indicator reflecting the satisfaction degree of water demand of each crop which can be defined as 24 s d j k t t m j t k t t e t j t k e p t k the calculation results of sd shows that sd of all crops were above 0 7 indicating that the minimum water demand of each crop can be satisfied citrus and rape were satisfied preferentially because of their high economic benefit and water use efficiency fig 7 c shows key indicators including economic benefit total yield irrigation water productivity and total water consumption in optimization economic benefit and total yield show similar trends under different scenarios with the highest value observed in scenario 3 and no significant changes in scenarios 4 5 and 6 this implies that stream runoff has a more significant influence on economic benefit and total yield than niwd irrigation water productivity decreases first and then increases from scenario 1 6 the total water consumption for irrigation under different scenarios was obviously affected by changes in stream runoff although scenario 6 has the highest water availability scenario 3 has the highest water consumption because the c smp model would not put all available irrigation water into agricultural production especially when the marginal benefit of newly invested irrigation water was lower than its cost table 8 provides detailed information on optimization results including crop yield cost and irrigation water productivity of each crop under different scenarios highlighting the specific impacts of optimal irrigation strategies the average yield of wheat rape and citrus in meishan city is 5250 2500 37500 kg ha respectively the optimal irrigation strategies improved wheat yield by 12 51 32 22 and citrus yield around 8 33 12 83 compared to the average level of meishan city only the yield of rape decreased by 27 68 1 42 under the extreme dry condition of niwd while the yield of rape increased by 1 84 4 56 when niwd was in dry condition besides it is noteworthy that the costs of crop irrigation were effectively controlled and only the cost of citrus under scenario 1 exceeded 9000 cny ha according to our field surveys the average wheat irrigation water productivity in meishan city was around 2 12 kg m3 this value falls below the corresponding wheat irrigation water productivity values reported in table 8 for under six scenarios under water saving irrigation in meishan city the average irrigation water productivity of rape was around 0 90 kg m3 which only exceeds the values obtained in scenario 5 and 6 that predominantly reliant on canal irrigation as for citrus during the study period we recalculated the irrigation water productivity as approximately 35 62 kg m3 indicating that the optimal irrigation strategies have obvious advantage in improving irrigation water productivity compared with the current situation 4 3 performance of c smp model to evaluate the performance of the c smp model three single objective models were proposed based on the c smp model model 1 model 2 and model 3 take the three objectives of the multi objective model as the objective function and the constraints are the same as c smp model respectively the objective values of each model were generated via solving these models to clearly display the difference of each model the objective values obtained were normalized in the range of 0 1 as fig 8 shows with the help of their best and worst values from the fig 8 it is obvious that there exist fierce contradictions between economic benefit total yield and irrigation water productivity the single objective models model 1 2 and 3 only achieve their own optimization goal while other objectives were suboptimal all normalized values of the c smp model are higher than 0 5 indicating that it could effectively make tradeoffs among the conflicting objectives besides the objectives of economic benefit and total yield show similar trends with few conflicts while the irrigation water productivity has prominent contradiction with other objectives additionally this study indicated that c smp model has better performance in randomness of sad occurs and multiple conflicting objectives some multiobjective models had been proposed for dealing with randomness and multiple objectives in agricultural water management practices such as stochastic multiobjective programming model by li et al 2019 and bi level multiobjective stochastic programming model by zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 compare with these models the c smp model has advantages in 1 divided the water supply and demand combination scenarios in more detail way and give the specific probabilities of each scenario 2 simultaneously generate the irrigation schedule and water saving measure application strategies of each crop despite optimization results successfully showed how the irrigation strategies were sensitive to the degree of sad there are multiple complexities in irrigation strategy optimization such as the fuzziness of decision makers preference the dynamic nature of crop market prices and the impact of fertilizers which are not considered in the model formulation process and require further investigation all in all when formulating irrigation strategies with multiple conflicting objectives for reducing the impacts of sad c smp model is recommended to be used as a preferable alternative 5 conclusions a copula based stochastic multiobjective approach was presented to optimize irrigation strategy of crops in irrigation districts affected by sad such research has several advantages including 1 precisely identifying sad scenarios in irrigation district and providing probability of sad occurrence via building copula function for net irrigation water demand and stream runoff 2 simultaneously providing water saving measures and deficit irrigation strategies for each possible sad scenarios and 3 effectively handling tradeoffs among conflicting objectives under randomness of sad scenarios these contributions support decision makers in formulating meaningful decision alternatives when sad occurs the proposed approach was applied in the dongfeng reservoir irrigation district in china an irrigation district affected by sad from the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the joint distribution model established by the frank copula function had the best performance in measuring the sad and the probability of drought occurrence is 25 in dfrid 2 optimal irrigation strategies improve the yield of wheat and citrus by around 12 51 32 22 and 8 33 12 83 respectively compared to the average level of meishan city only the yield of rape was reduced by 27 68 1 42 under the extreme dry condition of niwd while the yield of rape increases 1 84 4 56 under dry condition 3 the c smp model had obvious advantages in dealing with multiple conflicting objectives and randomness of sad scenarios based on the optimization results appropriate irrigation strategies can be recommended to mitigate the effects of sad in the region the c smp model demonstrated its potential to be applied in similar agricultural regions that face sad the optimization objectives and constraints can be built according to practical conditions furthermore irrigation strategy optimization is a complex problem with multiple components and uncertainties some of which are not considered in the model formulation process for example the fuzziness of decision makers preference the dynamic nature of crop market prices and the impact of fertilizers require further investigation to improve the applicability of the optimal model a decision support system with online databases and future climate change considerations should be developed in the future work

8985,seasonal agricultural droughts sad often cause yield loss for the farming community around the world reinforcing the need to optimize both water saving measures and irrigation schedules to improve irrigation water use efficiency this study proposed a copula based stochastic multiobjective programming c smp model for optimizing irrigation strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of sad the model uses the regional net irrigation water demand and stream runoff to formulate the copula which better characterizes sad drought scenarios are selected based on reservoir storage capacity and irrigation water use efficiency then randomness of drought scenarios from copula model multiple conflicting objectives selecting of water saving measures and deficit irrigation strategy optimization were addressed via the stochastic multiobjective programming technique a case study was conducted in the dongfeng reservoir irrigation district dfrid meishan city of sichuan province southwest china to optimize both water saving measures and deficit irrigation schedules for different crops during their growth periods the results showed that 1 the joint distribution model established by the frank copula function had the best performance in measuring sad and the probability of drought occurrence was 25 in dfrid 2 optimal irrigation strategies improved the yield of wheat

irrigation water demand while it increased by 1 84 4 56 when the net irrigation water demand niwd was in a dry condition 3 the c smp demonstrated clear advantages in dealing with multiple conflicting objectives and the randomness of sad scenarios the proposed approach is applicable for irrigation districts suffering from sad and can help formulate more effective and sustainable irrigation strategies keywords seasonal agricultural drought copula stochastic multiobjective programming irrigation strategy optimization data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought constitutes a prominent meteorological and natural hazards leading to significant economic for the global farming community narasimhan and srinivasan 2005 it is not limited to arid and semi arid regions but also occurs in humid regions with uneven precipitation distribution within a year named seasonal drought rhee et al 2010 the agricultural sector is particularly susceptible to the impact of drought due to its high reliance on water meza et al 2020 moreover the exacerbation of global warming is projected to escalate the frequency and severity of seasonal drought sheffield et al 2012 which could further jeopardize agricultural production and food security besides with the increasing population the capacity of food production has become insufficient to meet the growing demand godfray et al 2010 leading to an inevitable food crisis in light of these challenges effective irrigation strategies are imperative to mitigate the adverse impacts of seasonal agricultural drought sad on crop yields and improve water use efficiency generally drought can be categorized into four types namely meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economic droughts zhou et al 2021 to identify these types of drought events several indicators have been proposed including the standard precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 the effective reconnaissance drought index erdi tigkas et al 2017 the integrated monitoring index idmi kumar et al 2021 and the standardized streamflow index ssi among others most of these indicators were developed using historical data on univariate variables such as precipitation reference crop evapotranspiration et0 and stream runoff however the drought events are interdependent because there are complex interactions among these variables for example sad is greatly affected by both irrigation and meteorological conditions li et al 2023 and artificial irrigation plays a crucial role in preventing sad the imbalance between available irrigation water and crop water demand is one of the main reasons for sad vergni and todisco 2011 and these two aspects should be analyzed together to consider the mutual impacts of variables thereupon univariate analysis cannot adequately capture the correlations among multiple variables leading to inaccurate evaluations of sad it is essential to use multivariate models to integrate various factors for multilateral analysis bhuyan erhardt et al 2019 among various methods copula is regarded as a promising approach for assessing multivariate probability distribution as it can handle variables without the information of independence normality or equality of marginal distribution zhang and singh 2007 copulas have been widely used to analyze joint distribution characteristics of various factors such as water and energy cai et al 2019 precipitation and evapotranspiration liu and yang 2021 available water and precipitation li et al 2017 and severity peak duration of meteorological droughts nabaei et al 2019 numerous attempts have been made in the field of sad using copula models for example ribeiro et al 2019 employed copula functions to establish the relationship between crop yield and drought indicators evapotranspiration index spei vegetation condition index vci and temperature condition index tci and effectively evaluated the probability of crop loss with varying drought severity in italy wang et al 2022 constructed a copula function that incorporated drought severity and duration to estimate the return period of sad across china although these studies effectively described the multivariable nature of sad certain key factors such as the water consumption characteristics of regional crops and the effect of reservoir on available water resources for irrigation were not considered in the copula formulation to better depict sad in a seasonal drought region we endeavored to build copula models that incorporated regional net irrigation water demand and stream runoff we selected drought scenarios based on reservoir storage capacity and irrigation water use efficiency additionally very few studies have integrated sad analysis and coping strategies for sad in one framework but such studies hold significant practical significance for regions severely impacted by sad mathematical modeling is an effective tool for formulating optimal strategies and numerous mathematical models have been developed to capture the complex characteristics of irrigation management system li et al 2022 yue et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the primary objective of these models has been to optimally allocate limited resources of irrigation water and land but few of them have focused on optimizing water saving measures which is a critical technical method for enhancing irrigation water use efficiency various water saving irrigation measures such as canal sprinkling drip low pressure pipe irrigation possess differences in construction cost and water saving efficiency therefore irrigation strategies should be formulated to alleviate crop yield loss under sad by selecting appropriate water saving measures and optimizing irrigation schedules previous agricultural water management studies have successfully addressed multiple complexities through corresponding models for example interval programming zhang et al 2018 fuzzy programming yue et al 2020 stochastic programming wang et al 2020 and multiobjective programming lence et al 2017 have been proposed to handle statistical data uncertainties fuzziness of subjective judgment of decision makers randomness of hydrometeorological events and conflicting multiple objectives respectively however these models have not been effectively coupled with the copula method which hinders their applications in practical droughts therefore this paper endeavors to propose a copula based stochastic multiobjective programming c smp model considering the randomness of drought scenarios from copula model multiple conflicting objectives for optimizing irrigation strategy the proposed approach offers the following contributions 1 identification of sad by integrating the water consumption characteristics of regional crops and the impact of the reservoir on the available water resources for irrigation using copula model 2 concurrent optimization of water saving measures and deficit irrigation schedules to mitigate the crop yield loss caused by sad 3 resolution of tradeoffs between multiple conflicting objectives and benefit cost analysis when generating optimal alternatives under uncertainty the proposed approach can be employed to optimize irrigation strategies in irrigation districts that suffer from sad 2 methodology 2 1 problem statement drought is one of most important factors hindering agricultural production for irrigation district with sad decision makers usually have to deal with the following problems in practical irrigation management 1 the dynamic change of water resources in irrigation districts with sad is fast precisely identifying drought scenarios and determining their probability of occurrence are fundamental challenges for optimizing irrigation strategies in multi crop systems 2 water saving measures and deficit irrigation strategies are required for some crops to enhance the irrigation water use efficiency the economic benefits and irrigation efficiency should be balanced when selecting the best irrigation mode 3 multiple complexities such as conflicting objectives and randomness of drought scenarios should be considered simultaneously in the decision making process developing satisfactory irrigation strategies to address these complexities poses a challenge to decision makers to tackle above issues this study proposes an optimal modeling approach for optimizing irrigation strategies as presented in fig 1 the reminder of the paper comprises three sections 1 the copula method for generating sad scenarios and determining their probability 2 the formulation of a copula based stochastic multiobjective programming model considering multiple complexities and 3 a real world case study to demonstrate the approach s application additional details are provided in the following sections 2 2 probability of combined seasonal agricultural drought scenarios sad is characterized by a deficiency of water in crops resulting from a continuous shortage of soil water this deficit is primarily caused by two factors the persistent aridity of climate and the scarcity of available irrigation water resources to accurately represent sad scenarios it is necessary to consider both meteorological and hydrological droughts which can be reflected through the net irrigation water demand niwd of crops and stream runoff respectively the data on stream runoff can be collected directly while the nind during a given time period t can be calculated through following equation 1 n i w d t 10 j j a j k c j t e t 0 j t e p t where the t and j indicate the time period and crop type a j is the planting area of crop j ha k c jt is the crop coefficient of crop j during time period t 10 is the unit conversion factor from millimeter to cubic meter per hectare et 0 jt is reference crop evapotranspiration of crop j during time period t mm which can be obtained by the fao pm equation allan et al 1998 ep t represents the effective precipitation during time period t mm which can be obtained formulas follows kang cai 1996 zhang et al 2022 2 e p t p t p t 50 m m 0 75 p t 5 0 m m p t 150 m m 0 7 p t 150 m m p t where p t is the precipitation observed from meteorological station during period t mm then the copula function is used to calculate the joint probability of combined scenarios of niwd and stream runoff the copula function is a powerful tool for deriving joint distributions given the marginal distributions sklar 1959 and has been widely used to define non parametric measures of dependence for pairs of random variables li et al 2017 setting x and y as random variables of niwd and stream runoff the joint distribution function c x y can be expressed as 3 c x y c θ f x x f y y where c θ u v is the copula function which includes many types such as gaussian copula function t copula gumbel copula frank copula and clayton copula θ is the parameter of copula function f x x and f y y are the marginal distribution functions of x and y with the help of copula function the joint probability for two variables x and y can be generated and the detailed steps are introduced as follows 1 the correlation between niwd and stream runoff should be clarified via pearson spearman and kendall correlation coefficients cai et al 2019 2 establishing the individual marginal distribution functions of niwd and stream runoff through kernel density estimation kamalov 2020 hasan et al 2016 which is a nonparametric method to estimate nonparametric marginal distribution functions for random variables the goodness of fit is tested by kolmogorov smirnov method goodman 1954 3 correlation index method is used to estimate unknown parameters of the two dimensional archimedean copula function including gumbel clayton and frank copula and the maximum likelihood method was applied to estimate parameters of the copula function liu and yang 2021 4 based on the empirical copula function c u v the squared euclidean distance ed formula 4 was used to measure each copula function and the copula function with the smallest value can be chosen to construct the joint function of niwd and stream runoff 4 e d 2 n 1 n c u n v n c 0 u n v n 2 where n stands for the sample size c 0 u v is the jointly probability calculated through raw data 1 to focus drought conditions we assumed both niwd and stream runoff had three hydrological characteristics extreme dry dry and normal condition including normal wet and other conditions and thus nine combination scenarios were generated as shown table 1 2 the bivariate joint probability for two variables x and y are described in table 1 li et al 2017 nabaei et al 2019 where u 1 u 2 v 1 v 2 are the marginal distribution values of x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 2 3 copula based stochastic multiobjective programming for optimizing irrigation strategy in this section a copula based stochastic multiobjective programming c smp model was developed with the aid of generated scenarios and joint probability to address the issue of sad the optimization of water allocation and water saving transformation should be simultaneously conducted consequently the decision variables in the c smp model corresponded to the amount of irrigation water and area proportion of water saving transformation for each crop across multiple scenarios the model parameters were defined in table 2 2 3 1 objective functions three objectives are considered in this study to reflect the main concerns of decision makers to simultaneously optimize the irrigation water under stochastic scenarios each objective is expressed by expected value as follows 5 max f n k k p k f k x 1 maximum economic benefit economic benefit is the primary objective in crop planting and the objective function can be expressed as formula 6 economic benefit of each scenario k can be obtained via total economic benefit minus total cost formula 7 and jensen model jensen 1968 was used for simulate the yield of crop j under scenario k formula 8 the total economic cost includes the cost of irrigation water cost and water saving transformation cost which can be written as 6 max f 1 k k p k e b k 7 e b k j 1 j a j y j k m p j j 1 j a j cost j k 8 y j k y max j t t m j t k e p t k e t max j t k λ j t 9 cost j k

one of the most important problems faced by decision makers is how to ensure the crop yield therefore the second objective is to maximize the expected yield under multiple scenarios the objective function can be written as 10 max f 2 k k p k t y k 11 t y k j 1 j a j y j k 3 maximum irrigation water productivity irrigation water productivity is another main factor that should be considered by decision makers especially when water deficit occurs in irrigation districts this objective can help improve water use efficiency and thus it should be maximized and the corresponding objective function can be written as 12 max f 3 k k p k i w p k 13 i w p k j j a j y j k 10 j j t t a j g i j t k 14 g i j t k s 1 j k m j t k η 1 s 2 j k m j t k η 2 s 3 j k m j t k η 3 s 4 j k m j t k η 4 2 3 2 constraints 1 water supply constraint irrigation water allocation for crops should not be larger than total surface water supply generally the available surface water is taken from reservoirs and the total water availability during whole growth period should not be larger than the available reservoir volume for irrigation this constraint can be expressed as 15 j 1 j t 1 t 10 a j g i j t k α i r w t t r t k ε t t k 2 water demand constraint in different scenarios irrigation water allocation of crops during each period should be larger than the minimum water demand of crops only in this way can the crops survive and grow normally this constraint can be expressed as 16 w d min j t k m j t k e p j t k j t k 3 irrigation quota constraint when facing sad deficit irrigation is necessary for guaranteeing the crop yield and water use efficiency english and raja 1996 in order to ensure crop growth under deficit irrigation mode the net irrigation water allocation during whole growth period should be less than the irrigation quota of deficit irrigation this constraint can be expressed as 17 t t m j t k m j j k 4 water saving transformation constraint four widely used water saving measures in drought regions including canal sprinkling drip and low pressure pipe irrigation were considered in this study zou et al 2013 this constraint is to screen the optimal water saving irrigation measures under different drought scenarios and define their use proportions this constraint can be expressed as 18 s 1 j k s 2 j k s 3 j k s 4 j k 1 j k 5 maximum investment in water saving transformation constraint for conducting water saving transformation on the existing farmland economic investments are needed the average cost of water saving transformation should be less than the maximum available investment this constraint can be expressed as 19 j j a j s 1 j k c c 1 s 2 j k c c 2 s 3 j k c c 3 s 4 j k c c 4 i v j j a j 6 non negative constraint the decision variables should not be negative 20 m i j k 0 i j k 21 s 1 j k s 2 j k s 3 j k s 4 j k 0 j k 2 4 model solution to solve the conflicting objectives of c smp model the minimum deviation method li et al 2019 was applied the steps of solving c smp model can be summarized as following steps in details 1 model the c smp problem 2 calculate best value f 1 b f 2 b f 3 b and worst value f 1 w f 2 w f 3 w of each objective under the constraints 3 generate the single objective model the objective function can be written as following equation 22 f ω 1 f 1 b f 1 f 1 b f 1 w ω 2 f 1 f 2 b f 2 w f 2 b ω 3 f 3 f 3 b f 3 w f 3 b where ɷ 1 ɷ 2 and ɷ 3 are important weights of each objective which is usually obtained by analytic hierarchy process ahp method 4 solve the single objective model in lingo software and generate optimal schemes under different scenarios 3 application in real world case 3 1 study area the study area is the dongfeng reservoir irrigation district dfrid situated in meishan city of sichuan province in southwest china 103 14 24 3 103 35 24 2 e 29 52 19 4 30 08 15 6 n fig 2 the dfrid exhibits a typical subtropical humid climate with an annual average temperature relative humidity duration of sunshine evaporation precipitation and wind speed of 16 5 c 83 1079 2 h 968 4 mm 1250 3 mm and 1 2 m s respectively despite the annual precipitation being greater than the annual evaporation sad is a common issue in the dfrid about 81 of the annual rainfall and 85 of the stream runoff occur between may and september whereas irrigation water deficits are often experienced from october to april seriously affecting regional agricultural production dfrid adopts multiple a multi cropping system with the primary crops consisting of wheat rice maize rape and citrus which collectively occupy approximately 86 of the total cultivated area among these crops wheat and rape are planted during early october to next early may while citrus is cultivated perennially given their vulnerability to sad these three crops are selected as research object in this study irrigation of all crops in dfrid is performed using surface water from the dongfeng reservoir located on the anxi river the irrigation water use efficiency of the study area is about 0 53 when sad occurs irrigation strategies must be optimized to mitigate water shortages thereby improving crop yield and water use efficiency 3 2 data collection and processing 3 2 1 data collection to solve the c smp model many parameters should be collected these parameters were acquired through various sources including field survey hydrometric station government reports of dfrid statistical yearbooks and published references meteorological data during 1970 2000 were downloaded from china meteorological data network http data cma cn with the meteorological station of no 56385 runoff data for the dongfeng reservoir were collected through field surveys within the study area because the large time scale can hardly reflect the generation and impact of sad we analyze all the data in ten day time step during 1970 2000 each month was divided into three parts including the early ten days e the middle ten days m and the late ten days l fig 3 shows the stream runoff precipitation and et0 value of dfrid as previously noted stream runoff and precipitation exhibit similar trends with the majority of values concentrated between may and september during this time period et0 values were also relatively high according to the field survey precipitation and stream runoff during this period were sufficient to meet the irrigation demands of the dfrid and sad almost never occurs table 3 displays basic data of dfrid including planting area market price maximum yield limitation of deficit irrigation and crop coefficients kc for crops sourced from the statistical yearbook of meishan city table 4 shows the transformation costs and irrigation water use efficiency of canal sprinkling drip and low pressure pipe irrigation acquired through field surveys the cost of irrigation water was 0 08 cny m3 the available irrigation water from reservoir and acceptable economic investment pre unit area was 2 6 million m3 and 9000 cny ha respectively 3 3 temporal downscaling of jensen model parameters as the important parameter in simulating crop yield through the jensen model crop water sensitive indexes are usually derived by dividing the entire crop growth period into several distinct stages as shown in table 5 however in this study the time step is ten days and the crop water sensitive index necessitates a downscaling to align with the time step of the c smp model according to pertinent literatures tsakiris 1982 han et al 2010 it is apparent that there is a clear correlation between the cumulative value of water sensitivity index and growth stage which can be reflected through a cumulative function of the water sensitivity index the logistic model is widely applied to depict such a relationship 23 y a 1 e k x x c where a k and x c are the parameters of logistic model table 6 shows the fitting results of the logistic model the results indicate that the determination coefficient r 2 for all three crops surpassed 0 95 indicating the logistic model performed well subsequently the crop water sensitivity index was divided into ten day time scale fig 4 portrays the fitting of the cumulative function fig 4 a and the derived ten daily value fig 4 b of the water sensitivity index the water sensitive index of three crops had similar trend exhibiting an initial increase followed by a subsequent decreased as this study only focused on the drought period from october to april concerning citrus crops it was assumed that irrigation water resources would be sufficient during the period from may to september that is the value of m ep equaled to et max during this period 4 results analysis 4 1 joint probabilities of agricultural drought scenarios the niwd of dfrid was generated through formula 1 subsequently both niwd and stream runoff were converted into ten day intervals from october to next early may to measure the correlation pearson kendall and spearman coefficient were calculated the marginal distribution function of niwd and stream runoff as well as their respective marginal distribution function parameter values were shown in fig 5 a and b to construct the joint probability distribution model of niwd and stream runoff we employed two dimensional symmetric archime dean models frank clayton gumbel copula function kolmogorov smirnov k s test was used to examine the statistical d values and all obtained values were less than the critical value showing that all copula functions could be used to establish joint probability distribution function models the copula function s fitting performance was evaluated by the squared euclidean distance the squared euclidean distance of clayton frank and gumbel copula function was 0 0304 0 0298 and 0 0333 respectively illustrating that the joint distribution model established by the frank copula function had the best performance fig 5 c the combined distribution probabilities under different scenarios of niwd and stream runoff were generated according to the following categories 1 the normal dry and extreme dry scenarios of niwd were divided by the frequency of 75 u 1 and 95 u 2 2 the extreme dry dry and normal scenarios of stream runoff were divided by the frequency of 5 v 1 and 25 v 2 thus probabilities of nine combination scenarios were obtained according to table 1 and the calculated results can be found in table 7 furthermore assuming canal irrigation was adopted in the irrigation district the gross irrigation water demand of the normal dry and extreme dry scenarios of niwd was 3 97 3 30 and 2 52 million m3 therefore the shortage of irrigation water resources only occurred in dry and extreme dry scenarios and the probability of drought occurrence was 25 thus only 1 6 scenarios were incorporated in the c smp model when optimizing irrigation strategies 4 2 optimization results analysis by incorporating all the essential data into the c smp model the optimization results can be generated field survey reveals that water saving irrigation measures for grain crops were not implemented because of their low economic benefit and thus the irrigation mode of wheat was fixed as canal irrigation in the model fig 6 a shows the optimization results of water saving measures under six different scenarios the water deficit progressively reduced from scenario 1 to scenario 6 the water shortage gradually decreased although the optimal water saving measures changed with scenarios the citrus was consistently applied water saving measures sprinkling and low pressure pipeline irrigation in every scenario owing to its high yield and market price the irrigation method of rape was noticeably influenced by the available irrigation water as the severity of sad lessened the proportion of water saving irrigation area gradually declined although drip irrigation exhibited the highest water use efficiency it was not applied in any scenario possibly due to its expensive cost and investment restrictions these optimization results can assist the decision makers of dfrid in effectively designing water saving measures to against sad simultaneously the optimal irrigation schedule of each crop under six scenarios fig 6 b can be generated through solving the c smp model once the water saving measures are determined the optimization of the irrigation schedule can provide directly guidance to decision makers to manage the limited irrigation water effectively fig 7 a shows the optimization results of net irrigation water allocation total irrigation water allocation water use efficiency of crops under six scenarios net irrigation water pertains to the water used directly by the field crops whereas total irrigation water includes the leakage loss in water transportation and field the water consumption of wheat and rape were higher than citrus but the water use efficiency of citrus was the highest among three crops signifying that water use efficiency of crops was closely related to the application of water saving measures during irrigation the optimization results reminded us that when water deficit occurred in dfrid the adjustment of water saving irrigation measures for rape could reduce the water shortage risk caused by sad besides the irrigation satisfaction degree of three crops under different scenarios are displayed in fig 7 b irrigation satisfaction degree sd is an indicator reflecting the satisfaction degree of water demand of each crop which can be defined as 24 s d j k t t m j t k t t e t j t k e p t k the calculation results of sd shows that sd of all crops were above 0 7 indicating that the minimum water demand of each crop can be satisfied citrus and rape were satisfied preferentially because of their high economic benefit and water use efficiency fig 7 c shows key indicators including economic benefit total yield irrigation water productivity and total water consumption in optimization economic benefit and total yield show similar trends under different scenarios with the highest value observed in scenario 3 and no significant changes in scenarios 4 5 and 6 this implies that stream runoff has a more significant influence on economic benefit and total yield than niwd irrigation water productivity decreases first and then increases from scenario 1 6 the total water consumption for irrigation under different scenarios was obviously affected by changes in stream runoff although scenario 6 has the highest water availability scenario 3 has the highest water consumption because the c smp model would not put all available irrigation water into agricultural production especially when the marginal benefit of newly invested irrigation water was lower than its cost table 8 provides detailed information on optimization results including crop yield cost and irrigation water productivity of each crop under different scenarios highlighting the specific impacts of optimal irrigation strategies the average yield of wheat rape and citrus in meishan city is 5250 2500 37500 kg ha respectively the optimal irrigation strategies improved wheat yield by 12 51 32 22 and citrus yield around 8 33 12 83 compared to the average level of meishan city only the yield of rape decreased by 27 68 1 42 under the extreme dry condition of niwd while the yield of rape increased by 1 84 4 56 when niwd was in dry condition besides it is noteworthy that the costs of crop irrigation were effectively controlled and only the cost of citrus under scenario 1 exceeded 9000 cny ha according to our field surveys the average wheat irrigation water productivity in meishan city was around 2 12 kg m3 this value falls below the corresponding wheat irrigation water productivity values reported in table 8 for under six scenarios under water saving irrigation in meishan city the average irrigation water productivity of rape was around 0 90 kg m3 which only exceeds the values obtained in scenario 5 and 6 that predominantly reliant on canal irrigation as for citrus during the study period we recalculated the irrigation water productivity as approximately 35 62 kg m3 indicating that the optimal irrigation strategies have obvious advantage in improving irrigation water productivity compared with the current situation 4 3 performance of c smp model to evaluate the performance of the c smp model three single objective models were proposed based on the c smp model model 1 model 2 and model 3 take the three objectives of the multi objective model as the objective function and the constraints are the same as c smp model respectively the objective values of each model were generated via solving these models to clearly display the difference of each model the objective values obtained were normalized in the range of 0 1 as fig 8 shows with the help of their best and worst values from the fig 8 it is obvious that there exist fierce contradictions between economic benefit total yield and irrigation water productivity the single objective models model 1 2 and 3 only achieve their own optimization goal while other objectives were suboptimal all normalized values of the c smp model are higher than 0 5 indicating that it could effectively make tradeoffs among the conflicting objectives besides the objectives of economic benefit and total yield show similar trends with few conflicts while the irrigation water productivity has prominent contradiction with other objectives additionally this study indicated that c smp model has better performance in randomness of sad occurs and multiple conflicting objectives some multiobjective models had been proposed for dealing with randomness and multiple objectives in agricultural water management practices such as stochastic multiobjective programming model by li et al 2019 and bi level multiobjective stochastic programming model by zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 compare with these models the c smp model has advantages in 1 divided the water supply and demand combination scenarios in more detail way and give the specific probabilities of each scenario 2 simultaneously generate the irrigation schedule and water saving measure application strategies of each crop despite optimization results successfully showed how the irrigation strategies were sensitive to the degree of sad there are multiple complexities in irrigation strategy optimization such as the fuzziness of decision makers preference the dynamic nature of crop market prices and the impact of fertilizers which are not considered in the model formulation process and require further investigation all in all when formulating irrigation strategies with multiple conflicting objectives for reducing the impacts of sad c smp model is recommended to be used as a preferable alternative 5 conclusions a copula based stochastic multiobjective approach was presented to optimize irrigation strategy of crops in irrigation districts affected by sad such research has several advantages including 1 precisely identifying sad scenarios in irrigation district and providing probability of sad occurrence via building copula function for net irrigation water demand and stream runoff 2 simultaneously providing water saving measures and deficit irrigation strategies for each possible sad scenarios and 3 effectively handling tradeoffs among conflicting objectives under randomness of sad scenarios these contributions support decision makers in formulating meaningful decision alternatives when sad occurs the proposed approach was applied in the dongfeng reservoir irrigation district in china an irrigation district affected by sad from the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the joint distribution model established by the frank copula function had the best performance in measuring the sad and the probability of drought occurrence is 25 in dfrid 2 optimal irrigation strategies improve the yield of wheat and citrus by around 12 51 32 22 and 8 33 12 83 respectively compared to the average level of meishan city only the yield of rape was reduced by 27 68 1 42 under the extreme dry condition of niwd while the yield of rape increases 1 84 4 56 under dry condition 3 the c smp model had obvious advantages in dealing with multiple conflicting objectives and randomness of sad scenarios based on the optimization results appropriate irrigation strategies can be recommended to mitigate the effects of sad in the region the c smp model demonstrated its potential to be applied in similar agricultural regions that face sad the optimization objectives and constraints can be built according to practical conditions furthermore irrigation strategy optimization is a complex problem with multiple components and uncertainties some of which are not considered in the model formulation process for example the fuzziness of decision makers preference the dynamic nature of crop market prices and the impact of fertilizers require further investigation to improve the applicability of the optimal model a decision support system with online databases and future climate change considerations should be developed in the future work

8986,rainfed cereal yields show high variability depending on the varying conditions of concurrent factors during the crop year among them hydrometeorological factors such as maximum temperature rainfall and notably soil moisture strongly affect crop production but the greatest source of uncertainty on yield estimates stems from their interaction this is of special interest in water limited regions where climate change is expected to affect more intensely but also in others where water is increasingly limited despite the highly non linear nature of the interactions simple statistic models such as multilinear regression accurately explore a notable proportion of the variability of cereal yields to describe the impacts behind interactions we perform stepwise multilinear regression of meteorological factors derived from e obsv23 database and soil moisture from era5 land against annual wheat and barley yields for the period 1981 2019 in the main cereal regions of spain the multivariate approach characterizes the temporal shifts of factors influence beyond the temporal shifts on the synchrony of the factors some of them tend to co dominate the impact during the critical period of crop development with soil moisture exceeding all others in relevance multivariate analysis fosters discussion about the impact of the choice of variables on the model fit as well as on the pertinence of monthly and annual scales for explorative and predictive purposes monthly models perform particularly well during the critical period of growth and reproduction of crops and consistently better than univariate estimates the annual model built using the data of the months of maximum impact of key variables outperforms the model at a monthly scale which underlines the decisive role of the critical period similarly results highlight the worth of parsimony in modelling soil moisture stands out as the principal concurrent variable to improve yield estimates from environmental data which governs yields of rainfed water limited croplands keywords soil moisture climatic factor cereal yields wheat barley stepwise multilinear regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat and barley represent two major crops for global food security shiferaw et al 2013 newton et al 2011 whose cultivated area extends over three quarters of global croplands predominantly over rainfed areas bradford et al 2017 the fluctuations of these rainfed cereal yields have multiple implications in the global economy beyond their agricultural value perkins 1997 and the rise of demand conflicts and upcoming climate change further implies increasing uncertainties on their availability curtis and halford 2014 the demanding task of identifying croplands dedicated to each crop can be currently eased with the increasing number of earth observations tools peña barragán et al 2011 yet the estimates of wheat and barley yields remain a challenge due to the multiple factors and their trends affecting yield variability from year to year lobell et al 2011 iizumi and ramankutty 2016 especially in the water limited regions prone to droughts as the mediterranean ones but also of increasing interest in regions recently experiencing soil water availability shortcomings almendra martín et al 2022a these concerns about insufficient harvests drove the massive contribution of crop science to enhance rainfed wheat and barley yields during the last century agricultural mechanization together with fertilization initially led to the rise of yields binswanger 1986 but current trends in these aspects have low marginal yield gains or even decline liu et al 2019 in contrast crop breeding innovation represents the most relevant driver of yield improvement in recent decades halford et al 2012 rainfed cereals in particular face multiple challenges to reduce the yield gap anderson 2010 neumann et al 2010 related to the increasing variability of environmental factors gobbett et al 2017 ahrends et al 2020 crop breeding has extensively investigated crop varieties to assess the crop response to environmental factors but still demands thorough research of the impact of hydrometeorological factors on yields araus et al 2008 therefore the exploration of the impacting environmental variables on yields and their variability is still of major relevance zampieri et al 2017 fortunately this issue is increasingly explored beyond the agricultural scope multiple advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the critical zone that govern both ecosystems and croplands raised from flux and mass exchange research baldocchi and meyers 1998 scott and biederman 2019 kong et al 2022 these works broad the scope of crop science which primarily focusing on water and energy to estimate yields may overlook the interactions with carbon and other components cycling wiesmeier et al 2015 however flux data is still not as accessible and scalable for researchers beyond the land surface processes community papale 2020 as the gridded datasets of hydrometeorological variables that agricultural studies increasingly use to evaluate the spatiotemporal impacts of environmental factors from regional to global scales cantelaube et al 2004 ray et al 2015 this type of studies are still essential in many areas of rainfed croplands pradhan et al 2015 trnka et al 2016 especially because of the apparent decline in climate resilience of high yielding varieties kahiluoto et al 2019 furthermore descriptions of the impact of hydrometeorological variables on the cycle of crops are predominantly conducted at the annual scale ceglar et al 2016 well beyond the temporal resolution necessary to capture the shift in the concurrence of these factors over each crop stage slafer and rawson 1994 this is especially relevant during critical periods for the vegetative and reproductive phases gaona et al 2022a closely determined by meteorological variables the narrowing range of soil moisture available for crop development under climate change almendra martín et al 2022a fueled by hydro meteorological extremes such as droughts and heat waves zampieri et al 2017 epitomizes the relevance of discerning key variables of impact on wheat and barley yields ceglar et al 2016 lecerf et al 2019 beyond the seminal physiological works stating the impact of soil moisture on the stages of the crop cycle day and intalap 1970 campbell et al 1977 there is an insufficient number of studies specifically dedicated to evaluating the major influence of soil moisture on crops mkhabela and bullock 2012 peichl et al 2021 particularly in comparison to other factors along the crop cycle gaona et al 2022a the increasingly available soil moisture networks dorigo et al 2021 remotely sensed soil moisture data from space missions as smos kerr et al 2010 and smap colliander et al 2021 or modelled soil moisture databases van der knijff et al 2010 and others should have encouraged more dedicated analysis of soil moisture s influence on crops as an example some applications have been proposed on agricultural drought monitoring using soil moisture data martínez fernández et al 2016 modanesi et al 2020 meanwhile the challenge further extends from understanding the interactions of variables driving yield to develop better tools to estimate yields prasad et al 2007 towards agricultural decision support systems jones et al 2003 multiple approaches exist to address the issue from statistical models firstly there are variants of univariate or multivariate linear regressions mlr analysis that are common when it is necessary to predict yields understanding which factors play a staple part in the outcome the main barrier to their application resides in the difficulty to select the significant and most influential variables hara et al 2021 experiences show mlr models are straightforward tools to discern the interaction between factors while they can determine yields with reasonable levels of accuracy even despite their inability to address the inherent non linearity of plant processes semenov and porter 1994 to avoid neglecting nonlinearity a second option is to adopt machine learning methods such as random forest support vector regression gaussian processes or multivariate adaptative regression splines chlingaryan et al 2018 kamir et al 2020 paudel et al 2021 this approach aims to maximize the estimation of yields from a set of variables that are to a certain extent automatically selected by the algorithms which as a downside can obscure the comprehension of the processes driving cereal yields finally there are multiple process based crop models like wofost van diepen et al 1989 hermes kersebaum 1995 ceres ritchie 1985 or daisy abrahamsen and hansen 2000 among many which are the best option when the analysis refers to factors affecting any particular stage of development but which have as main disadvantage the vast amount of data required to feed and validate them they can be categorized based on their mechanistic approach to crop modelling leaf development light use crop phenology soil moisture dynamics and use of fertilizers palosuo et al 2011 often adopting more complex models implies more difficult discrimination of the sources of uncertainty not only from yield s non linear processes but also from the implicit uncertainty of the model s structure and the inherited from the diverse data origin alderman and stanfill 2017 all in all despite the multiple options available the aim is always to pursue accurate informative and parsimonious models landau et al 2000 this study aims to use stepwise multivariate linear regression smlr analysis to evaluate the predictive power of soil moisture when interacting with a few selected agrometeorological variables from an initial pool of nine common ones maximum and minimum temperature diurnal temperature range growing degree days accumulated rainfall radiation and photothermal quotient relative humidity of the air and vapor pressure deficit the period of study 1981 2019 uses data from the climatic database e obsv23 cornes et al 2018 and the soil moisture database era5 land muñoz sabater et al 2021 the annual wheat and barley yields database at province scale were obtained from the yearbook of statistics of the spanish ministry of agriculture mapa 2021 for the main cereal regions of spain castilla y león cyl and castilla la mancha clm the smlr analysis is used to explore the preferable combinations of variables most capable of estimating wheat and barley annual yields during the crop year the analysis provides monthly results of the skill of smlr models to estimate yield using the sets of variables which can be compared to that of a simplified multivariate model fed only by the selected variables in their critical period of influence despite neglecting the non linear processes affecting most interactions of variables the approach allows for the examination of the relative weight of the selected variables on yield variability the analysis further discusses the implications on the prevalence of water related variables over energy ones focusing on assessing the role of soil moisture over all other factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the majority of rainfed cereal croplands in spain occur in cyl and clm regions fig 1a where rainfed croplands occupy 84 and 83 of the total cultivated area of these two regions extended 94 226 km2 and 79 463 km2 respectively the mask of cereal areas determines 43 and 47 of the area of cyl and clm dedicated to wheat and barley fig 1b based on crop statistics of the spanish ministry of agriculture mapa 2021 the cultivation of other cereals species is negligible compared to wheat and barley these extensive study regions generate together the 56 of wheat and 73 of barley in spain however these water limited areas of the prevailing bsk climatic type of the köppen geiger climatic classification dry and cold semi arid beck et al 2018 fig 1b together with some limiting soil characteristics determine high yield variability despite the variability and relatively low productivity fig 1c d cyl and clm frequently join in the top ten productive regions of wheat and barley in europe eurostat 2021 2 2 climatic data e obsv23 the climatic data used to obtain the nine agrometeorological variables are derived from the e obsv23 database which is part of the european climate assessment dataset of the copernicus climate change service c3s cornes et al 2018 the e obsv23 european daily climatic database of temperatures and precipitation is based on observations of the national weather services the spatial resolution of the data is 0 1 0 1 and is available from 1 january 1950 to 31 december 2020 the main variables used in the present study are maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin accumulated precipitation rr relative humidity rh and global radiation rad the growing degree days gdd diurnal temperature range dtr photo thermal quotient ptq and vapor pressure deficit vpd have been derived from the main ones following the methodology described in gaona et al 2022a 2 3 soil moisture data era5 land muñoz sabater et al 2021 is the reanalysis climatic database provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf the soil moisture and the rest of the reanalysis variables at a spatial resolution of 9 9 km are generated by assimilating observations into the physical modelling data of the integrated forecasting system ifs of ecmwf the upper three soil moisture layers of the four era5 land layers are adopted as the root zone soil moisture rzsm from 0 to 100 cm depth thereby we refer to the rzsm as sm the current version of era5 land provides data from january 1981 to present with a delay in the release of 2 to 3 month with respect to the present muñoz sabater et al 2021 2 4 wheat and barley crop data yield characterization of agricultural districts 2 4 1 statistics and characterization of agricultural districts the annual yearbook of statistics from the spanish ministry of agriculture mapa 2021 provides provincial wheat and barley yields for the period 1904 2019 from which we use the period 1981 2019 yield data were detrended using the method proposed by lobell and asner 2003 to filter the effect of non climatic factors the ministry of agriculture further describes the proportion of crop types rainfed and irrigated cropland of agricultural districts in each province 2 5 methods 2 5 1 data processing the spatial scale of interest for the study is the regional one which defines results for the spanish regions of cyl and clm nonetheless every analysis using sm and climatic data have adopted the provincial level to obtain the provincial values we calculated spatial averages of the 0 1 0 1 grid sm and climatic data era5 land was resampled from its original resolution to that of e obsv23 dataset within the areas prevailingly dedicated to rainfed wheat and barley in each province these areas of dominant rainfed wheat and barley crops in each province are selected applying a mask defined by the statistics of the agricultural districts of spanish ministry of agriculture mapa 2021 the suitable masked areas fulfill two of the three proposed thresholds of prevalence of rainfed cereal crops 25 of barley and wheat rainfed cropland in respect to rainfed cropland 15 percentage of wheat and barley croplands in relation to total cropland and cropland area over total district area of 35 the masked areas within each province are aggregated to further remove the areas with more than 15 of irrigated cropland from the mask we used the digital global map of irrigation areas from the food and agriculture organization fao siebert et al 2005 sm and climatic grid data are clipped by the provincial vector polygons of the resulting mask and then provincially averaged the temporal scale used in the study is the monthly scale either for the generation of monthly smlr models or annual models using values of the variables at their most impactful month however since the focus of the study is based on the temporal clusters of correlation between sm and climatic variables with cereal yields both the climatic data and sm data is initially filtered with a 30 days moving average gonzález zamora et al 2021 averaging sm levels to a depth of 100 cm to obtain rzsm further dampens sm temporal variability which increases the representativity of the mean between the hourly midday and midnight sm values that has been used to stand for the daily values of sm this procedure has proved effective in several works adopting similar correlation analysis almendra martín et al 2021 2022a 2022b gonzález zamora et al 2022 2 5 2 univariate correlation analysis the univariate correlations of the selected variables with the annual wheat and barley yields shown in this study come from our previous univariate analysis in the study areas gaona et al 2022a the pearson correlation analysis used in the referred work aimed to characterize the magnitude timing and duration of the correlations to determine critical periods of the impact of each variable on yields the approach evidenced the concurrence of the variables impact particularly during the critical period from march to june which recommended further research on the simultaneous influence of variables 2 5 3 multivariate correlation analysis stepwise multivariate linear regression smlr is a powerful tool to tackle high dimensional multivariate regressions of environmental factors qiu et al 2010 the smlr analysis applied in this study focus on multiple aspects of the concurrent impact of climatic variables and sm on cereal yields the sequence of steps of the approach is illustrated in fig 2 firstly the smlr method allows for exploring the combined impact of key variables on the annual wheat and barley yields all along the crop season the preferred combinations of variables for the smlr are selected using the most independent variables indicated by the variance inflation factor vif and hereafter iteratively checked for smlr model performance regarding its highest r 2 adj fig 2 dormann et al 2013 the variance inflation factor vif is an indicator of collinearity of each variable depending on the correlation coefficient r i between the i variable and the remaining variables of the model as in eq 1 1 vif 1 1 r i 2 vif values 10 warn against including highly colinear variables in the model wang et al 2012 li et al 2020 considering that relatively collinear variables of vif 5 are better removed williams et al 2008 and variables of vif 3 have an admissible degree of collinearity yuan et al 2021 only the suitable sets of variables that are under vif criteria can be promoted to the smlr analysis based on the principle of parsimony the lower number of variables the better and a balanced mixture of energy and water variables afterwards the selected groups of variables are gathered with barley and wheat yield annual series to apply smlr to generate the monthly multivariate model of each month of the crop season smlrm the smlrm variables and coefficients of each month change along the crop year according to the filtering of significance at 95 confidence of the stepwise method then the slmrm can be compared based on r 2 adjusted r 2 adj values to interpret the seasonal changes in the relevance of variables as well as the magnitude timing and duration of the multivariate correlation with annual yields the change in r 2 adj along the crop season further helps to identify the critical periods of multivariate impact which later serves to define models at annual scale based on the critical months of influence of each variable smlryc secondly the results of the best fitting smlr modelling can be further analyzed regarding the contribution of each variable taking advantage of the normalization of the climatic and sm variables the relative contribution of each variable to the total sum of square error sse can illustrate the relative contribution of each variable to the variance accordingly the sse distribution between variables aims to rank the weight of each variable on the smlr the shift in the weight of each variable on the sse from month to month helps unravel dependencies between variables thirdly the r 2 of multivariate smlr models are compared to those of simple regression from gaona et al 2022a to discuss the capacity of smlr to realistically explore the climatic and sm impacts on yields despite the inherent non linearity of the yield development processes the comparison aims to test the capability of the monthly scale smlr to monitor yields with a sufficient level of certainty eq 2 afterwards the monthly scale smlrm is compared to an annual scale smlryc fed exclusively on critical months of each involved variable identified from the monthly multivariate analysis of smlrm eq 3 2 yield from mth i mth i β 1 mth i var 1 mth i β 2 mth i var 2 mth i β n mth i var n mth i ε mth i 3 yield crit mth α β 1 crit mth var 1 var 1 crit mth var 1 β 2 crit mth var 2 var 2 crit mth var 2 β n crit mth varn var n crit mth varn ε finally beyond these three aspects of analysis the analysis of the contribution of sm to the general fit of the smlr model is devoted to dedicated attention to evaluate its role the sm variable is removed from the alternative smlrm yc to check its impact on r 2 adj compared to the cases with sm included in the set of multivariate variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 sets of non colinear climatic and soil moisture variables suitable for smlr the vif method provided scores on the collinearity of each of the variables included in the different sets evaluated in the smlr analysis fig 3 shows the monthly and annual vif scores of each variable of the set of most independent variables among the e obs and sm datasets i e gdd and dtr depend on tmax tmin vif evaluates the sets of variables included in different smlr alternatives including from three to six variables excluding yield variables therefore the sets of variables compliant with the vif method can be used to build both barley and wheat smlr models results show that smlr including six or five variables are prone to suffer collinearity between at least tmax tmin rad and rh removing at least tmin facilitates decreasing the collinearity but still either rad or rh on five variable models is best removed to avoid experiencing vif 5 the selection of the best model is an iterating process as shown in fig 2 evaluating simultaneously both the low collinearity indicated by vif fig 3 and the performance r 2 adj of the smlr models considering that any removal of variables notably impacts the overall r 2 adj of the model we preferably select the smlr models with the maximum admissible number of variables based on the criteria vif 5 blue box of the right of fig 3 in comparison to the red box of the left four variable smlrs such as those including tmax rr rh sm display tolerable levels of collinearity and moderate r 2 adj models including only three variables may fall sort of predictors and display reduced r 2 adj values sm is always included in the set of vif compliant variables given its consistent low collinearity and the goal of this study therefore the admissible sets of variables usually include tmax rr rh rad vpd and always sm while other variables are generally absent from the suitable sets of variables vif evaluations of collinearity can also serve as a basis for the mechanistic interpretation of the coupling between the selected variables in the environment of study in view of fig 3 the water related variables such as rr and sm are less colinear in between them and with other variables than the variables representing the energy conditions of the atmosphere such as temperatures or rad despite being partially defined by energy related variables the atmospheric water demand represented by vpd does not exhibit remarkable collinearity with sm in comparison to tmax or rad adopting vpd instead of tmax rh which are moderately collinear in combination seems also beneficial for the reduction of collinearity risks with very little downgrade of the smlr performance r 2 adj furthermore the vif scores of vpd sm or alternatively rh sm during springtime reflect less coupling than the ones of rad vpd rad rh and last less the vpd sm coupling is only remarkable in october there is evidence in other iberian regions similarly dominated by rainfed croplands gaona et al 2022b that the link between atmospheric demand and soil moisture is significant but neither prevailing nor long lasting all these evidence supports the idea that during the high energy season soil and atmospheric evolution become partially disconnected 3 2 seasonal change on the set of multivariate variables significantly influential on smlr models of cereal yields once the set of suitable variables is chosen alternative smlr models can be generated at a monthly scale smlrm these smlrm models facilitate a detailed depiction of the seasonal performance of the model to explain the annual yield fig 4 illustrates the crop year round and critical period r 2 adj of the different models i e from six to three variable smlr evaluated in this study the seasonality of correlations is consistently shared by all models with a clear wave of correlation during spring coinciding with the most active period for the two crops the multimodal distribution of the correlations varies depending on the number of variables included in the smlr with models of four or more variables showing two very secondary additional peaks of correlation during autumn and winter absent in the three variables model indeed the decrease in the number of correlations of the models seems to impact more the secondary peaks of correlation than the primary peak of spring regarding the magnitude of correlations the main spring peak ranges from r 2 adj 0 7 0 6 regardless of the number of variables which is a remarkable value for a study using mlr secondary peaks though display a more noticeable decline in r 2 adj with alternatives using fewer variables and notably less coincident between models 3 3 multivariate results compared to univariate results univariate regression results described in a previous analysis gaona et al 2022a are shown in the yellow box of fig 5 transformed from r pearson to r2 for the comparison with those multivariate of the preferred smlrm model green box of figs 4 and 5 both type of results match to a great extent but mostly in the distribution of climatic sm correlations with yields along the crop season more than in the values of correlation reflected by individual variables smlrm peak r 2 adj values exceed those of univariate correlation fig 5 regardless of the relevance of the variable such as sm or rr whose values barely surpass r 2 0 4 the comparison illustrates the clear difference between the apparent high individual univariate contribution to yields of any variable and the more realistic combined contribution of them to yield estimates of smlrm results the sum of influential variables even when coinciding to a great extent in the critical period of influence does not translate into an additive rise of their correlation with yields but a slight rise all along the agricultural season particularly during the critical period from march to june the rise of correlations happens on a similar magnitude for both the primary peak of correlation of spring and the secondary ones of the early season which explains the marked increase in the annual and critical period r 2 adj values of smlrm compared to those of univariate analysis the values of r 2y and r 2c reported by works adopting an mlr or analogue approaches to estimate yields suggest the results are within the range of expected r 2y values around 0 5 and with maximum correlations barely over 0 7 lewin and lomas 1974 r 2max 0 7 leilah and al khateeb 2005 r 2max 0 6 gonzalez sánchez et al 2014 r 2max 0 45 ceglar et al 2016 r 2max 0 53 yue et al 2018 r 2max 0 5 kamir et al 2020 r 2max 0 73 an additional point of conformity is on the consistency of correlations across scales comparing the univariate and multivariate correlation plots at daily and monthly scales of the yellow and green boxes of fig 5 provides a notion of the small change in magnitude and timing of the peaks of correlation of the environmental factors on yield regardless of the temporal scale despite the differences in temporal resolution in between the two scales the timing and duration of the cluster agree either for the critical period or the secondary peak of correlation of crop establishment the monthly scale univariate results barely differ from the daily scale ones the modest gain of correlation of multivariate results in comparison to univariate ones additionally evidences the relevant contribution of non linear factors to yield variability however the values achieved during the critical period support the notion that non linear mechanisms remain less influential during such decisive season nevertheless the factors behind the remaining variability attributed to non linear factors may well be of different origin such as from the modelling randomness or the propagation of uncertainty from the data origin especially in the case of reanalysis databases such as era5 land 3 4 critical period of impact of climatic variables combined with soil moisture on cereal yields results of multivariate correlation agree with univariate values also in the timing and duration of the primary period of influence from march to june for both wheat and barley crops generally referred to as the critical period the critical period of multivariate analysis seems to depict the convolution of durations of the critical periods of univariate variables which extends from the start of march to mid june depending on the region such consistency in the pattern underlines the relevance of monitoring climatic and sm values during the springtime which is the most active month for vegetative and reproductive growth of the crop something widely reported in yield studies from regional to continental scales zampieri et al 2017 subtle differences can be noticed in the shape and magnitude of the seasonal curve of correlations comparing the models that include one or other variable to their counterparts that remove it e g in fig 4 comparing the model including tmax rr rh sm to the model including only tmax rh sm consequently the impact of including or removing specific variables to determine the critical period barely has an effect while the monthly scale compared to the daily scale adopted in our previous work gaona et al 2022a may slightly distort critical period recognition 3 5 relative weight of variables in the smlr to yield variance conversely to the change in the number of variables including or removing specific variables alters the relative contribution of each variable to yields variance to provide such informative results sse statistics of each variable of the model with normalized variables were collected e g from the four variable tmax rr rh sm model to later compute the percent contribution to sse of each variable to the total sse of the model which is illustrated in the percent stacked bars fig 6 furthermore changes in the variables included in the model that alter the proportion of water and energy variables induce relevant shifts in the sum of sse of energetic variables such as tmax and rad compared to the sum of water related ones such as rr rh and sm a balanced mix of energy and water related variables seems convenient to avoid such tendencies while supporting the benefit of selecting models of a greater number of variables compliant with the vif requirements models of four variables the relative contribution to sse of energy related variables is remarkable even in energy related environments landau et al 2000 which further supports the convenience of adopting a balanced selection of water and energy related variables in smlr models therefore considering that the tmax rr rh sm model can be biased towards water related variables we refer to the rad vpd rr sm model as the optimal model given vpd is participated by both energy and water related variables comparing the third and fifth columns of subplots of fig 6 we can discuss the impact of excluding rr on the model results indicate the lack of rr enhances the weight on sse of tmax during the first half of the crop season the role of rh during april and the influence of sm during the late season june july conversely when these factors are removed rr exaggerates its share of total sse sixth column of the subplots early autumn and early spring this is consistent with the dominating influence of rr during two periods the critical springtime period and the initial crop establishment period wardlaw and wrigley 1994 ceglar et al 2016 in the first one rr influence dominates the vegetative development of the crop peaking the earliest and lasting the shortest among the influential variables during the critical period in the period of crop establishment after sowing rr becomes the most impactful factor the contrast between columns four and six of fig 6 enables assessing the role of rad when rad is removed from the model the contribution of energetic variables that stands out during the early season and mid to late winter disappears to a great extent and with it most of the relative weight of rad is taken by rr and especially sm more than by vpd rad exerts a complementary influence on vpd which represents the influence of rh along with tmax and tmin and consistent with the nature of heat gas and water exchange in the canopy of crops gilmanov et al 2013 this is the justification to preferably include both rad and vpd which also highlights the role of interdependence between variables the vpd is a straightforward way to reduce tmax and rh in pursuit of including other benefiting variables in the model however since vpd includes rh it impedes the comparison between these two proxy variables of transpiration using tmax instead of rad for instance seems also unable to fully explain the variance caused by energy factors the share of energy factors drops from less than a half to about a third of the total sse while forces to additionally include rh in the model when both rad and vpd are included in the optimal model fourth column the balance between water and energy related variables of the set of analysis resembles better the original share shown by the model including all variables first column compared to the case of the models of column fifth and sixth when vpd is included in smlrm models they are indicated as based on a 3 c combination of variables three elementary variables plus one calculated variable in summary results express the convenience of keeping a balance between the number of water and energy related variables in the model given the well known role of energy variables on heat stress of crops webber et al 2016 the balance is also of benefit to characterize the seasonally varying contribution of energy and water related variables to the total variance overall the combination of water related variables prevails in explaining the variance during the critical period from march to june while energy related variables remain important during the early and late season and for a short period during mid to late winter results agree the ones obtained in the univariate analysis and with multiple literature devoted to the study of the relevant factors for photosynthetic efficiency that determine the yield potential throughout the season lobell et al 2009 this description of the seasonal changes though may oversimplify the complex interactions between variables which show notable differences from month to month and between crops barley compared to wheat conversely the seasonal variation exposes the reality that cereal crops in water limited regions are particularly dependent on water conditions in the critical period and consequently prone to water deficit yield gaps due to drought and heatwaves zampieri et al 2017 3 6 soil moisture contribution to smlr fitting and yield estimates in line with previous statements sm plays a principal role in the sensitivity of cereal crops to water during the critical period sm contribution is largely over 20 and increases its share with the decrease in the number of variables fig 6 vpd may surpass the monthly contribution of sm from the sowing months to late winter in accordance with the autumn winter temperature influences reported in regions nearby bouras et al 2021 later in the crop season rr may also eventually exceed the contribution of sm during the early vegetative development of march and april rossato et al 2017 however the particularly high contribution of sm to the sse from the critical period towards the summer as well as immediately after sowing october november determines the overall dominance of sm over the rest of the variables this clear impact of insufficient sm during the critical period from spring to summer on yields is even reported in regions not previously identified as water limited like germany where drought is increasingly worrisome peichl et al 2021 in cyl region the sm contribution is lower than in the region more in the south clm which is consistent with the lower rainfall average of clm in a similar way to nearby regions of france and germany these results prescribe sm as the most relevant variable among the ones included in smlr models even among water related variables however to reveal the essential role of sm we additionally test changes in correlation and share of sse when sm is removed from the model rad vpd rr sm fig 7 while excluding sm on smlrm does not cause very visible changes in the shape of the correlation curves beyond a subtle delay of the onset and slight anticipation of the end of the critical period the lack of sm causes a substantial drop in overall r 2 adj values the overall decline of r 2 adj is close to 0 1 the annual scale r 2y and especially the critical period r 2c decreased significantly consequently the results show that the contribution of the sm is greater than that of climatic factors when in combination in addition it represents a variable of greater influence on yields especially during the critical period than the environmental factors commonly adopted by mlrs to estimate yields the prominent role of sm evidence in multivariate analysis is also consistent with multiple literature underlining the potential of sm as the best estimator of yields long ago baier and robertson 1968 3 7 comparison of monthly scale smlr models with yearly smlr models only based on critical months previous sections demonstrate the usefulness of monthly smlrm to elucidate the seasonal variation of the weight of the variables intervening on the models smlrm models additionally exhibit their potential to accurately monitor yield estimates during the crop year especially during the critical period of most crop development of springtime the focus of such applicability appears most suitable to the forecasting of yield estimates along the crop season based on the monitoring of climatic variables and sm conversely for studies focusing on yield estimation at a yearly scale the status of the variables and their influence on yields expressed by the monthly smlrm along most of the season is beyond interest because data from the critical period can be sufficient to accurately estimate annual yields eitzinger et al 2012 for such cases when the main function of the smlrm is to serve as a practical straightforward tool to estimate annual yields the best option seems to be building the smlryc models based only on the values of the set of variables at their specific month of peak correlation with yields maximum month value an example of the model building process is showed in fig 8 this means that the smlryc model defined only with critical periods with eq 3 may represent a straightforward alternative to the monthly based smlrm to evaluate yields at an annual scale we assessed the critical months of the variables involved in smlrm and the results concur that the critical months tend to stand in the center of the critical period for the development of the crop overly in may for wheat and around may for barley in both cyl and clm regions fig 9 the r 2y values achieved with the smlryc model evaluating yields based on critical months of the intervening variables greatly outperform those of the monthly model smlrm reaching values over r 2y 0 60 for both wheat and barley results of the same model removing sm decline significantly in r 2 suggesting again that the most relevant variable during the critical period govern to a great extent the performance of the model which is the case of sm such outstanding values of the smlryc fed only with a few variables on their critical months emphasize the benefit of simplicity in modelling processes such as yield formation steduto et al 2009 however given the restricted input data for this purpose this type of model is not so suitable for applications of monitoring scope but rather for quick and early estimates of annual yield fig 9 also evidences the relative contribution of sm to the smlr models an impact that has been evaluated in detail table 1 compares the performance of smlryc model including and excluding sm compared to the smlrm models considering the optimal model highlighted in green in fig 9 the smlryc models of both regions and crops surpass the annual average and critical period average values shown by smlrm models also when sm is excluded sm seems to affect barley more than wheat and the driest region clm more than cyl these outcomes suggest sm is more influential in the more water limited environments which is consistent with the regional outputs already shown in fig 1c d however r 2y 0 61 cyl 0 65 clm compared to r 2y 0 44 cyl 0 40 clm when smlryc excludes sm and partially of similar contrasting values for wheat may suggest some oversensitive response of smlryc to sm 4 conclusions stepwise multivariate linear regression smlr analysis is applied to model wheat and barley yields in the main cereal regions of spain based on the climatic e obsv23 database and the era5 land root zone soil moisture sm data the study aims to gain insight into the interactions between environmental factors determining yields especially to the prominent role of sm both at monthly and annual scales along the crop year the variance inflation factor vif method filters effectively the less collinear variables for yield modelling sm is the most independent variable followed by accumulated rainfall rr relative humidity rh radiation rad and vapor pressure deficit vpd following the vif 5 criteria and the principle of parsimony four variable models are preferred over five or more variable ones three or fewer variable models jeopardize the r 2 adj results beyond the comparison of models of different sets of variables based on vif and the r 2y adj values the selection of the optimal set of variables for smlr tries to keep a balance between energy and water related variables the monthly models such as the optimal one formed by rad rr vpd sm exhibit low collinearity and annual r 2y values of 0 3 r 2c during the critical period close to 0 5 and r 2c max during peak correlations barely over 0 7 which are within the range of results published before for similar multivariate linear regression approaches interestingly the r 2y values obtained from the annual model built using variables only in their critical month of influence reach over 0 6 which exceeds substantially the estimates of the monthly models these results highlight the importance of the critical periods of impact of each key variables which can be used as proxies of crop yields the seasonality of correlations is consistently displayed by all models with a peak of correlation during the springtime critical period of crops from early march to mid june while univariate analysis indicated synchrony between the critical periods of sm and the climatic factors multilinear regression shows seasonal variations of the prevalence of groups of variables e g rad tmax as energetic factors eventually exceeding sm the individual contribution of each variable to the sse further clarifies the ranking of influence of the variables as well as the seasonal share and dominance between them overall sm is the principal annual contributor to yield variance followed by rr so that the contribution of water related variables prevail during the critical period from march to june in comparison to energy related variables dominating early and late seasons while insensitive to non linear processes of importance multivariate analysis using smlr stands as a straightforward tool to identify key variables and reasonably estimate cereal yields at monthly and yearly scales the smlr further provides multiple metrics to evaluate the concurrent contribution of sm and climatic factors on yields underlining the preeminent role of sm in crops under water limited environmental conditions the interest of these results goes beyond the regions currently showing soil water shortcomings because recent studies show that climate change increasingly compromises crop production in many other regions consequently the characterization of environmental factors impact on crop yields and particularly of sm can be helpful to tackle the concerns about the future trends on rainfed cereal crops worldwide declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8986,rainfed cereal yields show high variability depending on the varying conditions of concurrent factors during the crop year among them hydrometeorological factors such as maximum temperature rainfall and notably soil moisture strongly affect crop production but the greatest source of uncertainty on yield estimates stems from their interaction this is of special interest in water limited regions where climate change is expected to affect more intensely but also in others where water is increasingly limited despite the highly non linear nature of the interactions simple statistic models such as multilinear regression accurately explore a notable proportion of the variability of cereal yields to describe the impacts behind interactions we perform stepwise multilinear regression of meteorological factors derived from e obsv23 database and soil moisture from era5 land against annual wheat and barley yields for the period 1981 2019 in the main cereal regions of spain the multivariate approach characterizes the temporal shifts of factors influence beyond the temporal shifts on the synchrony of the factors some of them tend to co dominate the impact during the critical period of crop development with soil moisture exceeding all others in relevance multivariate analysis fosters discussion about the impact of the choice of variables on the model fit as well as on the pertinence of monthly and annual scales for explorative and predictive purposes monthly models perform particularly well during the critical period of growth and reproduction of crops and consistently better than univariate estimates the annual model built using the data of the months of maximum impact of key variables outperforms the model at a monthly scale which underlines the decisive role of the critical period similarly results highlight the worth of parsimony in modelling soil moisture stands out as the principal concurrent variable to improve yield estimates from environmental data which governs yields of rainfed water limited croplands keywords soil moisture climatic factor cereal yields wheat barley stepwise multilinear regression data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat and barley represent two major crops for global food security shiferaw et al 2013 newton et al 2011 whose cultivated area extends over three quarters of global croplands predominantly over rainfed areas bradford et al 2017 the fluctuations of these rainfed cereal yields have multiple implications in the global economy beyond their agricultural value perkins 1997 and the rise of demand conflicts and upcoming climate change further implies increasing uncertainties on their availability curtis and halford 2014 the demanding task of identifying croplands dedicated to each crop can be currently eased with the increasing number of earth observations tools peña barragán et al 2011 yet the estimates of wheat and barley yields remain a challenge due to the multiple factors and their trends affecting yield variability from year to year lobell et al 2011 iizumi and ramankutty 2016 especially in the water limited regions prone to droughts as the mediterranean ones but also of increasing interest in regions recently experiencing soil water availability shortcomings almendra martín et al 2022a these concerns about insufficient harvests drove the massive contribution of crop science to enhance rainfed wheat and barley yields during the last century agricultural mechanization together with fertilization initially led to the rise of yields binswanger 1986 but current trends in these aspects have low marginal yield gains or even decline liu et al 2019 in contrast crop breeding innovation represents the most relevant driver of yield improvement in recent decades halford et al 2012 rainfed cereals in particular face multiple challenges to reduce the yield gap anderson 2010 neumann et al 2010 related to the increasing variability of environmental factors gobbett et al 2017 ahrends et al 2020 crop breeding has extensively investigated crop varieties to assess the crop response to environmental factors but still demands thorough research of the impact of hydrometeorological factors on yields araus et al 2008 therefore the exploration of the impacting environmental variables on yields and their variability is still of major relevance zampieri et al 2017 fortunately this issue is increasingly explored beyond the agricultural scope multiple advances in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the critical zone that govern both ecosystems and croplands raised from flux and mass exchange research baldocchi and meyers 1998 scott and biederman 2019 kong et al 2022 these works broad the scope of crop science which primarily focusing on water and energy to estimate yields may overlook the interactions with carbon and other components cycling wiesmeier et al 2015 however flux data is still not as accessible and scalable for researchers beyond the land surface processes community papale 2020 as the gridded datasets of hydrometeorological variables that agricultural studies increasingly use to evaluate the spatiotemporal impacts of environmental factors from regional to global scales cantelaube et al 2004 ray et al 2015 this type of studies are still essential in many areas of rainfed croplands pradhan et al 2015 trnka et al 2016 especially because of the apparent decline in climate resilience of high yielding varieties kahiluoto et al 2019 furthermore descriptions of the impact of hydrometeorological variables on the cycle of crops are predominantly conducted at the annual scale ceglar et al 2016 well beyond the temporal resolution necessary to capture the shift in the concurrence of these factors over each crop stage slafer and rawson 1994 this is especially relevant during critical periods for the vegetative and reproductive phases gaona et al 2022a closely determined by meteorological variables the narrowing range of soil moisture available for crop development under climate change almendra martín et al 2022a fueled by hydro meteorological extremes such as droughts and heat waves zampieri et al 2017 epitomizes the relevance of discerning key variables of impact on wheat and barley yields ceglar et al 2016 lecerf et al 2019 beyond the seminal physiological works stating the impact of soil moisture on the stages of the crop cycle day and intalap 1970 campbell et al 1977 there is an insufficient number of studies specifically dedicated to evaluating the major influence of soil moisture on crops mkhabela and bullock 2012 peichl et al 2021 particularly in comparison to other factors along the crop cycle gaona et al 2022a the increasingly available soil moisture networks dorigo et al 2021 remotely sensed soil moisture data from space missions as smos kerr et al 2010 and smap colliander et al 2021 or modelled soil moisture databases van der knijff et al 2010 and others should have encouraged more dedicated analysis of soil moisture s influence on crops as an example some applications have been proposed on agricultural drought monitoring using soil moisture data martínez fernández et al 2016 modanesi et al 2020 meanwhile the challenge further extends from understanding the interactions of variables driving yield to develop better tools to estimate yields prasad et al 2007 towards agricultural decision support systems jones et al 2003 multiple approaches exist to address the issue from statistical models firstly there are variants of univariate or multivariate linear regressions mlr analysis that are common when it is necessary to predict yields understanding which factors play a staple part in the outcome the main barrier to their application resides in the difficulty to select the significant and most influential variables hara et al 2021 experiences show mlr models are straightforward tools to discern the interaction between factors while they can determine yields with reasonable levels of accuracy even despite their inability to address the inherent non linearity of plant processes semenov and porter 1994 to avoid neglecting nonlinearity a second option is to adopt machine learning methods such as random forest support vector regression gaussian processes or multivariate adaptative regression splines chlingaryan et al 2018 kamir et al 2020 paudel et al 2021 this approach aims to maximize the estimation of yields from a set of variables that are to a certain extent automatically selected by the algorithms which as a downside can obscure the comprehension of the processes driving cereal yields finally there are multiple process based crop models like wofost van diepen et al 1989 hermes kersebaum 1995 ceres ritchie 1985 or daisy abrahamsen and hansen 2000 among many which are the best option when the analysis refers to factors affecting any particular stage of development but which have as main disadvantage the vast amount of data required to feed and validate them they can be categorized based on their mechanistic approach to crop modelling leaf development light use crop phenology soil moisture dynamics and use of fertilizers palosuo et al 2011 often adopting more complex models implies more difficult discrimination of the sources of uncertainty not only from yield s non linear processes but also from the implicit uncertainty of the model s structure and the inherited from the diverse data origin alderman and stanfill 2017 all in all despite the multiple options available the aim is always to pursue accurate informative and parsimonious models landau et al 2000 this study aims to use stepwise multivariate linear regression smlr analysis to evaluate the predictive power of soil moisture when interacting with a few selected agrometeorological variables from an initial pool of nine common ones maximum and minimum temperature diurnal temperature range growing degree days accumulated rainfall radiation and photothermal quotient relative humidity of the air and vapor pressure deficit the period of study 1981 2019 uses data from the climatic database e obsv23 cornes et al 2018 and the soil moisture database era5 land muñoz sabater et al 2021 the annual wheat and barley yields database at province scale were obtained from the yearbook of statistics of the spanish ministry of agriculture mapa 2021 for the main cereal regions of spain castilla y león cyl and castilla la mancha clm the smlr analysis is used to explore the preferable combinations of variables most capable of estimating wheat and barley annual yields during the crop year the analysis provides monthly results of the skill of smlr models to estimate yield using the sets of variables which can be compared to that of a simplified multivariate model fed only by the selected variables in their critical period of influence despite neglecting the non linear processes affecting most interactions of variables the approach allows for the examination of the relative weight of the selected variables on yield variability the analysis further discusses the implications on the prevalence of water related variables over energy ones focusing on assessing the role of soil moisture over all other factors 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the majority of rainfed cereal croplands in spain occur in cyl and clm regions fig 1a where rainfed croplands occupy 84 and 83 of the total cultivated area of these two regions extended 94 226 km2 and 79 463 km2 respectively the mask of cereal areas determines 43 and 47 of the area of cyl and clm dedicated to wheat and barley fig 1b based on crop statistics of the spanish ministry of agriculture mapa 2021 the cultivation of other cereals species is negligible compared to wheat and barley these extensive study regions generate together the 56 of wheat and 73 of barley in spain however these water limited areas of the prevailing bsk climatic type of the köppen geiger climatic classification dry and cold semi arid beck et al 2018 fig 1b together with some limiting soil characteristics determine high yield variability despite the variability and relatively low productivity fig 1c d cyl and clm frequently join in the top ten productive regions of wheat and barley in europe eurostat 2021 2 2 climatic data e obsv23 the climatic data used to obtain the nine agrometeorological variables are derived from the e obsv23 database which is part of the european climate assessment dataset of the copernicus climate change service c3s cornes et al 2018 the e obsv23 european daily climatic database of temperatures and precipitation is based on observations of the national weather services the spatial resolution of the data is 0 1 0 1 and is available from 1 january 1950 to 31 december 2020 the main variables used in the present study are maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin accumulated precipitation rr relative humidity rh and global radiation rad the growing degree days gdd diurnal temperature range dtr photo thermal quotient ptq and vapor pressure deficit vpd have been derived from the main ones following the methodology described in gaona et al 2022a 2 3 soil moisture data era5 land muñoz sabater et al 2021 is the reanalysis climatic database provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecast ecmwf the soil moisture and the rest of the reanalysis variables at a spatial resolution of 9 9 km are generated by assimilating observations into the physical modelling data of the integrated forecasting system ifs of ecmwf the upper three soil moisture layers of the four era5 land layers are adopted as the root zone soil moisture rzsm from 0 to 100 cm depth thereby we refer to the rzsm as sm the current version of era5 land provides data from january 1981 to present with a delay in the release of 2 to 3 month with respect to the present muñoz sabater et al 2021 2 4 wheat and barley crop data yield characterization of agricultural districts 2 4 1 statistics and characterization of agricultural districts the annual yearbook of statistics from the spanish ministry of agriculture mapa 2021 provides provincial wheat and barley yields for the period 1904 2019 from which we use the period 1981 2019 yield data were detrended using the method proposed by lobell and asner 2003 to filter the effect of non climatic factors the ministry of agriculture further describes the proportion of crop types rainfed and irrigated cropland of agricultural districts in each province 2 5 methods 2 5 1 data processing the spatial scale of interest for the study is the regional one which defines results for the spanish regions of cyl and clm nonetheless every analysis using sm and climatic data have adopted the provincial level to obtain the provincial values we calculated spatial averages of the 0 1 0 1 grid sm and climatic data era5 land was resampled from its original resolution to that of e obsv23 dataset within the areas prevailingly dedicated to rainfed wheat and barley in each province these areas of dominant rainfed wheat and barley crops in each province are selected applying a mask defined by the statistics of the agricultural districts of spanish ministry of agriculture mapa 2021 the suitable masked areas fulfill two of the three proposed thresholds of prevalence of rainfed cereal crops 25 of barley and wheat rainfed cropland in respect to rainfed cropland 15 percentage of wheat and barley croplands in relation to total cropland and cropland area over total district area of 35 the masked areas within each province are aggregated to further remove the areas with more than 15 of irrigated cropland from the mask we used the digital global map of irrigation areas from the food and agriculture organization fao siebert et al 2005 sm and climatic grid data are clipped by the provincial vector polygons of the resulting mask and then provincially averaged the temporal scale used in the study is the monthly scale either for the generation of monthly smlr models or annual models using values of the variables at their most impactful month however since the focus of the study is based on the temporal clusters of correlation between sm and climatic variables with cereal yields both the climatic data and sm data is initially filtered with a 30 days moving average gonzález zamora et al 2021 averaging sm levels to a depth of 100 cm to obtain rzsm further dampens sm temporal variability which increases the representativity of the mean between the hourly midday and midnight sm values that has been used to stand for the daily values of sm this procedure has proved effective in several works adopting similar correlation analysis almendra martín et al 2021 2022a 2022b gonzález zamora et al 2022 2 5 2 univariate correlation analysis the univariate correlations of the selected variables with the annual wheat and barley yields shown in this study come from our previous univariate analysis in the study areas gaona et al 2022a the pearson correlation analysis used in the referred work aimed to characterize the magnitude timing and duration of the correlations to determine critical periods of the impact of each variable on yields the approach evidenced the concurrence of the variables impact particularly during the critical period from march to june which recommended further research on the simultaneous influence of variables 2 5 3 multivariate correlation analysis stepwise multivariate linear regression smlr is a powerful tool to tackle high dimensional multivariate regressions of environmental factors qiu et al 2010 the smlr analysis applied in this study focus on multiple aspects of the concurrent impact of climatic variables and sm on cereal yields the sequence of steps of the approach is illustrated in fig 2 firstly the smlr method allows for exploring the combined impact of key variables on the annual wheat and barley yields all along the crop season the preferred combinations of variables for the smlr are selected using the most independent variables indicated by the variance inflation factor vif and hereafter iteratively checked for smlr model performance regarding its highest r 2 adj fig 2 dormann et al 2013 the variance inflation factor vif is an indicator of collinearity of each variable depending on the correlation coefficient r i between the i variable and the remaining variables of the model as in eq 1 1 vif 1 1 r i 2 vif values 10 warn against including highly colinear variables in the model wang et al 2012 li et al 2020 considering that relatively collinear variables of vif 5 are better removed williams et al 2008 and variables of vif 3 have an admissible degree of collinearity yuan et al 2021 only the suitable sets of variables that are under vif criteria can be promoted to the smlr analysis based on the principle of parsimony the lower number of variables the better and a balanced mixture of energy and water variables afterwards the selected groups of variables are gathered with barley and wheat yield annual series to apply smlr to generate the monthly multivariate model of each month of the crop season smlrm the smlrm variables and coefficients of each month change along the crop year according to the filtering of significance at 95 confidence of the stepwise method then the slmrm can be compared based on r 2 adjusted r 2 adj values to interpret the seasonal changes in the relevance of variables as well as the magnitude timing and duration of the multivariate correlation with annual yields the change in r 2 adj along the crop season further helps to identify the critical periods of multivariate impact which later serves to define models at annual scale based on the critical months of influence of each variable smlryc secondly the results of the best fitting smlr modelling can be further analyzed regarding the contribution of each variable taking advantage of the normalization of the climatic and sm variables the relative contribution of each variable to the total sum of square error sse can illustrate the relative contribution of each variable to the variance accordingly the sse distribution between variables aims to rank the weight of each variable on the smlr the shift in the weight of each variable on the sse from month to month helps unravel dependencies between variables thirdly the r 2 of multivariate smlr models are compared to those of simple regression from gaona et al 2022a to discuss the capacity of smlr to realistically explore the climatic and sm impacts on yields despite the inherent non linearity of the yield development processes the comparison aims to test the capability of the monthly scale smlr to monitor yields with a sufficient level of certainty eq 2 afterwards the monthly scale smlrm is compared to an annual scale smlryc fed exclusively on critical months of each involved variable identified from the monthly multivariate analysis of smlrm eq 3 2 yield from mth i mth i β 1 mth i var 1 mth i β 2 mth i var 2 mth i β n mth i var n mth i ε mth i 3 yield crit mth α β 1 crit mth var 1 var 1 crit mth var 1 β 2 crit mth var 2 var 2 crit mth var 2 β n crit mth varn var n crit mth varn ε finally beyond these three aspects of analysis the analysis of the contribution of sm to the general fit of the smlr model is devoted to dedicated attention to evaluate its role the sm variable is removed from the alternative smlrm yc to check its impact on r 2 adj compared to the cases with sm included in the set of multivariate variables 3 results and discussion 3 1 sets of non colinear climatic and soil moisture variables suitable for smlr the vif method provided scores on the collinearity of each of the variables included in the different sets evaluated in the smlr analysis fig 3 shows the monthly and annual vif scores of each variable of the set of most independent variables among the e obs and sm datasets i e gdd and dtr depend on tmax tmin vif evaluates the sets of variables included in different smlr alternatives including from three to six variables excluding yield variables therefore the sets of variables compliant with the vif method can be used to build both barley and wheat smlr models results show that smlr including six or five variables are prone to suffer collinearity between at least tmax tmin rad and rh removing at least tmin facilitates decreasing the collinearity but still either rad or rh on five variable models is best removed to avoid experiencing vif 5 the selection of the best model is an iterating process as shown in fig 2 evaluating simultaneously both the low collinearity indicated by vif fig 3 and the performance r 2 adj of the smlr models considering that any removal of variables notably impacts the overall r 2 adj of the model we preferably select the smlr models with the maximum admissible number of variables based on the criteria vif 5 blue box of the right of fig 3 in comparison to the red box of the left four variable smlrs such as those including tmax rr rh sm display tolerable levels of collinearity and moderate r 2 adj models including only three variables may fall sort of predictors and display reduced r 2 adj values sm is always included in the set of vif compliant variables given its consistent low collinearity and the goal of this study therefore the admissible sets of variables usually include tmax rr rh rad vpd and always sm while other variables are generally absent from the suitable sets of variables vif evaluations of collinearity can also serve as a basis for the mechanistic interpretation of the coupling between the selected variables in the environment of study in view of fig 3 the water related variables such as rr and sm are less colinear in between them and with other variables than the variables representing the energy conditions of the atmosphere such as temperatures or rad despite being partially defined by energy related variables the atmospheric water demand represented by vpd does not exhibit remarkable collinearity with sm in comparison to tmax or rad adopting vpd instead of tmax rh which are moderately collinear in combination seems also beneficial for the reduction of collinearity risks with very little downgrade of the smlr performance r 2 adj furthermore the vif scores of vpd sm or alternatively rh sm during springtime reflect less coupling than the ones of rad vpd rad rh and last less the vpd sm coupling is only remarkable in october there is evidence in other iberian regions similarly dominated by rainfed croplands gaona et al 2022b that the link between atmospheric demand and soil moisture is significant but neither prevailing nor long lasting all these evidence supports the idea that during the high energy season soil and atmospheric evolution become partially disconnected 3 2 seasonal change on the set of multivariate variables significantly influential on smlr models of cereal yields once the set of suitable variables is chosen alternative smlr models can be generated at a monthly scale smlrm these smlrm models facilitate a detailed depiction of the seasonal performance of the model to explain the annual yield fig 4 illustrates the crop year round and critical period r 2 adj of the different models i e from six to three variable smlr evaluated in this study the seasonality of correlations is consistently shared by all models with a clear wave of correlation during spring coinciding with the most active period for the two crops the multimodal distribution of the correlations varies depending on the number of variables included in the smlr with models of four or more variables showing two very secondary additional peaks of correlation during autumn and winter absent in the three variables model indeed the decrease in the number of correlations of the models seems to impact more the secondary peaks of correlation than the primary peak of spring regarding the magnitude of correlations the main spring peak ranges from r 2 adj 0 7 0 6 regardless of the number of variables which is a remarkable value for a study using mlr secondary peaks though display a more noticeable decline in r 2 adj with alternatives using fewer variables and notably less coincident between models 3 3 multivariate results compared to univariate results univariate regression results described in a previous analysis gaona et al 2022a are shown in the yellow box of fig 5 transformed from r pearson to r2 for the comparison with those multivariate of the preferred smlrm model green box of figs 4 and 5 both type of results match to a great extent but mostly in the distribution of climatic sm correlations with yields along the crop season more than in the values of correlation reflected by individual variables smlrm peak r 2 adj values exceed those of univariate correlation fig 5 regardless of the relevance of the variable such as sm or rr whose values barely surpass r 2 0 4 the comparison illustrates the clear difference between the apparent high individual univariate contribution to yields of any variable and the more realistic combined contribution of them to yield estimates of smlrm results the sum of influential variables even when coinciding to a great extent in the critical period of influence does not translate into an additive rise of their correlation with yields but a slight rise all along the agricultural season particularly during the critical period from march to june the rise of correlations happens on a similar magnitude for both the primary peak of correlation of spring and the secondary ones of the early season which explains the marked increase in the annual and critical period r 2 adj values of smlrm compared to those of univariate analysis the values of r 2y and r 2c reported by works adopting an mlr or analogue approaches to estimate yields suggest the results are within the range of expected r 2y values around 0 5 and with maximum correlations barely over 0 7 lewin and lomas 1974 r 2max 0 7 leilah and al khateeb 2005 r 2max 0 6 gonzalez sánchez et al 2014 r 2max 0 45 ceglar et al 2016 r 2max 0 53 yue et al 2018 r 2max 0 5 kamir et al 2020 r 2max 0 73 an additional point of conformity is on the consistency of correlations across scales comparing the univariate and multivariate correlation plots at daily and monthly scales of the yellow and green boxes of fig 5 provides a notion of the small change in magnitude and timing of the peaks of correlation of the environmental factors on yield regardless of the temporal scale despite the differences in temporal resolution in between the two scales the timing and duration of the cluster agree either for the critical period or the secondary peak of correlation of crop establishment the monthly scale univariate results barely differ from the daily scale ones the modest gain of correlation of multivariate results in comparison to univariate ones additionally evidences the relevant contribution of non linear factors to yield variability however the values achieved during the critical period support the notion that non linear mechanisms remain less influential during such decisive season nevertheless the factors behind the remaining variability attributed to non linear factors may well be of different origin such as from the modelling randomness or the propagation of uncertainty from the data origin especially in the case of reanalysis databases such as era5 land 3 4 critical period of impact of climatic variables combined with soil moisture on cereal yields results of multivariate correlation agree with univariate values also in the timing and duration of the primary period of influence from march to june for both wheat and barley crops generally referred to as the critical period the critical period of multivariate analysis seems to depict the convolution of durations of the critical periods of univariate variables which extends from the start of march to mid june depending on the region such consistency in the pattern underlines the relevance of monitoring climatic and sm values during the springtime which is the most active month for vegetative and reproductive growth of the crop something widely reported in yield studies from regional to continental scales zampieri et al 2017 subtle differences can be noticed in the shape and magnitude of the seasonal curve of correlations comparing the models that include one or other variable to their counterparts that remove it e g in fig 4 comparing the model including tmax rr rh sm to the model including only tmax rh sm consequently the impact of including or removing specific variables to determine the critical period barely has an effect while the monthly scale compared to the daily scale adopted in our previous work gaona et al 2022a may slightly distort critical period recognition 3 5 relative weight of variables in the smlr to yield variance conversely to the change in the number of variables including or removing specific variables alters the relative contribution of each variable to yields variance to provide such informative results sse statistics of each variable of the model with normalized variables were collected e g from the four variable tmax rr rh sm model to later compute the percent contribution to sse of each variable to the total sse of the model which is illustrated in the percent stacked bars fig 6 furthermore changes in the variables included in the model that alter the proportion of water and energy variables induce relevant shifts in the sum of sse of energetic variables such as tmax and rad compared to the sum of water related ones such as rr rh and sm a balanced mix of energy and water related variables seems convenient to avoid such tendencies while supporting the benefit of selecting models of a greater number of variables compliant with the vif requirements models of four variables the relative contribution to sse of energy related variables is remarkable even in energy related environments landau et al 2000 which further supports the convenience of adopting a balanced selection of water and energy related variables in smlr models therefore considering that the tmax rr rh sm model can be biased towards water related variables we refer to the rad vpd rr sm model as the optimal model given vpd is participated by both energy and water related variables comparing the third and fifth columns of subplots of fig 6 we can discuss the impact of excluding rr on the model results indicate the lack of rr enhances the weight on sse of tmax during the first half of the crop season the role of rh during april and the influence of sm during the late season june july conversely when these factors are removed rr exaggerates its share of total sse sixth column of the subplots early autumn and early spring this is consistent with the dominating influence of rr during two periods the critical springtime period and the initial crop establishment period wardlaw and wrigley 1994 ceglar et al 2016 in the first one rr influence dominates the vegetative development of the crop peaking the earliest and lasting the shortest among the influential variables during the critical period in the period of crop establishment after sowing rr becomes the most impactful factor the contrast between columns four and six of fig 6 enables assessing the role of rad when rad is removed from the model the contribution of energetic variables that stands out during the early season and mid to late winter disappears to a great extent and with it most of the relative weight of rad is taken by rr and especially sm more than by vpd rad exerts a complementary influence on vpd which represents the influence of rh along with tmax and tmin and consistent with the nature of heat gas and water exchange in the canopy of crops gilmanov et al 2013 this is the justification to preferably include both rad and vpd which also highlights the role of interdependence between variables the vpd is a straightforward way to reduce tmax and rh in pursuit of including other benefiting variables in the model however since vpd includes rh it impedes the comparison between these two proxy variables of transpiration using tmax instead of rad for instance seems also unable to fully explain the variance caused by energy factors the share of energy factors drops from less than a half to about a third of the total sse while forces to additionally include rh in the model when both rad and vpd are included in the optimal model fourth column the balance between water and energy related variables of the set of analysis resembles better the original share shown by the model including all variables first column compared to the case of the models of column fifth and sixth when vpd is included in smlrm models they are indicated as based on a 3 c combination of variables three elementary variables plus one calculated variable in summary results express the convenience of keeping a balance between the number of water and energy related variables in the model given the well known role of energy variables on heat stress of crops webber et al 2016 the balance is also of benefit to characterize the seasonally varying contribution of energy and water related variables to the total variance overall the combination of water related variables prevails in explaining the variance during the critical period from march to june while energy related variables remain important during the early and late season and for a short period during mid to late winter results agree the ones obtained in the univariate analysis and with multiple literature devoted to the study of the relevant factors for photosynthetic efficiency that determine the yield potential throughout the season lobell et al 2009 this description of the seasonal changes though may oversimplify the complex interactions between variables which show notable differences from month to month and between crops barley compared to wheat conversely the seasonal variation exposes the reality that cereal crops in water limited regions are particularly dependent on water conditions in the critical period and consequently prone to water deficit yield gaps due to drought and heatwaves zampieri et al 2017 3 6 soil moisture contribution to smlr fitting and yield estimates in line with previous statements sm plays a principal role in the sensitivity of cereal crops to water during the critical period sm contribution is largely over 20 and increases its share with the decrease in the number of variables fig 6 vpd may surpass the monthly contribution of sm from the sowing months to late winter in accordance with the autumn winter temperature influences reported in regions nearby bouras et al 2021 later in the crop season rr may also eventually exceed the contribution of sm during the early vegetative development of march and april rossato et al 2017 however the particularly high contribution of sm to the sse from the critical period towards the summer as well as immediately after sowing october november determines the overall dominance of sm over the rest of the variables this clear impact of insufficient sm during the critical period from spring to summer on yields is even reported in regions not previously identified as water limited like germany where drought is increasingly worrisome peichl et al 2021 in cyl region the sm contribution is lower than in the region more in the south clm which is consistent with the lower rainfall average of clm in a similar way to nearby regions of france and germany these results prescribe sm as the most relevant variable among the ones included in smlr models even among water related variables however to reveal the essential role of sm we additionally test changes in correlation and share of sse when sm is removed from the model rad vpd rr sm fig 7 while excluding sm on smlrm does not cause very visible changes in the shape of the correlation curves beyond a subtle delay of the onset and slight anticipation of the end of the critical period the lack of sm causes a substantial drop in overall r 2 adj values the overall decline of r 2 adj is close to 0 1 the annual scale r 2y and especially the critical period r 2c decreased significantly consequently the results show that the contribution of the sm is greater than that of climatic factors when in combination in addition it represents a variable of greater influence on yields especially during the critical period than the environmental factors commonly adopted by mlrs to estimate yields the prominent role of sm evidence in multivariate analysis is also consistent with multiple literature underlining the potential of sm as the best estimator of yields long ago baier and robertson 1968 3 7 comparison of monthly scale smlr models with yearly smlr models only based on critical months previous sections demonstrate the usefulness of monthly smlrm to elucidate the seasonal variation of the weight of the variables intervening on the models smlrm models additionally exhibit their potential to accurately monitor yield estimates during the crop year especially during the critical period of most crop development of springtime the focus of such applicability appears most suitable to the forecasting of yield estimates along the crop season based on the monitoring of climatic variables and sm conversely for studies focusing on yield estimation at a yearly scale the status of the variables and their influence on yields expressed by the monthly smlrm along most of the season is beyond interest because data from the critical period can be sufficient to accurately estimate annual yields eitzinger et al 2012 for such cases when the main function of the smlrm is to serve as a practical straightforward tool to estimate annual yields the best option seems to be building the smlryc models based only on the values of the set of variables at their specific month of peak correlation with yields maximum month value an example of the model building process is showed in fig 8 this means that the smlryc model defined only with critical periods with eq 3 may represent a straightforward alternative to the monthly based smlrm to evaluate yields at an annual scale we assessed the critical months of the variables involved in smlrm and the results concur that the critical months tend to stand in the center of the critical period for the development of the crop overly in may for wheat and around may for barley in both cyl and clm regions fig 9 the r 2y values achieved with the smlryc model evaluating yields based on critical months of the intervening variables greatly outperform those of the monthly model smlrm reaching values over r 2y 0 60 for both wheat and barley results of the same model removing sm decline significantly in r 2 suggesting again that the most relevant variable during the critical period govern to a great extent the performance of the model which is the case of sm such outstanding values of the smlryc fed only with a few variables on their critical months emphasize the benefit of simplicity in modelling processes such as yield formation steduto et al 2009 however given the restricted input data for this purpose this type of model is not so suitable for applications of monitoring scope but rather for quick and early estimates of annual yield fig 9 also evidences the relative contribution of sm to the smlr models an impact that has been evaluated in detail table 1 compares the performance of smlryc model including and excluding sm compared to the smlrm models considering the optimal model highlighted in green in fig 9 the smlryc models of both regions and crops surpass the annual average and critical period average values shown by smlrm models also when sm is excluded sm seems to affect barley more than wheat and the driest region clm more than cyl these outcomes suggest sm is more influential in the more water limited environments which is consistent with the regional outputs already shown in fig 1c d however r 2y 0 61 cyl 0 65 clm compared to r 2y 0 44 cyl 0 40 clm when smlryc excludes sm and partially of similar contrasting values for wheat may suggest some oversensitive response of smlryc to sm 4 conclusions stepwise multivariate linear regression smlr analysis is applied to model wheat and barley yields in the main cereal regions of spain based on the climatic e obsv23 database and the era5 land root zone soil moisture sm data the study aims to gain insight into the interactions between environmental factors determining yields especially to the prominent role of sm both at monthly and annual scales along the crop year the variance inflation factor vif method filters effectively the less collinear variables for yield modelling sm is the most independent variable followed by accumulated rainfall rr relative humidity rh radiation rad and vapor pressure deficit vpd following the vif 5 criteria and the principle of parsimony four variable models are preferred over five or more variable ones three or fewer variable models jeopardize the r 2 adj results beyond the comparison of models of different sets of variables based on vif and the r 2y adj values the selection of the optimal set of variables for smlr tries to keep a balance between energy and water related variables the monthly models such as the optimal one formed by rad rr vpd sm exhibit low collinearity and annual r 2y values of 0 3 r 2c during the critical period close to 0 5 and r 2c max during peak correlations barely over 0 7 which are within the range of results published before for similar multivariate linear regression approaches interestingly the r 2y values obtained from the annual model built using variables only in their critical month of influence reach over 0 6 which exceeds substantially the estimates of the monthly models these results highlight the importance of the critical periods of impact of each key variables which can be used as proxies of crop yields the seasonality of correlations is consistently displayed by all models with a peak of correlation during the springtime critical period of crops from early march to mid june while univariate analysis indicated synchrony between the critical periods of sm and the climatic factors multilinear regression shows seasonal variations of the prevalence of groups of variables e g rad tmax as energetic factors eventually exceeding sm the individual contribution of each variable to the sse further clarifies the ranking of influence of the variables as well as the seasonal share and dominance between them overall sm is the principal annual contributor to yield variance followed by rr so that the contribution of water related variables prevail during the critical period from march to june in comparison to energy related variables dominating early and late seasons while insensitive to non linear processes of importance multivariate analysis using smlr stands as a straightforward tool to identify key variables and reasonably estimate cereal yields at monthly and yearly scales the smlr further provides multiple metrics to evaluate the concurrent contribution of sm and climatic factors on yields underlining the preeminent role of sm in crops under water limited environmental conditions the interest of these results goes beyond the regions currently showing soil water shortcomings because recent studies show that climate change increasingly compromises crop production in many other regions consequently the characterization of environmental factors impact on crop yields and particularly of sm can be helpful to tackle the concerns about the future trends on rainfed cereal crops worldwide declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8987,moistubes continuously irrigate crop root zone through tube nanopores as required based on crop water demand this study investigated the soil water dynamics under adjusted working pressure heads wphs in moistube and revealed whether wetting patterns and moisture distribution can be artificially regulated six scenarios of adjustments were designed wph increase from 0 to 1 0 2 and 1 2 m and wph decrease from 1 to 0 2 0 and 2 1 m wetting patterns were analyzed using image processing moistube discharge and moisture distribution within wetting patterns were analyzed results demonstrated that following wph adjustment the moistube discharge rate moisture distribution and wetting morphology significantly changed the cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate rapidly changed without buffering process at the adjustment points the infiltration rate at certain wphs showed a slightly decreasing trend obeying an exponential type model when the wph was adjusted the infiltration rate rapidly increased or decreased to values that linearly correlated with wph respectively the wetting front deviated from the original advance trend and accelerated or decelerated with increased or decreased wph respectively we proposed a physical empirical model based on green ampt model theory under a polar coordinate system this model exhibited satisfactory performances on moistube discharge and wetting front advance under adjusted wphs wetting pattern center rapidly deviated from the moistube center following greater wphs with the deviation positively correlated with wph soil remained unsaturated around moistubes the soil water content swc within the wetting patterns was governed by wph adjustments swc gradually increased or decreased with wph increase or decrease our results suggest that increasing wph remarkably affected soil water dynamics while the effects of wph decrease on wetting pattern advance were not noticeable which exhibited a slight expanding of wetting patterns with uniformly redistributed and decreasing swc the feasibility of regulating moistube discharge wetting morphology and swc favors synchronously satisfying crop water requirements keywords moistube irrigation infiltration characteristic water content redistribution wetting centroid descent physical empirical model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction irrigated water accounts for approximately 70 of freshwater withdrawals worldwide pérez blanco et al 2020 and is the least productive use of freshwater resources damania et al 2017 water saving irrigation technology is vitally important in regions where water is scarce traditional water saving irrigation methods improve crop water productivity wpc see abbreviations in table 1 but consume high amounts of energy and might cause environmental problems cai et al 2021 interest in subsurface irrigation has increased primarily due to its efficacy in conserving water by reducing surface runoff evaporative water losses and deep percolation in agricultural systems ayars et al 2015 kacimov and obnosov 2017 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 nazari et al 2021 moistube irrigation mti is a newly developed precise irrigation technology and is categorized as a subsurface irrigation method qi et al 2021a sun et al 2018 the moistube serving as a line source emitter continuously supplies water and soluble fertilizer to the crop root zone similar to skin sweating fig 1a b and c kanda et al 2020b the entire tube is made of poly semipermeable membrane material with densely distributed nanoscale pores as emission devices approximately 1 105 pores per cm2 the diameter of the nanoscale pores ranges between 10 and 900 nm water is discharged into the surrounding soil matrix under the water potential difference between the working pressure head wph and soil matric potential the discharge of the mti tube is typically no more than 50 l m 1 d 1 under varying working pressure heads from 6 kpa negative wph to 10 kpa kacimov and obnosov 2016 2017 kanda et al 2020a 2020b as is widely acknowledged traditional microirrigation systems e g drip irrigation and microsprinkler irrigation allow water to drip or spray onto the plant root zone or the soil surface through a pressurized piping system consisting of a main line submain laterals pipes valves and emitters baiamonte 2018 the irrigation water is transferred through circular pipes in laminar flow regime and is discharged by emitters in a turbulent flow regime e g drip irrigation however the emitters on moistubes are nanoscale pores that are approximately tens or hundreds of times larger than water molecules the effects of surface tension of water molecules on the outflow mechanism of moistube irrigation are not yet understood it remains unclear whether the hydraulic outflow mechanism complies with the conventional darcy s law therefore there is a need for investigations on moistube discharge and water transfer mechanisms in the moistube and soil matrix system optimization of moistube irrigation scheduling requires estimates of soil water dynamics with evapotranspiration and drainage processes incorporated to reduce deep percolation and ineffective evaporation kanda et al 2020a previous research has documented that the soil water dynamics in mti or subsurface drip irrigation depend on factors such as soil texture initial soil water content working pressure head wph evapotranspiration emitter type and discharge displacement depth of the emitter etc cai et al 2018 elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 kanda et al 2020a nogueira et al 2021 qi et al 2021a 2021b wang et al 2017 understanding the effects of wph on wetting patterns and root water uptake throughout the crop growth helps with the effective use of irrigated water by ensuring that water is supplied to zones where the root system is highly active and at a suitable rate for crop uptake appels and karimi 2021 porous pipes made of elastic and flexible materials e g nanopore materials show variable discharge characteristics when subjected to varying pressures as reported by liang et al 2009 studies has found that similar to other pressurized irrigation technologies the wph of moistube irrigation is also the main driver of discharge and wetting patterns the discharge rate is significantly positively correlated with the wph niu et al 2013 the moistube discharge ranges between 5 8 and 41 5 l m 1 d 1 under a wph from 20 kpa to 100 kpa kanda et al 2020a therefore it could be well envisaged to dynamically adjust the working pressure head of moistubes as required based on crop growth periods and meteorological factors the matching of timely water input and output is achievable there are differences in the discharge characteristics of the emitter in the air and in the soil under the same pressure head increasing wph in the air results in a linear increase in the discharge rate and a decrease in discharge deviation with increased wph in the soil the emitter discharge soil water content and irrigation uniformity increase cai et al 2021 it is of great interest to find that the water discharge rate in the air is much lower than that in the soil and that increasing burial depth results in a lower discharge rate soil matric suction facilitates moistube outflow because the soil instantaneously absorbs skin sweating like droplets from the tube wall thus promoting moistube discharge niu et al 2013 as noted by fan et al 2018a both the wetted soil volume and wetting front distance are positively correlated with the initial water content and wph fan et al 2018a qi et al 2021a numerically simulated the infiltration behaviors of mti and found that a higher operating pressure head appreciably enlarges the water potential gradient between inside and outside the moistube and increases the moistube discharge rate and wetting pattern area qi et al 2021a the wph of subsurface irrigation is also not necessarily set to a positive value e g wang et al 2022 invented a negative pressure irrigation device to regulate soil moisture precisely and continuously by altering the negative pressure to supply a low discharge rate that maintains a desirable wetting pattern wang et al 2022 this study further recommended that a positive pressure head be operated to promptly generate a stable wetting pattern and that a suitable negative pressure be automatically adjusted to satisfy crop water requirements li et al 2017 reported that negative fertigation is capable of supplying water at appropriate times and the moisture content within 0 100 cm of the soil layer is more stable than that under drip fertigation li et al 2017 negative fertigation could save a substantial amount of water compared to drip fertigation for vegetable production there should also be a maximum discharge rate or an upper limit to the wph inside the moistube or a subsurface emitter to avoid back pressure when a predetermined discharge of a subsurface emitter is greater than the soil infiltration capacity the pressure head outside the emitter becomes positive which in return builds up pressure and reduces the source discharge rate lazarovitch et al 2005 by making use of the back pressure phenomenon a possibility of self regulation of noncompensating emitter discharge was proposed for subsurface irrigation according to the interplay between emitter discharge and soil pressure gil et al 2008 for subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters excessive working pressure might also destroy the soil aggregate structure and severely clog the emitter thus low hydraulic conductivity and a wph ranging between 20 and 50 cm for subsurface emitters are recommended cai et al 2018 a 0 2 m deep subsurface drip tube was suggested to provide moisture for the root zones and to reduce evaporation and deep percolation santos et al 2016 different layers with varying hydraulic properties should also be considered to calculate the water depth and manage irrigation by water balance in summary appropriate adjustment of the working pressure head of the moistube is needed primarily to meet crop water demands at different fertility stages and to promote wue and to avoid soil structure destruction positive pressure built up deep drainage and tube clogging in addition intelligent regulation of working pressure could also be integrated with intelligent irrigation making it inevitable to reveal the soil water dynamics subjected to a variable wph it remains unclear how infiltration behaviors and water diffusion mechanisms respond to variable wph under a newly developed moistube irrigation technology therefore the aim of this study is 1 to investigate how infiltration behaviors and wetting patterns dynamically respond to various scenarios of increasing or decreasing wph 2 to observe how moisture is redistributed within the wetting pattern when subjected to increased or decreased wph and 3 to monitor how the wetting pattern swells or shrinks and to measure how the wetting front centroid deviates the moistube core under variable wphs 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments of moistube irrigation laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate wetting front dynamics and flow characteristics subjected to a varying wph the soil used was a clay loam and was classified as hapludalf alfisols table 2 surface samples were collected from the upper 40 cm layer of agricultural fields rice and maize cultivated in rotation in the laboratory of efficient irrigation drainage and agricultural soil water environment in southern china in hohai university nanjing 31 57 n 118 50 e china soils were then sieved through 5 mm apertures air dried and remolded every 10 cm into lysimeters length width height 0 6 m 0 3 m 0 7 m to a bulk density of 1 30 g cm3 the initial volumetric water content of the air dried soil was 5 98 the surface of each repacked layer was roughened to obtain homogeneous hydraulic properties the lysimeters were made of transparent acrylic plates to observe and record wetting front dynamics a third generation moistube fig 1b was chosen as the micro irrigator produced by the shenzhen moistube irrigation co ltd china the experimental equipment comprised a soil lysimeter moistube mariotte bottle height adjustment plate and time domain reflectometer tdr as depicted in fig 2 a 30 cm moistube along the lysimeter width was installed at a soil depth of 20 cm the moistube irrigator was supplied by the mariotte bottle and the water supply head could be artificially adjusted the moistube had an internal diameter of 1 5 cm a thickness of 1 mm and 100 thousand nanopores distributed per cm2 zou et al 2017 dirwai et al 2021 the duration of moistube irrigation was set to 160 h and the working pressure head was instantly adjusted at the 72nd hour the reason why we chose 72nd hour as the adjustment point is that as we experimentally investigated the wetting front distance and cumulative infiltration practically entered a linear growth phase in addition it was reasonable to reset the crop irrigation scheduling with a three day deadline or to meet the water requirements of the crops irrigation could be advanced or delayed by three days in the subtropical or temperate monsoon climate zone such as that in nanjing china the cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate were calculated from the readings of mariotte bottles the wetting front patterns were photographed every 4 h by a digital camera canon 60d and afterward processed by digital image processing and morphological algorithms the volumetric water contents of the soil profile were continuously monitored by tdr model tdr mux mpts produced by the institute of agrophysics polish academy of sciences ia pas throughout the moistube irrigation event sixteen sensors were installed at 15 10 5 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm vertically and 20 15 10 5 5 10 15 and 20 cm horizontally from the moistube under a cartesian coordinate system centered at the moistube fig 2b the sensors were calibrated by equations recommended by the manufacturer and by a series of soils with different moisture statuses the water content data were collected at approximately 0 5 hour intervals during the whole moistube irrigation process the contour maps of the soil water content distribution were plotted using surfer 15 3 307 computer software in windows version to observe how the soil water content changed under regulated working pressure heads 2 2 treatments of varying working pressure heads during moistube irrigation the wph was manually adjusted at approximately the 72nd hour adjustments of some specimens were delayed due to experimental complexities the recommended working pressure head varies depending on soil types soil textures subsurface irrigation methods emitters and vegetation type for instance based on our survey the recommended hydraulic heads of ceramic emitters or porous clay pipes ranged between 0 and 1 2 m cai et al 2018 2022 das gupta et al 2009 moistube irrigation practices suggest a wph ranging between a negative pressure head and 3 0 m dirwai et al 2021 qi et al 2021 the optimum wph should be determined based on evapotranspiration and soil hydraulic properties infiltration characteristics to avoid excess head or pressure deficits nine scenarios of water head treatments were designed i e three treatments of constant working pressure head as control groups 0 1 and 2 m three treatments of water head increase 0 1 m 1 2 m and 0 2 m and three treatments of water head decrease 1 0 m 2 0 m and 2 1 m the numbers of treatments are given in table 3 three replicates were set for each treatment scenarios of wph adjustments are presented in table 4 and fig 3 the reason why we staggered the adjustment time points in different replicates of the same treatment was to rationalize the arrangements of tdr probes 2 3 image processing and parameter calculation pictures of wetting patterns were corrected for geometric distortion wetting pattern images actual size 60 cm 60 cm were cropped and then resized to a resolution of 6000 6000 marked contrast was displayed between the wetting pattern and initially dry soil matrix therefore the images were classified into wetted and dry classes using a supervised classification method which is widely used in water flow analysis fig 2c and d as employed by bargués tobella et al 2014 cai et al 2018 guo et al 2019 hardie et al 2018 parker 2010 wang et al 2018 based on the wetting front binary images the parameters including wetting pattern areas horizontal and vertical distances and propagation velocity of the wetting front were calculated using morphological algorithms fig 2e wang et al 2018a 2018b all image processing and parameter calculation processes were performed in matlab r2018a wetting front patterns and infiltration characteristics were characterized by the following i cumulative infiltration volume i cm2 and infiltration rate q cm2 h 1 per unit width obtained by the readings of the mariotte bottle ii the distance of the wetting front in the horizontal vertical downward and vertical upward directions denoted by x h r z d o w n and z u p cm respectively these three parameters were calculated by measuring the distance from the moistube to the respective wetting front edges using morphological algorithms followed by a conversion from pixel length to actual length iii area of the wetting front a w f cm2 obtained by counting the pixels of the wetting front and converting from pixel area to actual area iv deviation distance from the centroid of the wetting pattern to the moistube δ cm used to evaluate the effects of gravitational potential and water pressure adjustment on the centroid of wetting patterns in variable stages of moistube irrigation v relative deviation of the wetting front centroid to the moistube compared with the vertical wetting front distance δ cm which is expressed as 1 δ δ z u p z d o w n where δ cm is the deviation distance of the wetting front centroid from the moistube and z u p and z d o w n cm are the upward and downward distances of wetting front respectively vi equivalent radius of wetting front r e cm referred to as the radius determined from the wetting front area a w f which can be written as 2 r e a w f π where a w f is the wetting front area introduced above cm2 and π is the circumference ratio approximately taken as 3 14 2 4 semiphysical empirical model and model performance evaluation we proposed a set of physical empirical equations that describe the cumulative infiltration discharge rate and wetting pattern radius versus time based on the green ampt model in a polar coordinate system fig 4 let r 0 be a saturated disk source of a radius outer radius with a moistube working pressure head h p inside then the pressure head outside the tube at point a can be expressed as 3 h 0 h p q 2 π k w ln r 0 d w r 0 where k w is the saturated conductivity of the moistube cm h 1 q is the discharge rate of moistube cm h 1 and d w is the thickness of the moistube cm as previously investigated qi et al 2021a k w is constant and the discharge q is linearly correlated with the pressure head difference between the water head inside and outside the moistube thus we know that the water heads outside the moistube h 0 are positively correlated with those inside the moistube h p according to darcy s law the water infiltration rate into soil outside the tube can be written as 4 i k s h r where i is the infiltration rate per unit width cm h 1 h is the soil water head cm r is the wetting front distance along the polar direction cm and the negative sign indicates that the direction of infiltration is opposite to the water potential gradient according to the green ampt model the difference in the soil water head between points a and b for a given wetting front distance r can be estimated as 5 h δ h h 0 r sin θ s f where r sin θ is the difference in gravitational potential between points a and b s f is the matric suction at the wetting front cm the actual infiltration length from the tube wall to b can be written as 6 r δ r r r 0 therefore the infiltration rate per unit width at point b can be written as 7 i k s h 0 r sin θ s f r r 0 the infiltration flux d q corresponding to an arc length r d θ at the wetting front can be estimated as d q i r d θ and the integration along the circle wetting front of this equation leads to 8 q d q 0 2 π i r d θ 0 2 π r k s h 0 r sin θ s f r r 0 d θ where q is the discharge rate through the moistube cm2 min 1 assuming that r δ then r is deemed to be independent of θ it is worth noting that this is an approximate estimate derivation of eq 8 gives 9 q 2 π r k s h 0 s f r r 0 k s r 2 r r 0 0 2 π sin θ d θ with 0 2 π sin θ d θ 0 eq 9 can be reduced to 10 q 2 π r k s h 0 s f r r 0 based on the water balance principle the relationship between the cumulative infiltration volume i and equivalent wetting front radius r e was obtained 11 i π r e 2 π r 0 2 θ s θ i according to the cosine theorem we have 12 r e 2 r 2 δ 2 2 r δ sin θ based on the relation between the infiltration flux q through the wetting front and the cumulative infiltration volume i we can obtain 13 q d i d t substituting eqs 10 11 and 12 into eq 13 we have 14 d π r 2 δ 2 2 r δ sin θ r 0 2 θ s θ i d t 2 π r k s h 0 s f r r 0 r and δ are functions of infiltration time t and the derivation of eq 14 yields 15 r d r d t δ d δ

eq 16 gives 17 r r 0 2 k s h 0 s f θ s θ i t eqs 11 13 and 17 can be combined to obtain 18 i 2 π k s h 0 s f t 2 π r 0 2 k s θ s θ i h 0 s f t 19 q 2 π k s h 0 s f π r 0 2 k s θ s θ i h 0 s f 1 t practically the volumetric water content θ along the wetting front is not saturated θ s but gradually decreases along the r direction the water head outside the moistube h 0 is also difficult to predict using physical approaches in practice similar to the original green ampt model the proposed model overestimates the hydraulic conductivity of soil k s because the water content within the wetting front did not reach saturation thus k s in eq 17 19 should be replaced by k e in addition k e also varied with time and along the polar direction thus making it more difficult to accurately measure or estimate with this background we transformed the fully physical models eqs 18 and 19 into semiphysical empirical models to describe the infiltration behaviors as follows 20 i α h t β h t 21 q α h β h 2 t 22 r r 0 ξ 1 h t t t c r 0 ξ 2 h t t c t t c where r is the radius of the wetting front cm r 0 is the outer radius of the moistube cm h is the equivalent water head considering the working pressure head and matrix potential cm α β and ξ are the fitting parameters of infiltration behaviors t is the infiltration time h and t c is the time point when the wph was adjusted the model

table 5 3 results 3 1 infiltration characteristics subjected to varying working pressure heads fig 5 shows the cumulative infiltration with time under variable working pressure heads wphs the cumulative infiltration amount changed approximately linearly over time under all treatments this phenomenon differs greatly from other traditional infiltration characteristics e g surface infiltration under a constant pressure head in which the infiltration amount varied exponentially and linearly in the early and later stages respectively the curve of cumulative infiltration rapidly skipped the exponential growth phase as displayed in fig 5 for the treatments with an adjusted wph the cumulative infiltration responded sharply to the increase or decrease in wph the cumulative infiltration exhibited a pattern of two intersecting straight lines with a rigid folding point signifying that we have the flexibility to regulate the infiltration characteristics by instantly adjusting working pressure heads following crop water requirements another interesting finding is that the moistube irrigation pattern might depend faintly on the elapsed infiltration time or initial moisture status when the adjacent area around the moistube was already moistened in fig 5a and b the water content distributions and wetting front patterns corresponding to the adjustment timepoints 72nd 83rd and 92nd and 72nd 90th and 144th hour were different respectively however the cumulative infiltration curves visually displayed a parallel phenomenon under the same wph this phenomenon is also seen when comparing dec 1 0 and dec 2 0 in fig 5d and e respectively in which the segments in the later phases were parallel under a 0 m working head differentiating the cumulative infiltration amount with respect to time yielded the infiltration rate as depicted in fig 6 the figure shows that in the first stage the infiltration rate exhibited a faint decreasing trend with time but this trend seemed insignificant and can be ignored considering the duration of moistube irrigation similar findings in regard to the cumulative infiltration were expected when the wph was adjusted up or down the infiltration rate increased or decreased without any buffering process sharply increased or decreased to an approximately constant value respectively which seemed to be a fixed value under certain wph for instance comparison of dec 1 0 and dec 2 0 indicates that the infiltration rates under the adjusted 0 m working head between the two treatments were practically identical although the initial moisture status of soil at the transition point was different the hypothesis was also confirmed in fig 7 in which the infiltration rate typically corresponded to a fixed value under a certain wph the gray blue and red bars indicate the infiltration rates under wphs of 0 m 1 m and 2 m respectively the data demonstrated that regardless of how and when the wph was adjusted the infiltration rate under a fixed working head was almost constant additionally the infiltration rate was linearly and positively correlated with the wph and was independent of the wph adjustment criteria as depicted in fig 7 m the moistube discharge increased by 3 2 times or 7 6 times when the wph was adjusted from 0 m to 1 m or 2 m respectively we proposed a semiphysical empirical model that uses the equivalent water head h and infiltration time t to evaluate the moistube discharge rate under varying wphs see the bold solid line in fig 6 according to the rsr criteria acceptable agreement between the modeled and measured data was confirmed table 6 however the r 2 and nse criteria gave less satisfactory evaluation results due to the marked scattering of data from the three replicates the data of cumulative infiltration vs time exhibited more obvious regularity in contrast obvious fluctuations and variance were found in the infiltration rate for treatments inc 1 2 80 h and dec 2 1 80 h this resulted from the following causes 1 differences in the hydraulic conductivity of the moistube gave rise to variance in infiltration curves among replicates 2 soil heterogeneity led to value discontinuity in the infiltration rate with respect to time considering that the moistube discharge was small and 3 short time intervals could also cause distinct errors in infiltration rates these reasons magnify the deviation between the modeled and observed data nevertheless our model provided a good trend of how the infiltration rate varied under adjusted wphs the mechanisms of the interplay among wph time and infiltration rate should be physically enhanced in regard to the parameters that were difficult to measure 3 2 wetting front patterns and moisture distribution under varying pressure heads infiltration from the moistube into initially dry soils displayed a clear wetting front and an abrupt interface separating the moistened and yet dry zones the vicinity of the wetting front was visually a line at which the gradient of water content was greatest along the direction of infiltration the dynamic wet patterns of three replicates exhibited similar characteristics and two typical specimens of the three replicates were analyzed fig 8 shows the evolution of wetting pattern area and wetting front distances in both the vertical and horizontal directions with time the wetting pattern of moistube irrigation was approximately elliptical the wetting front in both the vertical and horizontal directions advanced faster in the early phases because of the large capillarity pressure gradients between the moistube and wetting fronts the vertical and horizontal wetting front then decelerated as the cumulative infiltration increased and tended toward a stabilization in which the wetting front distance was linearly correlated with time as gravity forces began to dominate the wetting patterns also responded dramatically to an increase or decrease in wph once the wph was increased stabilization was disturbed and entered a new normal in which the wetting front also accelerated and then advanced at a constant velocity however when the wph decreased from 2 m to 1 m or 0 m the wetting front directly and distinctly started to move forward at a smaller uniform velocity without any buffering process typically the upward distance of the wetting front was smaller than that of the downward wetting front under gravitational effects this was marked in our experiments an abnormal phenomenon exhibited in our experiments was that the horizontal distance of wetting front was greater than the vertical distance this could probably be attributed to the excessive longitudinal compression of soil during backfilling this gave rise to a non uniformity of hydraulic parameters and a reduction in the hydraulic conductivity in the vertical direction than that in the horizontal direction this abnormal phenomenon was usually observed in infiltration experiments in remolded soil columns as was also observed by naglič et al 2014 shiri et al 2020 as shown in the second and fourth columns in fig 8 the trends in wetting front advancing velocity were approximately the same as the infiltration rate but distributed in a slightly scattered way which could be explained by the localized heterogeneity of soils and the inevitable calculation errors from the digital image processing methods this scattering behavior was not displayed in the infiltration rate because it was more of a macroscopic performance of moisture transport and wetting front evolution the wetting pattern area was converted into the equivalent radius and then modeled with respect to infiltration time using eq 17 the observed and modeled results are plotted in fig 9 the results show that our model gave excellent approximations of the equivalent wetting front distance with r 2 and nse all greater values than 0 99 and rsr values approaching 0 table 7 and fig 9 this suggests that the advance distances of the wetting front before and after the adjustment were both consistent accord with the kostiakov type equation in which the gravitational effects could be counterbalanced with increases in wph the vertex of the parabola moved more towards the right displaying increased curvature at the adjustment point in contrast a decreasing wph resulted in a leftward movement of the vertex with decreasing curvature at the adjustment point one can make full use of the characteristics of the wetting front advance when designing moistube irrigation scheduling and tube burial depth typically the distance of the wetting front in different directions conformed to the same law and was ranked in the following order the distance of the downward wetting front horizontal wetting front upward wetting front the parallel contour of the advancing wetting front or the isobar of pore pressure or water content approximated the form of concentric circles however the centroid of the wetting front is closely correlated with soil textures the more clayey the soil texture was the smaller the difference in the distance of the wetting front in the downward horizontal and upward directions less deviation between the wetting pattern center and the moistube δ was found this phenomenon in clayey soils can be explained by less influence from gravity and more influence from of the capillary effects in this study we revealed how the centroid of the wetting front deviated from the moistube center under varying wphs during the moistube irrigation process in fig 10 the absolute and relative deviation to the vertical wetting front distance is given definitions and equations are provided in section 2 3 the reason for choosing relative deviation is that the swelling process of the wetting pattern differed greatly under different regulation modes of wph it is more reasonable to use relative deviation across different treatments in addition the deviation δ is not only closely related to the size of the wetting pattern but also to the levels of moisture content within the wetting pattern this is because as we presume the level of water content determines the weighing of the capillarity potential gradient in dominating water transport compared with gravitational effects we speculate that initially greater working pressure heads resulted in higher water contents thus enlarging the deviation distance between the wetting pattern core and the moistube we compared the deviations under different working pressure heads it was found that the absolute and relative deviation values increased with increasing wph in the early phase when the wetting front was relatively small the deviation value fluctuated around the moistube center showing no significant deviation due to the dominating capillary forces when the wph was increased the deviation δ increased as infiltration proceeded and no upper limit values were observed gravity gradually played a dominant role in the moistube infiltration process as the wetting front expanded it is interesting to find that when wph decreased the absolute deviation continued to rise with at a gentler trend however the relative deviation gradually stabilized or even declined as shown in fig 10 h j and l under a working pressure of 2 m the growth rate of the relative deviation was greater than the absolute deviation and the opposite phenomenon occurred when the working pressure decreased we presume that the entire wetting pattern descended gradually accompanied by a slight expansion the higher water content supplied by the preliminary 2 m water head began to redistribute and the expansion velocity decreased due to the decrease in the wph hence the relative deviation δ exhibited a decreasing trend overall the deviation increased when raising the working pressure and tended to stabilize when the working head was lowered these results provide the basis for designing the moistube burial depth under a variable working pressure head when moistube irrigation is integrated with intelligent irrigation fig 11 shows the evolution of volumetric water content with time for eight monitored depths i e 5 10 15 20 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm vertically from the moistube we also manually measured the soil water content swc around the moistube the swc results demonstrated that under moistube irrigation the swc within the wetting pattern was maintained at 30 43 and was not saturated at the three working pressure heads this created a suitable hydropneumatic environment for crop moisture and oxygen however it remains to be investigated whether it was capable of providing sufficient moisture to protect against drought stress once evapotranspiration was higher than normal as shown in fig 11 the water contents of the nine observation points ranked in descending order as follows 25 cm 20 cm 20 cm 15 cm 15 cm 10 cm 10 cm 5 cm 5 cm due to gravity effects the upward and downward soil water distribution could be assumed to be an intersection of two linear functions as proposed previously mao et al 2016 based on the green ampt model for the treatments of pressure head increase inc the swc with respect to time exhibited a rapid increase and then an approximate stabilization or an extremely slow increase in the early phase for instance the stabilized water contents at z 5 cm for 0 1 and 2 m working pressure heads were approximately 30 37 and 43 respectively once the wph was raised the water content at each observation point abruptly increased and then reached another stabilization the second stabilized water content agreed well with that under the same working pressure head for instance at z 5 cm the second steady state of water content was 37 and 43 under 1 m and 2 m working pressure heads respectively for the treatments of pressure head decrease dec the evolution of water content with time responded distinctly from that of inc in the early phase the water content showed a rapid increase followed by approximate stabilization once the water head decreased several specimens showed a slightly decreasing trend in water content e g fig 11 g i and j which could be neglected compared to the maximum water content the water contents of the other specimens of dec remained basically unchanged for the observation points whose water contents had reached a state of stabilization regulating soil water content swc is achievable by adjusting wph fig 12 illustrates the swc under increasing or decreasing wph fig 13 displays the variations in swc distribution along the z axis at different observation timepoints the thin solid black and red lines are the curves of swc before and after wph adjustment respectively the thick solid blue line marks the swc distribution at the adjustment point it is worth noting that the black and red lines we chose are representative random swc distributions the time interval between each two swc distribution lines was not fixed but randomly and rationally selected due to the limited number of tdr probes which did not allow for continuous observation for the inc treatments the swc distribution evolved slowly in the shape of a sarciniform under an initially low pressure head an increase in the working pressure head resulted in rapid growth followed by a redistribution of swc for the dec treatments the swc distribution rapidly progressed and then redistributed to a high swc state when the wph decreased a slight but not marked increase in swc was observed the time interval between the bunching lines was relatively random and ranged between 1 and 4 h nevertheless the variation in swc could also help reveal the mechanism of how the swc responded to the increase or decrease in the working pressure head in summary the swc progressed rapidly and redistributed after the working head increased as one could expect however there was a slight change or even a reverse distribution in the swc when the pressure head decreased the moisture diffused from high to low swc areas and this diffusion rate was greater than the discharge rate supplied by the lower wph thus causing a slight but negligible drop in the swc around the moistube 4 discussion 4 1 flow characteristics under variable working pressure heads moistubes are polymer semipermeable membranes in which the supplied water is driven by the working pressure head wph inside the tube and the soil suction outside the tube dirwai et al 2021 water and fertilizer solutions are transported out of the nanopores similar to skin sweating and permeate to the crop root zones as precisely adapted to evapotranspiration to supply moisture and nutrients our findings indicated that the working pressure head wph was the dominant factor that controlled the flow rate of moistube irrigation the infiltration rate was linearly correlated with the wph separately considering the flow mechanisms through the moistube the moistube wall could be treated as a porous medium e g a heavy clay soil that remained saturated throughout the infiltration process and had a constant saturated hydraulic conductivity qi et al 2021a the infiltration problem through the moistube wall was reduced to darcy s flow therefore the infiltration process in moistube irrigation is considered to comprise of two phases through two porous media i e a nanopore porous medium with lower hydraulic conductivity and soil porous medium with higher hydraulic conductivity we assume that the infiltration behaviors in moistube irrigation do not fall outside the scope of darcy s law when analyzing a darcy richards infiltration problem boundary conditions and soil diffusion capacity are indispensable prerequisites for revealing soil water dynamics and infiltration behaviors this also applies to moistube irrigation in which the hydraulic mechanism has not been clearly characterized to date regarding the nanotube given that the moistube was treated as a permanent porous medium and the surrounding soil was a porous medium with a permanent particle aggregate skeleton the working conditions of moistube irrigation mainly depended on the working pressure head initial water content and tube burial depth the water potential gradient caused by the internal and external water head became a dominant factor driving water movement previous studies have shown that the infiltration rate of moistubes exposed to the atmosphere is much lower than that of the moistubes buried in soil qi et al 2021a this also proved that the soil matric suction facilitated water flow out of the moistube by absorbing the sweat like moisture and increasing the water potential gradient inside and outside the tube niu et al 2013 the discharge rate of the moistube was proportional to the working pressure head inside when the water potential outside exposed to the atmosphere was basically unchanged qi et al 2021a when the wph increased or decreased the cumulative infiltration amount or infiltration rate responded accordingly and sharply this could be interpreted by the extremely low emitter discharge out of the moistube generally the infiltration rate in variably saturated soils is dominated jointly by the output capacity of the water source at the boundary e g moistube discharge and the maximum water diffusion capacity or infiltration capacity around the tube if the emitter discharge is less than the maximum infiltration capacity of the soil the moisture rapidly diffuses thus leaving the soil around the moistube unsaturated this was also manifested in the moisture distribution under the maximum wph i e the 2 m treatment as reported by provenzano 2007 if the emitter discharge is greater than the maximum soil infiltration capacity a positive pressure head is built up surrounding the emitter resulting in a decrease in the emitter discharge provenzano 2007 this phenomenon is typically referred to as back pressure in the moistube irrigation the outlet emitter moistube was a nanotube material in which the working pressure head was remarkably dissipated by the dense nanopores the radial soil diffusion rate around the wetting front was much greater than the discharge capacity of the moistube since the initial water content was sufficiently low therefore the infiltration rate in our case depends mainly on the discharge capacity of the moistube this explains the abrupt increase or decrease in the infiltration rate under instant adjustments of moistube wph the moistube had not yet reached the back pressure state nevertheless it remains unresolved whether there would be a buildup of a positive water head when the working pressure head inside the moistube is sufficiently large or when the soil is heavily clayey or sufficiently wet in addition it needs to be further addressed whether the flow in the nanotube materials e g moistube still conforms with darcy s law given that the water conducting materials are made of nanopores that have a slightly larger pore scale than water molecules 4 2 moisture redistribution subjected to increase or decrease in working pressure head moistube irrigation continuously supplies moisture to root zones and adapts to crop water requirements thereby avoiding sudden changes in soil moisture that impair crop growth maintaining a constantly satisfactory moisture fertilizer environment can facilitate maize growth and yields particularly during the flowering and pollination stages cai et al 2022 during the critical period of crop water demand it is necessary to artificially adjust the working pressure heads to proactively regulate the moisture content this can be achieved based on our experimental results when moistube irrigation began the soil water content swc at the observation points rapidly tended to stabilization in which swc remained generally stable the swc did not reach saturation and declined along the radial direction of infiltration the negative pressure regimes were quasi steady because the water was emitted from the moistube spontaneously and absorbed continuously into the soil the moistube discharge rate under the three wphs was much less than the infiltration capacity along the wetting front the infiltration problem from the moistube outside can be viewed as a flux dominated or water supply dominated infiltration model the boundary around the moistube can be treated as a neumann boundary condition under a prescribed discharge rate the water content along the radial direction increased slowly within an unsaturated range after a certain period when the wph was raised the boundary condition changed but still represented the second type of boundary condition neumann boundary the water content rose sharply and entered another stabilization state with a higher water content that still did not reach saturation when the wph was indefinitely increased the discharge rate began to exceed the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the moistube the infiltration was no longer dominated by the wph due to the development of the back pressure lazarovitch et al 2005 the water content along the radial direction reached saturation and the water transfer depended on the soil infiltration capacity the backup pressure case should be strictly avoided because of the high probability of aggregate dispersion and emitter clogging the sudden reduction in the wph caused a decrease in the moistube discharge rate the antecedent high water content began to diffuse because the changed discharge rate could not sufficiently complement the diffusion along the wetting front direction thus resulting in a slight reduction in the soil water content around the moistube however the water content near the wetting front was not affected and showed a normal increasing trend moistubes are essentially a porous medium that could be deemed to be a heavy clay with extremely fine pores very similar to the ceramic emitter reported by cai et al 2018 the water flow through the moistube is considered to be darcy flow type laminar flow as previously reported by qi et al 2021a the moistube discharge rate infiltration behaviors and wetting front advance could be simulated well by hydrus 2d in this numerical simulation the moistube and the surrounding soil were treated as uniform porous medium that exhibited darcy richards flow regimes with a couple of separate hydraulic parameters kacimov and obnosov 2017 the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the moistube was set according to the preliminarily measured hydraulic conductivity during the infiltration process the moistube was basically saturated the moisture escaping from the moistube was rapidly absorbed by the surrounding soil and conducted to the low potential areas the infiltration problem under increased or decreased water heads can be simplified into a layered soil infiltration problem and solved by creating a double ring soil matrix with outer clay loam and inner extremely heavy clay our attempt to regulate soil water content by adjusting working pressure heads is achievable the efficacy of adjusting volumetric water content into desired levels as adapted to crop needs appears different in increasing or decreasing wph the efficacy of increasing wph on swc is much more satisfactory than that of decreasing wph in production practice the moistube irrigation working conditions and wetting front patterns need to be better adapted to closely match crop needs to achieve water saving irrigation and reduce deep seepage previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of wph and tube burial depth on moistube wetting patterns and crop yield merely based on indoor experiments and numerical simulations xu et al 2021 first reported the connections of the wetting pattern of moistube irrigation with crop root characteristics and distribution the depth width and morphology of the root system of cash crops were summarized with suitable swc upper and lower limits in our study the feasibility of regulating the wetting front pattern and moisture content was validated how to satisfy the physiological water demands root water uptake and crop transpiration by simultaneously controlling the wph and maintaining the volumetric water balance remains to be further addressed 4 3 wetting pattern centroid deviating from the moistube as discussed above the moistube is a semipermeable membrane tube with a low discharge rate around which a positive pressure head typically does not form and the soil is unsaturated thus the water transport around the moistube is driven by gravity and capillarity the advance distance of the wetting front follows the descending order downward wetting front horizontal wetting front upward wetting front which is consistent with previous results conducted by elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 fan et al 2018b this results from the gravitational effect that further leads to a difference in the water potential gradient in the following descending order downward horizontal and upward this phenomenon can be well and simply analyzed by applying the traditional green ampt ga model in the three directions to reveal which direction the wetting front moves farthest let us set up a scenario in which the wetting front along three directions downward horizontal and upward directions is identical then what remains to be done is to determine the maximum infiltration rate along the three directions based on the green ampt model the infiltration rate for the same wetting front distance z f along three directions can be written as i d o w n k e d o w n s f s t u b e z f z f i h o r k e h o r s f s t u b e z f and i u p k e u p s f s t u b e z f z f where i d o w n i h o r and i u p are the estimated downward horizontal and upward infiltration rates using the traditional ga model respectively s t u b e and s f are the soil matric suction both positive at the moistube and wetting front respectively k e is the effective hydraulic conductivity that is positively related to the effective saturation s e as experimentally investigated the water content in the upward direction is minimal and that in the downward direction is maximal making the effective hydraulic conductivity k e rank in the descending order k e d o w n k e h o r and k e u p it should be noted that the conventional ga model that describes wetting front distance and infiltration time is an implicit equation here we use the infiltration rate at the same wetting front distance to predict the increasing trend of the wetting front after computation it is clear that i d o w n i h o r i u p thus the scenario in which the wetting front along the three directions was equivalent was broken and the downward wetting front reached maximum this scenario clearly and concisely corroborates our experimental results as reported by elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 this phenomenon mentioned above was more evident in coarser soils than in finer soils because of the greater relative gravitational effects in coarser soils regardless of the infiltration type the water infiltration process is essentially water redistribution driven by gravitational and capillary potentials the main difference is that gravity and capillarity forces dominate in different phases of infiltration in the vertical direction the capillarity effect is more significant in diffusing water in the initial phase while the gravity effect plays a great role in the mid to late phases according to the contributions of capillarity and gravity this results in a greater deviation of the wetting pattern centroid from the moistube in the later infiltration process when we analyze this deviation phenomenon following the physical descriptions of richards equation the potential gradient of gravity remains constant at 1 0 while the potential gradient of capillarity rapidly decreases from infinity to 0 this theoretically reveals the change of weighing between gravity and capillarity effects this can better explain the offset of the wetting pattern centroid from moistube that is the greater the gravity effect is the larger the deviation δ will become at different working pressure heads the deviation δ might also show different values for the same size wetting pattern because of the different moisture content within the wetting front a higher moisture content of the wetting pattern leads to larger deviations of δ based on the above discussion we can conclude that a more clayey soil typically results in a slower infiltration rate and less deviation of the wetting pattern centroid from moistube a higher water content within the wetting pattern leads to greater deviation of the wetting pattern centroid from the moistube this conclusion provides a basis for designing the moistube burial depth 5 conclusions moistube discharge wetting front morphology and moisture distribution can be regulated by adjusting the working pressure heads wphs the cumulative infiltration with time responded rapidly to the wph increase or decrease exhibiting a pattern of two intersecting lines without buffering on the folding point when the wph was increased or decreased the infiltration rate increased or decreased without any buffering process to values that linearly correlated with the wph the wetting front deviated from the original advance trend and rapidly accelerated or decelerated in response to increased or decreased wph we proposed a semiphysical empirical model that describes the discharge rate infiltration volume and wetting front advance of moistube irrigation with time this model was fairly useful in predicting the infiltration behaviors of moistube irrigation under regulated wph gravity affected the water potential gradient along different infiltration directions thus causing the wetting pattern centroid to deviate from the moistube the deviation increased as the wph increased because of the progressive domination of gravitational effects swc remained unsaturated throughout moistube irrigation creating a suitable hydropneumatic environment for crop growth swc tended stabilization under a certain wph after a certain period and the stabilization was disturbed and entered another state that exhibited higher or lower moisture distribution when the wph was raised or reduced these findings imply that increasing wph markedly facilitated soil water redistribution and wetting front morphology while the effects of wph decrease on wetting pattern advance were not significant artificial adjustment of the wph can effectively regulate the moistube discharge wetting patterns and moisture distribution under moistube irrigation to reduce deep percolation wph is recommended to be lowered to avoid rapid expansion of the wetting pattern during the critical period of crop water requirement a positive high wph could be applied to generate an initially sufficient wetting pattern followed by decreasing wph to an appropriate water head as the crop requires accordingly it is also feasible to integrate these mechanisms into intelligent irrigation with moistube irrigation and enable moistube supplementation to synchronously meet crop water requirements declaration of competing interest we declare that they have no known

8987,moistubes continuously irrigate crop root zone through tube nanopores as required based on crop water demand this study investigated the soil water dynamics under adjusted working pressure heads wphs in moistube and revealed whether wetting patterns and moisture distribution can be artificially regulated six scenarios of adjustments were designed wph increase from 0 to 1 0 2 and 1 2 m and wph decrease from 1 to 0 2 0 and 2 1 m wetting patterns were analyzed using image processing moistube discharge and moisture distribution within wetting patterns were analyzed results demonstrated that following wph adjustment the moistube discharge rate moisture distribution and wetting morphology significantly changed the cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate rapidly changed without buffering process at the adjustment points the infiltration rate at certain wphs showed a slightly decreasing trend obeying an exponential type model when the wph was adjusted the infiltration rate rapidly increased or decreased to values that linearly correlated with wph respectively the wetting front deviated from the original advance trend and accelerated or decelerated with increased or decreased wph respectively we proposed a physical empirical model based on green ampt model theory under a polar coordinate system this model exhibited satisfactory performances on moistube discharge and wetting front advance under adjusted wphs wetting pattern center rapidly deviated from the moistube center following greater wphs with the deviation positively correlated with wph soil remained unsaturated around moistubes the soil water content swc within the wetting patterns was governed by wph adjustments swc gradually increased or decreased with wph increase or decrease our results suggest that increasing wph remarkably affected soil water dynamics while the effects of wph decrease on wetting pattern advance were not noticeable which exhibited a slight expanding of wetting patterns with uniformly redistributed and decreasing swc the feasibility of regulating moistube discharge wetting morphology and swc favors synchronously satisfying crop water requirements keywords moistube irrigation infiltration characteristic water content redistribution wetting centroid descent physical empirical model data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction irrigated water accounts for approximately 70 of freshwater withdrawals worldwide pérez blanco et al 2020 and is the least productive use of freshwater resources damania et al 2017 water saving irrigation technology is vitally important in regions where water is scarce traditional water saving irrigation methods improve crop water productivity wpc see abbreviations in table 1 but consume high amounts of energy and might cause environmental problems cai et al 2021 interest in subsurface irrigation has increased primarily due to its efficacy in conserving water by reducing surface runoff evaporative water losses and deep percolation in agricultural systems ayars et al 2015 kacimov and obnosov 2017 kandelous and šimůnek 2010 nazari et al 2021 moistube irrigation mti is a newly developed precise irrigation technology and is categorized as a subsurface irrigation method qi et al 2021a sun et al 2018 the moistube serving as a line source emitter continuously supplies water and soluble fertilizer to the crop root zone similar to skin sweating fig 1a b and c kanda et al 2020b the entire tube is made of poly semipermeable membrane material with densely distributed nanoscale pores as emission devices approximately 1 105 pores per cm2 the diameter of the nanoscale pores ranges between 10 and 900 nm water is discharged into the surrounding soil matrix under the water potential difference between the working pressure head wph and soil matric potential the discharge of the mti tube is typically no more than 50 l m 1 d 1 under varying working pressure heads from 6 kpa negative wph to 10 kpa kacimov and obnosov 2016 2017 kanda et al 2020a 2020b as is widely acknowledged traditional microirrigation systems e g drip irrigation and microsprinkler irrigation allow water to drip or spray onto the plant root zone or the soil surface through a pressurized piping system consisting of a main line submain laterals pipes valves and emitters baiamonte 2018 the irrigation water is transferred through circular pipes in laminar flow regime and is discharged by emitters in a turbulent flow regime e g drip irrigation however the emitters on moistubes are nanoscale pores that are approximately tens or hundreds of times larger than water molecules the effects of surface tension of water molecules on the outflow mechanism of moistube irrigation are not yet understood it remains unclear whether the hydraulic outflow mechanism complies with the conventional darcy s law therefore there is a need for investigations on moistube discharge and water transfer mechanisms in the moistube and soil matrix system optimization of moistube irrigation scheduling requires estimates of soil water dynamics with evapotranspiration and drainage processes incorporated to reduce deep percolation and ineffective evaporation kanda et al 2020a previous research has documented that the soil water dynamics in mti or subsurface drip irrigation depend on factors such as soil texture initial soil water content working pressure head wph evapotranspiration emitter type and discharge displacement depth of the emitter etc cai et al 2018 elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 kanda et al 2020a nogueira et al 2021 qi et al 2021a 2021b wang et al 2017 understanding the effects of wph on wetting patterns and root water uptake throughout the crop growth helps with the effective use of irrigated water by ensuring that water is supplied to zones where the root system is highly active and at a suitable rate for crop uptake appels and karimi 2021 porous pipes made of elastic and flexible materials e g nanopore materials show variable discharge characteristics when subjected to varying pressures as reported by liang et al 2009 studies has found that similar to other pressurized irrigation technologies the wph of moistube irrigation is also the main driver of discharge and wetting patterns the discharge rate is significantly positively correlated with the wph niu et al 2013 the moistube discharge ranges between 5 8 and 41 5 l m 1 d 1 under a wph from 20 kpa to 100 kpa kanda et al 2020a therefore it could be well envisaged to dynamically adjust the working pressure head of moistubes as required based on crop growth periods and meteorological factors the matching of timely water input and output is achievable there are differences in the discharge characteristics of the emitter in the air and in the soil under the same pressure head increasing wph in the air results in a linear increase in the discharge rate and a decrease in discharge deviation with increased wph in the soil the emitter discharge soil water content and irrigation uniformity increase cai et al 2021 it is of great interest to find that the water discharge rate in the air is much lower than that in the soil and that increasing burial depth results in a lower discharge rate soil matric suction facilitates moistube outflow because the soil instantaneously absorbs skin sweating like droplets from the tube wall thus promoting moistube discharge niu et al 2013 as noted by fan et al 2018a both the wetted soil volume and wetting front distance are positively correlated with the initial water content and wph fan et al 2018a qi et al 2021a numerically simulated the infiltration behaviors of mti and found that a higher operating pressure head appreciably enlarges the water potential gradient between inside and outside the moistube and increases the moistube discharge rate and wetting pattern area qi et al 2021a the wph of subsurface irrigation is also not necessarily set to a positive value e g wang et al 2022 invented a negative pressure irrigation device to regulate soil moisture precisely and continuously by altering the negative pressure to supply a low discharge rate that maintains a desirable wetting pattern wang et al 2022 this study further recommended that a positive pressure head be operated to promptly generate a stable wetting pattern and that a suitable negative pressure be automatically adjusted to satisfy crop water requirements li et al 2017 reported that negative fertigation is capable of supplying water at appropriate times and the moisture content within 0 100 cm of the soil layer is more stable than that under drip fertigation li et al 2017 negative fertigation could save a substantial amount of water compared to drip fertigation for vegetable production there should also be a maximum discharge rate or an upper limit to the wph inside the moistube or a subsurface emitter to avoid back pressure when a predetermined discharge of a subsurface emitter is greater than the soil infiltration capacity the pressure head outside the emitter becomes positive which in return builds up pressure and reduces the source discharge rate lazarovitch et al 2005 by making use of the back pressure phenomenon a possibility of self regulation of noncompensating emitter discharge was proposed for subsurface irrigation according to the interplay between emitter discharge and soil pressure gil et al 2008 for subsurface irrigation with ceramic emitters excessive working pressure might also destroy the soil aggregate structure and severely clog the emitter thus low hydraulic conductivity and a wph ranging between 20 and 50 cm for subsurface emitters are recommended cai et al 2018 a 0 2 m deep subsurface drip tube was suggested to provide moisture for the root zones and to reduce evaporation and deep percolation santos et al 2016 different layers with varying hydraulic properties should also be considered to calculate the water depth and manage irrigation by water balance in summary appropriate adjustment of the working pressure head of the moistube is needed primarily to meet crop water demands at different fertility stages and to promote wue and to avoid soil structure destruction positive pressure built up deep drainage and tube clogging in addition intelligent regulation of working pressure could also be integrated with intelligent irrigation making it inevitable to reveal the soil water dynamics subjected to a variable wph it remains unclear how infiltration behaviors and water diffusion mechanisms respond to variable wph under a newly developed moistube irrigation technology therefore the aim of this study is 1 to investigate how infiltration behaviors and wetting patterns dynamically respond to various scenarios of increasing or decreasing wph 2 to observe how moisture is redistributed within the wetting pattern when subjected to increased or decreased wph and 3 to monitor how the wetting pattern swells or shrinks and to measure how the wetting front centroid deviates the moistube core under variable wphs 2 materials and methods 2 1 laboratory experiments of moistube irrigation laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate wetting front dynamics and flow characteristics subjected to a varying wph the soil used was a clay loam and was classified as hapludalf alfisols table 2 surface samples were collected from the upper 40 cm layer of agricultural fields rice and maize cultivated in rotation in the laboratory of efficient irrigation drainage and agricultural soil water environment in southern china in hohai university nanjing 31 57 n 118 50 e china soils were then sieved through 5 mm apertures air dried and remolded every 10 cm into lysimeters length width height 0 6 m 0 3 m 0 7 m to a bulk density of 1 30 g cm3 the initial volumetric water content of the air dried soil was 5 98 the surface of each repacked layer was roughened to obtain homogeneous hydraulic properties the lysimeters were made of transparent acrylic plates to observe and record wetting front dynamics a third generation moistube fig 1b was chosen as the micro irrigator produced by the shenzhen moistube irrigation co ltd china the experimental equipment comprised a soil lysimeter moistube mariotte bottle height adjustment plate and time domain reflectometer tdr as depicted in fig 2 a 30 cm moistube along the lysimeter width was installed at a soil depth of 20 cm the moistube irrigator was supplied by the mariotte bottle and the water supply head could be artificially adjusted the moistube had an internal diameter of 1 5 cm a thickness of 1 mm and 100 thousand nanopores distributed per cm2 zou et al 2017 dirwai et al 2021 the duration of moistube irrigation was set to 160 h and the working pressure head was instantly adjusted at the 72nd hour the reason why we chose 72nd hour as the adjustment point is that as we experimentally investigated the wetting front distance and cumulative infiltration practically entered a linear growth phase in addition it was reasonable to reset the crop irrigation scheduling with a three day deadline or to meet the water requirements of the crops irrigation could be advanced or delayed by three days in the subtropical or temperate monsoon climate zone such as that in nanjing china the cumulative infiltration and infiltration rate were calculated from the readings of mariotte bottles the wetting front patterns were photographed every 4 h by a digital camera canon 60d and afterward processed by digital image processing and morphological algorithms the volumetric water contents of the soil profile were continuously monitored by tdr model tdr mux mpts produced by the institute of agrophysics polish academy of sciences ia pas throughout the moistube irrigation event sixteen sensors were installed at 15 10 5 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm vertically and 20 15 10 5 5 10 15 and 20 cm horizontally from the moistube under a cartesian coordinate system centered at the moistube fig 2b the sensors were calibrated by equations recommended by the manufacturer and by a series of soils with different moisture statuses the water content data were collected at approximately 0 5 hour intervals during the whole moistube irrigation process the contour maps of the soil water content distribution were plotted using surfer 15 3 307 computer software in windows version to observe how the soil water content changed under regulated working pressure heads 2 2 treatments of varying working pressure heads during moistube irrigation the wph was manually adjusted at approximately the 72nd hour adjustments of some specimens were delayed due to experimental complexities the recommended working pressure head varies depending on soil types soil textures subsurface irrigation methods emitters and vegetation type for instance based on our survey the recommended hydraulic heads of ceramic emitters or porous clay pipes ranged between 0 and 1 2 m cai et al 2018 2022 das gupta et al 2009 moistube irrigation practices suggest a wph ranging between a negative pressure head and 3 0 m dirwai et al 2021 qi et al 2021 the optimum wph should be determined based on evapotranspiration and soil hydraulic properties infiltration characteristics to avoid excess head or pressure deficits nine scenarios of water head treatments were designed i e three treatments of constant working pressure head as control groups 0 1 and 2 m three treatments of water head increase 0 1 m 1 2 m and 0 2 m and three treatments of water head decrease 1 0 m 2 0 m and 2 1 m the numbers of treatments are given in table 3 three replicates were set for each treatment scenarios of wph adjustments are presented in table 4 and fig 3 the reason why we staggered the adjustment time points in different replicates of the same treatment was to rationalize the arrangements of tdr probes 2 3 image processing and parameter calculation pictures of wetting patterns were corrected for geometric distortion wetting pattern images actual size 60 cm 60 cm were cropped and then resized to a resolution of 6000 6000 marked contrast was displayed between the wetting pattern and initially dry soil matrix therefore the images were classified into wetted and dry classes using a supervised classification method which is widely used in water flow analysis fig 2c and d as employed by bargués tobella et al 2014 cai et al 2018 guo et al 2019 hardie et al 2018 parker 2010 wang et al 2018 based on the wetting front binary images the parameters including wetting pattern areas horizontal and vertical distances and propagation velocity of the wetting front were calculated using morphological algorithms fig 2e wang et al 2018a 2018b all image processing and parameter calculation processes were performed in matlab r2018a wetting front patterns and infiltration characteristics were characterized by the following i cumulative infiltration volume i cm2 and infiltration rate q cm2 h 1 per unit width obtained by the readings of the mariotte bottle ii the distance of the wetting front in the horizontal vertical downward and vertical upward directions denoted by x h r z d o w n and z u p cm respectively these three parameters were calculated by measuring the distance from the moistube to the respective wetting front edges using morphological algorithms followed by a conversion from pixel length to actual length iii area of the wetting front a w f cm2 obtained by counting the pixels of the wetting front and converting from pixel area to actual area iv deviation distance from the centroid of the wetting pattern to the moistube δ cm used to evaluate the effects of gravitational potential and water pressure adjustment on the centroid of wetting patterns in variable stages of moistube irrigation v relative deviation of the wetting front centroid to the moistube compared with the vertical wetting front distance δ cm which is expressed as 1 δ δ z u p z d o w n where δ cm is the deviation distance of the wetting front centroid from the moistube and z u p and z d o w n cm are the upward and downward distances of wetting front respectively vi equivalent radius of wetting front r e cm referred to as the radius determined from the wetting front area a w f which can be written as 2 r e a w f π where a w f is the wetting front area introduced above cm2 and π is the circumference ratio approximately taken as 3 14 2 4 semiphysical empirical model and model performance evaluation we proposed a set of physical empirical equations that describe the cumulative infiltration discharge rate and wetting pattern radius versus time based on the green ampt model in a polar coordinate system fig 4 let r 0 be a saturated disk source of a radius outer radius with a moistube working pressure head h p inside then the pressure head outside the tube at point a can be expressed as 3 h 0 h p q 2 π k w ln r 0 d w r 0 where k w is the saturated conductivity of the moistube cm h 1 q is the discharge rate of moistube cm h 1 and d w is the thickness of the moistube cm as previously investigated qi et al 2021a k w is constant and the discharge q is linearly correlated with the pressure head difference between the water head inside and outside the moistube thus we know that the water heads outside the moistube h 0 are positively correlated with those inside the moistube h p according to darcy s law the water infiltration rate into soil outside the tube can be written as 4 i k s h r where i is the infiltration rate per unit width cm h 1 h is the soil water head cm r is the wetting front distance along the polar direction cm and the negative sign indicates that the direction of infiltration is opposite to the water potential gradient according to the green ampt model the difference in the soil water head between points a and b for a given wetting front distance r can be estimated as 5 h δ h h 0 r sin θ s f where r sin θ is the difference in gravitational potential between points a and b s f is the matric suction at the wetting front cm the actual infiltration length from the tube wall to b can be written as 6 r δ r r r 0 therefore the infiltration rate per unit width at point b can be written as 7 i k s h 0 r sin θ s f r r 0 the infiltration flux d q corresponding to an arc length r d θ at the wetting front can be estimated as d q i r d θ and the integration along the circle wetting front of this equation leads to 8 q d q 0 2 π i r d θ 0 2 π r k s h 0 r sin θ s f r r 0 d θ where q is the discharge rate through the moistube cm2 min 1 assuming that r δ then r is deemed to be independent of θ it is worth noting that this is an approximate estimate derivation of eq 8 gives 9 q 2 π r k s h 0 s f r r 0 k s r 2 r r 0 0 2 π sin θ d θ with 0 2 π sin θ d θ 0 eq 9 can be reduced to 10 q 2 π r k s h 0 s f r r 0 based on the water balance principle the relationship between the cumulative infiltration volume i and equivalent wetting front radius r e was obtained 11 i π r e 2 π r 0 2 θ s θ i according to the cosine theorem we have 12 r e 2 r 2 δ 2 2 r δ sin θ based on the relation between the infiltration flux q through the wetting front and the cumulative infiltration volume i we can obtain 13 q d i d t substituting eqs 10 11 and 12 into eq 13 we have 14 d π r 2 δ 2 2 r δ sin θ r 0 2 θ s θ i d t 2 π r k s h 0 s f r r 0 r and δ are functions of infiltration time t and the derivation of eq 14 yields 15 r d r d t δ d δ d t δ sin θ d r d t r sin θ d δ d t k s h 0 s f θ s θ i r r r 0 assuming that δ t 0 then substituting δ t 0 into eq 15 gives 16 r d r d t k s h 0 s f θ s θ i r r r 0 transformation and integration of eq 16 gives 17 r r 0 2 k s h 0 s f θ s θ i t eqs 11 13 and 17 can be combined to obtain 18 i 2 π k s h 0 s f t 2 π r 0 2 k s θ s θ i h 0 s f t 19 q 2 π k s h 0 s f π r 0 2 k s θ s θ i h 0 s f 1 t practically the volumetric water content θ along the wetting front is not saturated θ s but gradually decreases along the r direction the water head outside the moistube h 0 is also difficult to predict using physical approaches in practice similar to the original green ampt model the proposed model overestimates the hydraulic conductivity of soil k s because the water content within the wetting front did not reach saturation thus k s in eq 17 19 should be replaced by k e in addition k e also varied with time and along the polar direction thus making it more difficult to accurately measure or estimate with this background we transformed the fully physical models eqs 18 and 19 into semiphysical empirical models to describe the infiltration behaviors as follows 20 i α h t β h t 21 q α h β h 2 t 22 r r 0 ξ 1 h t t t c r 0 ξ 2 h t t c t t c where r is the radius of the wetting front cm r 0 is the outer radius of the moistube cm h is the equivalent water head considering the working pressure head and matrix potential cm α β and ξ are the fitting parameters of infiltration behaviors t is the infiltration time h and t c is the time point when the wph was adjusted the model

data will yield nse and r 2 values approaching 1 0 and rmse mae and rsr values approaching 0 performance rating criteria as suggested previously by me et al 2015 n moriasi et al 2007 are given in table 5 3 results 3 1 infiltration characteristics subjected to varying working pressure heads fig 5 shows the cumulative infiltration with time under variable working pressure heads wphs the cumulative infiltration amount changed approximately linearly over time under all treatments this phenomenon differs greatly from other traditional infiltration characteristics e g surface infiltration under a constant pressure head in which the infiltration amount varied exponentially and linearly in the early and later stages respectively the curve of cumulative infiltration rapidly skipped the exponential growth phase as displayed in fig 5 for the treatments with an adjusted wph the cumulative infiltration responded sharply to the increase or decrease in wph the cumulative infiltration exhibited a pattern of two intersecting straight lines with a rigid folding point signifying that we have the flexibility to regulate the infiltration characteristics by instantly adjusting working pressure heads following crop water requirements another interesting finding is that the moistube irrigation pattern might depend faintly on the elapsed infiltration time or initial moisture status when the adjacent area around the moistube was already moistened in fig 5a and b the water content distributions and wetting front patterns corresponding to the adjustment timepoints 72nd 83rd and 92nd and 72nd 90th and 144th hour were different respectively however the cumulative infiltration curves visually displayed a parallel phenomenon under the same wph this phenomenon is also seen when comparing dec 1 0 and dec 2 0 in fig 5d and e respectively in which the segments in the later phases were parallel under a 0 m working head differentiating the cumulative infiltration amount with respect to time yielded the infiltration rate as depicted in fig 6 the figure shows that in the first stage the infiltration rate exhibited a faint decreasing trend with time but this trend seemed insignificant and can be ignored considering the duration of moistube irrigation similar findings in regard to the cumulative infiltration were expected when the wph was adjusted up or down the infiltration rate increased or decreased without any buffering process sharply increased or decreased to an approximately constant value respectively which seemed to be a fixed value under certain wph for instance comparison of dec 1 0 and dec 2 0 indicates that the infiltration rates under the adjusted 0 m working head between the two treatments were practically identical although the initial moisture status of soil at the transition point was different the hypothesis was also confirmed in fig 7 in which the infiltration rate typically corresponded to a fixed value under a certain wph the gray blue and red bars indicate the infiltration rates under wphs of 0 m 1 m and 2 m respectively the data demonstrated that regardless of how and when the wph was adjusted the infiltration rate under a fixed working head was almost constant additionally the infiltration rate was linearly and positively correlated with the wph and was independent of the wph adjustment criteria as depicted in fig 7 m the moistube discharge increased by 3 2 times or 7 6 times when the wph was adjusted from 0 m to 1 m or 2 m respectively we proposed a semiphysical empirical model that uses the equivalent water head h and infiltration time t to evaluate the moistube discharge rate under varying wphs see the bold solid line in fig 6 according to the rsr criteria acceptable agreement between the modeled and measured data was confirmed table 6 however the r 2 and nse criteria gave less satisfactory evaluation results due to the marked scattering of data from the three replicates the data of cumulative infiltration vs time exhibited more obvious regularity in contrast obvious fluctuations and variance were found in the infiltration rate for treatments inc 1 2 80 h and dec 2 1 80 h this resulted from the following causes 1 differences in the hydraulic conductivity of the moistube gave rise to variance in infiltration curves among replicates 2 soil heterogeneity led to value discontinuity in the infiltration rate with respect to time considering that the moistube discharge was small and 3 short time intervals could also cause distinct errors in infiltration rates these reasons magnify the deviation between the modeled and observed data nevertheless our model provided a good trend of how the infiltration rate varied under adjusted wphs the mechanisms of the interplay among wph time and infiltration rate should be physically enhanced in regard to the parameters that were difficult to measure 3 2 wetting front patterns and moisture distribution under varying pressure heads infiltration from the moistube into initially dry soils displayed a clear wetting front and an abrupt interface separating the moistened and yet dry zones the vicinity of the wetting front was visually a line at which the gradient of water content was greatest along the direction of infiltration the dynamic wet patterns of three replicates exhibited similar characteristics and two typical specimens of the three replicates were analyzed fig 8 shows the evolution of wetting pattern area and wetting front distances in both the vertical and horizontal directions with time the wetting pattern of moistube irrigation was approximately elliptical the wetting front in both the vertical and horizontal directions advanced faster in the early phases because of the large capillarity pressure gradients between the moistube and wetting fronts the vertical and horizontal wetting front then decelerated as the cumulative infiltration increased and tended toward a stabilization in which the wetting front distance was linearly correlated with time as gravity forces began to dominate the wetting patterns also responded dramatically to an increase or decrease in wph once the wph was increased stabilization was disturbed and entered a new normal in which the wetting front also accelerated and then advanced at a constant velocity however when the wph decreased from 2 m to 1 m or 0 m the wetting front directly and distinctly started to move forward at a smaller uniform velocity without any buffering process typically the upward distance of the wetting front was smaller than that of the downward wetting front under gravitational effects this was marked in our experiments an abnormal phenomenon exhibited in our experiments was that the horizontal distance of wetting front was greater than the vertical distance this could probably be attributed to the excessive longitudinal compression of soil during backfilling this gave rise to a non uniformity of hydraulic parameters and a reduction in the hydraulic conductivity in the vertical direction than that in the horizontal direction this abnormal phenomenon was usually observed in infiltration experiments in remolded soil columns as was also observed by naglič et al 2014 shiri et al 2020 as shown in the second and fourth columns in fig 8 the trends in wetting front advancing velocity were approximately the same as the infiltration rate but distributed in a slightly scattered way which could be explained by the localized heterogeneity of soils and the inevitable calculation errors from the digital image processing methods this scattering behavior was not displayed in the infiltration rate because it was more of a macroscopic performance of moisture transport and wetting front evolution the wetting pattern area was converted into the equivalent radius and then modeled with respect to infiltration time using eq 17 the observed and modeled results are plotted in fig 9 the results show that our model gave excellent approximations of the equivalent wetting front distance with r 2 and nse all greater values than 0 99 and rsr values approaching 0 table 7 and fig 9 this suggests that the advance distances of the wetting front before and after the adjustment were both consistent accord with the kostiakov type equation in which the gravitational effects could be counterbalanced with increases in wph the vertex of the parabola moved more towards the right displaying increased curvature at the adjustment point in contrast a decreasing wph resulted in a leftward movement of the vertex with decreasing curvature at the adjustment point one can make full use of the characteristics of the wetting front advance when designing moistube irrigation scheduling and tube burial depth typically the distance of the wetting front in different directions conformed to the same law and was ranked in the following order the distance of the downward wetting front horizontal wetting front upward wetting front the parallel contour of the advancing wetting front or the isobar of pore pressure or water content approximated the form of concentric circles however the centroid of the wetting front is closely correlated with soil textures the more clayey the soil texture was the smaller the difference in the distance of the wetting front in the downward horizontal and upward directions less deviation between the wetting pattern center and the moistube δ was found this phenomenon in clayey soils can be explained by less influence from gravity and more influence from of the capillary effects in this study we revealed how the centroid of the wetting front deviated from the moistube center under varying wphs during the moistube irrigation process in fig 10 the absolute and relative deviation to the vertical wetting front distance is given definitions and equations are provided in section 2 3 the reason for choosing relative deviation is that the swelling process of the wetting pattern differed greatly under different regulation modes of wph it is more reasonable to use relative deviation across different treatments in addition the deviation δ is not only closely related to the size of the wetting pattern but also to the levels of moisture content within the wetting pattern this is because as we presume the level of water content determines the weighing of the capillarity potential gradient in dominating water transport compared with gravitational effects we speculate that initially greater working pressure heads resulted in higher water contents thus enlarging the deviation distance between the wetting pattern core and the moistube we compared the deviations under different working pressure heads it was found that the absolute and relative deviation values increased with increasing wph in the early phase when the wetting front was relatively small the deviation value fluctuated around the moistube center showing no significant deviation due to the dominating capillary forces when the wph was increased the deviation δ increased as infiltration proceeded and no upper limit values were observed gravity gradually played a dominant role in the moistube infiltration process as the wetting front expanded it is interesting to find that when wph decreased the absolute deviation continued to rise with at a gentler trend however the relative deviation gradually stabilized or even declined as shown in fig 10 h j and l under a working pressure of 2 m the growth rate of the relative deviation was greater than the absolute deviation and the opposite phenomenon occurred when the working pressure decreased we presume that the entire wetting pattern descended gradually accompanied by a slight expansion the higher water content supplied by the preliminary 2 m water head began to redistribute and the expansion velocity decreased due to the decrease in the wph hence the relative deviation δ exhibited a decreasing trend overall the deviation increased when raising the working pressure and tended to stabilize when the working head was lowered these results provide the basis for designing the moistube burial depth under a variable working pressure head when moistube irrigation is integrated with intelligent irrigation fig 11 shows the evolution of volumetric water content with time for eight monitored depths i e 5 10 15 20 5 10 15 20 and 25 cm vertically from the moistube we also manually measured the soil water content swc around the moistube the swc results demonstrated that under moistube irrigation the swc within the wetting pattern was maintained at 30 43 and was not saturated at the three working pressure heads this created a suitable hydropneumatic environment for crop moisture and oxygen however it remains to be investigated whether it was capable of providing sufficient moisture to protect against drought stress once evapotranspiration was higher than normal as shown in fig 11 the water contents of the nine observation points ranked in descending order as follows 25 cm 20 cm 20 cm 15 cm 15 cm 10 cm 10 cm 5 cm 5 cm due to gravity effects the upward and downward soil water distribution could be assumed to be an intersection of two linear functions as proposed previously mao et al 2016 based on the green ampt model for the treatments of pressure head increase inc the swc with respect to time exhibited a rapid increase and then an approximate stabilization or an extremely slow increase in the early phase for instance the stabilized water contents at z 5 cm for 0 1 and 2 m working pressure heads were approximately 30 37 and 43 respectively once the wph was raised the water content at each observation point abruptly increased and then reached another stabilization the second stabilized water content agreed well with that under the same working pressure head for instance at z 5 cm the second steady state of water content was 37 and 43 under 1 m and 2 m working pressure heads respectively for the treatments of pressure head decrease dec the evolution of water content with time responded distinctly from that of inc in the early phase the water content showed a rapid increase followed by approximate stabilization once the water head decreased several specimens showed a slightly decreasing trend in water content e g fig 11 g i and j which could be neglected compared to the maximum water content the water contents of the other specimens of dec remained basically unchanged for the observation points whose water contents had reached a state of stabilization regulating soil water content swc is achievable by adjusting wph fig 12 illustrates the swc under increasing or decreasing wph fig 13 displays the variations in swc distribution along the z axis at different observation timepoints the thin solid black and red lines are the curves of swc before and after wph adjustment respectively the thick solid blue line marks the swc distribution at the adjustment point it is worth noting that the black and red lines we chose are representative random swc distributions the time interval between each two swc distribution lines was not fixed but randomly and rationally selected due to the limited number of tdr probes which did not allow for continuous observation for the inc treatments the swc distribution evolved slowly in the shape of a sarciniform under an initially low pressure head an increase in the working pressure head resulted in rapid growth followed by a redistribution of swc for the dec treatments the swc distribution rapidly progressed and then redistributed to a high swc state when the wph decreased a slight but not marked increase in swc was observed the time interval between the bunching lines was relatively random and ranged between 1 and 4 h nevertheless the variation in swc could also help reveal the mechanism of how the swc responded to the increase or decrease in the working pressure head in summary the swc progressed rapidly and redistributed after the working head increased as one could expect however there was a slight change or even a reverse distribution in the swc when the pressure head decreased the moisture diffused from high to low swc areas and this diffusion rate was greater than the discharge rate supplied by the lower wph thus causing a slight but negligible drop in the swc around the moistube 4 discussion 4 1 flow characteristics under variable working pressure heads moistubes are polymer semipermeable membranes in which the supplied water is driven by the working pressure head wph inside the tube and the soil suction outside the tube dirwai et al 2021 water and fertilizer solutions are transported out of the nanopores similar to skin sweating and permeate to the crop root zones as precisely adapted to evapotranspiration to supply moisture and nutrients our findings indicated that the working pressure head wph was the dominant factor that controlled the flow rate of moistube irrigation the infiltration rate was linearly correlated with the wph separately considering the flow mechanisms through the moistube the moistube wall could be treated as a porous medium e g a heavy clay soil that remained saturated throughout the infiltration process and had a constant saturated hydraulic conductivity qi et al 2021a the infiltration problem through the moistube wall was reduced to darcy s flow therefore the infiltration process in moistube irrigation is considered to comprise of two phases through two porous media i e a nanopore porous medium with lower hydraulic conductivity and soil porous medium with higher hydraulic conductivity we assume that the infiltration behaviors in moistube irrigation do not fall outside the scope of darcy s law when analyzing a darcy richards infiltration problem boundary conditions and soil diffusion capacity are indispensable prerequisites for revealing soil water dynamics and infiltration behaviors this also applies to moistube irrigation in which the hydraulic mechanism has not been clearly characterized to date regarding the nanotube given that the moistube was treated as a permanent porous medium and the surrounding soil was a porous medium with a permanent particle aggregate skeleton the working conditions of moistube irrigation mainly depended on the working pressure head initial water content and tube burial depth the water potential gradient caused by the internal and external water head became a dominant factor driving water movement previous studies have shown that the infiltration rate of moistubes exposed to the atmosphere is much lower than that of the moistubes buried in soil qi et al 2021a this also proved that the soil matric suction facilitated water flow out of the moistube by absorbing the sweat like moisture and increasing the water potential gradient inside and outside the tube niu et al 2013 the discharge rate of the moistube was proportional to the working pressure head inside when the water potential outside exposed to the atmosphere was basically unchanged qi et al 2021a when the wph increased or decreased the cumulative infiltration amount or infiltration rate responded accordingly and sharply this could be interpreted by the extremely low emitter discharge out of the moistube generally the infiltration rate in variably saturated soils is dominated jointly by the output capacity of the water source at the boundary e g moistube discharge and the maximum water diffusion capacity or infiltration capacity around the tube if the emitter discharge is less than the maximum infiltration capacity of the soil the moisture rapidly diffuses thus leaving the soil around the moistube unsaturated this was also manifested in the moisture distribution under the maximum wph i e the 2 m treatment as reported by provenzano 2007 if the emitter discharge is greater than the maximum soil infiltration capacity a positive pressure head is built up surrounding the emitter resulting in a decrease in the emitter discharge provenzano 2007 this phenomenon is typically referred to as back pressure in the moistube irrigation the outlet emitter moistube was a nanotube material in which the working pressure head was remarkably dissipated by the dense nanopores the radial soil diffusion rate around the wetting front was much greater than the discharge capacity of the moistube since the initial water content was sufficiently low therefore the infiltration rate in our case depends mainly on the discharge capacity of the moistube this explains the abrupt increase or decrease in the infiltration rate under instant adjustments of moistube wph the moistube had not yet reached the back pressure state nevertheless it remains unresolved whether there would be a buildup of a positive water head when the working pressure head inside the moistube is sufficiently large or when the soil is heavily clayey or sufficiently wet in addition it needs to be further addressed whether the flow in the nanotube materials e g moistube still conforms with darcy s law given that the water conducting materials are made of nanopores that have a slightly larger pore scale than water molecules 4 2 moisture redistribution subjected to increase or decrease in working pressure head moistube irrigation continuously supplies moisture to root zones and adapts to crop water requirements thereby avoiding sudden changes in soil moisture that impair crop growth maintaining a constantly satisfactory moisture fertilizer environment can facilitate maize growth and yields particularly during the flowering and pollination stages cai et al 2022 during the critical period of crop water demand it is necessary to artificially adjust the working pressure heads to proactively regulate the moisture content this can be achieved based on our experimental results when moistube irrigation began the soil water content swc at the observation points rapidly tended to stabilization in which swc remained generally stable the swc did not reach saturation and declined along the radial direction of infiltration the negative pressure regimes were quasi steady because the water was emitted from the moistube spontaneously and absorbed continuously into the soil the moistube discharge rate under the three wphs was much less than the infiltration capacity along the wetting front the infiltration problem from the moistube outside can be viewed as a flux dominated or water supply dominated infiltration model the boundary around the moistube can be treated as a neumann boundary condition under a prescribed discharge rate the water content along the radial direction increased slowly within an unsaturated range after a certain period when the wph was raised the boundary condition changed but still represented the second type of boundary condition neumann boundary the water content rose sharply and entered another stabilization state with a higher water content that still did not reach saturation when the wph was indefinitely increased the discharge rate began to exceed the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the soil surrounding the moistube the infiltration was no longer dominated by the wph due to the development of the back pressure lazarovitch et al 2005 the water content along the radial direction reached saturation and the water transfer depended on the soil infiltration capacity the backup pressure case should be strictly avoided because of the high probability of aggregate dispersion and emitter clogging the sudden reduction in the wph caused a decrease in the moistube discharge rate the antecedent high water content began to diffuse because the changed discharge rate could not sufficiently complement the diffusion along the wetting front direction thus resulting in a slight reduction in the soil water content around the moistube however the water content near the wetting front was not affected and showed a normal increasing trend moistubes are essentially a porous medium that could be deemed to be a heavy clay with extremely fine pores very similar to the ceramic emitter reported by cai et al 2018 the water flow through the moistube is considered to be darcy flow type laminar flow as previously reported by qi et al 2021a the moistube discharge rate infiltration behaviors and wetting front advance could be simulated well by hydrus 2d in this numerical simulation the moistube and the surrounding soil were treated as uniform porous medium that exhibited darcy richards flow regimes with a couple of separate hydraulic parameters kacimov and obnosov 2017 the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the moistube was set according to the preliminarily measured hydraulic conductivity during the infiltration process the moistube was basically saturated the moisture escaping from the moistube was rapidly absorbed by the surrounding soil and conducted to the low potential areas the infiltration problem under increased or decreased water heads can be simplified into a layered soil infiltration problem and solved by creating a double ring soil matrix with outer clay loam and inner extremely heavy clay our attempt to regulate soil water content by adjusting working pressure heads is achievable the efficacy of adjusting volumetric water content into desired levels as adapted to crop needs appears different in increasing or decreasing wph the efficacy of increasing wph on swc is much more satisfactory than that of decreasing wph in production practice the moistube irrigation working conditions and wetting front patterns need to be better adapted to closely match crop needs to achieve water saving irrigation and reduce deep seepage previous studies have mainly focused on the effects of wph and tube burial depth on moistube wetting patterns and crop yield merely based on indoor experiments and numerical simulations xu et al 2021 first reported the connections of the wetting pattern of moistube irrigation with crop root characteristics and distribution the depth width and morphology of the root system of cash crops were summarized with suitable swc upper and lower limits in our study the feasibility of regulating the wetting front pattern and moisture content was validated how to satisfy the physiological water demands root water uptake and crop transpiration by simultaneously controlling the wph and maintaining the volumetric water balance remains to be further addressed 4 3 wetting pattern centroid deviating from the moistube as discussed above the moistube is a semipermeable membrane tube with a low discharge rate around which a positive pressure head typically does not form and the soil is unsaturated thus the water transport around the moistube is driven by gravity and capillarity the advance distance of the wetting front follows the descending order downward wetting front horizontal wetting front upward wetting front which is consistent with previous results conducted by elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 fan et al 2018b this results from the gravitational effect that further leads to a difference in the water potential gradient in the following descending order downward horizontal and upward this phenomenon can be well and simply analyzed by applying the traditional green ampt ga model in the three directions to reveal which direction the wetting front moves farthest let us set up a scenario in which the wetting front along three directions downward horizontal and upward directions is identical then what remains to be done is to determine the maximum infiltration rate along the three directions based on the green ampt model the infiltration rate for the same wetting front distance z f along three directions can be written as i d o w n k e d o w n s f s t u b e z f z f i h o r k e h o r s f s t u b e z f and i u p k e u p s f s t u b e z f z f where i d o w n i h o r and i u p are the estimated downward horizontal and upward infiltration rates using the traditional ga model respectively s t u b e and s f are the soil matric suction both positive at the moistube and wetting front respectively k e is the effective hydraulic conductivity that is positively related to the effective saturation s e as experimentally investigated the water content in the upward direction is minimal and that in the downward direction is maximal making the effective hydraulic conductivity k e rank in the descending order k e d o w n k e h o r and k e u p it should be noted that the conventional ga model that describes wetting front distance and infiltration time is an implicit equation here we use the infiltration rate at the same wetting front distance to predict the increasing trend of the wetting front after computation it is clear that i d o w n i h o r i u p thus the scenario in which the wetting front along the three directions was equivalent was broken and the downward wetting front reached maximum this scenario clearly and concisely corroborates our experimental results as reported by elmaloglou and diamantopoulos 2009 this phenomenon mentioned above was more evident in coarser soils than in finer soils because of the greater relative gravitational effects in coarser soils regardless of the infiltration type the water infiltration process is essentially water redistribution driven by gravitational and capillary potentials the main difference is that gravity and capillarity forces dominate in different phases of infiltration in the vertical direction the capillarity effect is more significant in diffusing water in the initial phase while the gravity effect plays a great role in the mid to late phases according to the contributions of capillarity and gravity this results in a greater deviation of the wetting pattern centroid from the moistube in the later infiltration process when we analyze this deviation phenomenon following the physical descriptions of richards equation the potential gradient of gravity remains constant at 1 0 while the potential gradient of capillarity rapidly decreases from infinity to 0 this theoretically reveals the change of weighing between gravity and capillarity effects this can better explain the offset of the wetting pattern centroid from moistube that is the greater the gravity effect is the larger the deviation δ will become at different working pressure heads the deviation δ might also show different values for the same size wetting pattern because of the different moisture content within the wetting front a higher moisture content of the wetting pattern leads to larger deviations of δ based on the above discussion we can conclude that a more clayey soil typically results in a slower infiltration rate and less deviation of the wetting pattern centroid from moistube a higher water content within the wetting pattern leads to greater deviation of the wetting pattern centroid from the moistube this conclusion provides a basis for designing the moistube burial depth 5 conclusions moistube discharge wetting front morphology and moisture distribution can be regulated by adjusting the working pressure heads wphs the cumulative infiltration with time responded rapidly to the wph increase or decrease exhibiting a pattern of two intersecting lines without buffering on the folding point when the wph was increased or decreased the infiltration rate increased or decreased without any buffering process to values that linearly correlated with the wph the wetting front deviated from the original advance trend and rapidly accelerated or decelerated in response to increased or decreased wph we proposed a semiphysical empirical model that describes the discharge rate infiltration volume and wetting front advance of moistube irrigation with time this model was fairly useful in predicting the infiltration behaviors of moistube irrigation under regulated wph gravity affected the water potential gradient along different infiltration directions thus causing the wetting pattern centroid to deviate from the moistube the deviation increased as the wph increased because of the progressive domination of gravitational effects swc remained unsaturated throughout moistube irrigation creating a suitable hydropneumatic environment for crop growth swc tended stabilization under a certain wph after a certain period and the stabilization was disturbed and entered another state that exhibited higher or lower moisture distribution when the wph was raised or reduced these findings imply that increasing wph markedly facilitated soil water redistribution and wetting front morphology while the effects of wph decrease on wetting pattern advance were not significant artificial adjustment of the wph can effectively regulate the moistube discharge wetting patterns and moisture distribution under moistube irrigation to reduce deep percolation wph is recommended to be lowered to avoid rapid expansion of the wetting pattern during the critical period of crop water requirement a positive high wph could be applied to generate an initially sufficient wetting pattern followed by decreasing wph to an appropriate water head as the crop requires accordingly it is also feasible to integrate these mechanisms into intelligent irrigation with moistube irrigation and enable moistube supplementation to synchronously meet crop water requirements declaration of competing interest we declare that they have no known

8988,the water energy food society wefs nexus is profiled for sustainable development the wefs nexus exhibits strong uncertainty owing to the stochasticity of model structure and water availability uncertainty under climate change and human activities the wefs nexus remains highly risky as the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus under the regulation of water resources allocation has rarely been investigated in this study white gaussian noises were integrated into a system dynamic model for the wefs nexus simulation transforming the nexus from deterministic to stochastic based on a monte carlo simulation of the stochastic wefs nexus with water availability uncertainty the copula function was applied to evaluate the joint distributions between water availability and water shortage rates in the upstream and downstream zones to investigate the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation were analyzed by setting different water resources allocation schemes the proposed approach was applied to the mid lower reaches of hanjiang river basin in china as a case study the results indicate that an effective water resources allocation scheme can ensure water supply and diminish the impacts of water availability uncertainty on water supply through reservoir operation the annual average water supply rate increased from 84 74 to 93 45 and the standard deviation decreased from 3 37 to 1 78 the high level environmental awareness evoked by water or food shortages decreased significantly with smaller uncertainty the co evolution of the wefs was ensured through its nexus water storage capacity was the vital factor to regulate the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the impacts of upstream water availability uncertainty were efficiently regulated via reservoir operation for the zones with sufficient water storage capacity water supply was ensured and there was no significant response of the wefs through its nexus to different water resources allocation schemes if there was few water storage capacity in a zone the water supply was remarkably influenced by the water availability uncertainty in the upstream zone the water supply was difficult to ensure and was sensitive to different water resources allocation schemes the environmental awareness evoked by water or food shortages increased the environmental awareness feedback under the impacts of the noises increased water demand uncertainty by altering the socioeconomic expansion further increased wefs uncertainty through its nexus particularly when water availability was much smaller than water demand the proposed approach can help quantify the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus and contribute to the sustainable development of the wefs nexus keywords water energy food society nexus uncertainty propagation water resources allocation copula function data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water energy and food are the fundamental human resources bilgen 2014 vörösmarty et al 2000 west et al 2014 the interconnections across the water energy and food systems are increasingly tight and thus can be profiled as the water energy food wef nexus to increase resource use benefits cai et al 2018 d odorico et al 2018 hoff 2011 huntington et al 2021 zeng et al 2019a human sensitivity has been integrated into the wef nexus to take the physical and social processes in the nexus simultaneously and the wef nexus has been expanded into the water energy food society wefs nexus for the sustainable development di baldassarre et al 2019 fuchs et al 2017 sivapalan et al 2012 zeng et al 2022 the system dynamic model has been widely applied to mimic the co evolution of the nexus owing to its flexibility in describing the dynamics within an integrated system feng et al 2016 simonovic 2002 however modeling the wefs nexus exhibits significant uncertainties owing to deficiencies in the model structure and the input uncertainties deficiencies in the model structure mainly arises from a lack of knowledge in representing the real life process of the wefs nexus numerous studies have applied deterministic system dynamic model based on coupled ordinary differential equations to simulate the dynamics of the nexus feng et al 2016 li et al 2019 wu et al 2022 the deterministic model revealed the interactions among variables of the wefs nexus and further helped to investigate the co evolution of the nexus stochasticity underlies the key process of model structure of the wefs nexus simulation guerra et al 2021 shoemaker et al 2020 vellend et al 2014 and can lead to remarkable variability in the state variables of the nexus however the deterministic model is often incapable of identifying the stochasticity in its model structure of the wefs nexus simulation and ignores the risk of its results challenging the sustainable development goals the stochasticity of the nexus was typically simulated by using noises method chen et al 2021 feng et al 2019 guttal and jayaprakash 2007 for example an et al 2021 employed the noises method to ordinary differential equations for the dynamics of the water supply power generation and environmental awareness wpe transforming the wpe nexus simulation from deterministic to stochastic the probability density function pdf of the state variable was estimated from the stochastic wpe nexus simulation which provided more information for risk management than a deterministic series from the deterministic wpe nexus simulation therefore the noises method can effectively investigate the stochasticity of the wefs nexus and further contribute to the risk management of the wefs nexus to achieve sustainable development goals water availability is one of the primary inputs to the wefs nexus simulation owing to the impacts of climate change and human activities the water availability uncertainty is expanding her et al 2019 muller schmied et al 2014 vetter et al 2017 and an increase in the risk of water supply through the wefs nexus is also evident govindan and al ansari 2019 ji et al 2020 ma et al 2020 zeng et al 2019b the effects of water availability uncertainties on the nexus are described only as a whole basin which cannot express the uncertainty propagation within the basin especially from upstream to downstream via hydrologic connections moges et al 2020 silva et al 2018 zhang and shao 2018 thus the risks of water shortage may propagate from upstream to downstream adaptive measures to ensure water supply should thereby consider the water availability uncertainties not only from the local area but also from the upstream areas as the joint distributions of hydrologic variables have often been adopted to express the water availability uncertainty renard 2011 serinaldi 2013 the copula function has been used as a hydrologic frequency analysis method to describe water availability uncertainty by binding multiple independent random variables into joint distributions chen et al 2013 karmakar and simonovic 2009 nelsen 2006 therefore the water availability uncertainty propagation from upstream to downstream can be assessed by the copula function the water supply assurance strategy often results from a water resources allocation model that takes the impacts of the water availability uncertainty through reservoir operation castelletti et al 2010 chen et al 2016 he et al 2022 liu et al 2010 zeng et al 2017 numerous studies took the water availability uncertainty following the historical natural water flow whereas the impacts of reservoir operation on the water availability uncertainty were overlooked or significantly simplified the risks of the water supply and even of wefs might be overestimated or underestimated water resources allocation simultaneously takes the reservoir operation and the hydrologic connections into account liu et al 2018 pedro monzonis et al 2015 zeng et al 2021 incorporating a water resources allocation model into wefs simulation can improve the assessment of the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus our study aims to quantitatively assess the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the framework for developing the stochastic wefs nexus simulation with water availability uncertainty and assessing the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus section 3 applies the framework to the mid lower reaches of hanjiang river basin in china section 4 presents the co evolution results of the stochastic wefs nexus simulation with water availability uncertainty and discusses the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus section 5 concludes the study 2 method the simulation of the interactions between water energy food and society systems is based on the deterministic dynamic model of the wefs nexus proposed by zeng et al 2022 the wefs nexus model is transformed from deterministic to stochastic through adding the white gaussian noises to the ordinary differential equations to express the model structure uncertainty of the wefs nexus simulation to determine the impacts of the water availability uncertainty on the stochastic wefs nexus simulation the pdf of the water availability within basin is estimated by frequency analysis method discrete water availability samples are generated by the monte carlo method through its pdf as water shortage is outputted from the stochastic wefs nexus simulation with the inputs of the discrete water availability discrete water shortage rates are defined by the ratios of water shortage to demand the pdf of the water shortage rate is then determined by fitting the sample data thus joint distributions of the water availability and water shortage rates can be obtained by copula function through connecting their marginal distributions the joint distribution functions can quantify the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus that are the uncertainties of water availability from upstream to downstream as different water resources allocation schemes are inputted into the wefs nexus simulation the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus can be studied by the joint distribution functions the framework is illustrated as fig 1 2 1 deterministic dynamic wefs nexus model to investigate the interactions between water energy food and society systems zeng et al 2022 developed a deterministic system dynamic model expanding the wef nexus into the wefs nexus the interactive river aquifer simulation iras water resources allocation model loucks 2002 zeng et al 2021 was integrated into the wefs nexus model to quantify the impacts of water resources allocation on the co evolution of the wefs nexus the wefs nexus comprises four modules water system energy system food system and society system modules in the water system module the water demand is firstly projected based on socioeconomic factors the water demand and water availability are then inputted into the iras model to simulate water resources allocation including the water release from reservoir based on fig 2 and eqs 1 7 and the water shortage experienced by water users by eqs 8 9 the water supply and agricultural water shortage rates outputted from the water system module are then inputted into energy and food system modules respectively to determine the energy and food shortages the water energy and food shortage rates are taken as the inputs of the society system module to determine the shortage awareness of water energy and food and further the environmental awareness once the environmental awareness exceeds its critical value the environmental awareness feedback to constrain the socioeconomic factors in the water system module will be triggered to alleviate the stress on water energy and food supplies further details can be retrieved from

dynamic wefs nexus model as white gaussian noise is popular in stochastic simulation owing to its effectiveness in capturing the randomness of state variables meng et al 2020 schmogrow et al 2012 xiao et al 2021 it has been employed to simulate the stochasticity of the wefs nexus specifically the white gaussian noises are incorporated into the seven primary governing equations i e referring to the dynamics of population gdp crop area water use quota energy use quota crop yield and environmental awareness respectively to illustrate the uncertainties of the model structure of the wefs nexus simulation as presented by eqs 10 16 the developed wefs nexus simulation was transformed from deterministic into stochastic 10 d n t r p t n t d t t s p n t d w p 11 d g t r g t g t d t t s g g t d w

for the water availability uncertainties monte carlo sampling has been widely used to analyze the impacts of uncertain inputs or parameters of hydrological model on runoff jeremiah et al 2011 knighton et al 2014 as runoff determines water availability the water availability uncertainty can be analyzed by the monte carlo sampling the pdf of a hydrologic variable including water availability is often described by the pearson type ⅲ p ⅲ distribution according to the recommendation in the specification for hydrologic computation of water resources and hydropower projects in china the parameters of p ⅲ distribution shown as eq 17 are estimated by minimizing the difference between the p ⅲ distribution and the empirical distribution from the historical records of water availability 17 f x β α γ α x a 0 α 1 exp β x a 0 α 0 x a 0 where α β and a 0 are the shape scale and location parameters respectively the difference between empirical and the p ⅲ distributions is quantified by the root mean square error rmse as shown in eq 18 18 r m s e 1 n q 1 n e q 2 where n is the sample size and e q is the q th differences of the sample the maximum likelihood estimation is used to minimize the rmse then the kolmogorov smimov k s is adopted as a goodness of fit test for the optimal p ⅲ distribution as a hypothesis testing if the hypothesis testing with a 95 confidence interval is satisfied the optimal distribution of water availability is acceptable for the monte carlo sampling of the stochastic wefs nexus the samples of the state variables can be obtained from the stochastic wefs nexus simulation results to quantify the uncertainty of the state variables of the wefs nexus three indices that are the annual average value x standard deviation σ and coefficient of variation cv were adopted as shown in eqs 19 20 and 21 19 x 1 n q 1 n x q 20 σ 1 n q 1 n x q x 2 21 c v σ x where x q is the q th individual in the sample of the state variable and n is the sample size 2 4 uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the samples of the state variables of the wefs nexus can be obtained from the stochastic wefs nexus simulation inputted by the samples of water availability as the stochastic wefs nexus is nonlinear owing to the reservoir operation and heterogenetic input e g water availability and water demand the distributions of the output of the stochastic wefs nexus e g water shortage rate might not be the same as that of the inputs i e the p ⅲ distribution the normal lognormal exponential gamma weibull and generalized extreme value distributions were also tested to fit the distribution of water shortage rate to investigate the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the joint distributions of water availability and water shortage rates can be used to describe the uncertainty propagation the copula function can link multiple independent variables into a multivariate distribution by effectively capturing system dependence and has been extensively applied to multivariate uncertainty analysis of complex systems nelsen 2006 yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b it can be implemented to obtain the joint distributions after determining the distributions of water availability and water shortage rate as their marginal distributions according to the sklar s theorem in eq 22 22 f x y c u v where f is a joint distribution c denotes a copula function u and v denote the cumulative density functions of the variables x and y according to their marginal distribution functions respectively the archimedean copula comprising the gumbel hougaard clayton and frank copulas gaussian copula and student copula also named t copula is easily constructed and can effectively capture extensive dependence structures with different desirable properties in hydrologic analysis the copulas above are adopted here to construct the joint distributions of water availability and water shortage rate to describe the uncertainties propagation in the wefs nexus based on the joint distributions constructed by the copula function it is easy to determine the cumulative density functions of water shortage rates in the upstream and downstream operational zones under varied water availability conditions of the upstream operational zones the propagation of water availability uncertainty within the wefs nexus or from upstream to downstream can be investigated through their conditional distribution functions the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus are then assessed through inputting different water resources allocation schemes 3 case study 3 1 study area the hanjiang river is the largest tributary of the changjiang river the mid lower basin of hanjiang river basin mlhrb covers 63 800 km2 shown in fig 3 the danjiangkou reservoir the water source of the middle route of the south north water transfer project in china is located at the upper boundary of mlhrb the water availability in the mlhrb is thereby significantly affected by the reservoir operation of the water transfer project the energy consumption in the mlhrb is considerable due to the large population and industry as agriculture in the mlhrb is developed the mlhrb is taken as one of the nine major commodity grain bases in china the interconnections across water energy food and society systems in the mlhrb are intensifying due to socioeconomic development with fast urbanization the conflicts between the increasing the demands of water energy and food and their supply capacities are aggravating which has led to rising social concerns about resources shortages the resources management strategy for water energy and food based on the wefs nexus is desirable to increase resource use efficiencies and benefits in production and consumption in the mlhrb however under the impacts of human activities and climate change the water availability in the mlhrb exhibits strong uncertainty liu et al 2018 zeng et al 2021 the water availability uncertainty can challenge the water energy and food safeties in local area through the wefs nexus and may further propagate to downstream areas based on hydrologic connections the downstream water energy and food systems thus may be altered therefore the mlhrb is taken as the study area to investigate the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus twenty eight operational zones were sketched out by the superimposition of administrative units and sub basins to maintain consistent socioeconomic and hydrological data in the operational zones five types of water users i e municipal domesticity rural domesticity industry agricultural and in stream ecology water users were taken in each operational zone resulting in 140 water users in the water resources allocation model seventeen medium and large size reservoirs i e the total storage is more than 10 million m3 and two water transfer projects were taken to regulate water availability in water resource allocation the storage of all 17 reservoirs was 37 3 billion m3 the operational zones reservoirs and water transfer projects within the water system in the mlhrb were sketched as shown in fig 4 3 2 data sources the wefs nexus simulation was mainly driven by the hydrological and socioeconomic data the monthly water availability data of each operational zone from 1956 to 2016 were obtained from the changjiang water resources commission cwrc 2016 the characteristics of the 17 reservoirs were retrieved from the hubei provincial department of water resources hpdwr 2014 and were listed in tables s1 the socioeconomic data from 2010 to 2019 were collected from the yearbooks of hubei province including the annual population gdp crop area water use quota energy use quota and crop yield which were available at the statistical database of chinese economic and social development http data cnki net notably the agricultural water use quota is related to the precipitation frequency four typical exceedance frequencies i e p 50 75 90 and 95 are related to the wet normal dry extreme dry years respectively were estimated based on the frequency analysis method to predict the agricultural water demand series these historical data were further inputted into the wefs nexus model to predict the co evolution of the wefs nexus during 2010 2070 table 1 3 3 scenarios with water resources allocation schemes combining the water availability and water resources allocation schemes seven scenarios were set for the uncertainty analysis of the wefs nexus as listed in table 2 scenario ⅰ was set as the reference one its water resources allocation scheme and the calibrated parameters for the deterministic process of the wefs nexus simulation were set by zeng et al 2022 the water availability was based on the historical record while its wefs nexus simulation was stochastic in scenario ⅰ if there was no water resources allocation model and the water availability data were sampled from its distribution in the wefs nexus simulation the water availability uncertainty was analyzed for the wefs nexus as scenario ⅱ after setting the critical values for water shortage rates from 0 07 to 0 15 to avoid the explosion of environmental awareness zeng et al 2022 if there was the water resource allocation model in the wefs nexus simulation scenario ⅲ was set to analyze the impacts of water availability uncertainty on the wefs nexus by comparing it with the scenarios ⅱ the reservoir release multiplier q release was the ratio of the amount of water released from reservoir to that under the reference scenario according to reservoir operation rules the q release was used to indicate different water resources allocation schemes scenarios ⅳ ⅴ ⅵ and ⅶ were set to discuss the response of the wefs nexus simulation to different water resources allocation schemes according the sensitivity analysis results the reservoirs release multiplier was set between 0 5 and 1 5 zeng et al 2022 scenarios ⅳ ⅴ ⅵ and ⅶ were set with their q release at 0 5 0 75 1 25 and 1 5 respectively 4 results and discussion the uncertainty of the wefs nexus in the mlhrb was analyzed at monthly time step the co evolution of the wefs nexus was from 2010 to 2070 specifically an initial parameter sensitivity analysis for the stochastic wefs nexus was conducted to determine the noise intensities of the governing equations as described in section 2 2 the annual water availability from 1956 to 2016 was used to approximate the pdf of water availability according to the monthly ratios of water availability based on the historical hydrological data monthly water availability was obtained and inputted into the stochastic wefs nexus simulation the size of the monte carlo sampling was set to 1000 and the sample was tested to capture the pdfs of the state variables of the wefs nexus which were shown in fig s1 the outputs from the stochastic wefs nexus simulation were used to analyze the uncertainty of the wefs nexus the joint and conditional distributions of water availability and water shortage rates at upstream and downstream operational zones were derived through copula function to analyze the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus under the seven scenarios 4 1 uncertainty sources of the wefs nexus in the mlhrb the noise intensities are the key parameters for the stochastic process in the wefs nexus simulation as presented in eqs 10 16 to ensure the co evolution of the wefs nexus within the rational intervals an initial sensitivity analysis of the noise intensities was conducted to determine their values as listed in table 3 the rational intervals of the socioeconomic state variables i e population gdp crop area water use quota energy use quota and crop yield were based on their historical data and all their noise intensities were no more than 0 005 there were no historical data for environmental awareness as environmental awareness was a subjective variable that describes the societal perceptions of environmental degradation within the prevailing value systems environmental awareness was often reflected by media focus and was thus accompanied with larger uncertainty than the variables with historical data the noise intensity of environmental awareness was thus assumed to be 0 05 according to the initial sensitivity analysis the parameters of the p ⅲ distribution for the total water availability in the entire mlhrb were estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation parameters α β and a 0 values were 9 60 0 19 billion m 3 and 0 26 billion m3 respectively it was taken as the optimal distribution of the total water availability with the rmse of 0 0312 thus the pdf of the total water availability in the entire mlhrb was bell shaped and positive partial as shown in fig 5 and the total probability between 25 and 70 billion m3 was more than 95 the coefficients of variation cv and skewness cs were 0 645 and 0 321 respectively the ratio of cs to cv was 2 01 the p value was 0 8795 in the k s test with a 95 confidence level suggesting that the optimal p ⅲ distribution was capable to describe the water availability uncertainty and laid the foundation for monte carlo sampling 4 2 effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty of the wefs nexus at the whole mlhrb there are seven primary state variables in the wefs nexus that are water demand energy demand food production water supply rate energy supply rate food supply rate and environmental awareness these seven state variables were selected to investigate the potential effects of the water resources allocation on the total uncertainty of the wefs nexus the water supply priorities in the iras model from high to low were assigned as municipal and rural domesticity in stream ecology industrial and agricultural users according to the integrated water resources planning of hanjiang river basin cwrc 2016 table 4 listed water demand and water supply resulting from the water resources allocation model under seven scenarios table 5 listed the remaining five state variable values i e energy demand food production energy supply rate food supply rate and environmental awareness that were outputted from the wefs nexus simulation the average x and standard deviation σ from the samples quantified their uncertainties throughout the co evolution process to illustrate the evolution processes of the state variables of the stochastic wefs nexus under the impacts of water availability uncertainty and water resources allocation the trajectories of the average values and the intervals at 95 confidence level under scenarios ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ were determined and shown in fig 6 4 2 1 response of the uncertainty of the wefs nexus to water resources allocation to investigate the stochasticity of the wefs nexus the results of scenario ⅰ showed that the co evolution of the wefs nexus simulation was slightly altered by the noises water demand was directly affected by socioeconomic variables i e population gdp crop area and their water use quotas as shown in fig 6 a the average water demand was 17 02 billion m3 and its standard deviation was 0 23 billion m3 the water demand was satisfied and the water supply rate shown in fig 6 d showed little response to the noises the uncertainty of the agricultural water supply was small with a standard deviation of 0 12 which accounted for that the food production increased with small uncertainty shown in fig 6 c the average food production was 6529 thousand tons with a standard deviation of 178 thousand tons for the energy system the energy demand in the water supply process with a small standard deviation of 27 million kw h was altered by the water supply shown in fig 6 b however the total planning energy availability was less than the energy demand owing to socioeconomic expansion the energy supply cannot be ensured and the energy supply rate was typically lower than its critical value i e 95 as detailed in zeng et al 2022 as shown in fig 6 e which led to the accumulation of environmental awareness the variability in the energy supply rate contributed to the uncertainty in the evolution of environmental awareness as shown in fig 6 g as the environmental awareness often kept at a low level and rarely exceeded its critical value of 8 0 in the evolution process shown in fig 6 g the environmental awareness feedback on socioeconomic variables was rarely triggered or only triggered with little intensity thus the impacts of the uncertainty of environmental awareness owing to its noises on the wefs nexus were not evident the impacts of water availability uncertainty on the stochastic wefs nexus were determined by comparing the differences in the results between scenarios ⅰ and ⅲ the wefs nexus was remarkably altered by the water availability uncertainty the average water demand decreased from 17 02 billion m3 under scenario ⅰ to 15 96 billion m3 under scenario ⅲ while its standard deviation increased from 0 23 to 0 90 billion m3 although there were few differences in the supply rates of water energy and food between scenarios ⅰ and ⅲ their standard deviations increased remarkably the average environmental awareness increased from 5 83 under scenario ⅰ to 7 46 under scenario ⅲ and its standard deviation simultaneously increased from 0 63 to 2 63 the increasing uncertainty of environmental awareness further led to larger variability of the co evolution of the wefs nexus through environmental awareness feedback under the impacts of noises the differences between the scenarios ⅱ and ⅲ can indicate the impacts of water resources allocation on the uncertainty of the wefs nexus the purpose of the water resources allocation model was to ensure water supply the total water supply rate increased from 84 74 to 93 45 and the standard deviation decreased from 3 37 to 1 78 under the scenarios ⅱ and ⅲ respectively as the water resources allocation model was integrated with scenarios ⅲ the water supply rates of industrial and agricultural users increased from 79 19 and 84 27 to 90 03 and 93 4 respectively their standard deviations also decreased from 4 35 and 3 99 to 1 72 and 2 40 respectively thus the uncertainties decreased as much water was stored in the reservoirs during the flood season and released during the dry season the water shortage was remarkably alleviated due to the uneven temporal distribution of water availability the impacts of the variability of the monthly water availability were also decreased as the water inflow was stored in reservoirs based on seasonal or annual operational rules the impacts of the uncertainties of water availability on water supply were thereby alleviated through reservoir operation under the scenarios ⅲ with the increased agricultural water supply rate the food production increased from 5572 to 6362 thousand tons the considerable average environmental awareness caused by the water shortage and food shortage thereby decreased from 14 75 to 7 46 with smaller uncertainty negative feedback driven by environmental awareness then resulted in lower uncertainty for the co evolution of the wefs nexus there are four phases in the co evolution of the wefs nexus when water resources allocation was considered expansion contraction recession and recovery phases zeng et al 2022 as the wefs nexus performed differently in different phases the response of wefs nexus uncertainty to water resources allocation was analyzed in these four phases for the entire mlhrb under scenario ⅲ in the expansion phase i e 2010 2032 most water and energy demands can be satisfied the accumulation of environmental awareness was mainly due to food shortages as shown in fig 6 f as water resources allocation can effectively alleviate the impacts of water availability uncertainty on water supply the uncertainties in agricultural water supply and food production decreased although environmental awareness increased with increasing water and food shortages the 95 confidence interval of environmental awareness was small as shown in fig 6 g the socioeconomic sectors and the wefs nexus can expand with a high confidence level in the expansion phase however during the contraction i e 2033 2039 and recession phases i e 2040 2045 as water availability could not cover the increasing water demand most water was directly released from the reservoir rather than being stored in reservoir water availability was poorly regulated by reservoir thus the water availability uncertainty directly impacted the water supply and increased the uncertainties of the evolution of energy demand and the food production through the wefs nexus shown in fig 6 b and c as the environmental awareness was positively correlated with water and energy shortage rates environmental awareness exhibits high uncertainty due to the high uncertainties of water and energy shortage rates in the contraction and recession phases the evolution of socioeconomic variables was altered by environmental awareness feedback under the impacts of noises the water demand projected by the socioeconomic variables thereby also exhibited uncertainty although environmental awareness decreased in the recovery phase i e 2046 2070 its uncertainty was not negligible in the co evolution of the wefs nexus through the dynamics of the state variables at the end of the recession phase therefore water resources allocation can effectively decrease the water supply uncertainty through reservoirs operation the uncertainty in the wefs nexus also decreases however if the water demand exceeds the regulating capacity of the water system the reservoirs can poorly regulate the water flow and the stress on water supply increases water availability uncertainty can remarkably impact the water supply and leads to the high uncertainties in the wefs through its nexus 4 2 2 impacts of water resources allocation schemes on the uncertainty of the wefs nexus to obtain the optimal water resources allocation scheme it was necessary to conduct the different water resources allocation schemes for the uncertainty of the wefs nexus the differences among scenarios ⅲ ⅳ ⅴ ⅵ and ⅶ indicated the sensitivities of the uncertainty of the wefs nexus to the reservoir release multipliers q release there were few differences in the water supply rate ranging from 93 11 to 93 61 among these five scenarios water availability was abundant across the entire mlhrb so the water demand was often satisfied the standard deviations of water supply rate were 2 12 1 93 1 78 1 80 and 1 87 under the scenarios ⅳ ⅴ ⅲ ⅵ and ⅶ respectively and they were not linear with the q release values as less water was released with a smaller q release value e g the q release of scenarios ⅳ and ⅴ were 0 50 and 0 75 respectively more water was stored in the reservoir once the water level exceeded the normal water level of the reservoir water was directly released downstream through the spillway more water released from reservoir with larger q release values e g the q release under scenarios ⅵ and ⅶ were 1 25 and 1 50 respectively and the regulation on water availability through the reservoir decreased the water availability uncertainty slightly decreased thus the uncertainty in the corresponding water supply cannot be efficiently alleviated by reservoir operation the standard deviations of energy demand and food production further increased from 199 million kw h and 456 thousand tons under scenario ⅲ to 209 219 million kw h and 487 497 thousand tons under scenarios ⅵ and ⅶ respectively these uncertainties in water supply energy demand and food production have influenced socioeconomic expansion through environmental awareness feedback the uncertainty in the corresponding socioeconomic water demand has increased therefore policymakers should pay more attention to the regulating capacity of reservoirs in water resources management in a basin which is an effective way to decrease the impacts of water availability uncertainties on water demand to ensure the co evolution of the wefs nexus 4 3 effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus within the mlhbr water resources allocation can effectively alleviate the impacts of the water availability uncertainty on the water supply through reservoir operation to ensure the co evolution of the wefs nexus however as the water flows from upstream to downstream water availability uncertainty also propagates from upstream to downstream the responses of water supply energy demand and food production to the uncertainty of water availability differed in upstream and downstream areas owing to the uneven distribution of reservoirs within the basin according to the responses of the water supply from the water resources allocation model to the water availability uncertainty in every operational zone the operational zones in the mlhrb can be categorized into three types shown in fig 7 if the water supply could be assured and impacted by the water availability uncertainty in an operational zone the zone was taken as type a if the water shortage can be effectively alleviated by water resources allocation and the impacts of water availability uncertainty on water supply can be remarkably alleviated the zone was taken as type b there was no negligible water shortage in a zone and its water supply was remarkably affected by the water availability uncertainty the zone was taken as type c considering the hydrologic connections between the upstream and downstream zones four types of routes for uncertainty propagation within the mlhrb can be found the route i was from type a to type a zones whereas the route ii was from type b to a type a zones the route iii was from type b to type b zones whereas the route iv was from type c to type a zones specifically eight operational zones selected to show the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus within the mlhrb z25 xiantao and z26 wuhan with the route i z2 shennongjia and z3 baokang with the route ii z19 jingshan and z21 yingcheng with the route iii and z13 jingmenshuanghe and z14 zhongxiangshuanghe with the route iv the average and standard deviation values of the water demand water supply rate energy demand and food production were listed in table 6 as water availability for an operational zone contains water flows from upstream in addition to the local water availability table 7 listed the water availability from an upstream zone thus water availability uncertainty can propagate from upstream to downstream the uncertainty of the wefs nexus varied in different phases during the co evolution of the wefs nexus as discussed in section 4 2 1 the uncertainty emerged in the contraction phase which was the vital phase therefore a representative year 2035 in the contractions phase was selected to study the uncertainty propagation the water flowing from the upstream to downstream operational zones were listed in table 7 4 3 1 response of the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus to water resources allocation the response of uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus to water resources allocation varied through different routes the uncertainty of upstream water availability was remarkably alleviated when it propagated downstream through the routes i ii and iv whereas it was not efficiently alleviated through the route iii in the case study taking the uncertainty propagation routes iv as an example the water supply rate in z13 was slightly increased by water resources allocation from 62 32 under scenario ⅱ to 65 40 under scenario ⅲ as there was few water storage capacity for regulating the local water availability by the reservoir operation the impacts of water availability uncertainty on the water supply slightly increased and the standard deviation of the water supply rate increased from 9 20 to 10 49 the uncertainty of the water released from z13 increased with the coefficients of variation increasing from 0 12 under scenario ⅱ to 0 13 under scenario ⅲ the water released from z13 then flowed into the downstream z14 through the river network interestingly the water supply in z14 was ensured and the uncertainty of water flow from z13 had little impacts on its water supply as the main water availability source in z14 was from the main stream of hanjiang river there was a large water storage capacity from the r3 danjiangkou reservoir with a total storage of 33 91 billion m3 as shown in fig 3 to regulate the water availability uncertainty and ensure water supply the impacts of the water availability uncertainty in upstream z13 on the water supply in downstream z14 decreased the water supply rates in z14 under scenarios ⅱ and ⅲ were greater than 91 62 and their standard deviations were less than 0 64 the water supply rates in z13 were less than 65 40 and the corresponding standard deviations were greater than 10 49 thus water availability uncertainty was alleviated through the routes iv from z13 to z14 a similar uncertainty propagation can be found in routes i from z25 to z26 and route ii from z2 to z3 most of the water availability in z25 and z26 was from the main stream of the hanjiang river that was regulated by the dangjiangkou reservoir their water supplies were ensured and the impacts of uncertainty of local water availability were decreased by the upstream reservoir operation if the water resources allocation model was considered the water supply rates in z25 and z26 were more than 99 with small standard deviations as the water flowed along with the route ii from z2 to z3 with high uncertainty and the standard deviations were 15 and 14 million m3 and the coefficients of variation of 0 10 and 0 08 under scenario ⅱ and scenario ⅲ respectively water availability in z3 was regulated by the r1 sanliping and r2 siping reservoirs respectively as shown in fig 3 the water supply rate in z3 was 99 99 and its standard deviation was 0 07 under the scenario ⅲ whereas the water supply rate was 79 01 and its standard deviation was 7 86 in z2 the impacts of the upstream water availability uncertainty on water supply were alleviated as the water storage capacities in both z19 and z21 were insufficient to cover the corresponding water demands and they were connected through the route iii the upstream water availability uncertainty did not fade as the standard deviations of the water supply rate were 4 68 and 4 63 in z19 and z21 respectively to quantify the upstream water availability uncertainty propagation to downstream the joint distributions of both the water availability and water shortage rate in z19 water availability in z19 and the water shortage rate in z21 under scenarios ⅱ and ⅲ were estimated their conditional distributions were determined based on the joint distributions as shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively as there was no water resources allocation model in the scenario ⅱ the water shortage rates in z19 fell between 8 and 45 there were little differences between the cumulative density function curves shown in fig 8 a if the water availability was less than 800 million m3 the water shortage rate was typically greater than 15 which was the critical value of evoking the water shortage awareness accumulation under scenario ⅱ leading to an increase in environmental awareness the evolution of environmental awareness was accompanied by uncertainty due to the noises as discussed in section 4 2 1 if the environmental awareness value exceeded its critical value environmental awareness feedback impacted the evolution of water demand by regulating socioeconomic expansion the uncertainty then propagated into the water demand and further into the water supply and water shortage rate therefore the water shortage rate uncertainty was considerable because of the model stochasticity when water availability was low and further challenged the whole wefs through its nexus since the water availability was greater than 800 million m3 the water shortage decreased remarkably the water shortage rates were often less than its critical value as shown in fig 8 a environmental awareness decreased and the impacts of environmental awareness feedback on socioeconomic variables also diminished the uncertainty of water demand decreased and the uncertainty of the water shortage rate decreased the water shortage rates interval for the most distribution gradually narrowed from 8 45 to 8 12 as the water availability increased from 800 to 1400 million m3 shown in fig 8 a the uncertainty of the co evolution of the wefs decreased through its nexus if the water availability was greater than 1400 million m3 the corresponding water shortage rates were less than the critical value little environmental awareness accumulated and environmental awareness feedback was rarely triggered the uncertainty of the wefs nexus was mainly due to the noises in the dynamics of socioeconomic variables and its impacts on the wefs nexus were much smaller than those from the water availability uncertainty as discussed in section 4 1 as the water released from z19 flowed into z21 through the route iii the water availability uncertainty in z19 propagated into z21 from upstream to downstream the average value and standard deviation of the water flowing from z19 to z21 were 126 and 24 million m3 respectively with the coefficient of variation of 0 19 the uncertainty of the water supply in z21 increased owing to the uncertainty propagation of the water availability in z19 if the water availability was less than 800 million m3 the water shortage rate in z21 fell between 8 and 25 as shown in fig 8 b the water supply uncertainty in z21 was remarkably increased by the uncertainty propagation of water availability in upstream z19 which was the response of the water supply in z21 to the water availability uncertainty in z19 as the water resources allocation model was taken under scenario ⅲ the water shortage in z19 decreased through reservoir operation benefiting the co evolution of the wefs nexus the average values of water demand energy demand and food production remarkably increased from 248 million m3 to 466 million m3 26 million kw h to 82 million kw h and 332 thousand tons to 363 thousand tons respectively the average water supply rate increased from 84 42 to 90 86 and the corresponding water demand significantly increased the critical water availability to ensure the water supply in z19 decreased from 1400 million m3 under scenario ⅱ to 1250 million m3 under scenario ⅲ as the local water availability was effectively regulated through water resources allocation the water shortage rate was less than 7 and did not exceed its critical value shown in fig 9 a which was much smaller than the corresponding water shortage rate of 15 shown in fig 8 a thus there was a low level of environmental awareness the co evolution of the wefs nexus was slightly affected by environmental awareness feedback on socioeconomic expansion the uncertainty in water shortage rate increased with a decrease in water availability when the water availability ranged from 1250 to 800 million m3 the interval of the water shortage rate expanded from 0 7 to 0 30 shown in fig 9 a whereas the corresponding interval expanded from 8 12 to 8 45 shown in fig 8 a as the decreasing water demand was often less than the decreasing water availability the water shortage rate might have exceeded its critical value in evoking the accumulation of environmental awareness thus water demand uncertainty increased with increasing environmental awareness and further propagated into the wefs through its nexus if the water availability was less than 800 million m3 the water shortage was considerable and cannot be completely relieved by water resources allocation the water shortage rate fell between 0 and 30 shown in fig 9 a and easily exceeded the critical value there was high level environmental awareness which further altered the evolution of socioeconomic variables for water demand projection through its feedback under the impacts of noises owing to the water demand uncertainty the water supply uncertainty increased and the uncertainty of the wefs further increased through its nexus as the water supply in z19 was ensured by water resources allocation the average value of the water flowing from z19 to z21 increased from 126 to 279 million m3 and the coefficient of variation decreased from 0 19 to 0 11 the water supply in z21 was regulated by the r17 gaoguan reservoir shown in fig 3 and the impacts of the water availability uncertainty in z19 on the water supply in z21 were alleviated the average water supply rate increased from 86 06 to 97 09 the water shortage rate in z21 mainly fell in the range of 0 7 with varied water availability as shown in fig 9 b all water shortage rates were below the critical value and the environmental awareness accumulation was rarely evoked the impacts of the water availability uncertainty of upstream z19 on downstream z21 were effectively alleviated through the regulations on water flow by the r16 huiting reservoir in z19 and r17 gaoguan reservoir in z21 the standard deviation of water supply rate in z21 decreased from 4 48 to 3 3 the water supply uncertainty had little impacts on the evolution of energy demand and food production and their standard deviations decreased from 2 2 to 2 1 million kw h and from 27 to 22 thousand tons respectively therefore the water storage capacity is vital in alleviating the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the larger the water storage capacity size the greater the alleviation of the water availability uncertainty on water supply through reservoir operation as environmental awareness decreases the uncertainty from environmental awareness feedback decreases during its propagation in the wefs nexus the smaller the water storage capacity size the fewer the alleviation of water availability uncertainty on water supply the water availability uncertainty propagated into the water supply and the water supply uncertainty increased particularly when the water availability could not satisfy water demand thus environmental awareness increased environmental awareness feedback under the impacts of noises can lead to the uncertainty of socioeconomic expansion the uncertainty further propagated into the water demand and increased the uncertainty of the co evolution of the wefs of downstream zones through the water flowing from upstream into downstream zones the proposed framework for assessing the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus can aid the comprehensive resources management of water energy and food in areas where the wefs is remarkably altered by upstream water availability uncertainty especially for the transboundary river basins as the riparian countries have different developmental goals the different water resources management strategies from upstream to downstream have become an important issue for instance the mekong river basin in asia gao et al 2021 nile river basin in africa elsayed et al 2020 and columbia river basin in north america zhang et al 2021a taking the nile river basin as a case the wefs safety of downstream egypt can be severely challenged by the water availability uncertainty of upstream sudan with the reservoir operation of the upstream aswan dam the upstream water availability uncertainty was effectively decreased and the water supply was significantly increased which further ensured the rapid socioeconomic expansion of egypt through its nexus strzepek et al 2008 the proposed framework has considerable potential for riparian countries cooperation in transboundary river basins to handle the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus 4 3 2 impacts of water resources allocation schemes on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the uncertainty propagation showed little response to the different water resources allocation schemes under scenarios ⅲ ⅳ ⅴ ⅵ and ⅶ through the routes i ii and iv the varied q release values determined the amount of water release from the reservoir and influenced the water supply uncertainty as discussed in section 4 2 2 the average values of water flow from upstream to downstream from z25 to z26 through the route i from z2 to z3 through route ii and from z13 to z14 through route iv ranged from 736 to 827 million m3 from 167 to 183 million m3 from 75 to 77 million m3 respectively in comparison the corresponding standard deviations ranged from 14 to 17 million m3 from 68 to 81 million m3 from 9 9 to 10 2 million m3 respectively the water availability uncertainties propagated downstream but were efficiently alleviated through the reservoir operation with large water storage capacities in downstream zones as discussed in section 4 3 1 thus water supplies were ensured and there were few differences in the water supply rates in z26 z3 and z14 under different water resources allocation schemes as the water storage capacities of downstream zones through the route iii were insufficient to satisfy the water demands the water shortages in downstream zones were related to the q release values the uncertainty propagation of water availability was sensitive to water resources allocation schemes through reservoir operation the conditional distributions of water availability and water shortage rate in z19 and z21 reflected the impacts of water resources allocation schemes on the uncertainty propagation through the route iii as shown in figs 10 11 12 and 13 under scenarios ⅳ ⅴ ⅵ and ⅶ respectively the q release value decreased from 1 00 under scenario ⅲ to 0 75 and 0 50 under scenarios ⅴ and ⅳ respectively the uncertainty in the water shortage rates in both z19 and z21 increased a smaller q release value indicated the decreased water release from the reservoir the average water supply rate in z19 decreased from 90 86 under scenario ⅲ to 88 96 and 87 46 under scenarios ⅴ and ⅳ respectively the corresponding standard deviations increased from 5 17 to 6 15 and 7 16 respectively a lager environmental awareness has been accumulated subsequently the impacts of environmental awareness feedback on socioeconomic expansion for water demand projection increased the uncertainty of water demand propagated into the water supply through the water resources allocation the average water flow from z19 to z21 decreased from 279 million m3 under scenario ⅲ to 256 and 228 million m3 under scenarios ⅴ and ⅳ respectively while their standard deviation increased from 32 to 33 and 34 million m3 respectively thus the water supply uncertainty in z21 increased owing to the increasing uncertainty of the water flow from z19 as the storage capacity of the r17 gaoguan reservoir was insufficient to alleviate the water availability uncertainty propagated from z19 the wefs uncertainty in z21 increased through its nexus as discussed in section 4 3 1 the standard deviations of water demand energy demand and food production in z21 increased from 46 million m3 12 million kw h and 38 thousand tons under scenario ⅲ to 50 million m3 12 million kw h and 40 thousand tons under scenario ⅴ and 55 million m3 13 million kw h and 44 thousand tons under scenario ⅳ respectively interestingly the smaller the q release value the larger the uncertainty of water shortage rates particularly when the water availability was limited as shown in figs 9 10 and 11 if the water availability in z19 was less than 800 million m3 the interval of water shortage rate in z19 expanded from 0 to 33 under scenario ⅲ to 0 38 and 0 42 under scenarios ⅴ and ⅳ respectively as the water supply decreased with decreasing q release value the water shortage increased and further increased the environmental awareness the uncertainty of environmental awareness due to its noises propagated into water demand through environmental awareness feedback on socioeconomic sectors water demand uncertainty further increased the uncertainties of the water supply and water shortage rate through water resources allocation there were few differences between the cumulative density function curves of the water shortage rates in z19 and z21 as shown in figs 9 10 and 11 when the water availability in z19 was more than 1400 million m3 as their water supplies were ensured a similar method can be used to analyze the schemes with larger q release values under scenarios ⅵ and ⅶ e g the q release value were 1 25 and 1 50 respectively although water release increased with a larger q release value the water supply in z19 barely increased the average water supply rate ranged from 90 86 to 91 67 and the standard deviation ranged from 5 05 to 5 17 it was more difficult to maintain the reservoir at its normal water level with a larger q release value although the water supply can be ensured in the flood season the water supply stress during the dry season increased with limited water storage capacity and water availability thus there were few differences between the cumulative density function curves of the water shortage rates in z19 and z21 as shown in figs 9 12 and 13 it was found that the uncertainty propagation of water availability was insensitive to the water resources allocation schemes therefore policymakers have two manners to handle the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus a implementing optimal water resources allocation schemes in the area with few regulating capacity of the water system within a basin and b regulating the local socioeconomic expansion to keep the water demand from over speed increase as local water safety is ensured the water availability uncertainty propagated from upstream can be effectively alleviated and further the wefs can be ensured through its nexus 5 conclusion this study proposed a framework to assess the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus for the comprehensive management of water energy and food under uncertainties the white gaussian noises were integrated into seven primary governing equations of the system dynamic model for the wefs nexus to express the uncertainty of the model structure transforming the wefs nexus model from deterministic to stochastic the copula function was adopted to quantify the uncertainty propagation by estimating the joint distributions between the water availability and shortage rate in the upstream and downstream zones based on the monte carlo simulation of the stochastic wefs nexus model the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus were analyzed by investigating the response of wefs to different water resources allocation schemes according to the results of the case study in the mlhrb china water availability uncertainty is the main source of the uncertainty in the wefs nexus a rational water resources allocation scheme can efficiently improve water shortage and diminish the impacts of water availability uncertainty on water supply through reservoir operation food production increases remarkably as the agricultural water supply is ensured high level environmental awareness evoked by water or food shortages decreases and ensures the co evolution of the wefs nexus the water availability uncertainty in the upstream zone propagates to downstream zone by the water flow through their hydrologic connections the water storage capacity of a reservoir for water regulation in an operational zone is the vital factor in regulating the uncertainty propagation within a basin if there is sufficient water storage capacity in a zone the impacts of water availability uncertainty in the upstream zone can be alleviated through reservoir operation there is no significant response of the wefs through its nexus to different water resources allocation schemes if there is few water storage capacity in a zone its water supply is significantly influenced by water availability uncertainty in the upstream zone water supply is hardly ensured and is sensitive to different water resources allocation schemes water and food shortages evoke an accumulation of environmental awareness environmental awareness feedback under the impacts of model structure uncertainty i e the noises further increases the water demand uncertainty by altering socioeconomic expansion particularly when the water availability is much less than the water demand then the water supply uncertainty increases and propagates into the wefs through its nexus water availability uncertainty is the primary uncertainty for the co evolution of the wefs nexus in this study the pdf of water availability was estimated by stationary hydrologic frequency analysis method however the stationary assumption of water availability has been remarkably challenged under the impacts of human activities and climate change the nonstationarity of water availability can bring risks to the wefs through its nexus and further challenge sustainable development goals therefore more attention should be paid to

8988,the water energy food society wefs nexus is profiled for sustainable development the wefs nexus exhibits strong uncertainty owing to the stochasticity of model structure and water availability uncertainty under climate change and human activities the wefs nexus remains highly risky as the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus under the regulation of water resources allocation has rarely been investigated in this study white gaussian noises were integrated into a system dynamic model for the wefs nexus simulation transforming the nexus from deterministic to stochastic based on a monte carlo simulation of the stochastic wefs nexus with water availability uncertainty the copula function was applied to evaluate the joint distributions between water availability and water shortage rates in the upstream and downstream zones to investigate the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation were analyzed by setting different water resources allocation schemes the proposed approach was applied to the mid lower reaches of hanjiang river basin in china as a case study the results indicate that an effective water resources allocation scheme can ensure water supply and diminish the impacts of water availability uncertainty on water supply through reservoir operation the annual average water supply rate increased from 84 74 to 93 45 and the standard deviation decreased from 3 37 to 1 78 the high level environmental awareness evoked by water or food shortages decreased significantly with smaller uncertainty the co evolution of the wefs was ensured through its nexus water storage capacity was the vital factor to regulate the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the impacts of upstream water availability uncertainty were efficiently regulated via reservoir operation for the zones with sufficient water storage capacity water supply was ensured and there was no significant response of the wefs through its nexus to different water resources allocation schemes if there was few water storage capacity in a zone the water supply was remarkably influenced by the water availability uncertainty in the upstream zone the water supply was difficult to ensure and was sensitive to different water resources allocation schemes the environmental awareness evoked by water or food shortages increased the environmental awareness feedback under the impacts of the noises increased water demand uncertainty by altering the socioeconomic expansion further increased wefs uncertainty through its nexus particularly when water availability was much smaller than water demand the proposed approach can help quantify the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus and contribute to the sustainable development of the wefs nexus keywords water energy food society nexus uncertainty propagation water resources allocation copula function data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water energy and food are the fundamental human resources bilgen 2014 vörösmarty et al 2000 west et al 2014 the interconnections across the water energy and food systems are increasingly tight and thus can be profiled as the water energy food wef nexus to increase resource use benefits cai et al 2018 d odorico et al 2018 hoff 2011 huntington et al 2021 zeng et al 2019a human sensitivity has been integrated into the wef nexus to take the physical and social processes in the nexus simultaneously and the wef nexus has been expanded into the water energy food society wefs nexus for the sustainable development di baldassarre et al 2019 fuchs et al 2017 sivapalan et al 2012 zeng et al 2022 the system dynamic model has been widely applied to mimic the co evolution of the nexus owing to its flexibility in describing the dynamics within an integrated system feng et al 2016 simonovic 2002 however modeling the wefs nexus exhibits significant uncertainties owing to deficiencies in the model structure and the input uncertainties deficiencies in the model structure mainly arises from a lack of knowledge in representing the real life process of the wefs nexus numerous studies have applied deterministic system dynamic model based on coupled ordinary differential equations to simulate the dynamics of the nexus feng et al 2016 li et al 2019 wu et al 2022 the deterministic model revealed the interactions among variables of the wefs nexus and further helped to investigate the co evolution of the nexus stochasticity underlies the key process of model structure of the wefs nexus simulation guerra et al 2021 shoemaker et al 2020 vellend et al 2014 and can lead to remarkable variability in the state variables of the nexus however the deterministic model is often incapable of identifying the stochasticity in its model structure of the wefs nexus simulation and ignores the risk of its results challenging the sustainable development goals the stochasticity of the nexus was typically simulated by using noises method chen et al 2021 feng et al 2019 guttal and jayaprakash 2007 for example an et al 2021 employed the noises method to ordinary differential equations for the dynamics of the water supply power generation and environmental awareness wpe transforming the wpe nexus simulation from deterministic to stochastic the probability density function pdf of the state variable was estimated from the stochastic wpe nexus simulation which provided more information for risk management than a deterministic series from the deterministic wpe nexus simulation therefore the noises method can effectively investigate the stochasticity of the wefs nexus and further contribute to the risk management of the wefs nexus to achieve sustainable development goals water availability is one of the primary inputs to the wefs nexus simulation owing to the impacts of climate change and human activities the water availability uncertainty is expanding her et al 2019 muller schmied et al 2014 vetter et al 2017 and an increase in the risk of water supply through the wefs nexus is also evident govindan and al ansari 2019 ji et al 2020 ma et al 2020 zeng et al 2019b the effects of water availability uncertainties on the nexus are described only as a whole basin which cannot express the uncertainty propagation within the basin especially from upstream to downstream via hydrologic connections moges et al 2020 silva et al 2018 zhang and shao 2018 thus the risks of water shortage may propagate from upstream to downstream adaptive measures to ensure water supply should thereby consider the water availability uncertainties not only from the local area but also from the upstream areas as the joint distributions of hydrologic variables have often been adopted to express the water availability uncertainty renard 2011 serinaldi 2013 the copula function has been used as a hydrologic frequency analysis method to describe water availability uncertainty by binding multiple independent random variables into joint distributions chen et al 2013 karmakar and simonovic 2009 nelsen 2006 therefore the water availability uncertainty propagation from upstream to downstream can be assessed by the copula function the water supply assurance strategy often results from a water resources allocation model that takes the impacts of the water availability uncertainty through reservoir operation castelletti et al 2010 chen et al 2016 he et al 2022 liu et al 2010 zeng et al 2017 numerous studies took the water availability uncertainty following the historical natural water flow whereas the impacts of reservoir operation on the water availability uncertainty were overlooked or significantly simplified the risks of the water supply and even of wefs might be overestimated or underestimated water resources allocation simultaneously takes the reservoir operation and the hydrologic connections into account liu et al 2018 pedro monzonis et al 2015 zeng et al 2021 incorporating a water resources allocation model into wefs simulation can improve the assessment of the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus our study aims to quantitatively assess the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the reminder of this paper is organized as follows section 2 introduces the framework for developing the stochastic wefs nexus simulation with water availability uncertainty and assessing the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus section 3 applies the framework to the mid lower reaches of hanjiang river basin in china section 4 presents the co evolution results of the stochastic wefs nexus simulation with water availability uncertainty and discusses the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus section 5 concludes the study 2 method the simulation of the interactions between water energy food and society systems is based on the deterministic dynamic model of the wefs nexus proposed by zeng et al 2022 the wefs nexus model is transformed from deterministic to stochastic through adding the white gaussian noises to the ordinary differential equations to express the model structure uncertainty of the wefs nexus simulation to determine the impacts of the water availability uncertainty on the stochastic wefs nexus simulation the pdf of the water availability within basin is estimated by frequency analysis method discrete water availability samples are generated by the monte carlo method through its pdf as water shortage is outputted from the stochastic wefs nexus simulation with the inputs of the discrete water availability discrete water shortage rates are defined by the ratios of water shortage to demand the pdf of the water shortage rate is then determined by fitting the sample data thus joint distributions of the water availability and water shortage rates can be obtained by copula function through connecting their marginal distributions the joint distribution functions can quantify the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus that are the uncertainties of water availability from upstream to downstream as different water resources allocation schemes are inputted into the wefs nexus simulation the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus can be studied by the joint distribution functions the framework is illustrated as fig 1 2 1 deterministic dynamic wefs nexus model to investigate the interactions between water energy food and society systems zeng et al 2022 developed a deterministic system dynamic model expanding the wef nexus into the wefs nexus the interactive river aquifer simulation iras water resources allocation model loucks 2002 zeng et al 2021 was integrated into the wefs nexus model to quantify the impacts of water resources allocation on the co evolution of the wefs nexus the wefs nexus comprises four modules water system energy system food system and society system modules in the water system module the water demand is firstly projected based on socioeconomic factors the water demand and water availability are then inputted into the iras model to simulate water resources allocation including the water release from reservoir based on fig 2 and eqs 1 7 and the water shortage experienced by water users by eqs 8 9 the water supply and agricultural water shortage rates outputted from the water system module are then inputted into energy and food system modules respectively to determine the energy and food shortages the water energy and food shortage rates are taken as the inputs of the society system module to determine the shortage awareness of water energy and food and further the environmental awareness once the environmental awareness exceeds its critical value the environmental awareness feedback to constrain the socioeconomic factors in the water system module will be triggered to alleviate the stress on water energy and food supplies further details can be retrieved from

dynamic wefs nexus model as white gaussian noise is popular in stochastic simulation owing to its effectiveness in capturing the randomness of state variables meng et al 2020 schmogrow et al 2012 xiao et al 2021 it has been employed to simulate the stochasticity of the wefs nexus specifically the white gaussian noises are incorporated into the seven primary governing equations i e referring to the dynamics of population gdp crop area water use quota energy use quota crop yield and environmental awareness respectively to illustrate the uncertainties of the model structure of the wefs nexus simulation as presented by eqs 10 16 the developed wefs nexus simulation was transformed from deterministic into stochastic 10 d n t r p t n t d t t s p n t d w p 11 d g t r g t g t d t t s g g t d w

for the water availability uncertainties monte carlo sampling has been widely used to analyze the impacts of uncertain inputs or parameters of hydrological model on runoff jeremiah et al 2011 knighton et al 2014 as runoff determines water availability the water availability uncertainty can be analyzed by the monte carlo sampling the pdf of a hydrologic variable including water availability is often described by the pearson type ⅲ p ⅲ distribution according to the recommendation in the specification for hydrologic computation of water resources and hydropower projects in china the parameters of p ⅲ distribution shown as eq 17 are estimated by minimizing the difference between the p ⅲ distribution and the empirical distribution from the historical records of water availability 17 f x β α γ α x a 0 α 1 exp β x a 0 α 0 x a 0 where α β and a 0 are the shape scale and location parameters respectively the difference between empirical and the p ⅲ distributions is quantified by the root mean square error rmse as shown in eq 18 18 r m s e 1 n q 1 n e q 2 where n is the sample size and e q is the q th differences of the sample the maximum likelihood estimation is used to minimize the rmse then the kolmogorov smimov k s is adopted as a goodness of fit test for the optimal p ⅲ distribution as a hypothesis testing if the hypothesis testing with a 95 confidence interval is satisfied the optimal distribution of water availability is acceptable for the monte carlo sampling of the stochastic wefs nexus the samples of the state variables can be obtained from the stochastic wefs nexus simulation results to quantify the uncertainty of the state variables of the wefs nexus three indices that are the annual average value x standard deviation σ and coefficient of variation cv were adopted as shown in eqs 19 20 and 21 19 x 1 n q 1 n x q 20 σ 1 n q 1 n x q x 2 21 c v σ x where x q is the q th individual in the sample of the state variable and n is the sample size 2 4 uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the samples of the state variables of the wefs nexus can be obtained from the stochastic wefs nexus simulation inputted by the samples of water availability as the stochastic wefs nexus is nonlinear owing to the reservoir operation and heterogenetic input e g water availability and water demand the distributions of the output of the stochastic wefs nexus e g water shortage rate might not be the same as that of the inputs i e the p ⅲ distribution the normal lognormal exponential gamma weibull and generalized extreme value distributions were also tested to fit the distribution of water shortage rate to investigate the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the joint distributions of water availability and water shortage rates can be used to describe the uncertainty propagation the copula function can link multiple independent variables into a multivariate distribution by effectively capturing system dependence and has been extensively applied to multivariate uncertainty analysis of complex systems nelsen 2006 yin et al 2018 zhang et al 2021b it can be implemented to obtain the joint distributions after determining the distributions of water availability and water shortage rate as their marginal distributions according to the sklar s theorem in eq 22 22 f x y c u v where f is a joint distribution c denotes a copula function u and v denote the cumulative density functions of the variables x and y according to their marginal distribution functions respectively the archimedean copula comprising the gumbel hougaard clayton and frank copulas gaussian copula and student copula also named t copula is easily constructed and can effectively capture extensive dependence structures with different desirable properties in hydrologic analysis the copulas above are adopted here to construct the joint distributions of water availability and water shortage rate to describe the uncertainties propagation in the wefs nexus based on the joint distributions constructed by the copula function it is easy to determine the cumulative density functions of water shortage rates in the upstream and downstream operational zones under varied water availability conditions of the upstream operational zones the propagation of water availability uncertainty within the wefs nexus or from upstream to downstream can be investigated through their conditional distribution functions the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus are then assessed through inputting different water resources allocation schemes 3 case study 3 1 study area the hanjiang river is the largest tributary of the changjiang river the mid lower basin of hanjiang river basin mlhrb covers 63 800 km2 shown in fig 3 the danjiangkou reservoir the water source of the middle route of the south north water transfer project in china is located at the upper boundary of mlhrb the water availability in the mlhrb is thereby significantly affected by the reservoir operation of the water transfer project the energy consumption in the mlhrb is considerable due to the large population and industry as agriculture in the mlhrb is developed the mlhrb is taken as one of the nine major commodity grain bases in china the interconnections across water energy food and society systems in the mlhrb are intensifying due to socioeconomic development with fast urbanization the conflicts between the increasing the demands of water energy and food and their supply capacities are aggravating which has led to rising social concerns about resources shortages the resources management strategy for water energy and food based on the wefs nexus is desirable to increase resource use efficiencies and benefits in production and consumption in the mlhrb however under the impacts of human activities and climate change the water availability in the mlhrb exhibits strong uncertainty liu et al 2018 zeng et al 2021 the water availability uncertainty can challenge the water energy and food safeties in local area through the wefs nexus and may further propagate to downstream areas based on hydrologic connections the downstream water energy and food systems thus may be altered therefore the mlhrb is taken as the study area to investigate the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus twenty eight operational zones were sketched out by the superimposition of administrative units and sub basins to maintain consistent socioeconomic and hydrological data in the operational zones five types of water users i e municipal domesticity rural domesticity industry agricultural and in stream ecology water users were taken in each operational zone resulting in 140 water users in the water resources allocation model seventeen medium and large size reservoirs i e the total storage is more than 10 million m3 and two water transfer projects were taken to regulate water availability in water resource allocation the storage of all 17 reservoirs was 37 3 billion m3 the operational zones reservoirs and water transfer projects within the water system in the mlhrb were sketched as shown in fig 4 3 2 data sources the wefs nexus simulation was mainly driven by the hydrological and socioeconomic data the monthly water availability data of each operational zone from 1956 to 2016 were obtained from the changjiang water resources commission cwrc 2016 the characteristics of the 17 reservoirs were retrieved from the hubei provincial department of water resources hpdwr 2014 and were listed in tables s1 the socioeconomic data from 2010 to 2019 were collected from the yearbooks of hubei province including the annual population gdp crop area water use quota energy use quota and crop yield which were available at the statistical database of chinese economic and social development http data cnki net notably the agricultural water use quota is related to the precipitation frequency four typical exceedance frequencies i e p 50 75 90 and 95 are related to the wet normal dry extreme dry years respectively were estimated based on the frequency analysis method to predict the agricultural water demand series these historical data were further inputted into the wefs nexus model to predict the co evolution of the wefs nexus during 2010 2070 table 1 3 3 scenarios with water resources allocation schemes combining the water availability and water resources allocation schemes seven scenarios were set for the uncertainty analysis of the wefs nexus as listed in table 2 scenario ⅰ was set as the reference one its water resources allocation scheme and the calibrated parameters for the deterministic process of the wefs nexus simulation were set by zeng et al 2022 the water availability was based on the historical record while its wefs nexus simulation was stochastic in scenario ⅰ if there was no water resources allocation model and the water availability data were sampled from its distribution in the wefs nexus simulation the water availability uncertainty was analyzed for the wefs nexus as scenario ⅱ after setting the critical values for water shortage rates from 0 07 to 0 15 to avoid the explosion of environmental awareness zeng et al 2022 if there was the water resource allocation model in the wefs nexus simulation scenario ⅲ was set to analyze the impacts of water availability uncertainty on the wefs nexus by comparing it with the scenarios ⅱ the reservoir release multiplier q release was the ratio of the amount of water released from reservoir to that under the reference scenario according to reservoir operation rules the q release was used to indicate different water resources allocation schemes scenarios ⅳ ⅴ ⅵ and ⅶ were set to discuss the response of the wefs nexus simulation to different water resources allocation schemes according the sensitivity analysis results the reservoirs release multiplier was set between 0 5 and 1 5 zeng et al 2022 scenarios ⅳ ⅴ ⅵ and ⅶ were set with their q release at 0 5 0 75 1 25 and 1 5 respectively 4 results and discussion the uncertainty of the wefs nexus in the mlhrb was analyzed at monthly time step the co evolution of the wefs nexus was from 2010 to 2070 specifically an initial parameter sensitivity analysis for the stochastic wefs nexus was conducted to determine the noise intensities of the governing equations as described in section 2 2 the annual water availability from 1956 to 2016 was used to approximate the pdf of water availability according to the monthly ratios of water availability based on the historical hydrological data monthly water availability was obtained and inputted into the stochastic wefs nexus simulation the size of the monte carlo sampling was set to 1000 and the sample was tested to capture the pdfs of the state variables of the wefs nexus which were shown in fig s1 the outputs from the stochastic wefs nexus simulation were used to analyze the uncertainty of the wefs nexus the joint and conditional distributions of water availability and water shortage rates at upstream and downstream operational zones were derived through copula function to analyze the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus under the seven scenarios 4 1 uncertainty sources of the wefs nexus in the mlhrb the noise intensities are the key parameters for the stochastic process in the wefs nexus simulation as presented in eqs 10 16 to ensure the co evolution of the wefs nexus within the rational intervals an initial sensitivity analysis of the noise intensities was conducted to determine their values as listed in table 3 the rational intervals of the socioeconomic state variables i e population gdp crop area water use quota energy use quota and crop yield were based on their historical data and all their noise intensities were no more than 0 005 there were no historical data for environmental awareness as environmental awareness was a subjective variable that describes the societal perceptions of environmental degradation within the prevailing value systems environmental awareness was often reflected by media focus and was thus accompanied with larger uncertainty than the variables with historical data the noise intensity of environmental awareness was thus assumed to be 0 05 according to the initial sensitivity analysis the parameters of the p ⅲ distribution for the total water availability in the entire mlhrb were estimated by the maximum likelihood estimation parameters α β and a 0 values were 9 60 0 19 billion m 3 and 0 26 billion m3 respectively it was taken as the optimal distribution of the total water availability with the rmse of 0 0312 thus the pdf of the total water availability in the entire mlhrb was bell shaped and positive partial as shown in fig 5 and the total probability between 25 and 70 billion m3 was more than 95 the coefficients of variation cv and skewness cs were 0 645 and 0 321 respectively the ratio of cs to cv was 2 01 the p value was 0 8795 in the k s test with a 95 confidence level suggesting that the optimal p ⅲ distribution was capable to describe the water availability uncertainty and laid the foundation for monte carlo sampling 4 2 effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty of the wefs nexus at the whole mlhrb there are seven primary state variables in the wefs nexus that are water demand energy demand food production water supply rate energy supply rate food supply rate and environmental awareness these seven state variables were selected to investigate the potential effects of the water resources allocation on the total uncertainty of the wefs nexus the water supply priorities in the iras model from high to low were assigned as municipal and rural domesticity in stream ecology industrial and agricultural users according to the integrated water resources planning of hanjiang river basin cwrc 2016 table 4 listed water demand and water supply resulting from the water resources allocation model under seven scenarios table 5 listed the remaining five state variable values i e energy demand food production energy supply rate food supply rate and environmental awareness that were outputted from the wefs nexus simulation the average x and standard deviation σ from the samples quantified their uncertainties throughout the co evolution process to illustrate the evolution processes of the state variables of the stochastic wefs nexus under the impacts of water availability uncertainty and water resources allocation the trajectories of the average values and the intervals at 95 confidence level under scenarios ⅰ ⅱ and ⅲ were determined and shown in fig 6 4 2 1 response of the uncertainty of the wefs nexus to water resources allocation to investigate the stochasticity of the wefs nexus the results of scenario ⅰ showed that the co evolution of the wefs nexus simulation was slightly altered by the noises water demand was directly affected by socioeconomic variables i e population gdp crop area and their water use quotas as shown in fig 6 a the average water demand was 17 02 billion m3 and its standard deviation was 0 23 billion m3 the water demand was satisfied and the water supply rate shown in fig 6 d showed little response to the noises the uncertainty of the agricultural water supply was small with a standard deviation of 0 12 which accounted for that the food production increased with small uncertainty shown in fig 6 c the average food production was 6529 thousand tons with a standard deviation of 178 thousand tons for the energy system the energy demand in the water supply process with a small standard deviation of 27 million kw h was altered by the water supply shown in fig 6 b however the total planning energy availability was less than the energy demand owing to socioeconomic expansion the energy supply cannot be ensured and the energy supply rate was typically lower than its critical value i e 95 as detailed in zeng et al 2022 as shown in fig 6 e which led to the accumulation of environmental awareness the variability in the energy supply rate contributed to the uncertainty in the evolution of environmental awareness as shown in fig 6 g as the environmental awareness often kept at a low level and rarely exceeded its critical value of 8 0 in the evolution process shown in fig 6 g the environmental awareness feedback on socioeconomic variables was rarely triggered or only triggered with little intensity thus the impacts of the uncertainty of environmental awareness owing to its noises on the wefs nexus were not evident the impacts of water availability uncertainty on the stochastic wefs nexus were determined by comparing the differences in the results between scenarios ⅰ and ⅲ the wefs nexus was remarkably altered by the water availability uncertainty the average water demand decreased from 17 02 billion m3 under scenario ⅰ to 15 96 billion m3 under scenario ⅲ while its standard deviation increased from 0 23 to 0 90 billion m3 although there were few differences in the supply rates of water energy and food between scenarios ⅰ and ⅲ their standard deviations increased remarkably the average environmental awareness increased from 5 83 under scenario ⅰ to 7 46 under scenario ⅲ and its standard deviation simultaneously increased from 0 63 to 2 63 the increasing uncertainty of environmental awareness further led to larger variability of the co evolution of the wefs nexus through environmental awareness feedback under the impacts of noises the differences between the scenarios ⅱ and ⅲ can indicate the impacts of water resources allocation on the uncertainty of the wefs nexus the purpose of the water resources allocation model was to ensure water supply the total water supply rate increased from 84 74 to 93 45 and the standard deviation decreased from 3 37 to 1 78 under the scenarios ⅱ and ⅲ respectively as the water resources allocation model was integrated with scenarios ⅲ the water supply rates of industrial and agricultural users increased from 79 19 and 84 27 to 90 03 and 93 4 respectively their standard deviations also decreased from 4 35 and 3 99 to 1 72 and 2 40 respectively thus the uncertainties decreased as much water was stored in the reservoirs during the flood season and released during the dry season the water shortage was remarkably alleviated due to the uneven temporal distribution of water availability the impacts of the variability of the monthly water availability were also decreased as the water inflow was stored in reservoirs based on seasonal or annual operational rules the impacts of the uncertainties of water availability on water supply were thereby alleviated through reservoir operation under the scenarios ⅲ with the increased agricultural water supply rate the food production increased from 5572 to 6362 thousand tons the considerable average environmental awareness caused by the water shortage and food shortage thereby decreased from 14 75 to 7 46 with smaller uncertainty negative feedback driven by environmental awareness then resulted in lower uncertainty for the co evolution of the wefs nexus there are four phases in the co evolution of the wefs nexus when water resources allocation was considered expansion contraction recession and recovery phases zeng et al 2022 as the wefs nexus performed differently in different phases the response of wefs nexus uncertainty to water resources allocation was analyzed in these four phases for the entire mlhrb under scenario ⅲ in the expansion phase i e 2010 2032 most water and energy demands can be satisfied the accumulation of environmental awareness was mainly due to food shortages as shown in fig 6 f as water resources allocation can effectively alleviate the impacts of water availability uncertainty on water supply the uncertainties in agricultural water supply and food production decreased although environmental awareness increased with increasing water and food shortages the 95 confidence interval of environmental awareness was small as shown in fig 6 g the socioeconomic sectors and the wefs nexus can expand with a high confidence level in the expansion phase however during the contraction i e 2033 2039 and recession phases i e 2040 2045 as water availability could not cover the increasing water demand most water was directly released from the reservoir rather than being stored in reservoir water availability was poorly regulated by reservoir thus the water availability uncertainty directly impacted the water supply and increased the uncertainties of the evolution of energy demand and the food production through the wefs nexus shown in fig 6 b and c as the environmental awareness was positively correlated with water and energy shortage rates environmental awareness exhibits high uncertainty due to the high uncertainties of water and energy shortage rates in the contraction and recession phases the evolution of socioeconomic variables was altered by environmental awareness feedback under the impacts of noises the water demand projected by the socioeconomic variables thereby also exhibited uncertainty although environmental awareness decreased in the recovery phase i e 2046 2070 its uncertainty was not negligible in the co evolution of the wefs nexus through the dynamics of the state variables at the end of the recession phase therefore water resources allocation can effectively decrease the water supply uncertainty through reservoirs operation the uncertainty in the wefs nexus also decreases however if the water demand exceeds the regulating capacity of the water system the reservoirs can poorly regulate the water flow and the stress on water supply increases water availability uncertainty can remarkably impact the water supply and leads to the high uncertainties in the wefs through its nexus 4 2 2 impacts of water resources allocation schemes on the uncertainty of the wefs nexus to obtain the optimal water resources allocation scheme it was necessary to conduct the different water resources allocation schemes for the uncertainty of the wefs nexus the differences among scenarios ⅲ ⅳ ⅴ ⅵ and ⅶ indicated the sensitivities of the uncertainty of the wefs nexus to the reservoir release multipliers q release there were few differences in the water supply rate ranging from 93 11 to 93 61 among these five scenarios water availability was abundant across the entire mlhrb so the water demand was often satisfied the standard deviations of water supply rate were 2 12 1 93 1 78 1 80 and 1 87 under the scenarios ⅳ ⅴ ⅲ ⅵ and ⅶ respectively and they were not linear with the q release values as less water was released with a smaller q release value e g the q release of scenarios ⅳ and ⅴ were 0 50 and 0 75 respectively more water was stored in the reservoir once the water level exceeded the normal water level of the reservoir water was directly released downstream through the spillway more water released from reservoir with larger q release values e g the q release under scenarios ⅵ and ⅶ were 1 25 and 1 50 respectively and the regulation on water availability through the reservoir decreased the water availability uncertainty slightly decreased thus the uncertainty in the corresponding water supply cannot be efficiently alleviated by reservoir operation the standard deviations of energy demand and food production further increased from 199 million kw h and 456 thousand tons under scenario ⅲ to 209 219 million kw h and 487 497 thousand tons under scenarios ⅵ and ⅶ respectively these uncertainties in water supply energy demand and food production have influenced socioeconomic expansion through environmental awareness feedback the uncertainty in the corresponding socioeconomic water demand has increased therefore policymakers should pay more attention to the regulating capacity of reservoirs in water resources management in a basin which is an effective way to decrease the impacts of water availability uncertainties on water demand to ensure the co evolution of the wefs nexus 4 3 effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus within the mlhbr water resources allocation can effectively alleviate the impacts of the water availability uncertainty on the water supply through reservoir operation to ensure the co evolution of the wefs nexus however as the water flows from upstream to downstream water availability uncertainty also propagates from upstream to downstream the responses of water supply energy demand and food production to the uncertainty of water availability differed in upstream and downstream areas owing to the uneven distribution of reservoirs within the basin according to the responses of the water supply from the water resources allocation model to the water availability uncertainty in every operational zone the operational zones in the mlhrb can be categorized into three types shown in fig 7 if the water supply could be assured and impacted by the water availability uncertainty in an operational zone the zone was taken as type a if the water shortage can be effectively alleviated by water resources allocation and the impacts of water availability uncertainty on water supply can be remarkably alleviated the zone was taken as type b there was no negligible water shortage in a zone and its water supply was remarkably affected by the water availability uncertainty the zone was taken as type c considering the hydrologic connections between the upstream and downstream zones four types of routes for uncertainty propagation within the mlhrb can be found the route i was from type a to type a zones whereas the route ii was from type b to a type a zones the route iii was from type b to type b zones whereas the route iv was from type c to type a zones specifically eight operational zones selected to show the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus within the mlhrb z25 xiantao and z26 wuhan with the route i z2 shennongjia and z3 baokang with the route ii z19 jingshan and z21 yingcheng with the route iii and z13 jingmenshuanghe and z14 zhongxiangshuanghe with the route iv the average and standard deviation values of the water demand water supply rate energy demand and food production were listed in table 6 as water availability for an operational zone contains water flows from upstream in addition to the local water availability table 7 listed the water availability from an upstream zone thus water availability uncertainty can propagate from upstream to downstream the uncertainty of the wefs nexus varied in different phases during the co evolution of the wefs nexus as discussed in section 4 2 1 the uncertainty emerged in the contraction phase which was the vital phase therefore a representative year 2035 in the contractions phase was selected to study the uncertainty propagation the water flowing from the upstream to downstream operational zones were listed in table 7 4 3 1 response of the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus to water resources allocation the response of uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus to water resources allocation varied through different routes the uncertainty of upstream water availability was remarkably alleviated when it propagated downstream through the routes i ii and iv whereas it was not efficiently alleviated through the route iii in the case study taking the uncertainty propagation routes iv as an example the water supply rate in z13 was slightly increased by water resources allocation from 62 32 under scenario ⅱ to 65 40 under scenario ⅲ as there was few water storage capacity for regulating the local water availability by the reservoir operation the impacts of water availability uncertainty on the water supply slightly increased and the standard deviation of the water supply rate increased from 9 20 to 10 49 the uncertainty of the water released from z13 increased with the coefficients of variation increasing from 0 12 under scenario ⅱ to 0 13 under scenario ⅲ the water released from z13 then flowed into the downstream z14 through the river network interestingly the water supply in z14 was ensured and the uncertainty of water flow from z13 had little impacts on its water supply as the main water availability source in z14 was from the main stream of hanjiang river there was a large water storage capacity from the r3 danjiangkou reservoir with a total storage of 33 91 billion m3 as shown in fig 3 to regulate the water availability uncertainty and ensure water supply the impacts of the water availability uncertainty in upstream z13 on the water supply in downstream z14 decreased the water supply rates in z14 under scenarios ⅱ and ⅲ were greater than 91 62 and their standard deviations were less than 0 64 the water supply rates in z13 were less than 65 40 and the corresponding standard deviations were greater than 10 49 thus water availability uncertainty was alleviated through the routes iv from z13 to z14 a similar uncertainty propagation can be found in routes i from z25 to z26 and route ii from z2 to z3 most of the water availability in z25 and z26 was from the main stream of the hanjiang river that was regulated by the dangjiangkou reservoir their water supplies were ensured and the impacts of uncertainty of local water availability were decreased by the upstream reservoir operation if the water resources allocation model was considered the water supply rates in z25 and z26 were more than 99 with small standard deviations as the water flowed along with the route ii from z2 to z3 with high uncertainty and the standard deviations were 15 and 14 million m3 and the coefficients of variation of 0 10 and 0 08 under scenario ⅱ and scenario ⅲ respectively water availability in z3 was regulated by the r1 sanliping and r2 siping reservoirs respectively as shown in fig 3 the water supply rate in z3 was 99 99 and its standard deviation was 0 07 under the scenario ⅲ whereas the water supply rate was 79 01 and its standard deviation was 7 86 in z2 the impacts of the upstream water availability uncertainty on water supply were alleviated as the water storage capacities in both z19 and z21 were insufficient to cover the corresponding water demands and they were connected through the route iii the upstream water availability uncertainty did not fade as the standard deviations of the water supply rate were 4 68 and 4 63 in z19 and z21 respectively to quantify the upstream water availability uncertainty propagation to downstream the joint distributions of both the water availability and water shortage rate in z19 water availability in z19 and the water shortage rate in z21 under scenarios ⅱ and ⅲ were estimated their conditional distributions were determined based on the joint distributions as shown in figs 8 and 9 respectively as there was no water resources allocation model in the scenario ⅱ the water shortage rates in z19 fell between 8 and 45 there were little differences between the cumulative density function curves shown in fig 8 a if the water availability was less than 800 million m3 the water shortage rate was typically greater than 15 which was the critical value of evoking the water shortage awareness accumulation under scenario ⅱ leading to an increase in environmental awareness the evolution of environmental awareness was accompanied by uncertainty due to the noises as discussed in section 4 2 1 if the environmental awareness value exceeded its critical value environmental awareness feedback impacted the evolution of water demand by regulating socioeconomic expansion the uncertainty then propagated into the water demand and further into the water supply and water shortage rate therefore the water shortage rate uncertainty was considerable because of the model stochasticity when water availability was low and further challenged the whole wefs through its nexus since the water availability was greater than 800 million m3 the water shortage decreased remarkably the water shortage rates were often less than its critical value as shown in fig 8 a environmental awareness decreased and the impacts of environmental awareness feedback on socioeconomic variables also diminished the uncertainty of water demand decreased and the uncertainty of the water shortage rate decreased the water shortage rates interval for the most distribution gradually narrowed from 8 45 to 8 12 as the water availability increased from 800 to 1400 million m3 shown in fig 8 a the uncertainty of the co evolution of the wefs decreased through its nexus if the water availability was greater than 1400 million m3 the corresponding water shortage rates were less than the critical value little environmental awareness accumulated and environmental awareness feedback was rarely triggered the uncertainty of the wefs nexus was mainly due to the noises in the dynamics of socioeconomic variables and its impacts on the wefs nexus were much smaller than those from the water availability uncertainty as discussed in section 4 1 as the water released from z19 flowed into z21 through the route iii the water availability uncertainty in z19 propagated into z21 from upstream to downstream the average value and standard deviation of the water flowing from z19 to z21 were 126 and 24 million m3 respectively with the coefficient of variation of 0 19 the uncertainty of the water supply in z21 increased owing to the uncertainty propagation of the water availability in z19 if the water availability was less than 800 million m3 the water shortage rate in z21 fell between 8 and 25 as shown in fig 8 b the water supply uncertainty in z21 was remarkably increased by the uncertainty propagation of water availability in upstream z19 which was the response of the water supply in z21 to the water availability uncertainty in z19 as the water resources allocation model was taken under scenario ⅲ the water shortage in z19 decreased through reservoir operation benefiting the co evolution of the wefs nexus the average values of water demand energy demand and food production remarkably increased from 248 million m3 to 466 million m3 26 million kw h to 82 million kw h and 332 thousand tons to 363 thousand tons respectively the average water supply rate increased from 84 42 to 90 86 and the corresponding water demand significantly increased the critical water availability to ensure the water supply in z19 decreased from 1400 million m3 under scenario ⅱ to 1250 million m3 under scenario ⅲ as the local water availability was effectively regulated through water resources allocation the water shortage rate was less than 7 and did not exceed its critical value shown in fig 9 a which was much smaller than the corresponding water shortage rate of 15 shown in fig 8 a thus there was a low level of environmental awareness the co evolution of the wefs nexus was slightly affected by environmental awareness feedback on socioeconomic expansion the uncertainty in water shortage rate increased with a decrease in water availability when the water availability ranged from 1250 to 800 million m3 the interval of the water shortage rate expanded from 0 7 to 0 30 shown in fig 9 a whereas the corresponding interval expanded from 8 12 to 8 45 shown in fig 8 a as the decreasing water demand was often less than the decreasing water availability the water shortage rate might have exceeded its critical value in evoking the accumulation of environmental awareness thus water demand uncertainty increased with increasing environmental awareness and further propagated into the wefs through its nexus if the water availability was less than 800 million m3 the water shortage was considerable and cannot be completely relieved by water resources allocation the water shortage rate fell between 0 and 30 shown in fig 9 a and easily exceeded the critical value there was high level environmental awareness which further altered the evolution of socioeconomic variables for water demand projection through its feedback under the impacts of noises owing to the water demand uncertainty the water supply uncertainty increased and the uncertainty of the wefs further increased through its nexus as the water supply in z19 was ensured by water resources allocation the average value of the water flowing from z19 to z21 increased from 126 to 279 million m3 and the coefficient of variation decreased from 0 19 to 0 11 the water supply in z21 was regulated by the r17 gaoguan reservoir shown in fig 3 and the impacts of the water availability uncertainty in z19 on the water supply in z21 were alleviated the average water supply rate increased from 86 06 to 97 09 the water shortage rate in z21 mainly fell in the range of 0 7 with varied water availability as shown in fig 9 b all water shortage rates were below the critical value and the environmental awareness accumulation was rarely evoked the impacts of the water availability uncertainty of upstream z19 on downstream z21 were effectively alleviated through the regulations on water flow by the r16 huiting reservoir in z19 and r17 gaoguan reservoir in z21 the standard deviation of water supply rate in z21 decreased from 4 48 to 3 3 the water supply uncertainty had little impacts on the evolution of energy demand and food production and their standard deviations decreased from 2 2 to 2 1 million kw h and from 27 to 22 thousand tons respectively therefore the water storage capacity is vital in alleviating the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the larger the water storage capacity size the greater the alleviation of the water availability uncertainty on water supply through reservoir operation as environmental awareness decreases the uncertainty from environmental awareness feedback decreases during its propagation in the wefs nexus the smaller the water storage capacity size the fewer the alleviation of water availability uncertainty on water supply the water availability uncertainty propagated into the water supply and the water supply uncertainty increased particularly when the water availability could not satisfy water demand thus environmental awareness increased environmental awareness feedback under the impacts of noises can lead to the uncertainty of socioeconomic expansion the uncertainty further propagated into the water demand and increased the uncertainty of the co evolution of the wefs of downstream zones through the water flowing from upstream into downstream zones the proposed framework for assessing the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus can aid the comprehensive resources management of water energy and food in areas where the wefs is remarkably altered by upstream water availability uncertainty especially for the transboundary river basins as the riparian countries have different developmental goals the different water resources management strategies from upstream to downstream have become an important issue for instance the mekong river basin in asia gao et al 2021 nile river basin in africa elsayed et al 2020 and columbia river basin in north america zhang et al 2021a taking the nile river basin as a case the wefs safety of downstream egypt can be severely challenged by the water availability uncertainty of upstream sudan with the reservoir operation of the upstream aswan dam the upstream water availability uncertainty was effectively decreased and the water supply was significantly increased which further ensured the rapid socioeconomic expansion of egypt through its nexus strzepek et al 2008 the proposed framework has considerable potential for riparian countries cooperation in transboundary river basins to handle the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus 4 3 2 impacts of water resources allocation schemes on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus the uncertainty propagation showed little response to the different water resources allocation schemes under scenarios ⅲ ⅳ ⅴ ⅵ and ⅶ through the routes i ii and iv the varied q release values determined the amount of water release from the reservoir and influenced the water supply uncertainty as discussed in section 4 2 2 the average values of water flow from upstream to downstream from z25 to z26 through the route i from z2 to z3 through route ii and from z13 to z14 through route iv ranged from 736 to 827 million m3 from 167 to 183 million m3 from 75 to 77 million m3 respectively in comparison the corresponding standard deviations ranged from 14 to 17 million m3 from 68 to 81 million m3 from 9 9 to 10 2 million m3 respectively the water availability uncertainties propagated downstream but were efficiently alleviated through the reservoir operation with large water storage capacities in downstream zones as discussed in section 4 3 1 thus water supplies were ensured and there were few differences in the water supply rates in z26 z3 and z14 under different water resources allocation schemes as the water storage capacities of downstream zones through the route iii were insufficient to satisfy the water demands the water shortages in downstream zones were related to the q release values the uncertainty propagation of water availability was sensitive to water resources allocation schemes through reservoir operation the conditional distributions of water availability and water shortage rate in z19 and z21 reflected the impacts of water resources allocation schemes on the uncertainty propagation through the route iii as shown in figs 10 11 12 and 13 under scenarios ⅳ ⅴ ⅵ and ⅶ respectively the q release value decreased from 1 00 under scenario ⅲ to 0 75 and 0 50 under scenarios ⅴ and ⅳ respectively the uncertainty in the water shortage rates in both z19 and z21 increased a smaller q release value indicated the decreased water release from the reservoir the average water supply rate in z19 decreased from 90 86 under scenario ⅲ to 88 96 and 87 46 under scenarios ⅴ and ⅳ respectively the corresponding standard deviations increased from 5 17 to 6 15 and 7 16 respectively a lager environmental awareness has been accumulated subsequently the impacts of environmental awareness feedback on socioeconomic expansion for water demand projection increased the uncertainty of water demand propagated into the water supply through the water resources allocation the average water flow from z19 to z21 decreased from 279 million m3 under scenario ⅲ to 256 and 228 million m3 under scenarios ⅴ and ⅳ respectively while their standard deviation increased from 32 to 33 and 34 million m3 respectively thus the water supply uncertainty in z21 increased owing to the increasing uncertainty of the water flow from z19 as the storage capacity of the r17 gaoguan reservoir was insufficient to alleviate the water availability uncertainty propagated from z19 the wefs uncertainty in z21 increased through its nexus as discussed in section 4 3 1 the standard deviations of water demand energy demand and food production in z21 increased from 46 million m3 12 million kw h and 38 thousand tons under scenario ⅲ to 50 million m3 12 million kw h and 40 thousand tons under scenario ⅴ and 55 million m3 13 million kw h and 44 thousand tons under scenario ⅳ respectively interestingly the smaller the q release value the larger the uncertainty of water shortage rates particularly when the water availability was limited as shown in figs 9 10 and 11 if the water availability in z19 was less than 800 million m3 the interval of water shortage rate in z19 expanded from 0 to 33 under scenario ⅲ to 0 38 and 0 42 under scenarios ⅴ and ⅳ respectively as the water supply decreased with decreasing q release value the water shortage increased and further increased the environmental awareness the uncertainty of environmental awareness due to its noises propagated into water demand through environmental awareness feedback on socioeconomic sectors water demand uncertainty further increased the uncertainties of the water supply and water shortage rate through water resources allocation there were few differences between the cumulative density function curves of the water shortage rates in z19 and z21 as shown in figs 9 10 and 11 when the water availability in z19 was more than 1400 million m3 as their water supplies were ensured a similar method can be used to analyze the schemes with larger q release values under scenarios ⅵ and ⅶ e g the q release value were 1 25 and 1 50 respectively although water release increased with a larger q release value the water supply in z19 barely increased the average water supply rate ranged from 90 86 to 91 67 and the standard deviation ranged from 5 05 to 5 17 it was more difficult to maintain the reservoir at its normal water level with a larger q release value although the water supply can be ensured in the flood season the water supply stress during the dry season increased with limited water storage capacity and water availability thus there were few differences between the cumulative density function curves of the water shortage rates in z19 and z21 as shown in figs 9 12 and 13 it was found that the uncertainty propagation of water availability was insensitive to the water resources allocation schemes therefore policymakers have two manners to handle the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus a implementing optimal water resources allocation schemes in the area with few regulating capacity of the water system within a basin and b regulating the local socioeconomic expansion to keep the water demand from over speed increase as local water safety is ensured the water availability uncertainty propagated from upstream can be effectively alleviated and further the wefs can be ensured through its nexus 5 conclusion this study proposed a framework to assess the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus for the comprehensive management of water energy and food under uncertainties the white gaussian noises were integrated into seven primary governing equations of the system dynamic model for the wefs nexus to express the uncertainty of the model structure transforming the wefs nexus model from deterministic to stochastic the copula function was adopted to quantify the uncertainty propagation by estimating the joint distributions between the water availability and shortage rate in the upstream and downstream zones based on the monte carlo simulation of the stochastic wefs nexus model the effects of water resources allocation on the uncertainty propagation in the wefs nexus were analyzed by investigating the response of wefs to different water resources allocation schemes according to the results of the case study in the mlhrb china water availability uncertainty is the main source of the uncertainty in the wefs nexus a rational water resources allocation scheme can efficiently improve water shortage and diminish the impacts of water availability uncertainty on water supply through reservoir operation food production increases remarkably as the agricultural water supply is ensured high level environmental awareness evoked by water or food shortages decreases and ensures the co evolution of the wefs nexus the water availability uncertainty in the upstream zone propagates to downstream zone by the water flow through their hydrologic connections the water storage capacity of a reservoir for water regulation in an operational zone is the vital factor in regulating the uncertainty propagation within a basin if there is sufficient water storage capacity in a zone the impacts of water availability uncertainty in the upstream zone can be alleviated through reservoir operation there is no significant response of the wefs through its nexus to different water resources allocation schemes if there is few water storage capacity in a zone its water supply is significantly influenced by water availability uncertainty in the upstream zone water supply is hardly ensured and is sensitive to different water resources allocation schemes water and food shortages evoke an accumulation of environmental awareness environmental awareness feedback under the impacts of model structure uncertainty i e the noises further increases the water demand uncertainty by altering socioeconomic expansion particularly when the water availability is much less than the water demand then the water supply uncertainty increases and propagates into the wefs through its nexus water availability uncertainty is the primary uncertainty for the co evolution of the wefs nexus in this study the pdf of water availability was estimated by stationary hydrologic frequency analysis method however the stationary assumption of water availability has been remarkably challenged under the impacts of human activities and climate change the nonstationarity of water availability can bring risks to the wefs through its nexus and further challenge sustainable development goals therefore more attention should be paid to

8989,estimation of evapotranspiration et and yield over cropland is essential for water resources management and food security particularly the estimation at long term and regional scales still needs to be investigated in this study a remotely sensed and water carbon coupled model was combined with a process based crop growth simulation method to simultaneously estimate et and yield the developed model was tested for two of the most important crops wheat and maize with years of observations leaf area index determined by various remote sensing indices and individually calibrated parameters for wheat and maize were considered to improve crop et and gross primary production gpp estimates the parameters well reflected different physiological properties that c4 maize has a smaller stomatal conductance coefficient and a larger sensitivity in response to initial light than c3 wheat comparing with 20 years of measurements the root mean square error rmse of et and gpp for winter wheat was 0 57 mm d 1 and 1 65 g c m 2 d 1 and for maize were 0 80 mm d 1 and 2 92 g c m 2 d 1 respectively besides crop growth simulation including biomass accumulation and allocation agreed well with the measurements coefficient of determination was mostly larger than 0 66 and rmse of yield was 554 7 and 1346 6 kg hm 2 for wheat and maize respectively finally the spatiotemporal crop water productivity wp of winter wheat and summer maize in the north china plain during 2001 2018 were quantified the increased wp of winter wheat while the larger wp of maize than that of wheat were discovered the developed model helps to examine regional crop et and yield and provides critical information on agricultural water management keywords evapotranspiration gross primary production yield remote sensing wheat and maize crop water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et and gross primary production gpp are the crucial fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere ahmadi et al 2021 mohammadi mehdizadeh 2020 suyker and verma 2010 zhang et al 2019 and help water resource management and crop productivity assessment for agroecosystems with the increasing demand for water resources food and land dalin et al 2015 great efforts have been made to estimate et and agricultural production in croplands such as china south korea and the united states huang et al 2018 qiao et al 2020 sakamoto et al 2013 wu et al 2020 remote sensing methods have been applied to quantify et at large spatial scale wang et al 2022 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a glenn et al 2007 classified remote sensing based et models mainly into the empirical and physical methods and each has its advantage and limitation some empirical methods establish the relationship between remote sensing vegetation indices vis with crop coefficient and then obtain crop et combined with potential et er raki et al 2007 et i e latent heat can also be calculated as a residual of the energy balance equation in the physical methods yang et al 2015 the upscaling of land surface temperature on satellite passing time and the selection of dry and wet pixels in heterogeneous surfaces are the key points tang et al 2013 in addition the widely used modis et product adopts the physical penman monteith pm approach combining energy transfer and aerodynamic processes with remote sensing vi mu et al 2007 2011 recent years application of data assimilation and fusion techniques and utilization of latest sensor and machine leaning technologies further assist in producing robust and long term et estimates fang et al 2020 hadadi et al 2022 mehdizadeh et al 2021 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2016a benefiting from remote sensing vis some models were proposed to estimate crop yield guan et al 2016 lobell et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a which was suggested to be classified into three categories lobell 2013 the simplest approach is to establish the empirical relationships between ground based yield measures and remote sensing vis shanahan et al 2001 for example the wide dynamic range vegetation index wdrvi before maize silking stage was suggested to have a strong linear relationship with yield sakamoto et al 2013 another class of models is integrating remote sensing data into complex crop models of which parameters would need to be adjusted on a pixel by pixel basis and some parameters may be unavailable at regional scale doraiswamy et al 2005 lobell et al 2015 the third category relies on the light use efficiency lue method which states that total biomass production is proportional to total absorption of photosynthetically active radiation par khabba et al 2020 the lue based model has been validated for yield of corn soybean or other crops in the united states he et al 2018 wu et al 2020 crop et and carbon assimilation are regulated by stomatal physiological activities and determine water use efficiency or crop water productivity wp at canopy level hu and lei 2021 ryu et al 2011 which was essential for variety cultivation irrigation schedule and agronomic management however less remote sensing models have concerned coupled estimation of et and yield in cropland crop modelling at the site scale or the statistical yield based on administrative divisions could not well reflect their spatiotemporal pattern integrating the carbon assimilation and pm equation by stomatal conductance some water carbon coupled methods were developed to simultaneously estimate ecosystems et and gpp at large spatial scale luo et al 2018 ryu et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 the coupled model requires consistent satellite inputs to maintain internal consistency between et and gpp estimates which could be applied for causality analysis of water use efficiency zhang et al 2019 this kind of models has been applied for global ecosystems and the gpp output is closely related to crop biomass production which is possibly able to simulate crop growth and yield campioli et al 2015 peng et al 2013 zhang et al 2021a while only a few remotely sensed and water carbon coupled models have been extended to croplands huang et al 2018 and seldom is applied to simultaneously estimate et and yield for different crop types maize and wheat are two of the most important crops for humans caloric energy erenstein et al 2021 estimated that one third and one fifth of global farms in 2020 cultivated maize and wheat respectively cereal crops maize wheat and rice in china accounted for 59 of total planting area and 92 of grain production in 2017 luo et al 2020 besides agricultural water consumption as the largest item accounts for more than 60 of total water consumption in china estimating et and yield at the same time rather than isolated has more important significance in agricultural water management and it should also be considered that different physiological characteristics exist between c3 wheat and c4 maize in water carbon coupling process quantification of et and yield related processes during crop growth period based on remote sensing better reflects the spatiotemporal variation of crop wp the main objectives of this study were to 1 incorporate the process based crop growth simulation method into a remotely sensed and water carbon coupled model to estimate et and yield for wheat and maize 2 evaluate the reliability of the developed model by comparing the estimated et gpp crop biomatter accumulation and yield against 20 site years of measurements and 3 estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of et and yield to examine crop wp of wheat and maize in the north china plain ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and data collection data used in this study are collected from two areas i e the ncp and hetao irrigation district hid fig 1 the ncp with an area of 4 105 km2 is the largest grain production base in china and summer maize winter wheat rotation cropping system dominates this area fang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013a 2013b irrigation and climate conditions in the ncp are spatially heterogeneous which altered cropland water and carbon fluxes wang et al 2023 summer maize grows mainly during june to october and winter wheat grows mainly from october to june in next year the hid is the third largest irrigation area in china with an irrigated area of 1 12 104 km2 benefiting from large irrigation water from the yellow river the hid is also an important grain production area where spring maize is one of the main crop types chen et al 2018 wu et al 2017 the experimental observations from four sites in two areas were collected fig 1 and the available data are listed in table 1 the observations from three flux tower sites hetao 2017 2018 weishan 2005 2015 and yucheng 2003 2010 were considered to test et and gpp estimates since the availability of both eddy covariance ec fluxes and crop biomass the observations at hetao site from the hid were necessary to validate the fluxes and crop growth estimations at different sites the turbulent h2o and co2 fluxes between crop canopy and the atmosphere were measured by ec system suyker and verma 2010 wang et al 2020b the raw high frequent data were processed using the eddypro li cor inc lincoln usa software which allows for several corrections such as air density fluctuations frequency response sonic anemometer tilt correction coordinate rotation using the planar fit method and so on wagle et al 2018 hu and lei 2021 the spike detection and removal were also involved 90 of the fluxes originated from the observed cropland around the flux tower within about 400 m and energy balance closure larger than 0 6 indicated the reliability of the fluxes hu and lei 2021 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2020b then 30 min time series of net ecosystem exchange nee sensible heat h and latent heat le were obtained et was converted from le referring to the latent heat of vaporization nee was partitioned into gpp and ecosystem respiration reco fluxes nee reco gpp using the reddyproc wutzler et al 2018 this tool provides a standard co2 focused routine for reading half hourly data estimating friction velocity threshold as well as gap filling flux partitioning with ancillary meteorological data of friction velocity radiation air or soil temperature and vapor pressure deficit details about the flux partitioning process can be seen at https www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocweb crop growth measurements mainly including dry biomass and leaf area index lai were obtained by repeated at least three samplings each time during crop growing season leaf areas of plant samplings were measured and then used to calculate lai according to plant density wang et al 2020a details in supplementary material crop sampling maize at hetao and yucheng sites wheat at luancheng and yucheng sites was cut into the aboveground part including stem leaves and grain components and root part then each component was oven dried to obtain actual biomass partitioning coefficients crop yield was measured by grain threshing and air oven drying each component and total biomass were used to evaluate the allocation of carbon assimilation and crop growth simulation in addition the measurements of meteorological data such as net radiation air temperature relative humidity air pressure precipitation and wind speed were obtained by the meteorological station 2 2 development of resem for coupled estimation of et and yield the remote sensing based cropland ecohydrological model resem was developed by combing the water carbon coupled pml penman monteith leuning version 2 model with a process based crop growth module fig 2 the remote sensing canopy characteristics and meteorological forcing factors were used to estimate et and gpp in the pml framework then based on the gpp series during crop growth period crop biomass accumulation of each component and yield were simulated by the crop growth module the modelling processes are described in detail as follows 2 2 1 brief description of the pml model in the pml framework the pm approach and stomatal conductance g s model leuning et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 were considered to simultaneously estimate vegetation et components and gpp gan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the g s model leuning 1995 yu et al 2004 was adopted to simulate the stomatal conductance in response to light temperature and gross assimilation 1 g s m a g c a 1 d d 0 where m is the stomatal conductance coefficient a g is leaf gross assimilation c a is co2 concentration in the air and d 0 is the parameter reflecting the stomatal response to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit d considering the responses of leaf gross assimilation rate to the environmental variables a g was calculated by thornley 1976 2 a g a m β i η c a a m β i a m η c a β i η c a where β is the initial slope of the light response curve to the assimilation rate η is the initial slope of the co2 response curve to the assimilation rate i is the flux density of par and a m is the maximum photosynthetic rate when both i and c a are saturated which approximates half of the maximum catalytic capacity of rubisco per unit leaf area v m then integrating leaf level g s and a g by lai canopy conductance gc and canopy gross assimilation can be calculated as 3 g c m p 1 k q p 2 p 4 k q lai ln p

abbreviations of the combined parameters of a m β η and variables of i 0 the flux density of par at the top of the canopy and c a in addition a constraint function including the parameters of d max and d min is included to reflect the effect of d on gpp the above equations show that the vapor pressure deficit term 1 1 d do indicates stomatal closure with increasing d in the water carbon coupling process of this model the effect of vpd representing the water limitations was introduced soil water limitations on gc could be not only captured by changes in light interception or lai term but also reflected by atmospheric vpd the pm equation was used to estimate plant transpiration et and soil evaporation es 5 e t ε a c ρ c p γ d a g a ε 1 g a g c 6 e s f ε a s ε 1 where ε is the ratio of s to

extinction coefficient of available energy k a ρ is air density c p is the specific heat of air at constant pressure g a is the aerodynamic conductance and f is a dimensionless variable that determines the water availability for es considering precipitation and equilibrium evaporation rate the input data contain the meteorological variables including air temperature air pressure vapor pressure radiations longwave downward radiation precipitation and wind speed and remote sensing data including lai albedo and emissivity net radiation was calculated by albedo emissivity shortwave longwave downward radiations and temperature more details of the pml model can be found in zhang et al 2019 the resem was developed for agroecosystems in which the parameters were specified for wheat and maize while the original pml model was designed for global ecosystems and crops were defined as one plant function type with one set of parameters i e the fixed parameters for all crops this ignored the difference in photosynthesis between crops particularly c3 wheat and c4 maize yan et al 2009 zhang et al 2008 therefore the parameters were individually calibrated for wheat and maize in this study similar to zhang et al 2019 the sum of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for et and gpp was maximized to determine the parameters for each crop using a global optimization method the pattern search algorithm implemented in matlab the mathworks inc 2018 the model performance was evaluated using four indices the linear regression slope coefficient of determination r2 nse and root mean square error rmse 2 2 2 crop growth simulation for wheat and maize the estimated gpp series were used to simulate dry biomass accumulation of each crop component and yield formation huang et al 2018 this process based crop growth simulation method has not been investigated for maize and wheat besides integrating into the remote sensing model crop water consumption and yield could be easily estimated at regional scale in this module 8 day gpp was first used to calculate the cumulative net primary productivity npp 7 i 1 n npp φ i 1 n gpp where i is the number of 8 day gpp series during crop growing period that starts from the regreening stage for winter wheat and the sowing date for maize n is the total number of gpp series and φ is the ratio of npp gpp total dry biomass dm g c m 2 can be converted from the cumulated npp and carbon content ρ c the value of ρ c could be set as 0 45 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 for maize and 0 43 for wheat according to field measurements zhang 2014 8 dm i i 1 n npp ρ c to quantify crop development rate and dry biomass allocation gppnorm was defined as the ratio of every gpp to gpp the sum of all gpp 9 gpp norm gpp i gpp then gppnorm was used to determine dry biomass partitioning coefficients for each component ρ x x denotes stem s leaf l grain g and belowground ρ r of maize and wheat during the growing season it should be noted that the coefficients ρ s ρ l and ρ g were defined as the proportion of each component to the aboveground biomass ab and ρ r was defined as the proportion of belowground biomass bb i e roots against dm 10 ρ x i a x e i 1 n gpp norm b x c x 2 x s l g 11 ρ r i a r e b r i 1 n gpp norm c r e d r i 1 n gpp norm where parameters a b c and d for each component subscript x or r were calibrated by fitting the gaussian and quadratic exponential relationships between in situ measurements of biomass partitioning coefficients and gppnorm at yucheng during 2004 2010 for wheat and maize table 3 then the obtained parameters were further validated through fitting the relationships for measurements at luancheng and hetao sites for wheat and maize respectively fig s1 and fig s2 the bb and ab partitioning into l s and g components can be obtained according to the partitioning coefficients 12 bb i dm i ρ r i ab i dm i 1 ρ r i 13 ab x i ab i ρ x i x l s g finally crop yield could be calculated by grain dry biomass at the end of the season abg end and grain moisture content c m 14 yield ab g end 1 c m where c m was set as 0 11 for maize through field measurement at the hetao site and for wheat according to lobell et al 2002 regarding crop growth simulation the parameter φ in the ncp is equal to 0 72 and 0 73 for the entire growing season of maize and wheat respectively based on the field measurements by zhang 2014 while the calculation for wheat began from the regreening stage in the next year and φ was set as 0 88 and φ for maize at hetao site was set as 0 9 with more intense physiological characteristics and higher latitudes since both pure grain the yield at harvest and maize cob wheat ear were included in biomass measurement of grain component a coefficient of grain part based on the measurements was added to eq 14 both ec fluxes and crop biomass observations for wheat were available at yucheng and luancheng sites and for maize were available at yucheng and hetao sites table 1 then the crop growth simulation results based on the site observed gpp for both crops are shown in fig s3 values of r2 rmse and mean relative error mae were obtained to evaluate the simulation of crop biomass grain accumulation and yield 2 3 remote sensing lai acquisition lai is a key input for estimating crop et and carbon assimilation lai acquired from the modis mcd15a3h 006 product may underestimate crop lai and ndvi approaches saturation asymptotically when lai becomes larger than approximately 2 m2 m 2 in cropland gitelson 2004 li et al 2018 wdrvi was proposed to improve ndvi sensitivity under moderate to high densities of green vegetation gitelson et al 2007 which was satisfactory for crop lai estimation at the weishan site lei et al 2013 in this study wdrvi was calculated using the mod09a1 version 6 product of 8 day and 500 m resolution which provides the surface spectral reﬂectance after atmospheric correction with the advantages of global coverage strong timeliness and high dynamics there have been studies attempting to retrieve surface information from top of atmosphere reflectance while majority of the lai retrievals have utilized bottom of atmosphere reflectance the steps including image acquisition cloud removal and wdrvi calculation were conducted via google earth engine gee 15 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red 16 w d r vi α ρ nir ρ red α ρ nir ρ red 17 la i lai max wdrvi wd rvi min wdrvi max wdrvi min where ρnir and ρred are the reflectance in near infrared and red bands respectively α is a weighting coefficient and is set to 0 2 gitelson 2004 lei et al 2013 laimax was determined by the observation and was 6 5 and 5 0 m2 m 2 for wheat and maize respectively lei et al 2013 laimax for maize at hetao was approximately 6 5 m2 m 2 according to the measurement wang et al 2020b the remote sensing lai was smoothed by the weighted savitzky golay smoothing filter before being applied in the model considering different remote sensing vis and crop types another two common indices gcvi and evi were further applied to calculate lai for both crops a global laievi algorithm for maize and wheat was described by kang et al 2016 the laigcvi algorithm for maize and wheat was described by nguy robertson et al 2012 and tanaka et al 2015 respectively then crop lai derived from wdrvi evi gcvi and the modis product are shown in fig 3 the yearly averaged results at yucheng and weishan sites clearly indicated two peaks for the winter wheat summer maize rotation system laiwdrvi and laievi for wheat before june were higher than laigcvi and laimodis besides laiwdrvi and laievi indicated a higher or similar peak for wheat compared to maize which was generally consistent with the observation shen et al 2013 while laimodis suggested a contrary result at the hetao site only spring maize was planted in a year and single lai peak occurred in the seasonal variation due to the very limited and intermittent lai observations the model relies on the remote sensing lai with its spatiotemporal continuity compared to laiwdrvi the smaller laimodis could obviously underestimate crop lai especially for wheat fig s4 although the estimated peak of laiwdrvi was sometimes lower than the observed result laiwdrvi seemed to be a better alternative than laimodis the different estimation results by laimodis and laiwdrvi will be illustrated comparing with the observed fluxes in the results section 2 4 model experiments design compared to the original pml model the resem designed for cropland considered the applicability of different remote sensing lai inputs the changed parameters for crops and the output of key yield 1 to clarify the development of resem three model experiments were initially conducted the first one defined as pml 1 is the modelling of et and gpp forced by in situ meteorological data and the laimodis product the second defined as pml 2 is forced by the same meteorological data with pml 1 but the calculated laiwdrvi both the pml 1 and pml 2 experiments adopted the default eleven parameters for crops given in zhang et al 2019 the third one defined as pml 3 is the experiment forced by the same inputs as pml 2 but using the separately calibrated parameters for wheat and maize table 2 2 then the estimated results of the above three patterns were compared with years of observations by the ec system 3 finally the resem integrated the best et and gpp estimations into crop growth simulation module to obtain yield of wheat and maize through years of crop biomass and yield measurements the performance of resem in simulating crop growth process and yield was evaluated the application of resem at site scale adopted in situ meteorological data and cross validation was conducted to assess et and gpp estimates based on the observed fluxes the observed fluxes and meteorological data were aggregated from hourly to 8 day corresponding to the remote sensing lai time span for regional estimations all the observed fluxes were used to optimize parameters table 2 and the meteorological data of global land data assimilation system were adopted which were interpolated to 500 m resolution using the bilinear interpolation method zhang et al 2019 like the pml model the resem was also established in gee platform for regional estimation with a resolution of 500 m and 8 day as a planetary scale platform for earth science data and analysis gorelick et al 2017 gee has a multi petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary scale analysis capabilities the resem has a potential for easy application at large spatial scale and was applied in winter wheat summer maize rotation system in the ncp the remotely sensed crop cultivation areas and phenology in the ncp were obtained from li and lei 2021 2022 3 results 3 1 evaluation of et and gpp estimates for wheat and maize compared with a total of 20 years of measurements et and gpp estimates of all pml experiments generally captured the seasonal dynamics at three sites fig 4 it can be seen that et of wheat was higher than that of maize fig 4a c while gpp of wheat was similar or even smaller than that of maize fig 4b d at weishan site average of all the observed et and gpp was 3 82 mm d 1 and 11 71 g c m 2 d 1 respectively average of all the estimated et and gpp for pml 1 was 2 32 mm d 1 and 10 86 g c m 2 d 1 for pml 2 was 2 89 mm d 1 and 14 40 g c m 2 d 1 for pml 3 was 2 94 mm d 1 and 13 06 g c m 2 d 1 respectively at yucheng site the observed et and gpp averaged 3 86 mm d 1 and 12 68 g c m 2 d 1 respectively fig 4c d the estimated et and gpp for pml 1 pml 2 pml 3 averaged 3 26 3 57 3 47 mm d 1 and 10 46 13 11 11 79 g c m 2 d 1 respectively at hetao site the observed et and gpp averaged 4 35 mm d 1 and 11 94 g c m 2 d 1 respectively fig 4e f the estimated et and gpp for pml 1 pml 2 pml 3 averaged 2 90 3 72 3 20 mm d 1 and 8 35 15 14 12 50 g c m 2 d 1 respectively it seemed that et estimates of the three experiments were close while gpp estimates varied a lot between the experiments such as the estimated gpp by pml 2 experiment at weishan obviously overestimated gpp of wheat to clearly quantify the different estimations by the three experiments comparisons between the measured and estimated fluxes are shown in fig 5 the underestimations of et and gpp by pml 1 was obvious especially for wheat then replacing laimodis by laiwdrvi in pml 2 the underestimation was mitigated except that gpp of wheat was overestimated which could result in an overestimated water use efficiency fig 5e further considering the individual calibration for both crops in pml 3 the comparison results of et and gpp were more consistent than the former experiments due to coupled estimations of et and gpp in the model the evaluation of the experiments was analyzed based on the sum of statistical indicators for et and gpp fig 5g h results indicated that the simulations of wheat were significantly improved by pml 3 meanwhile the simulations of maize were slightly improved by pml 2 and pml 3 compared to pml 1 the sum of nse for wheat was increased to as large as 1 77 by pml 3 and rmse of et and gpp was decreased to about 0 57 mm d 1 and 1 65 g c m 2 d 1 respectively the sum of nse for maize was also increased to 1 29 by pml 3 compared to pml 1 although the sum of nse for maize in pml 2 was a little higher than the other experiments rmse of et and gpp estimates for maize was smallest in pml 3 0 80 mm d 1 and 2 92 g c m 2 d 1 respectively this was consistent with the largest slope of the fitting relationship in pml 3 indicating the smallest deviation and the closest fitting line to the 1 1 line 3 2 simulations of crop growth process and yield the results driven by the site observed gpp in fig s1 s3 illustrated the availability of crop growth module for simulating crop biomass accumulation and allocation as well as final yield both for wheat and maize then et and gpp derived from the pml 3 experiment were incorporated into the resem for coupled estimation of et and yield the results of dry biomass partitioning coefficients and yield driven by the estimated gpp are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 compared with years of observation at different sites the normalized gpp estimate was reliable for simulating biomass partitioning coefficient of each component during crop growth process the ratio of stem to ab ρ s for wheat increased to around 0 6 when gppnorm accumulated to about 0 5 0 6 then decreased until the end fig 6a the leaf coefficient ρ l indicated a gradually declined trend after gppnorm increased to around 0 3 the grain coefficient ρ g began to increase fast the proportion of roots in total dry biomass ρ r gradually decreased from about 0 4 0 1 but due to the difficulty in accurate observation of root system ρ r at the beginning period still needed to be determined in future experiment the seasonal variations of biomass partitioning coefficients for maize were similar to those for wheat while when the accumulatio of gppnorm was less than 0 4 for maize there were some deviations in the simulation of ρ s and ρ l the value of ρ l reached the peak a litter ahead of wheat fig 6a e coefficient of ρ g increased to the maximum then stabilized at about 0 6 fig 6g r2 of the partitioning coefficients ranged from 0 78 to 0 96 and 0 67 0 95 for wheat and maize respectively except for the root part which is hard to measure rmse and mae for both crops were less than 0 08 and 0 06 respectively the estimated ab grain accumulations and final yield by the resem also agreed well with the measurements fig 7 r2 was 0 80 and 0 66 and rmse was 265 4 and 198 7 g m 2 for ab and grain of wheat respectively results of maize indicate that r2 was larger than 0 91 and rmse was 215 0 and 154 5 g m 2 for ab and grain respectively rmse of final yield was 554 7 kg hm 2 rrmse 9 i e rmse mean value of observation and 1346 6 kg hm 2 rrmse 15 for wheat and maize respectively in addition ab and yield of maize at hetao were obviously larger than those at yucheng fig 7d f this could be attributed to that maize at hetao received sufficient irrigation and lai was larger wang et al 2020a 3 3 regional estimation in the north china plain based on the regional estimations of et and yield for wheat and maize in the ncp the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop wp from 2001 to 2018 was examined the cumulative et during winter wheat regreening harvest and summer maize sowing harvest growing seasons both showed a weakly increasing trend fig 8a c mean annual et of winter wheat was 275 9 mm y 1 which was much larger than that of summer maize 237 9 mm y 1 the yield of winter wheat indicated a significantly p 0 001 upward trend with an average of 5685 9 kg ha 1 resulting in a significantly increased wp in the past 20 years the yield of summer maize increased slowly with an average of 6312 8 kg ha 1 resulting in a stable wp although wp of winter wheat increased significantly mean annual wp of winter wheat 2 1 kg m 3 was much lower than that of summer maize 2 7 kg m 3 this was attributed to the larger et while less yield of winter wheat than summer maize the spatial distribution of wp was much different between two crops that the spatial variability of maize was not as significant as that of wheat fig 9 wp of winter wheat increased obviously from the semi arid northern areas to the humid southern areas with average wp increasing from 1 48 kg m 3 to 2 19 kg m 3 fig 10 from the extensively irrigated cropland 50 areas were irrigated to the less irrigated cropland 25 average wp gradually increased indicating that large irrigation in the ncp could reduce wheat wp to some extent the extensive irrigation was mainly conducted in the hebei plain in the north part and the midwestern part along the yellow river where groundwater or river water was diverted for irrigation due to over exploitation of water resources the northern areas of the ncp are facing with seriously groundwater depression average wp of winter wheat for the whole ncp was 1 9 kg m 3 which was smaller than that of summer maize 2 7 kg m 3 fig 10 since rainfall was mainly concentrated during summer maize growing period june october the spatial distribution of wp for summer maize was not obviously affected by various irrigation percentages average wp in the humid southern area was slightly lower than that in the semi arid northern area 4 discussion 4 1 et and yield estimations by the resem all the three pml experiments could simulate the seasonal dynamics of et and gpp at different sites fig 4 but the estimation accuracy was different fig 5 this was attributed to the uncertainty of model inputs and parameters the underestimation of et and gpp in pml 1 was mitigated after replacing laimodis by laiwdrvi in pml 2 fig 5 laimodis of winter wheat in the ncp underestimated lai by up to 2 3 m2 m 2 peng et al 2007 which was also found in our result fig s4 nguy robertson et al 2012 and tanaka et al 2015 discussed the sensitivity of various vis to lai and suggested that wdrvi was more sensitive to lai for maize and wheat wdrvi was suggested to be capable of estimating crop lai across a much greater lai range than ndvi gitelson et al 2007 the study in maize and soybean fields also documented that evi and wdrvi were better indices for gpp estimation than ndvi peng et al 2013 both evi and wdrvi increased lai estimate than the other two indices especially for wheat fig 3 the estimated laiwdrvi underestimated the peak of crop lai sometimes while there seemed to be no obvious effect on the flux predictions fig 5b e this may be because of the threshold of lai around 3 4 m2 m 2 influencing crop et suyker and verma 2010 wang et al 2020b lai is a critical vegetation structural variable controlling canopy radiative transfer and interpreting crop growth conditions xie et al 2017 besides the effects of variations in inputs on et and gpp estimates indicated that lai had the most significant effect among the inputs fig s5 this was consistent with the research on the fluxes in a rice field huang et al 2018 moreover the individual parameterization for wheat and maize is necessary due to the physiological differences between c3 and c4 crops still et al 2003 zhang et al 2008 miner et al 2017 using the same parameters for all crops the pml 2 experiment underestimated et and overestimated gpp of wheat fig 5b e after adopting the separated parameters in pml 3 the estimations of et and gpp for maize at site scale changed a little meanwhile the estimations for wheat were obviously improved fig 5g h generally the estimation results of wheat were better than those of maize comparing to the measurements for the simulation at site scale the adopted parameters were calibrated based on the observation at yucheng site and the observations at the other sites were used to validate for regional estimation in the ncp the observed fluxes at all sites were used to calibrate the parameters for two crops it is worth noting that β initial slope of the light response curve to the assimilation rate for maize was always larger than that for wheat and that m stomatal conductance coefficient for maize was smaller than wheat table 2 the well known distinction between c4 and c3 crops is the sensitivities of their photosynthetic pathways to atmospheric co2 their responses to light and temperature could also change still et al 2003 maize was suggested to has a larger maximum light use efficiency than wheat yan et al 2009 zhang et al 2008 the result verifies that maize is more sensitive in response to changes in light considering β and has a smaller stomatal conductance at the same carbon assimilation rate considering m crop growth simulation by the resem performed satisfactorily in simulations of biomass partitioning coefficient ab and grain accumulations as well as yield for both crops r2 ranged from 0 57 to 0 96 and rrmse of yield was less than 15 fig 6 and fig 7 in an estimation of winter wheat yield the values of rrmse and mae less than 10 represent coherence values of 10 20 indicate a good estimate dong et al 2020 he et al 2021 established the linear relationships between crops ab and gpp which varied for individual crop type we found that the normalization of cumulative gpp during crop growth period well determined portioning coefficient of each part even for various crops huang et al 2018 gpp closely related to crop physiological activity and biomass production is widely used for crop yield estimation campioli et al 2015 dong et al 2020 peng et al 2013 qiao et al 2020 while crop biomass partitioning coefficients in the estimations driven by remote sensing gpp were sometimes fixed for crops which in fact significantly vary during crop growth season fig 6 priesack and gayler 2009 xia et al 2017 for example the coefficient of aboveground parts was set as 0 9 for wheat in wang et al 2019 and 0 8 for six crops in he et al 2021 besides compared to the lue model for gpp and crop yield estimations dong et al 2020 he et al 2018 the resem simultaneously estimates crop et gpp and yield which could be directly used to evaluate crop wp 4 2 uncertainty of regional application the resem requires the accessible meteorological and remote sensing inputs with a few diagnostic parameters and is conveniently applied at large spatial scale fig 9 the spatiotemporal dynamics of et and yield for wheat and maize in the ncp were examined it was found that et of both crops increased insignificantly and slightly while yield of wheat increased significantly resulting in an improved wp during the past 20 years fig 8 this should be mainly attributed to the comprehensive agricultural management such as crop varieties renewal soil improvement and fertilizer zhang et al 2013a 2013b 2021b regional wp could be influenced by multiple factors such as water resources soil climate and agronomic management fang et al 2010 generally wp or wue of maize was larger than that of winter wheat due to the different characteristics of c3 and c4 species figs 9 and 10 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2018 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 the spatial distribution of wp for wheat showed a lower value in the semi arid northern area than the humid southern area the statistical yield of winter wheat at county level indicated that total yield in the ncp generally increased during 1998 2015 and that the counties with significant increase and decrease mainly concentrated in the southern and northern regions respectively zhang and lu 2019 this agreed with a higher wp in the humid south region fig 9 climate factors such as air temperature increase and changes in rainfall patterns may decrease crop yield and wue especially in water limited semiarid areas fang et al 2010 liu et al 2019 these results strongly support the current winter wheat fallow measures in the northern ncp while wp of maize varied a litter among various climatic or irrigated regions fig 10 which was mainly due to high rainfall during maize season there was no significant reduction of maize yield with less irrigation at luancheng site in recent 20 years zhang et al 2016b maize yield can even increase under rainfed conditions while decrease for irrigated maize when co2 fertilization effect was considered xiong et al 2007 irrigation could improve or maintain high yield while large amount of irrigation is unfavorable for wp improvement reducing the planting area of winter wheat was an effective way to enhance wp and more efforts are also needed to implement water saving irrigation schedule zhang et al 2021b zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 the conventional crop models have been used to study crop water consumption and production in interaction with the environment at site scale holzworth et al 2014 wit et al 2019 while the complex mechanism in the model relies on many forcing inputs such as soil physicochemical characteristics and management practices and numerous parameters such as soil type specific crop specific and other coefficients which may be unavailable at regional scale huang et al 2018 qiao et al 2020 there are also some uncertainties on regional application of the resem for example the accumulated gpp and crop growth duration are critical variables for crop growth simulation the onset and end of crop growth season was observed at the site while the spatial extraction of crop phenology is needed for regional estimation which can be detected based on remote sensing vis sakamoto et al 2013 li and lei 2022 luo et al 2020 then the uncertainty in yield estimation mainly originates from parameters ρc and φ npp gpp i e carbon use efficiency although ρc was more sensitive to yield estimation huang et al 2018 ρc was generally in a narrow range from 0 4 to 0 45 for rice wheat and maize huang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 parameter φ can vary over a large range and shows considerable spatial variation associated with ecosystem type geographical location and climate zhang et al 2009 even for rice φ varied from 0 50 to 0 79 on a large spatial scale huang et al 2018 although a constant φ was generally adopted before the spatial pattern of φ derived by the yield based npp and solar induced fluorescence based gpp could be an alternative guan et al 2016 and the relationship of φ between the environmental factors such as temperature should be further investigated the spatial pattern of the parameters for crops water consumption and carbon assimilation can be further diagnosed with as more observations as possible in the future 5 conclusion in this study by integrating a crop growth simulation method into the remotely sensed and water carbon coupled model et and yield related processes for wheat and maize croplands were simultaneously estimated firstly three model experiments were conducted to estimate crop et and gpp considering different remote sensing lai inputs and parameters then the estimates were evaluated through comparing with 20 site years of observations 1 it was found that the calculated laiwdrvi and the individually calibrated parameters for wheat and maize in pml 3 significantly improved the fluxes estimates compared to the original estimates by pml 1 the individual parameters also represented different c3 and c4 crop characteristics relative to the fixed ones the average nse of et and gpp was about 0 88 and 0 65 for wheat and maize respectively rmse of et and gpp were 0 57 mm d 1 and 1 65 g c m 2 d 1 for wheat and was 0 80 mm d 1 and 2 92 g c m 2 d 1 for maize respectively 2 meanwhile the simulation of dry biomass accumulation biomass allocation and yield also performed well for wheat and maize rmse of yield was 554 7 kg hm 2 rrmse 9 and 1346 6 kg hm 2 rrmse 15 for wheat and maize respectively finally the spatiotemporal dynamics of wp of winter wheat and summer maize over the ncp during 2001 2018 were assessed 3 the significantly increased wheat yield resulting in a significantly improved wp in the past two decades while wp of wheat was generally lower than that of maize 4 spatially wp of wheat in the irrigated semi arid area was lower than that in the less irrigated humid area the results provide important basis for water resource management and food security with the accessible meteorological and remote sensing data the developed resem is conveniently applied for croplands at large spatial scale while its spatial resolution 500 m needs to be further improved considering the fine planting structure and management practice and its application should be well assessed in humid areas where there was no fluxes observation in the ncp for yield simulation driven by carbon fluxes in this work or similar studies the spatial pattern of carbon use efficiency needs to be further evaluated in the future declaration

8989,estimation of evapotranspiration et and yield over cropland is essential for water resources management and food security particularly the estimation at long term and regional scales still needs to be investigated in this study a remotely sensed and water carbon coupled model was combined with a process based crop growth simulation method to simultaneously estimate et and yield the developed model was tested for two of the most important crops wheat and maize with years of observations leaf area index determined by various remote sensing indices and individually calibrated parameters for wheat and maize were considered to improve crop et and gross primary production gpp estimates the parameters well reflected different physiological properties that c4 maize has a smaller stomatal conductance coefficient and a larger sensitivity in response to initial light than c3 wheat comparing with 20 years of measurements the root mean square error rmse of et and gpp for winter wheat was 0 57 mm d 1 and 1 65 g c m 2 d 1 and for maize were 0 80 mm d 1 and 2 92 g c m 2 d 1 respectively besides crop growth simulation including biomass accumulation and allocation agreed well with the measurements coefficient of determination was mostly larger than 0 66 and rmse of yield was 554 7 and 1346 6 kg hm 2 for wheat and maize respectively finally the spatiotemporal crop water productivity wp of winter wheat and summer maize in the north china plain during 2001 2018 were quantified the increased wp of winter wheat while the larger wp of maize than that of wheat were discovered the developed model helps to examine regional crop et and yield and provides critical information on agricultural water management keywords evapotranspiration gross primary production yield remote sensing wheat and maize crop water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction evapotranspiration et and gross primary production gpp are the crucial fluxes between terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere ahmadi et al 2021 mohammadi mehdizadeh 2020 suyker and verma 2010 zhang et al 2019 and help water resource management and crop productivity assessment for agroecosystems with the increasing demand for water resources food and land dalin et al 2015 great efforts have been made to estimate et and agricultural production in croplands such as china south korea and the united states huang et al 2018 qiao et al 2020 sakamoto et al 2013 wu et al 2020 remote sensing methods have been applied to quantify et at large spatial scale wang et al 2022 yang et al 2015 zhang et al 2016a glenn et al 2007 classified remote sensing based et models mainly into the empirical and physical methods and each has its advantage and limitation some empirical methods establish the relationship between remote sensing vegetation indices vis with crop coefficient and then obtain crop et combined with potential et er raki et al 2007 et i e latent heat can also be calculated as a residual of the energy balance equation in the physical methods yang et al 2015 the upscaling of land surface temperature on satellite passing time and the selection of dry and wet pixels in heterogeneous surfaces are the key points tang et al 2013 in addition the widely used modis et product adopts the physical penman monteith pm approach combining energy transfer and aerodynamic processes with remote sensing vi mu et al 2007 2011 recent years application of data assimilation and fusion techniques and utilization of latest sensor and machine leaning technologies further assist in producing robust and long term et estimates fang et al 2020 hadadi et al 2022 mehdizadeh et al 2021 wang et al 2022 zhang et al 2016a benefiting from remote sensing vis some models were proposed to estimate crop yield guan et al 2016 lobell et al 2015 zhang et al 2021a which was suggested to be classified into three categories lobell 2013 the simplest approach is to establish the empirical relationships between ground based yield measures and remote sensing vis shanahan et al 2001 for example the wide dynamic range vegetation index wdrvi before maize silking stage was suggested to have a strong linear relationship with yield sakamoto et al 2013 another class of models is integrating remote sensing data into complex crop models of which parameters would need to be adjusted on a pixel by pixel basis and some parameters may be unavailable at regional scale doraiswamy et al 2005 lobell et al 2015 the third category relies on the light use efficiency lue method which states that total biomass production is proportional to total absorption of photosynthetically active radiation par khabba et al 2020 the lue based model has been validated for yield of corn soybean or other crops in the united states he et al 2018 wu et al 2020 crop et and carbon assimilation are regulated by stomatal physiological activities and determine water use efficiency or crop water productivity wp at canopy level hu and lei 2021 ryu et al 2011 which was essential for variety cultivation irrigation schedule and agronomic management however less remote sensing models have concerned coupled estimation of et and yield in cropland crop modelling at the site scale or the statistical yield based on administrative divisions could not well reflect their spatiotemporal pattern integrating the carbon assimilation and pm equation by stomatal conductance some water carbon coupled methods were developed to simultaneously estimate ecosystems et and gpp at large spatial scale luo et al 2018 ryu et al 2011 zhang et al 2019 the coupled model requires consistent satellite inputs to maintain internal consistency between et and gpp estimates which could be applied for causality analysis of water use efficiency zhang et al 2019 this kind of models has been applied for global ecosystems and the gpp output is closely related to crop biomass production which is possibly able to simulate crop growth and yield campioli et al 2015 peng et al 2013 zhang et al 2021a while only a few remotely sensed and water carbon coupled models have been extended to croplands huang et al 2018 and seldom is applied to simultaneously estimate et and yield for different crop types maize and wheat are two of the most important crops for humans caloric energy erenstein et al 2021 estimated that one third and one fifth of global farms in 2020 cultivated maize and wheat respectively cereal crops maize wheat and rice in china accounted for 59 of total planting area and 92 of grain production in 2017 luo et al 2020 besides agricultural water consumption as the largest item accounts for more than 60 of total water consumption in china estimating et and yield at the same time rather than isolated has more important significance in agricultural water management and it should also be considered that different physiological characteristics exist between c3 wheat and c4 maize in water carbon coupling process quantification of et and yield related processes during crop growth period based on remote sensing better reflects the spatiotemporal variation of crop wp the main objectives of this study were to 1 incorporate the process based crop growth simulation method into a remotely sensed and water carbon coupled model to estimate et and yield for wheat and maize 2 evaluate the reliability of the developed model by comparing the estimated et gpp crop biomatter accumulation and yield against 20 site years of measurements and 3 estimate the spatiotemporal dynamics of et and yield to examine crop wp of wheat and maize in the north china plain ncp 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and data collection data used in this study are collected from two areas i e the ncp and hetao irrigation district hid fig 1 the ncp with an area of 4 105 km2 is the largest grain production base in china and summer maize winter wheat rotation cropping system dominates this area fang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013a 2013b irrigation and climate conditions in the ncp are spatially heterogeneous which altered cropland water and carbon fluxes wang et al 2023 summer maize grows mainly during june to october and winter wheat grows mainly from october to june in next year the hid is the third largest irrigation area in china with an irrigated area of 1 12 104 km2 benefiting from large irrigation water from the yellow river the hid is also an important grain production area where spring maize is one of the main crop types chen et al 2018 wu et al 2017 the experimental observations from four sites in two areas were collected fig 1 and the available data are listed in table 1 the observations from three flux tower sites hetao 2017 2018 weishan 2005 2015 and yucheng 2003 2010 were considered to test et and gpp estimates since the availability of both eddy covariance ec fluxes and crop biomass the observations at hetao site from the hid were necessary to validate the fluxes and crop growth estimations at different sites the turbulent h2o and co2 fluxes between crop canopy and the atmosphere were measured by ec system suyker and verma 2010 wang et al 2020b the raw high frequent data were processed using the eddypro li cor inc lincoln usa software which allows for several corrections such as air density fluctuations frequency response sonic anemometer tilt correction coordinate rotation using the planar fit method and so on wagle et al 2018 hu and lei 2021 the spike detection and removal were also involved 90 of the fluxes originated from the observed cropland around the flux tower within about 400 m and energy balance closure larger than 0 6 indicated the reliability of the fluxes hu and lei 2021 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2020b then 30 min time series of net ecosystem exchange nee sensible heat h and latent heat le were obtained et was converted from le referring to the latent heat of vaporization nee was partitioned into gpp and ecosystem respiration reco fluxes nee reco gpp using the reddyproc wutzler et al 2018 this tool provides a standard co2 focused routine for reading half hourly data estimating friction velocity threshold as well as gap filling flux partitioning with ancillary meteorological data of friction velocity radiation air or soil temperature and vapor pressure deficit details about the flux partitioning process can be seen at https www bgc jena mpg de bgi index php services reddyprocweb crop growth measurements mainly including dry biomass and leaf area index lai were obtained by repeated at least three samplings each time during crop growing season leaf areas of plant samplings were measured and then used to calculate lai according to plant density wang et al 2020a details in supplementary material crop sampling maize at hetao and yucheng sites wheat at luancheng and yucheng sites was cut into the aboveground part including stem leaves and grain components and root part then each component was oven dried to obtain actual biomass partitioning coefficients crop yield was measured by grain threshing and air oven drying each component and total biomass were used to evaluate the allocation of carbon assimilation and crop growth simulation in addition the measurements of meteorological data such as net radiation air temperature relative humidity air pressure precipitation and wind speed were obtained by the meteorological station 2 2 development of resem for coupled estimation of et and yield the remote sensing based cropland ecohydrological model resem was developed by combing the water carbon coupled pml penman monteith leuning version 2 model with a process based crop growth module fig 2 the remote sensing canopy characteristics and meteorological forcing factors were used to estimate et and gpp in the pml framework then based on the gpp series during crop growth period crop biomass accumulation of each component and yield were simulated by the crop growth module the modelling processes are described in detail as follows 2 2 1 brief description of the pml model in the pml framework the pm approach and stomatal conductance g s model leuning et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 were considered to simultaneously estimate vegetation et components and gpp gan et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the g s model leuning 1995 yu et al 2004 was adopted to simulate the stomatal conductance in response to light temperature and gross assimilation 1 g s m a g c a 1 d d 0 where m is the stomatal conductance coefficient a g is leaf gross assimilation c a is co2 concentration in the air and d 0 is the parameter reflecting the stomatal response to atmospheric vapor pressure deficit d considering the responses of leaf gross assimilation rate to the environmental variables a g was calculated by thornley 1976 2 a g a m β i η c a a m β i a m η c a β i η c a where β is the initial slope of the light response curve to the assimilation rate η is the initial slope of the co2 response curve to the assimilation rate i is the flux density of par and a m is the maximum photosynthetic rate when both i and c a are saturated which approximates half of the maximum catalytic capacity of rubisco per unit leaf area v m then integrating leaf level g s and a g by lai canopy conductance gc and canopy gross assimilation can be calculated as 3 g c m p 1 k q p 2 p 4 k q lai ln p 2 p 3 p 4 p 2 p 3 exp k q lai p 4 1 1 d d 0 4 gpp p 1 c a k q p 2 p 4 k q lai ln p 2 p 3 p 4 p 2 p 3 exp k q lai p 4 where k q is the extinction coefficient of par p1 p2 p3 and p4 are the simplified abbreviations of the combined parameters of a m β η and variables of i 0 the flux density of par at the top of the canopy and c a in addition a constraint function including the parameters of d max and d min is included to reflect the effect of d on gpp the above equations show that the vapor pressure deficit term 1 1 d do indicates stomatal closure with increasing d in the water carbon coupling process of this model the effect of vpd representing the water limitations was introduced soil water limitations on gc could be not only captured by changes in light interception or lai term but also reflected by atmospheric vpd the pm equation was used to estimate plant transpiration et and soil evaporation es 5 e t ε a c ρ c p γ d a g a ε 1 g a g c 6 e s f ε a s ε 1 where ε is the ratio of s to

extinction coefficient of available energy k a ρ is air density c p is the specific heat of air at constant pressure g a is the aerodynamic conductance and f is a dimensionless variable that determines the water availability for es considering precipitation and equilibrium evaporation rate the input data contain the meteorological variables including air temperature air pressure vapor pressure radiations longwave downward radiation precipitation and wind speed and remote sensing data including lai albedo and emissivity net radiation was calculated by albedo emissivity shortwave longwave downward radiations and temperature more details of the pml model can be found in zhang et al 2019 the resem was developed for agroecosystems in which the parameters were specified for wheat and maize while the original pml model was designed for global ecosystems and crops were defined as one plant function type with one set of parameters i e the fixed parameters for all crops this ignored the difference in photosynthesis between crops particularly c3 wheat and c4 maize yan et al 2009 zhang et al 2008 therefore the parameters were individually calibrated for wheat and maize in this study similar to zhang et al 2019 the sum of nash sutcliffe efficiency nse for et and gpp was maximized to determine the parameters for each crop using a global optimization method the pattern search algorithm implemented in matlab the mathworks inc 2018 the model performance was evaluated using four indices the linear regression slope coefficient of determination r2 nse and root mean square error rmse 2 2 2 crop growth simulation for wheat and maize the estimated gpp series were used to simulate dry biomass accumulation of each crop component and yield formation huang et al 2018 this process based crop growth simulation method has not been investigated for maize and wheat besides integrating into the remote sensing model crop water consumption and yield could be easily estimated at regional scale in this module 8 day gpp was first used to calculate the cumulative net primary productivity npp 7 i 1 n npp φ i 1 n gpp where i is the number of 8 day gpp series during crop growing period that starts from the regreening stage for winter wheat and the sowing date for maize n is the total number of gpp series and φ is the ratio of npp gpp total dry biomass dm g c m 2 can be converted from the cumulated npp and carbon content ρ c the value of ρ c could be set as 0 45 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 for maize and 0 43 for wheat according to field measurements zhang 2014 8 dm i i 1 n npp ρ c to quantify crop development rate and dry biomass allocation gppnorm was defined as the ratio of every gpp to gpp the sum of all gpp 9 gpp norm gpp i gpp then gppnorm was used to determine dry biomass partitioning coefficients for each component ρ x x denotes stem s leaf l grain g and belowground ρ r of maize and wheat during the growing season it should be noted that the coefficients ρ s ρ l and ρ g were defined as the proportion of each component to the aboveground biomass ab and ρ r was defined as the proportion of belowground biomass bb i e roots against dm 10 ρ x i a x e i 1 n gpp norm b x c x 2 x s l g 11 ρ r i a r e b r i 1 n gpp norm c r e d r i 1 n gpp norm where parameters a b c and d for each component subscript x or r were calibrated by fitting the gaussian and quadratic exponential relationships between in situ measurements of biomass partitioning coefficients and gppnorm at yucheng during 2004 2010 for wheat and maize table 3 then the obtained parameters were further validated through fitting the relationships for measurements at luancheng and hetao sites for wheat and maize respectively fig s1 and fig s2 the bb and ab partitioning into l s and g components can be obtained according to the partitioning coefficients 12 bb i dm i ρ r i ab i dm i 1 ρ r i 13 ab x i ab i ρ x i x l s g finally crop yield could be calculated by grain dry biomass at the end of the season abg end and grain moisture content c m 14 yield ab g end 1 c m where c m was set as 0 11 for maize through field measurement at the hetao site and for wheat according to lobell et al 2002 regarding crop growth simulation the parameter φ in the ncp is equal to 0 72 and 0 73 for the entire growing season of maize and wheat respectively based on the field measurements by zhang 2014 while the calculation for wheat began from the regreening stage in the next year and φ was set as 0 88 and φ for maize at hetao site was set as 0 9 with more intense physiological characteristics and higher latitudes since both pure grain the yield at harvest and maize cob wheat ear were included in biomass measurement of grain component a coefficient of grain part based on the measurements was added to eq 14 both ec fluxes and crop biomass observations for wheat were available at yucheng and luancheng sites and for maize were available at yucheng and hetao sites table 1 then the crop growth simulation results based on the site observed gpp for both crops are shown in fig s3 values of r2 rmse and mean relative error mae were obtained to evaluate the simulation of crop biomass grain accumulation and yield 2 3 remote sensing lai acquisition lai is a key input for estimating crop et and carbon assimilation lai acquired from the modis mcd15a3h 006 product may underestimate crop lai and ndvi approaches saturation asymptotically when lai becomes larger than approximately 2 m2 m 2 in cropland gitelson 2004 li et al 2018 wdrvi was proposed to improve ndvi sensitivity under moderate to high densities of green vegetation gitelson et al 2007 which was satisfactory for crop lai estimation at the weishan site lei et al 2013 in this study wdrvi was calculated using the mod09a1 version 6 product of 8 day and 500 m resolution which provides the surface spectral reﬂectance after atmospheric correction with the advantages of global coverage strong timeliness and high dynamics there have been studies attempting to retrieve surface information from top of atmosphere reflectance while majority of the lai retrievals have utilized bottom of atmosphere reflectance the steps including image acquisition cloud removal and wdrvi calculation were conducted via google earth engine gee 15 ndvi ρ nir ρ red ρ nir ρ red 16 w d r vi α ρ nir ρ red α ρ nir ρ red 17 la i lai max wdrvi wd rvi min wdrvi max wdrvi min where ρnir and ρred are the reflectance in near infrared and red bands respectively α is a weighting coefficient and is set to 0 2 gitelson 2004 lei et al 2013 laimax was determined by the observation and was 6 5 and 5 0 m2 m 2 for wheat and maize respectively lei et al 2013 laimax for maize at hetao was approximately 6 5 m2 m 2 according to the measurement wang et al 2020b the remote sensing lai was smoothed by the weighted savitzky golay smoothing filter before being applied in the model considering different remote sensing vis and crop types another two common indices gcvi and evi were further applied to calculate lai for both crops a global laievi algorithm for maize and wheat was described by kang et al 2016 the laigcvi algorithm for maize and wheat was described by nguy robertson et al 2012 and tanaka et al 2015 respectively then crop lai derived from wdrvi evi gcvi and the modis product are shown in fig 3 the yearly averaged results at yucheng and weishan sites clearly indicated two peaks for the winter wheat summer maize rotation system laiwdrvi and laievi for wheat before june were higher than laigcvi and laimodis besides laiwdrvi and laievi indicated a higher or similar peak for wheat compared to maize which was generally consistent with the observation shen et al 2013 while laimodis suggested a contrary result at the hetao site only spring maize was planted in a year and single lai peak occurred in the seasonal variation due to the very limited and intermittent lai observations the model relies on the remote sensing lai with its spatiotemporal continuity compared to laiwdrvi the smaller laimodis could obviously underestimate crop lai especially for wheat fig s4 although the estimated peak of laiwdrvi was sometimes lower than the observed result laiwdrvi seemed to be a better alternative than laimodis the different estimation results by laimodis and laiwdrvi will be illustrated comparing with the observed fluxes in the results section 2 4 model experiments design compared to the original pml model the resem designed for cropland considered the applicability of different remote sensing lai inputs the changed parameters for crops and the output of key yield 1 to clarify the development of resem three model experiments were initially conducted the first one defined as pml 1 is the modelling of et and gpp forced by in situ meteorological data and the laimodis product the second defined as pml 2 is forced by the same meteorological data with pml 1 but the calculated laiwdrvi both the pml 1 and pml 2 experiments adopted the default eleven parameters for crops given in zhang et al 2019 the third one defined as pml 3 is the experiment forced by the same inputs as pml 2 but using the separately calibrated parameters for wheat and maize table 2 2 then the estimated results of the above three patterns were compared with years of observations by the ec system 3 finally the resem integrated the best et and gpp estimations into crop growth simulation module to obtain yield of wheat and maize through years of crop biomass and yield measurements the performance of resem in simulating crop growth process and yield was evaluated the application of resem at site scale adopted in situ meteorological data and cross validation was conducted to assess et and gpp estimates based on the observed fluxes the observed fluxes and meteorological data were aggregated from hourly to 8 day corresponding to the remote sensing lai time span for regional estimations all the observed fluxes were used to optimize parameters table 2 and the meteorological data of global land data assimilation system were adopted which were interpolated to 500 m resolution using the bilinear interpolation method zhang et al 2019 like the pml model the resem was also established in gee platform for regional estimation with a resolution of 500 m and 8 day as a planetary scale platform for earth science data and analysis gorelick et al 2017 gee has a multi petabyte catalog of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets with planetary scale analysis capabilities the resem has a potential for easy application at large spatial scale and was applied in winter wheat summer maize rotation system in the ncp the remotely sensed crop cultivation areas and phenology in the ncp were obtained from li and lei 2021 2022 3 results 3 1 evaluation of et and gpp estimates for wheat and maize compared with a total of 20 years of measurements et and gpp estimates of all pml experiments generally captured the seasonal dynamics at three sites fig 4 it can be seen that et of wheat was higher than that of maize fig 4a c while gpp of wheat was similar or even smaller than that of maize fig 4b d at weishan site average of all the observed et and gpp was 3 82 mm d 1 and 11 71 g c m 2 d 1 respectively average of all the estimated et and gpp for pml 1 was 2 32 mm d 1 and 10 86 g c m 2 d 1 for pml 2 was 2 89 mm d 1 and 14 40 g c m 2 d 1 for pml 3 was 2 94 mm d 1 and 13 06 g c m 2 d 1 respectively at yucheng site the observed et and gpp averaged 3 86 mm d 1 and 12 68 g c m 2 d 1 respectively fig 4c d the estimated et and gpp for pml 1 pml 2 pml 3 averaged 3 26 3 57 3 47 mm d 1 and 10 46 13 11 11 79 g c m 2 d 1 respectively at hetao site the observed et and gpp averaged 4 35 mm d 1 and 11 94 g c m 2 d 1 respectively fig 4e f the estimated et and gpp for pml 1 pml 2 pml 3 averaged 2 90 3 72 3 20 mm d 1 and 8 35 15 14 12 50 g c m 2 d 1 respectively it seemed that et estimates of the three experiments were close while gpp estimates varied a lot between the experiments such as the estimated gpp by pml 2 experiment at weishan obviously overestimated gpp of wheat to clearly quantify the different estimations by the three experiments comparisons between the measured and estimated fluxes are shown in fig 5 the underestimations of et and gpp by pml 1 was obvious especially for wheat then replacing laimodis by laiwdrvi in pml 2 the underestimation was mitigated except that gpp of wheat was overestimated which could result in an overestimated water use efficiency fig 5e further considering the individual calibration for both crops in pml 3 the comparison results of et and gpp were more consistent than the former experiments due to coupled estimations of et and gpp in the model the evaluation of the experiments was analyzed based on the sum of statistical indicators for et and gpp fig 5g h results indicated that the simulations of wheat were significantly improved by pml 3 meanwhile the simulations of maize were slightly improved by pml 2 and pml 3 compared to pml 1 the sum of nse for wheat was increased to as large as 1 77 by pml 3 and rmse of et and gpp was decreased to about 0 57 mm d 1 and 1 65 g c m 2 d 1 respectively the sum of nse for maize was also increased to 1 29 by pml 3 compared to pml 1 although the sum of nse for maize in pml 2 was a little higher than the other experiments rmse of et and gpp estimates for maize was smallest in pml 3 0 80 mm d 1 and 2 92 g c m 2 d 1 respectively this was consistent with the largest slope of the fitting relationship in pml 3 indicating the smallest deviation and the closest fitting line to the 1 1 line 3 2 simulations of crop growth process and yield the results driven by the site observed gpp in fig s1 s3 illustrated the availability of crop growth module for simulating crop biomass accumulation and allocation as well as final yield both for wheat and maize then et and gpp derived from the pml 3 experiment were incorporated into the resem for coupled estimation of et and yield the results of dry biomass partitioning coefficients and yield driven by the estimated gpp are shown in fig 6 and fig 7 compared with years of observation at different sites the normalized gpp estimate was reliable for simulating biomass partitioning coefficient of each component during crop growth process the ratio of stem to ab ρ s for wheat increased to around 0 6 when gppnorm accumulated to about 0 5 0 6 then decreased until the end fig 6a the leaf coefficient ρ l indicated a gradually declined trend after gppnorm increased to around 0 3 the grain coefficient ρ g began to increase fast the proportion of roots in total dry biomass ρ r gradually decreased from about 0 4 0 1 but due to the difficulty in accurate observation of root system ρ r at the beginning period still needed to be determined in future experiment the seasonal variations of biomass partitioning coefficients for maize were similar to those for wheat while when the accumulatio of gppnorm was less than 0 4 for maize there were some deviations in the simulation of ρ s and ρ l the value of ρ l reached the peak a litter ahead of wheat fig 6a e coefficient of ρ g increased to the maximum then stabilized at about 0 6 fig 6g r2 of the partitioning coefficients ranged from 0 78 to 0 96 and 0 67 0 95 for wheat and maize respectively except for the root part which is hard to measure rmse and mae for both crops were less than 0 08 and 0 06 respectively the estimated ab grain accumulations and final yield by the resem also agreed well with the measurements fig 7 r2 was 0 80 and 0 66 and rmse was 265 4 and 198 7 g m 2 for ab and grain of wheat respectively results of maize indicate that r2 was larger than 0 91 and rmse was 215 0 and 154 5 g m 2 for ab and grain respectively rmse of final yield was 554 7 kg hm 2 rrmse 9 i e rmse mean value of observation and 1346 6 kg hm 2 rrmse 15 for wheat and maize respectively in addition ab and yield of maize at hetao were obviously larger than those at yucheng fig 7d f this could be attributed to that maize at hetao received sufficient irrigation and lai was larger wang et al 2020a 3 3 regional estimation in the north china plain based on the regional estimations of et and yield for wheat and maize in the ncp the spatiotemporal dynamics of crop wp from 2001 to 2018 was examined the cumulative et during winter wheat regreening harvest and summer maize sowing harvest growing seasons both showed a weakly increasing trend fig 8a c mean annual et of winter wheat was 275 9 mm y 1 which was much larger than that of summer maize 237 9 mm y 1 the yield of winter wheat indicated a significantly p 0 001 upward trend with an average of 5685 9 kg ha 1 resulting in a significantly increased wp in the past 20 years the yield of summer maize increased slowly with an average of 6312 8 kg ha 1 resulting in a stable wp although wp of winter wheat increased significantly mean annual wp of winter wheat 2 1 kg m 3 was much lower than that of summer maize 2 7 kg m 3 this was attributed to the larger et while less yield of winter wheat than summer maize the spatial distribution of wp was much different between two crops that the spatial variability of maize was not as significant as that of wheat fig 9 wp of winter wheat increased obviously from the semi arid northern areas to the humid southern areas with average wp increasing from 1 48 kg m 3 to 2 19 kg m 3 fig 10 from the extensively irrigated cropland 50 areas were irrigated to the less irrigated cropland 25 average wp gradually increased indicating that large irrigation in the ncp could reduce wheat wp to some extent the extensive irrigation was mainly conducted in the hebei plain in the north part and the midwestern part along the yellow river where groundwater or river water was diverted for irrigation due to over exploitation of water resources the northern areas of the ncp are facing with seriously groundwater depression average wp of winter wheat for the whole ncp was 1 9 kg m 3 which was smaller than that of summer maize 2 7 kg m 3 fig 10 since rainfall was mainly concentrated during summer maize growing period june october the spatial distribution of wp for summer maize was not obviously affected by various irrigation percentages average wp in the humid southern area was slightly lower than that in the semi arid northern area 4 discussion 4 1 et and yield estimations by the resem all the three pml experiments could simulate the seasonal dynamics of et and gpp at different sites fig 4 but the estimation accuracy was different fig 5 this was attributed to the uncertainty of model inputs and parameters the underestimation of et and gpp in pml 1 was mitigated after replacing laimodis by laiwdrvi in pml 2 fig 5 laimodis of winter wheat in the ncp underestimated lai by up to 2 3 m2 m 2 peng et al 2007 which was also found in our result fig s4 nguy robertson et al 2012 and tanaka et al 2015 discussed the sensitivity of various vis to lai and suggested that wdrvi was more sensitive to lai for maize and wheat wdrvi was suggested to be capable of estimating crop lai across a much greater lai range than ndvi gitelson et al 2007 the study in maize and soybean fields also documented that evi and wdrvi were better indices for gpp estimation than ndvi peng et al 2013 both evi and wdrvi increased lai estimate than the other two indices especially for wheat fig 3 the estimated laiwdrvi underestimated the peak of crop lai sometimes while there seemed to be no obvious effect on the flux predictions fig 5b e this may be because of the threshold of lai around 3 4 m2 m 2 influencing crop et suyker and verma 2010 wang et al 2020b lai is a critical vegetation structural variable controlling canopy radiative transfer and interpreting crop growth conditions xie et al 2017 besides the effects of variations in inputs on et and gpp estimates indicated that lai had the most significant effect among the inputs fig s5 this was consistent with the research on the fluxes in a rice field huang et al 2018 moreover the individual parameterization for wheat and maize is necessary due to the physiological differences between c3 and c4 crops still et al 2003 zhang et al 2008 miner et al 2017 using the same parameters for all crops the pml 2 experiment underestimated et and overestimated gpp of wheat fig 5b e after adopting the separated parameters in pml 3 the estimations of et and gpp for maize at site scale changed a little meanwhile the estimations for wheat were obviously improved fig 5g h generally the estimation results of wheat were better than those of maize comparing to the measurements for the simulation at site scale the adopted parameters were calibrated based on the observation at yucheng site and the observations at the other sites were used to validate for regional estimation in the ncp the observed fluxes at all sites were used to calibrate the parameters for two crops it is worth noting that β initial slope of the light response curve to the assimilation rate for maize was always larger than that for wheat and that m stomatal conductance coefficient for maize was smaller than wheat table 2 the well known distinction between c4 and c3 crops is the sensitivities of their photosynthetic pathways to atmospheric co2 their responses to light and temperature could also change still et al 2003 maize was suggested to has a larger maximum light use efficiency than wheat yan et al 2009 zhang et al 2008 the result verifies that maize is more sensitive in response to changes in light considering β and has a smaller stomatal conductance at the same carbon assimilation rate considering m crop growth simulation by the resem performed satisfactorily in simulations of biomass partitioning coefficient ab and grain accumulations as well as yield for both crops r2 ranged from 0 57 to 0 96 and rrmse of yield was less than 15 fig 6 and fig 7 in an estimation of winter wheat yield the values of rrmse and mae less than 10 represent coherence values of 10 20 indicate a good estimate dong et al 2020 he et al 2021 established the linear relationships between crops ab and gpp which varied for individual crop type we found that the normalization of cumulative gpp during crop growth period well determined portioning coefficient of each part even for various crops huang et al 2018 gpp closely related to crop physiological activity and biomass production is widely used for crop yield estimation campioli et al 2015 dong et al 2020 peng et al 2013 qiao et al 2020 while crop biomass partitioning coefficients in the estimations driven by remote sensing gpp were sometimes fixed for crops which in fact significantly vary during crop growth season fig 6 priesack and gayler 2009 xia et al 2017 for example the coefficient of aboveground parts was set as 0 9 for wheat in wang et al 2019 and 0 8 for six crops in he et al 2021 besides compared to the lue model for gpp and crop yield estimations dong et al 2020 he et al 2018 the resem simultaneously estimates crop et gpp and yield which could be directly used to evaluate crop wp 4 2 uncertainty of regional application the resem requires the accessible meteorological and remote sensing inputs with a few diagnostic parameters and is conveniently applied at large spatial scale fig 9 the spatiotemporal dynamics of et and yield for wheat and maize in the ncp were examined it was found that et of both crops increased insignificantly and slightly while yield of wheat increased significantly resulting in an improved wp during the past 20 years fig 8 this should be mainly attributed to the comprehensive agricultural management such as crop varieties renewal soil improvement and fertilizer zhang et al 2013a 2013b 2021b regional wp could be influenced by multiple factors such as water resources soil climate and agronomic management fang et al 2010 generally wp or wue of maize was larger than that of winter wheat due to the different characteristics of c3 and c4 species figs 9 and 10 shen et al 2013 wang et al 2018 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 the spatial distribution of wp for wheat showed a lower value in the semi arid northern area than the humid southern area the statistical yield of winter wheat at county level indicated that total yield in the ncp generally increased during 1998 2015 and that the counties with significant increase and decrease mainly concentrated in the southern and northern regions respectively zhang and lu 2019 this agreed with a higher wp in the humid south region fig 9 climate factors such as air temperature increase and changes in rainfall patterns may decrease crop yield and wue especially in water limited semiarid areas fang et al 2010 liu et al 2019 these results strongly support the current winter wheat fallow measures in the northern ncp while wp of maize varied a litter among various climatic or irrigated regions fig 10 which was mainly due to high rainfall during maize season there was no significant reduction of maize yield with less irrigation at luancheng site in recent 20 years zhang et al 2016b maize yield can even increase under rainfed conditions while decrease for irrigated maize when co2 fertilization effect was considered xiong et al 2007 irrigation could improve or maintain high yield while large amount of irrigation is unfavorable for wp improvement reducing the planting area of winter wheat was an effective way to enhance wp and more efforts are also needed to implement water saving irrigation schedule zhang et al 2021b zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 the conventional crop models have been used to study crop water consumption and production in interaction with the environment at site scale holzworth et al 2014 wit et al 2019 while the complex mechanism in the model relies on many forcing inputs such as soil physicochemical characteristics and management practices and numerous parameters such as soil type specific crop specific and other coefficients which may be unavailable at regional scale huang et al 2018 qiao et al 2020 there are also some uncertainties on regional application of the resem for example the accumulated gpp and crop growth duration are critical variables for crop growth simulation the onset and end of crop growth season was observed at the site while the spatial extraction of crop phenology is needed for regional estimation which can be detected based on remote sensing vis sakamoto et al 2013 li and lei 2022 luo et al 2020 then the uncertainty in yield estimation mainly originates from parameters ρc and φ npp gpp i e carbon use efficiency although ρc was more sensitive to yield estimation huang et al 2018 ρc was generally in a narrow range from 0 4 to 0 45 for rice wheat and maize huang et al 2018 liu et al 2020 wang et al 2019 parameter φ can vary over a large range and shows considerable spatial variation associated with ecosystem type geographical location and climate zhang et al 2009 even for rice φ varied from 0 50 to 0 79 on a large spatial scale huang et al 2018 although a constant φ was generally adopted before the spatial pattern of φ derived by the yield based npp and solar induced fluorescence based gpp could be an alternative guan et al 2016 and the relationship of φ between the environmental factors such as temperature should be further investigated the spatial pattern of the parameters for crops water consumption and carbon assimilation can be further diagnosed with as more observations as possible in the future 5 conclusion in this study by integrating a crop growth simulation method into the remotely sensed and water carbon coupled model et and yield related processes for wheat and maize croplands were simultaneously estimated firstly three model experiments were conducted to estimate crop et and gpp considering different remote sensing lai inputs and parameters then the estimates were evaluated through comparing with 20 site years of observations 1 it was found that the calculated laiwdrvi and the individually calibrated parameters for wheat and maize in pml 3 significantly improved the fluxes estimates compared to the original estimates by pml 1 the individual parameters also represented different c3 and c4 crop characteristics relative to the fixed ones the average nse of et and gpp was about 0 88 and 0 65 for wheat and maize respectively rmse of et and gpp were 0 57 mm d 1 and 1 65 g c m 2 d 1 for wheat and was 0 80 mm d 1 and 2 92 g c m 2 d 1 for maize respectively 2 meanwhile the simulation of dry biomass accumulation biomass allocation and yield also performed well for wheat and maize rmse of yield was 554 7 kg hm 2 rrmse 9 and 1346 6 kg hm 2 rrmse 15 for wheat and maize respectively finally the spatiotemporal dynamics of wp of winter wheat and summer maize over the ncp during 2001 2018 were assessed 3 the significantly increased wheat yield resulting in a significantly improved wp in the past two decades while wp of wheat was generally lower than that of maize 4 spatially wp of wheat in the irrigated semi arid area was lower than that in the less irrigated humid area the results provide important basis for water resource management and food security with the accessible meteorological and remote sensing data the developed resem is conveniently applied for croplands at large spatial scale while its spatial resolution 500 m needs to be further improved considering the fine planting structure and management practice and its application should be well assessed in humid areas where there was no fluxes observation in the ncp for yield simulation driven by carbon fluxes in this work or similar studies the spatial pattern of carbon use efficiency needs to be further evaluated in the future declaration
