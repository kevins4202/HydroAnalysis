1845,to identify the enrichment mechanism of fluoride and iodine in saline groundwater and reveal the impact of salinization on it hydrogeochemical studies were conducted in different zones from the lower flood plain of the yellow river china the results showed that high f and high i groundwater is mainly distributed in the paleo yellow river alluvial plain zone 2 and alluvial lacustrine plain zone 3 rather than the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain zone 1 with exceedances of groundwater guidelines reaching up to 57 69 80 77 the high f and high i groundwater is characterized by high total dissolved solids tds concentrations which ranged between 475 and 7002 mg l with 47 and 77 of groundwater samples from zone 2 and zone 3 having tds over 1000 mg l respectively groundwater f mainly originated from geogenic sources of fluorite dissolution and silicate weathering and its release was promoted by alkaline conditions cation exchange processes and the competitive adsorption of hco3 with increasing tds concentration in the groundwater f concentration showed a trend of first increasing and then slightly decreasing furthermore the cl br molar ratio in groundwater and gibbs diagram indicated that water rock interactions could lead to f enrichment in slightly saline water tds 3000 mg l and strong evaporation would restrict f concentration in saline water tds 3000 mg l due to the limitation of fluorite solubility in contrast no close correlation between i and tds was observed indicating that salinization of groundwater is not the dominant reason for i enrichment in zone 2 and zone 3 large amounts of alluvial lacustrine sediments with abundant organic matter are probably the reason for high i groundwater which is supported by the significantly positive correlation between i and br the reduction of iodate and nitrate could be the direct cause of elevated i concentration in groundwater in addition results of factor analysis further confirm contrasting behaviors of fluoride and iodine in saline groundwater keywords fluoride iodine hydrogeochemistry salinization process factor analysis data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction globally groundwater is a critical resource that accounts for approximately 95 of available freshwater and approximately 31 5 of daily water consumption murphy et al 2017 however the worldwide occurrence of geogenic fluoride and iodine contaminated groundwater brings significant negative effects on the supply of water resources and human health in many areas such as afghanistan hayat and baba 2017 yadav et al 2019 bangladesh rahman et al 2020 china han et al 2021 jia et al 2018 india batabyal and gupta 2017 america chaudhuri and ale 2013 and iran amini et al 2008 fluorine and iodine mainly occur in the ionic form f and i in groundwater wang et al 2020 excessive intake of high f groundwater will lead to dental fluorosis and bone fluorosis sahu et al 2017 iodine is an indispensable microcomponent for thyroxine synthesis but too much or too little intake of iodine can cause hypothyroidism and other diseases laurberg et al 2010 according to the world health organization who the drinking water standards for f and i should be lower than 1 5 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively according to the chinese standards gb5749 2006 gb 14848 2017 the concentrations of f and i should not exceed 1 0 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively in both drinking water and groundwater in china 70 million people have been victims of endemic fluorosis especially in the arid semi arid areas with the concentration of fluoride in groundwater reaching up to 14 1 mg l chen et al 2012 a prediction model has shown that the high risk area p 0 5 of high iodine groundwater accounts for 19 8 of china s land area wang et al 2022 fluoride occurs widely in the natural environment because of its relatively high content in the earth s crust 0 065 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 fluorine rich minerals mainly include fluorite caf2 fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f and cryolite na3alf6 the dissolution of f containing minerals especially fluorite has generally been considered as the main source of f in groundwater schafer et al 2018 typically high f groundwater is characterized as na hco3 type with relatively low ca2 concentrations and with neutral to alkaline ph values 7 9 li et al 2019 qiao et al 2022 the processes of na ca cation exchange and or precipitation of caco3 under favorable conditions which can remove ca2 are able to promote the dissolution of caf2 moreover under alkaline conditions high concentrations of oh and hco3 tend to mobilize f from the surface of amorphous fe al oxyhydroxides and clay minerals into groundwater due to the similarity in the charges and radii of these anions pi et al 2015 wang et al 2021b xiao et al 2022 in arid and semi arid basins strong evaporation can lead to the precipitation of low solubility minerals caco3 thus decreasing the availability of ca2 in groundwater and facilitating the dissolution of fluorite minerals guo et al 2012 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 in addition geothermal fluids are generally enriched in fluoride the f concentrations range from 17 9 to 19 6 mg l in the groundwater 100 c at the yangbajing geothermal field of tibet guo et al 2007a around the guide basin spring water exhibited high f concentrations reaching 16 7 mg l wang et al 2021b iodine commonly exists in the form of iodide i iodate io3 and organic iodine oi in the groundwater system and i is the dominant species under reducing conditions voutchkova et al 2017 naturally high i groundwater is mainly distributed in inland basins and coastal plains wang et al 2020 the ancient marine transgression brought i sourced from sea water to affect groundwater in areas such as the north china plain denmark and japan li et al 2017a togo et al 2016 xue et al 2019 additionally quaternary alluvial lacustrine sediments are a rich source of groundwater iodine including in the datong basin yuncheng basin hetao basin and yangtze river basin jia et al 2018 li et al 2019 xue et al 2022 clayey or silty deposits rich in organic matter generally have a higher iodine content compared to sandy deposits li et al 2016b some researchers have reported that humus may serve as the major reservoir of iodine in most soils shetaya et al 2012 in addition iron oxyhydroxides are also able to act as a host of iodine in sediments li et al 2020 the biodegradation of organic matter could result in the reductive dissolution of iron oxides as well as the transformation between iodine species qian et al 2020 under weakly reductive conditions oi and or io3 can transform to i and lead to the enrichment of i in groundwater due to the lower affinity of i for sediments or minerals the southwest plain of shandong province which is located in the lower flood plain of the yellow river is a region of endemic diseases due to chronic exposure to f and i contaminated groundwater xiao et al 2022 previous studies have reported that groundwater f and i levels in this region are closely related to geologic structure sedimentary environment topography and climate liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 in this region the hydrochemistry of groundwater is characterized by high salinity with tds concentrations of over 3000 mg l xiao et al 2022 however research on the co occurrence mechanism of f and i in saline groundwater is limited compared with arid and semi arid basins which are characterized by strong evaporation evaporation may have a relatively weak impact on groundwater salinity in this region because of the warm temperate subhumid monsoon climate however the dominant hydrogeochemical processes for groundwater salinization e g dissolution precipitation adsorption desorption oxidation reduction evaporation concentration are undefined and the impact of salinization on f and i enrichment in groundwater may be different than in other contaminated regions in addition the sedimentary environment of this study area is complex due to the swing of the paleo yellow river alluvial flood deposits in the surrounding mountains and alluvial lacustrine deposits in the low lying terrain however few studies have been conducted to explore the distribution characteristics and controlling mechanism of high f and high i groundwater in these different sedimentary zones therefore this research aims to 1 investigate the spatial distribution characteristics of f and i in groundwater in different hydrogeological zones 2 identify the sources of enriched f and i in groundwater 3 reveal the hydrogeochemical processes controlling the enrichment of high f and high i and the influence of groundwater salinization this study will provide a better understanding of the co occurrence mechanism of f and i in high salinity groundwater in non arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in southwestern shandong province bounded by the yellow river in the north and low and middle hills in the east fig 1 it has a warm temperate subhumid monsoon climate the average annual rainfall is about 715 mm which is significantly lower than the average evaporation of 1879 mm precipitation shows high inter annual variability with 70 of annual precipitation occurring in the wet season june september this region has dozens of rivers flowing into the nansihu lake among which the larger rivers are the wanfu zhuzhaoxin dongyu and si topographically the study area is characterized by low terrain in the grand canal and nansihu lake and high terrain in the northeast and southwest fig 1 geologically this region includes the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain zone 1 the paleo yellow river alluvial plain zone 2 and the alluvial lacustrine plain zone 3 fig 1 xu et al 2014 in the study area the thickness of quaternary loose deposits exceeds 400 m fig s1 the aquifers in zone 1 are mainly composed of medium coarse sand and gravel followed by medium fine sand and silt sand in this zone the strong permeability of aquifers and steep hydraulic gradient contribute to the rapid flow and strong flushing in contrast zone 2 and zone 3 are low lying and are affected by flooding and meandering of the yellow river which have formed several depressions swamps and crevasse splays the aquifers in zone 2 and zone 3 are mainly composed of silt fine sand mild clay and clay containing a lot of organic matter meng sheng et al 2014 groundwater recharge runoff and discharge in this region are influenced by topography lithology and human factors precipitation and river infiltration are the main ways of shallow groundwater recharge and evaporation and artificial mining are the main ways of shallow groundwater discharge in addition lateral runoff recharge from upstream mountainous areas is another important source for zone 1 groundwater controlled by terrain conditions groundwater in zone 1 flows gradually from east to west whereas groundwater in zone 2 and zone 3 generally moves from west to east with both groundwater flows migrating to the nansihu lake and grand canal 2 2 groundwater sampling and analysis groundwater samples were collected from unconfined aquifer and semi confined aquifer with depths of mostly 80 m in september 2020 fig 1 the 69 wells that were sampled are used for drinking water and agricultural irrigation before sampling the wells were pumped for more than half an hour to avoid the impact of stagnant water on the representativeness of the samples the groundwater temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured using a eureka easyprobe multi parameter instrument in the field once these in situ parameters were stable groundwater samples were collected at 0 5 m below the water table and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter samples collected for trace element and major cation analyses were acidified with hno3 ph 2 and samples with no acidification were used for major anion analysis all groundwater samples were stored in portable ice filled coolers at 4 c and sent to the laboratory for analyses all of the hydrochemical analyses were performed at the shandong land and space ecological restoration center major cations na k ca2 mg2 were analyzed based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms major anions cl so4 2 no3 f i and br were determined using ion chromatography dx 120 dionex the detection limit of f i br were 0 1 mg l 0 01 mg l 0 01 mg l respectively hco3 concentrations were measured through acid base titration in addition tds was determined by gravimetric analysis the analytical precision error of the icp ms and dx 120 instruments is 5 moreover the ion charge imbalances among most water samples were 5 2 3 data analysis the hydrochemical types of groundwater were analyzed with the help of the rock ware aqqa 1 1 software the mineral saturation index si was calculated by the phreeqc geochemical modelling program version 3 3 5 for evaluating the equilibrium state between groundwater and minerals present pearson correlation coefficients were computed to identify the degree of dependency between variables factor analysis fa are widely applied to analyze interrelationship among different hydrochemical data to extract the most key factors and to reduce the data with minimum loss of information belkhiri and narany 2015 in this study principal component analysis was selected for factor extraction the number of factors was determined by the total explained variability and the number of eigenvalues 1 the varimax rotation was further performed to make the factor solution more interpretable factor scores were assessed by the regression method and plotted using inverse distance weighted interpolation about the score positive values represent areas affected by the hydrogeochemical process which each factor represents while negative values represent the areas not affected by a given process the correlation analysis and factor analysis were performed by the ibm spss statistics 27 3 results 3 1 hydrological characteristics 3 1 1 hydrochemical type descriptive statistics of chemical components in groundwater samples are shown in table s1 the ph values ranged from 7 62 to 9 16 with a mean value of 8 30 which demonstrates that the groundwater environment was slightly alkaline tds varied from 475 mg l to 7002 mg l indicating a large variation in groundwater salinity in zone 2 and zone 3 47 4 and 76 9 of groundwater samples respectively exceeded the limit of 1000 mg l for dinking purposes recommended by the chinese guidelines gaqs 2017 in different zones slightly saline water tds 1000 3000 mg l samples accounted for 42 65 of the total samples and saline water tds 3000 mg l samples accounted for 5 12 of the total samples fig s2 as shown in fig s3 cation composition was dominated by na k followed by ca2 and mg2 with average concentrations of 283 23 mg l 104 45 mg l and 92 36 mg l respectively the anions were mainly hco3 followed by so4 2 and cl with mean concentrations of 632 21 mg l 348 26 mg l and 256 63 mg l respectively in zone 1 the hydrochemistry of the groundwater was mainly of the hco3 ca type followed by so4 cl ca mg the hydrochemical components of zone 2 and zone 3 were mainly hco3 na mg followed by hco3 ca mg fig 2 3 1 2 pearson correlation analysis correlation analysis among different variables is helpful for understanding their possible sources and hydrogeochemical processes in the groundwater system xiao et al 2022 pearson correlation coefficients were calculated as presented in fig 3 mg2 na hco3 so4 2 and cl all showed a positive correlation with tds and these parameters represent macro components in groundwater nevertheless no close correlation was observed between ca2 and tds this was probably related to the ca2 concentration which was lower compared to other cations especially in zone 2 and zone 3 fig s3 f showed a positive correlation with na r 0 52 and hco3 r 0 58 and a negative correlation with ca2 0 28 fig 3 elevated f concentration is generally related to the dissolution of calcium fluoride and na ca ionic exchanges schafer et al 2018 wang et al 2021a notably i showed a significantly positive correlation with br r 0 77 which suggests that groundwater i and br probably have a common source in addition i exhibited a positive correlation with na and hco3 and a negative correlation with no3 indicating that weakly reducing conditions favor the enrichment of i pi et al 2015 3 2 spatial distribution of f and i in different sedimentary environments the concentrations of f in groundwater varied between 0 15 and 3 49 mg l with an average of 1 31 mg l approximately 50 88 of the groundwater samples had f concentrations exceeding the permissible limit of 1 0 mg l for drinking water as suggested by the chinese guidelines gaqs 2017 as shown in fig 4 high f groundwater was mainly distributed in the paleo yellow river alluvial plain zone 2 and alluvial lacustrine plain zone 3 with respective exceedance rates of 68 42 and 57 69 conversely there was only one sample with an f concentration exceeding 1 0 mg l in the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain zone 1 it can be seen from the piper diagram that the hydrochemical faces of high f groundwaters are characterized by the hco3 type and na type fig 2 the study area had an i concentration ranging from 0 04 mg l to 0 97 mg l with a mean value of 0 28 mg l approximately 64 91 of groundwater samples had an i concentration greater than the permissible limit of 0 1 mg l for drinking water as suggested by the chinese guidelines gaqs 2017 the distribution characteristics of i in groundwater were similar to those of f fig 4 the groundwater i concentration in the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain zone 1 was relatively low with a mean of 0 083 mg l in the paleo yellow river alluvial plain zone 2 and alluvial lacustrine plain zone 3 the exceedance rate of i in groundwater reached 78 95 and 80 77 respectively similarly the high i groundwater was characterized by the hco3 na type fig 2 the changes in f and i concentrations seem to be related to depth fig s4 samples with higher concentrations of f and i were distributed in aquifers with a depth of 10 30 m as shown in fig s4 the changes in f and i concentrations with depth are similar to those for tds and cl showing relatively high concentrations in shallow groundwater and lower concentrations in deep groundwater in addition some high f and high i groundwater was distributed along riverbanks e g dongyu river wanfu river zhaoxin river fig 4 which means that hyporheic zone could has a high risk of f and i contamination 3 3 saturation indices of minerals saturation indices sis were used to determine the saturation and precipitation over saturation and dissolution under saturation of the possible mineral phases si values are summarized in fig 5 all groundwater samples were over saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite with si 0 and the si values of groundwater samples collected from zones 2 3 were greater than those of groundwater samples collected from zone 1 fig 5a b in contrast the si values for gypsum halite and fluorite of almost all groundwater samples were less than zero fig 5c e the si values for gypsum ranged from 3 05 to 0 34 the si values for halite ranged from 7 55 to 4 40 and the si values for fluorite ranged from 2 51 to 0 16 from zone 1 to zone 3 the si values of fluorite gradually increase as salinity increases which indicates that these minerals tend to be saturated 4 discussion 4 1 geogenic source of groundwater f and i previous studies had excluded an anthropogenic origin of f and i in groundwater in this southwest plain of shandong province xiao et al 2022 xu et al 2020 the evolution of groundwater chemistry is mainly influenced by three mechanisms in nature namely water rock interaction evaporation and atmospheric precipitation gibbs 1970 according to the gibbs diagram fig 6 groundwater samples mainly plot within the rock weathering domain while several samples plot within the evaporation domain this suggests that water rock interaction is the primary mechanism contributing hydrogeochemical characteristics furthermore the end member diagram was used to assess the relative contribution of the rock weathering processes including silicate carbonate and evaporite weathering guo et al 2013 xiao et al 2022 based on fig s5 zone 1 groundwater samples plot close to the carbonate domain while zones 2 3 groundwater samples plot within the silicate weathering domain therefore the high levels of f in groundwater were probably released from f bearing minerals including silicates i e muscovite biotite hornblende and fluorite due to the high affinity of iodine for organic matter iodine usually occurs in fine grained sediment such as clay silt and iron oxides li et al 2017b shetaya et al 2012 xue et al 2019 moreover br and i behave in a similar manner in the secondary environment and can be classified as biophile elements that concentrate in organic matter fuge 1988 lu et al 2015 a significantly positive correlation r 0 77 p 0 01 between i and br is observed in fig 9c indicating a common organic matter source for i and br compared with zones 2 3 the stratum of zone 1 the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain is composed of coarse grained sand with poor organic matter and thus represents a poor source for groundwater i and br as shown in fig 9c concentrations of i and br are relatively low in most groundwater samples from zone 1 a weak yet significant positive correlation was observed for groundwater f and i concentrations in the study area r 0 24 p 0 01 fig 3 this may suggest that groundwater f and i have relatively independent sources and or a contrasting mechanism for mobilization in aquifers 4 2 controlling factors of f and i mobilization the elevated f concentration is controlled more by major cations e g ca2 and na in the study area groundwater f concentrations show a strong negative correlation with the ca2 equivalent proportion in cations r 0 63 p 0 01 fig 7 a and a positive correlation with the na equivalent proportion r 0 57 p 0 001 fig 7b the proportion of high f groundwater is around 83 in non ca type water while that in ca type water is only 17 fig 7a however high f groundwater only accounts for around 7 of non na type water while 93 of na type water exhibits elevated f concentration fig 7b with decreasing ca2 the reaction shown in eq 1 will proceed to the right consequently increasing the concentration of f overall high f groundwater is characterized by low ca2 but high na groundwater as evidenced by the strong positive correlation between groundwater f concentrations and na ca2 equivalent ratio r 0 54 p 0 001 fig s6a 1 c a f 2 c a 2 2 f therefore evaluating the fate of ca2 in groundwater is helpful for understanding the mobility of groundwater f the ca2 mg2 equivalent ratio is often used to evaluate the behavior of ca2 in groundwater this ratio is indicative of dolomite dissolution ca2 mg2 equivalent ratio 1 calcite dissolution 1 and silicate weathering 2 and ratios 1 indicate ca2 removal via precipitation katz et al 2010 parvaiz et al 2021 as shown in fig s6b the ratio ranges between 0 18 and 4 71 with all high f groundwater f 1 0 mg l samples having a ratio lower than 1 this indicates the preferential removal of ca2 especially in zone 2 and zone 3 groundwater which consequently facilitates the dissolution of caf2 in zone 1 most of the samples are ca type water and with the ca2 mg2 equivalent ratio exceeding 1 which is attributed to calcite and or silicate dissolution east of zone 1 widely distributed granite carbonatite and metamorphic rocks provide an abundant source of calcium for the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain high concentrations of ca2 81 7 373 3 mg l were observed in the groundwater of zone 1 fig s3 under strong flushing the elevated ca2 contributes to the precipitation of fluorite caf2 due to fluoride solubility control ksp of fluoride at 25 c is 5 2 10 9 li et al 2017a therefore leading to low f concentrations in this zone another possible reason for ca2 removal in zones 2 3 is cation exchange between ca2 and na the relationship between na k cl and hco3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 is linear plotted around the y x line fig 8 fig 9 showing that cation exchange is an important hydrogeochemical process occurring in the groundwater in the study area as most of the groundwater samples are unsaturated with respect to fluorite fig 5 the decrease in groundwater ca2 will promote fluorite dissolution and thus f enrichment qiao et al 2022 in addition the positive correlation between f and na ca2 fig s6a proves that the occurrence of cation exchange favors the mobility of f in groundwater the facilitation of high na ca2 equivalent ratio on groundwater f enrichment has been widely observed in both reducing pi et al 2015 wang et al 2021a and oxidizing aquifers currell et al 2011 zabala et al 2016 in this study area hco3 is the dominant anion in groundwater with alkaline conditions and the hydrochemical components of zone 2 and zone 3 are mainly of the hco3 type fig 2 and fig s2 the high content of hco3 as a common competitive anion in groundwater can trigger the desorption of f and i on mineral grains qiao et al 2022 numerous studies have shown that f i and io3 can be adsorbed on the sediment surface such as fe al oxyhydroxides oxides clay minerals and natural organic matter kaplan et al 2000 li et al 2017b xu et al 2013 significant positive correlations between hco3 and f r 0 55 p 0 01 and i r 0 60 p 0 01 can be observed in fig 9 suggesting that competitive adsorption by hco3 promotes the enrichment of f and i in addition high aqueous hco3 can facilitate caf2 dissolution and the subsequent release of f guo et al 2007b 2 c a f 2 2 h c o 3 c a c o 3 2 f c o 2 h 2 o under reducing conditions no3 and io3 generally act as electron acceptors that are utilized by some facultative anaerobes amachi 2008 li et al 2022b consequently no3 is reduced to no2 and further to n2 and io3 is reduced to i resulting in an increase in i concentration and a decrease in no3 and io3 concentrations in the groundwater zhang et al 2021 simultaneous no3 and io3 reduction has been found in many agrobacterium species bergaust et al 2008 and batch experiments have shown that microbial io3 reduction is catalyzed by no3 reductase amachi et al 2007 lee et al 2018 based on fig 9d high i concentrations are found in groundwater with low no3 concentrations in zone 2 and zone 3 which means that the reduction of no3 and io3 is relatively exhaustive in these areas the concentration of no3 is obviously lower in zone 2 and zone 3 compared to that in zone 1 showing varied redox conditions in different zones fig s7 in the reducing groundwater environment in zone 2 and zone 3 the average concentrations of i are 0 32 mg l and 0 34 mg l respectively which are remarkably higher than those in zone 1 average 0 08 mg l with oxidizing conditions fig s7 4 3 impact of groundwater salinization on f and i the tds concentration in groundwater indicates a large variation in salinity ranging between 475 and 7002 mg l as shown in fig s8 f content shows a linear increasing trend with increasing tds in slightly saline water tds 3000 mg l however the concentration of f is relatively invariable and even decreases in saline water tds 3000 mg l fig s8 a clear relationship with tds is not observed for i fig s8 the cl br molar ratio is often used as an indicator of groundwater transport and solute origin li et al 2022a pi et al 2015 halite dissolution leads to a rapid increase in the cl br molar ratio with increasing cl concentration while evaporation does not change cl br ratios until halite saturation occurs li et al 2016a xie et al 2012 groundwater cl br molar ratios in the study area range from 136 to 2512 showing a wide variation the plot of cl br ratios vs cl shows two obvious trends fig 10 when cl 600 mg l corresponding tds 3000 mg l the cl br ratios increase sharply with increasing cl content suggesting that halite mineral leaching and dissolution is an important source of groundwater solutes in contrast in trend 2 the cl br ratio does not change with increasing cl content when cl 600 mg l corresponding tds 3000 mg l indicating that evaporation is the main process elevating salinity as shown in fig 10 almost all high f and high i groundwater are situated within the leaching and dissolution domains with slightly saline water which is confirmed by the gibbs diagram fig 6 in trend 1 increases in groundwater salinity and f concentrations are mainly attributed to water rock interactions rather than evaporation however the concentrations of f in groundwater do not show continuous increases in saline water tds 3000 mg l fig 10 even though evaporation can further concentrate f in the groundwater this observation indicates that intense evaporation might restrain f enrichment in groundwater with the effects of evaporation high tds groundwater usually has higher ca2 concentration consequently the elevated ca2 content can retard the dissolution of fluorite caf2 a similar restriction of high salinity on groundwater f enrichment has also been observed in the datong basin in which tds concentration ranges between 451 and 8250 mg l li et al 2016a in contrast no close correlation between groundwater i and tds is observed in fig s8 the high concentration of i mainly occurs in groundwater with relatively low salinity cl 300 mg l fig 10 many previous studies have shown that groundwater iodine concentration is usually dependent on the redox conditions of the groundwater lu et al 2015 wen et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 the biodegradation of organic matter enhances the dissolution of carbonate minerals to increase the hco3 content in groundwater li et al 2017b hence elevated hco3 and i content in the groundwater of the study area might be related to the microbially mediated oxidation of organic matter and i release from the iodine loaded organic matter therefore iodine speciation and specific iodine reducing bacteria involved in iodine cycling warrant further research in the future 4 4 statistical verification in order to further identify and verify the key processes responsible for elevated f and i in groundwater of different zones the fa has been performed the major ions of tds ca2 mg2 na hco3 so4 2 cl no3 br f and i are used as variables three factors factor 1 factor 2 and factor 3 are extracted from the original variables by the analysis with a kmo coefficient of 0 770 under a 99 confidence level these factors count for 84 of the total variances and the total variance explained is given in table s2 the loading values for the respective principal components are shown in table 1 and fig 11 a the factor 1 explains 45 80 of the total data variance and half of chemical parameters in the original data set are contained in this factor high positive loadings of tds cl so4 2 mg2 na br indicate that groundwater chemical composition is largely influenced by silicate and halite dissolution and evaporation the spatial distribution of factor 1 scores is shown in fig 10b the lower scores blue shade are observed in zone 1 in which tds concentration is lower that is attributed to the strong flushing of groundwater in piedmont alluvial plain an abnormally high score is observed in zone 1 fig 10b due to sulfate pollution so4 2 3134 6 mg l the high scores red shade are mainly distributed in zone 2 and zone 3 indicating the high contents of major components in groundwater the slightly saline water tds 1000 3000 mg l and saline water tds 3000 mg l mainly occurs in the two zones gibbs diagram and cl br molar ratios show that water rock interaction and evaporation are major mechanisms contributing to groundwater salinization of these two zones the factor 2 corresponds to 22 16 of total variance and has a significant correlation with no3 i br and hco3 this component can explain the source of i in groundwater and the impact of redox conditions on i release as mentioned above the positive loading of i br and hco3 may indicate the biodegradation of organic matter iodine and bromide are biophilic element generally enriched in organic rich sedimentary and marine sedimentary kim et al 2020 razafindratsima et al 2015 scholz et al 2010 when organic matter is buried microbial decomposition can release iodine and bromide and produce hco3 lu et al 2015 both dissolution of carbonate minerals and decomposition of organic matter can lead to enrichment of hco3 in the groundwater the correlation coefficient and the factor analysis show that redox action is the more important trigger than dissolution of carbonate minerals to iodine enrichment the strongly negative loading of no3 0 846 represent reducing environment of groundwater as shown in the fig 11c these areas with higher factor scores indicate greater groundwater reducing and higher concentrations of iodine and bromine comparing fig 4b and fig 11c the spatial distribution of high i groundwater is generally coincident with high scores of the factor 2 in a word the fa results suggest that formation of high i groundwater is preferentially controlled by reducing conditions in the factor 3 explaining 16 36 of the total variance f shows the highest positive loading and ca2 shows the lowest negative loading this principal component indicates that fluoride concentration in groundwater is significantly controlled by the behaviors of ca2 in groundwater a notable negative correlation between f and ca2 is observed in the present study area and other fluoride enriched regions due to calcium fluoride solubility equilibrium li et al 2016a parvaiz et al 2021 podgorski et al 2018 in zone 1 ca2 is the dominantly cationic composition and high concentration of ca2 restrain releases of f in zone 2 and zone 3 both saturation of calcite and dolomite and cation exchange between ca2 and na lead to ca2 removal in groundwater consequently high f groundwater is widely distributed in zone 2 and zone 3 which is supported by the spatial distribution of high factor scores in fig 11d besides hco3 and na has a relatively high loading in the factor 1 table 1 the hydrochemical components in zone 2 and zone 3 are mainly of hco3 na type high aqueous hco3 can not only promote the desorption of f derived from the surface of amorphous fe al oxyhydroxides and clay minerals but also promote the dissolution of calcium fluoride guo et al 2007b qiao et al 2022 5 conclusion the present study aimed to reveal the hydrochemistry salinization origin and driving forces of fluoride and iodine enrichment in groundwater in the lower flood plain of the yellow river the major findings are as follows 1 in the study area the groundwater is slightly alkaline ph 7 62 9 16 and saline tds 475 7002 mg l the typical hydrochemical types of shallow groundwater include hco3 na mg hco3 ca mg and so4 cl ca mg water rock interactions and evaporation contribute to groundwater salinization calcite and dolomite are over saturated in groundwater while gypsum halite and fluorite are under saturated 2 the distribution of groundwater f and i is clearly defined by sediment zones high f and i groundwater is mainly distributed in the paleo yellow river alluvial plain zone 2 and alluvial lacustrine plain zone 3 while low concentrations of f and i are observed in the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain zone 1 the results of gibbs diagram end member diagram and factor analysis show that groundwater f mainly originates from geogenic sources of fluorine bearing minerals in addition organic matter enriched alluvial lacustrine sediments are probably the main source of groundwater i in zone 2 and zone 3 3 groundwater f enrichment is promoted by the alkaline and high hco3 conditions precipitation of calcite and dolomite and cation exchange evaporation is only partly responsible for the groundwater enrichment of f in slightly saline water tds 3000 mg l and strong evapotranspiration would restrict the f concentration due to fluorite solubility control in contrast the hydrogeochemical characteristics of high i groundwater indicate that salinization has a weak influence on i enrichment and that reducing conditions favor i release future studies should investigate the speciation and spatial evolution of fluoride and iodine in both groundwater and sediments along hydrogeological profiles to further determine factors controlling

1845,to identify the enrichment mechanism of fluoride and iodine in saline groundwater and reveal the impact of salinization on it hydrogeochemical studies were conducted in different zones from the lower flood plain of the yellow river china the results showed that high f and high i groundwater is mainly distributed in the paleo yellow river alluvial plain zone 2 and alluvial lacustrine plain zone 3 rather than the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain zone 1 with exceedances of groundwater guidelines reaching up to 57 69 80 77 the high f and high i groundwater is characterized by high total dissolved solids tds concentrations which ranged between 475 and 7002 mg l with 47 and 77 of groundwater samples from zone 2 and zone 3 having tds over 1000 mg l respectively groundwater f mainly originated from geogenic sources of fluorite dissolution and silicate weathering and its release was promoted by alkaline conditions cation exchange processes and the competitive adsorption of hco3 with increasing tds concentration in the groundwater f concentration showed a trend of first increasing and then slightly decreasing furthermore the cl br molar ratio in groundwater and gibbs diagram indicated that water rock interactions could lead to f enrichment in slightly saline water tds 3000 mg l and strong evaporation would restrict f concentration in saline water tds 3000 mg l due to the limitation of fluorite solubility in contrast no close correlation between i and tds was observed indicating that salinization of groundwater is not the dominant reason for i enrichment in zone 2 and zone 3 large amounts of alluvial lacustrine sediments with abundant organic matter are probably the reason for high i groundwater which is supported by the significantly positive correlation between i and br the reduction of iodate and nitrate could be the direct cause of elevated i concentration in groundwater in addition results of factor analysis further confirm contrasting behaviors of fluoride and iodine in saline groundwater keywords fluoride iodine hydrogeochemistry salinization process factor analysis data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction globally groundwater is a critical resource that accounts for approximately 95 of available freshwater and approximately 31 5 of daily water consumption murphy et al 2017 however the worldwide occurrence of geogenic fluoride and iodine contaminated groundwater brings significant negative effects on the supply of water resources and human health in many areas such as afghanistan hayat and baba 2017 yadav et al 2019 bangladesh rahman et al 2020 china han et al 2021 jia et al 2018 india batabyal and gupta 2017 america chaudhuri and ale 2013 and iran amini et al 2008 fluorine and iodine mainly occur in the ionic form f and i in groundwater wang et al 2020 excessive intake of high f groundwater will lead to dental fluorosis and bone fluorosis sahu et al 2017 iodine is an indispensable microcomponent for thyroxine synthesis but too much or too little intake of iodine can cause hypothyroidism and other diseases laurberg et al 2010 according to the world health organization who the drinking water standards for f and i should be lower than 1 5 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively according to the chinese standards gb5749 2006 gb 14848 2017 the concentrations of f and i should not exceed 1 0 mg l and 0 1 mg l respectively in both drinking water and groundwater in china 70 million people have been victims of endemic fluorosis especially in the arid semi arid areas with the concentration of fluoride in groundwater reaching up to 14 1 mg l chen et al 2012 a prediction model has shown that the high risk area p 0 5 of high iodine groundwater accounts for 19 8 of china s land area wang et al 2022 fluoride occurs widely in the natural environment because of its relatively high content in the earth s crust 0 065 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 fluorine rich minerals mainly include fluorite caf2 fluorapatite ca5 po4 3f and cryolite na3alf6 the dissolution of f containing minerals especially fluorite has generally been considered as the main source of f in groundwater schafer et al 2018 typically high f groundwater is characterized as na hco3 type with relatively low ca2 concentrations and with neutral to alkaline ph values 7 9 li et al 2019 qiao et al 2022 the processes of na ca cation exchange and or precipitation of caco3 under favorable conditions which can remove ca2 are able to promote the dissolution of caf2 moreover under alkaline conditions high concentrations of oh and hco3 tend to mobilize f from the surface of amorphous fe al oxyhydroxides and clay minerals into groundwater due to the similarity in the charges and radii of these anions pi et al 2015 wang et al 2021b xiao et al 2022 in arid and semi arid basins strong evaporation can lead to the precipitation of low solubility minerals caco3 thus decreasing the availability of ca2 in groundwater and facilitating the dissolution of fluorite minerals guo et al 2012 vithanage and bhattacharya 2015 in addition geothermal fluids are generally enriched in fluoride the f concentrations range from 17 9 to 19 6 mg l in the groundwater 100 c at the yangbajing geothermal field of tibet guo et al 2007a around the guide basin spring water exhibited high f concentrations reaching 16 7 mg l wang et al 2021b iodine commonly exists in the form of iodide i iodate io3 and organic iodine oi in the groundwater system and i is the dominant species under reducing conditions voutchkova et al 2017 naturally high i groundwater is mainly distributed in inland basins and coastal plains wang et al 2020 the ancient marine transgression brought i sourced from sea water to affect groundwater in areas such as the north china plain denmark and japan li et al 2017a togo et al 2016 xue et al 2019 additionally quaternary alluvial lacustrine sediments are a rich source of groundwater iodine including in the datong basin yuncheng basin hetao basin and yangtze river basin jia et al 2018 li et al 2019 xue et al 2022 clayey or silty deposits rich in organic matter generally have a higher iodine content compared to sandy deposits li et al 2016b some researchers have reported that humus may serve as the major reservoir of iodine in most soils shetaya et al 2012 in addition iron oxyhydroxides are also able to act as a host of iodine in sediments li et al 2020 the biodegradation of organic matter could result in the reductive dissolution of iron oxides as well as the transformation between iodine species qian et al 2020 under weakly reductive conditions oi and or io3 can transform to i and lead to the enrichment of i in groundwater due to the lower affinity of i for sediments or minerals the southwest plain of shandong province which is located in the lower flood plain of the yellow river is a region of endemic diseases due to chronic exposure to f and i contaminated groundwater xiao et al 2022 previous studies have reported that groundwater f and i levels in this region are closely related to geologic structure sedimentary environment topography and climate liu et al 2021 xu et al 2020 in this region the hydrochemistry of groundwater is characterized by high salinity with tds concentrations of over 3000 mg l xiao et al 2022 however research on the co occurrence mechanism of f and i in saline groundwater is limited compared with arid and semi arid basins which are characterized by strong evaporation evaporation may have a relatively weak impact on groundwater salinity in this region because of the warm temperate subhumid monsoon climate however the dominant hydrogeochemical processes for groundwater salinization e g dissolution precipitation adsorption desorption oxidation reduction evaporation concentration are undefined and the impact of salinization on f and i enrichment in groundwater may be different than in other contaminated regions in addition the sedimentary environment of this study area is complex due to the swing of the paleo yellow river alluvial flood deposits in the surrounding mountains and alluvial lacustrine deposits in the low lying terrain however few studies have been conducted to explore the distribution characteristics and controlling mechanism of high f and high i groundwater in these different sedimentary zones therefore this research aims to 1 investigate the spatial distribution characteristics of f and i in groundwater in different hydrogeological zones 2 identify the sources of enriched f and i in groundwater 3 reveal the hydrogeochemical processes controlling the enrichment of high f and high i and the influence of groundwater salinization this study will provide a better understanding of the co occurrence mechanism of f and i in high salinity groundwater in non arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is located in southwestern shandong province bounded by the yellow river in the north and low and middle hills in the east fig 1 it has a warm temperate subhumid monsoon climate the average annual rainfall is about 715 mm which is significantly lower than the average evaporation of 1879 mm precipitation shows high inter annual variability with 70 of annual precipitation occurring in the wet season june september this region has dozens of rivers flowing into the nansihu lake among which the larger rivers are the wanfu zhuzhaoxin dongyu and si topographically the study area is characterized by low terrain in the grand canal and nansihu lake and high terrain in the northeast and southwest fig 1 geologically this region includes the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain zone 1 the paleo yellow river alluvial plain zone 2 and the alluvial lacustrine plain zone 3 fig 1 xu et al 2014 in the study area the thickness of quaternary loose deposits exceeds 400 m fig s1 the aquifers in zone 1 are mainly composed of medium coarse sand and gravel followed by medium fine sand and silt sand in this zone the strong permeability of aquifers and steep hydraulic gradient contribute to the rapid flow and strong flushing in contrast zone 2 and zone 3 are low lying and are affected by flooding and meandering of the yellow river which have formed several depressions swamps and crevasse splays the aquifers in zone 2 and zone 3 are mainly composed of silt fine sand mild clay and clay containing a lot of organic matter meng sheng et al 2014 groundwater recharge runoff and discharge in this region are influenced by topography lithology and human factors precipitation and river infiltration are the main ways of shallow groundwater recharge and evaporation and artificial mining are the main ways of shallow groundwater discharge in addition lateral runoff recharge from upstream mountainous areas is another important source for zone 1 groundwater controlled by terrain conditions groundwater in zone 1 flows gradually from east to west whereas groundwater in zone 2 and zone 3 generally moves from west to east with both groundwater flows migrating to the nansihu lake and grand canal 2 2 groundwater sampling and analysis groundwater samples were collected from unconfined aquifer and semi confined aquifer with depths of mostly 80 m in september 2020 fig 1 the 69 wells that were sampled are used for drinking water and agricultural irrigation before sampling the wells were pumped for more than half an hour to avoid the impact of stagnant water on the representativeness of the samples the groundwater temperature ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured using a eureka easyprobe multi parameter instrument in the field once these in situ parameters were stable groundwater samples were collected at 0 5 m below the water table and then filtered through a 0 45 μm membrane filter samples collected for trace element and major cation analyses were acidified with hno3 ph 2 and samples with no acidification were used for major anion analysis all groundwater samples were stored in portable ice filled coolers at 4 c and sent to the laboratory for analyses all of the hydrochemical analyses were performed at the shandong land and space ecological restoration center major cations na k ca2 mg2 were analyzed based on inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry agilent 7500ce icp ms major anions cl so4 2 no3 f i and br were determined using ion chromatography dx 120 dionex the detection limit of f i br were 0 1 mg l 0 01 mg l 0 01 mg l respectively hco3 concentrations were measured through acid base titration in addition tds was determined by gravimetric analysis the analytical precision error of the icp ms and dx 120 instruments is 5 moreover the ion charge imbalances among most water samples were 5 2 3 data analysis the hydrochemical types of groundwater were analyzed with the help of the rock ware aqqa 1 1 software the mineral saturation index si was calculated by the phreeqc geochemical modelling program version 3 3 5 for evaluating the equilibrium state between groundwater and minerals present pearson correlation coefficients were computed to identify the degree of dependency between variables factor analysis fa are widely applied to analyze interrelationship among different hydrochemical data to extract the most key factors and to reduce the data with minimum loss of information belkhiri and narany 2015 in this study principal component analysis was selected for factor extraction the number of factors was determined by the total explained variability and the number of eigenvalues 1 the varimax rotation was further performed to make the factor solution more interpretable factor scores were assessed by the regression method and plotted using inverse distance weighted interpolation about the score positive values represent areas affected by the hydrogeochemical process which each factor represents while negative values represent the areas not affected by a given process the correlation analysis and factor analysis were performed by the ibm spss statistics 27 3 results 3 1 hydrological characteristics 3 1 1 hydrochemical type descriptive statistics of chemical components in groundwater samples are shown in table s1 the ph values ranged from 7 62 to 9 16 with a mean value of 8 30 which demonstrates that the groundwater environment was slightly alkaline tds varied from 475 mg l to 7002 mg l indicating a large variation in groundwater salinity in zone 2 and zone 3 47 4 and 76 9 of groundwater samples respectively exceeded the limit of 1000 mg l for dinking purposes recommended by the chinese guidelines gaqs 2017 in different zones slightly saline water tds 1000 3000 mg l samples accounted for 42 65 of the total samples and saline water tds 3000 mg l samples accounted for 5 12 of the total samples fig s2 as shown in fig s3 cation composition was dominated by na k followed by ca2 and mg2 with average concentrations of 283 23 mg l 104 45 mg l and 92 36 mg l respectively the anions were mainly hco3 followed by so4 2 and cl with mean concentrations of 632 21 mg l 348 26 mg l and 256 63 mg l respectively in zone 1 the hydrochemistry of the groundwater was mainly of the hco3 ca type followed by so4 cl ca mg the hydrochemical components of zone 2 and zone 3 were mainly hco3 na mg followed by hco3 ca mg fig 2 3 1 2 pearson correlation analysis correlation analysis among different variables is helpful for understanding their possible sources and hydrogeochemical processes in the groundwater system xiao et al 2022 pearson correlation coefficients were calculated as presented in fig 3 mg2 na hco3 so4 2 and cl all showed a positive correlation with tds and these parameters represent macro components in groundwater nevertheless no close correlation was observed between ca2 and tds this was probably related to the ca2 concentration which was lower compared to other cations especially in zone 2 and zone 3 fig s3 f showed a positive correlation with na r 0 52 and hco3 r 0 58 and a negative correlation with ca2 0 28 fig 3 elevated f concentration is generally related to the dissolution of calcium fluoride and na ca ionic exchanges schafer et al 2018 wang et al 2021a notably i showed a significantly positive correlation with br r 0 77 which suggests that groundwater i and br probably have a common source in addition i exhibited a positive correlation with na and hco3 and a negative correlation with no3 indicating that weakly reducing conditions favor the enrichment of i pi et al 2015 3 2 spatial distribution of f and i in different sedimentary environments the concentrations of f in groundwater varied between 0 15 and 3 49 mg l with an average of 1 31 mg l approximately 50 88 of the groundwater samples had f concentrations exceeding the permissible limit of 1 0 mg l for drinking water as suggested by the chinese guidelines gaqs 2017 as shown in fig 4 high f groundwater was mainly distributed in the paleo yellow river alluvial plain zone 2 and alluvial lacustrine plain zone 3 with respective exceedance rates of 68 42 and 57 69 conversely there was only one sample with an f concentration exceeding 1 0 mg l in the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain zone 1 it can be seen from the piper diagram that the hydrochemical faces of high f groundwaters are characterized by the hco3 type and na type fig 2 the study area had an i concentration ranging from 0 04 mg l to 0 97 mg l with a mean value of 0 28 mg l approximately 64 91 of groundwater samples had an i concentration greater than the permissible limit of 0 1 mg l for drinking water as suggested by the chinese guidelines gaqs 2017 the distribution characteristics of i in groundwater were similar to those of f fig 4 the groundwater i concentration in the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain zone 1 was relatively low with a mean of 0 083 mg l in the paleo yellow river alluvial plain zone 2 and alluvial lacustrine plain zone 3 the exceedance rate of i in groundwater reached 78 95 and 80 77 respectively similarly the high i groundwater was characterized by the hco3 na type fig 2 the changes in f and i concentrations seem to be related to depth fig s4 samples with higher concentrations of f and i were distributed in aquifers with a depth of 10 30 m as shown in fig s4 the changes in f and i concentrations with depth are similar to those for tds and cl showing relatively high concentrations in shallow groundwater and lower concentrations in deep groundwater in addition some high f and high i groundwater was distributed along riverbanks e g dongyu river wanfu river zhaoxin river fig 4 which means that hyporheic zone could has a high risk of f and i contamination 3 3 saturation indices of minerals saturation indices sis were used to determine the saturation and precipitation over saturation and dissolution under saturation of the possible mineral phases si values are summarized in fig 5 all groundwater samples were over saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite with si 0 and the si values of groundwater samples collected from zones 2 3 were greater than those of groundwater samples collected from zone 1 fig 5a b in contrast the si values for gypsum halite and fluorite of almost all groundwater samples were less than zero fig 5c e the si values for gypsum ranged from 3 05 to 0 34 the si values for halite ranged from 7 55 to 4 40 and the si values for fluorite ranged from 2 51 to 0 16 from zone 1 to zone 3 the si values of fluorite gradually increase as salinity increases which indicates that these minerals tend to be saturated 4 discussion 4 1 geogenic source of groundwater f and i previous studies had excluded an anthropogenic origin of f and i in groundwater in this southwest plain of shandong province xiao et al 2022 xu et al 2020 the evolution of groundwater chemistry is mainly influenced by three mechanisms in nature namely water rock interaction evaporation and atmospheric precipitation gibbs 1970 according to the gibbs diagram fig 6 groundwater samples mainly plot within the rock weathering domain while several samples plot within the evaporation domain this suggests that water rock interaction is the primary mechanism contributing hydrogeochemical characteristics furthermore the end member diagram was used to assess the relative contribution of the rock weathering processes including silicate carbonate and evaporite weathering guo et al 2013 xiao et al 2022 based on fig s5 zone 1 groundwater samples plot close to the carbonate domain while zones 2 3 groundwater samples plot within the silicate weathering domain therefore the high levels of f in groundwater were probably released from f bearing minerals including silicates i e muscovite biotite hornblende and fluorite due to the high affinity of iodine for organic matter iodine usually occurs in fine grained sediment such as clay silt and iron oxides li et al 2017b shetaya et al 2012 xue et al 2019 moreover br and i behave in a similar manner in the secondary environment and can be classified as biophile elements that concentrate in organic matter fuge 1988 lu et al 2015 a significantly positive correlation r 0 77 p 0 01 between i and br is observed in fig 9c indicating a common organic matter source for i and br compared with zones 2 3 the stratum of zone 1 the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain is composed of coarse grained sand with poor organic matter and thus represents a poor source for groundwater i and br as shown in fig 9c concentrations of i and br are relatively low in most groundwater samples from zone 1 a weak yet significant positive correlation was observed for groundwater f and i concentrations in the study area r 0 24 p 0 01 fig 3 this may suggest that groundwater f and i have relatively independent sources and or a contrasting mechanism for mobilization in aquifers 4 2 controlling factors of f and i mobilization the elevated f concentration is controlled more by major cations e g ca2 and na in the study area groundwater f concentrations show a strong negative correlation with the ca2 equivalent proportion in cations r 0 63 p 0 01 fig 7 a and a positive correlation with the na equivalent proportion r 0 57 p 0 001 fig 7b the proportion of high f groundwater is around 83 in non ca type water while that in ca type water is only 17 fig 7a however high f groundwater only accounts for around 7 of non na type water while 93 of na type water exhibits elevated f concentration fig 7b with decreasing ca2 the reaction shown in eq 1 will proceed to the right consequently increasing the concentration of f overall high f groundwater is characterized by low ca2 but high na groundwater as evidenced by the strong positive correlation between groundwater f concentrations and na ca2 equivalent ratio r 0 54 p 0 001 fig s6a 1 c a f 2 c a 2 2 f therefore evaluating the fate of ca2 in groundwater is helpful for understanding the mobility of groundwater f the ca2 mg2 equivalent ratio is often used to evaluate the behavior of ca2 in groundwater this ratio is indicative of dolomite dissolution ca2 mg2 equivalent ratio 1 calcite dissolution 1 and silicate weathering 2 and ratios 1 indicate ca2 removal via precipitation katz et al 2010 parvaiz et al 2021 as shown in fig s6b the ratio ranges between 0 18 and 4 71 with all high f groundwater f 1 0 mg l samples having a ratio lower than 1 this indicates the preferential removal of ca2 especially in zone 2 and zone 3 groundwater which consequently facilitates the dissolution of caf2 in zone 1 most of the samples are ca type water and with the ca2 mg2 equivalent ratio exceeding 1 which is attributed to calcite and or silicate dissolution east of zone 1 widely distributed granite carbonatite and metamorphic rocks provide an abundant source of calcium for the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain high concentrations of ca2 81 7 373 3 mg l were observed in the groundwater of zone 1 fig s3 under strong flushing the elevated ca2 contributes to the precipitation of fluorite caf2 due to fluoride solubility control ksp of fluoride at 25 c is 5 2 10 9 li et al 2017a therefore leading to low f concentrations in this zone another possible reason for ca2 removal in zones 2 3 is cation exchange between ca2 and na the relationship between na k cl and hco3 so4 2 ca2 mg2 is linear plotted around the y x line fig 8 fig 9 showing that cation exchange is an important hydrogeochemical process occurring in the groundwater in the study area as most of the groundwater samples are unsaturated with respect to fluorite fig 5 the decrease in groundwater ca2 will promote fluorite dissolution and thus f enrichment qiao et al 2022 in addition the positive correlation between f and na ca2 fig s6a proves that the occurrence of cation exchange favors the mobility of f in groundwater the facilitation of high na ca2 equivalent ratio on groundwater f enrichment has been widely observed in both reducing pi et al 2015 wang et al 2021a and oxidizing aquifers currell et al 2011 zabala et al 2016 in this study area hco3 is the dominant anion in groundwater with alkaline conditions and the hydrochemical components of zone 2 and zone 3 are mainly of the hco3 type fig 2 and fig s2 the high content of hco3 as a common competitive anion in groundwater can trigger the desorption of f and i on mineral grains qiao et al 2022 numerous studies have shown that f i and io3 can be adsorbed on the sediment surface such as fe al oxyhydroxides oxides clay minerals and natural organic matter kaplan et al 2000 li et al 2017b xu et al 2013 significant positive correlations between hco3 and f r 0 55 p 0 01 and i r 0 60 p 0 01 can be observed in fig 9 suggesting that competitive adsorption by hco3 promotes the enrichment of f and i in addition high aqueous hco3 can facilitate caf2 dissolution and the subsequent release of f guo et al 2007b 2 c a f 2 2 h c o 3 c a c o 3 2 f c o 2 h 2 o under reducing conditions no3 and io3 generally act as electron acceptors that are utilized by some facultative anaerobes amachi 2008 li et al 2022b consequently no3 is reduced to no2 and further to n2 and io3 is reduced to i resulting in an increase in i concentration and a decrease in no3 and io3 concentrations in the groundwater zhang et al 2021 simultaneous no3 and io3 reduction has been found in many agrobacterium species bergaust et al 2008 and batch experiments have shown that microbial io3 reduction is catalyzed by no3 reductase amachi et al 2007 lee et al 2018 based on fig 9d high i concentrations are found in groundwater with low no3 concentrations in zone 2 and zone 3 which means that the reduction of no3 and io3 is relatively exhaustive in these areas the concentration of no3 is obviously lower in zone 2 and zone 3 compared to that in zone 1 showing varied redox conditions in different zones fig s7 in the reducing groundwater environment in zone 2 and zone 3 the average concentrations of i are 0 32 mg l and 0 34 mg l respectively which are remarkably higher than those in zone 1 average 0 08 mg l with oxidizing conditions fig s7 4 3 impact of groundwater salinization on f and i the tds concentration in groundwater indicates a large variation in salinity ranging between 475 and 7002 mg l as shown in fig s8 f content shows a linear increasing trend with increasing tds in slightly saline water tds 3000 mg l however the concentration of f is relatively invariable and even decreases in saline water tds 3000 mg l fig s8 a clear relationship with tds is not observed for i fig s8 the cl br molar ratio is often used as an indicator of groundwater transport and solute origin li et al 2022a pi et al 2015 halite dissolution leads to a rapid increase in the cl br molar ratio with increasing cl concentration while evaporation does not change cl br ratios until halite saturation occurs li et al 2016a xie et al 2012 groundwater cl br molar ratios in the study area range from 136 to 2512 showing a wide variation the plot of cl br ratios vs cl shows two obvious trends fig 10 when cl 600 mg l corresponding tds 3000 mg l the cl br ratios increase sharply with increasing cl content suggesting that halite mineral leaching and dissolution is an important source of groundwater solutes in contrast in trend 2 the cl br ratio does not change with increasing cl content when cl 600 mg l corresponding tds 3000 mg l indicating that evaporation is the main process elevating salinity as shown in fig 10 almost all high f and high i groundwater are situated within the leaching and dissolution domains with slightly saline water which is confirmed by the gibbs diagram fig 6 in trend 1 increases in groundwater salinity and f concentrations are mainly attributed to water rock interactions rather than evaporation however the concentrations of f in groundwater do not show continuous increases in saline water tds 3000 mg l fig 10 even though evaporation can further concentrate f in the groundwater this observation indicates that intense evaporation might restrain f enrichment in groundwater with the effects of evaporation high tds groundwater usually has higher ca2 concentration consequently the elevated ca2 content can retard the dissolution of fluorite caf2 a similar restriction of high salinity on groundwater f enrichment has also been observed in the datong basin in which tds concentration ranges between 451 and 8250 mg l li et al 2016a in contrast no close correlation between groundwater i and tds is observed in fig s8 the high concentration of i mainly occurs in groundwater with relatively low salinity cl 300 mg l fig 10 many previous studies have shown that groundwater iodine concentration is usually dependent on the redox conditions of the groundwater lu et al 2015 wen et al 2013 zhang et al 2013 the biodegradation of organic matter enhances the dissolution of carbonate minerals to increase the hco3 content in groundwater li et al 2017b hence elevated hco3 and i content in the groundwater of the study area might be related to the microbially mediated oxidation of organic matter and i release from the iodine loaded organic matter therefore iodine speciation and specific iodine reducing bacteria involved in iodine cycling warrant further research in the future 4 4 statistical verification in order to further identify and verify the key processes responsible for elevated f and i in groundwater of different zones the fa has been performed the major ions of tds ca2 mg2 na hco3 so4 2 cl no3 br f and i are used as variables three factors factor 1 factor 2 and factor 3 are extracted from the original variables by the analysis with a kmo coefficient of 0 770 under a 99 confidence level these factors count for 84 of the total variances and the total variance explained is given in table s2 the loading values for the respective principal components are shown in table 1 and fig 11 a the factor 1 explains 45 80 of the total data variance and half of chemical parameters in the original data set are contained in this factor high positive loadings of tds cl so4 2 mg2 na br indicate that groundwater chemical composition is largely influenced by silicate and halite dissolution and evaporation the spatial distribution of factor 1 scores is shown in fig 10b the lower scores blue shade are observed in zone 1 in which tds concentration is lower that is attributed to the strong flushing of groundwater in piedmont alluvial plain an abnormally high score is observed in zone 1 fig 10b due to sulfate pollution so4 2 3134 6 mg l the high scores red shade are mainly distributed in zone 2 and zone 3 indicating the high contents of major components in groundwater the slightly saline water tds 1000 3000 mg l and saline water tds 3000 mg l mainly occurs in the two zones gibbs diagram and cl br molar ratios show that water rock interaction and evaporation are major mechanisms contributing to groundwater salinization of these two zones the factor 2 corresponds to 22 16 of total variance and has a significant correlation with no3 i br and hco3 this component can explain the source of i in groundwater and the impact of redox conditions on i release as mentioned above the positive loading of i br and hco3 may indicate the biodegradation of organic matter iodine and bromide are biophilic element generally enriched in organic rich sedimentary and marine sedimentary kim et al 2020 razafindratsima et al 2015 scholz et al 2010 when organic matter is buried microbial decomposition can release iodine and bromide and produce hco3 lu et al 2015 both dissolution of carbonate minerals and decomposition of organic matter can lead to enrichment of hco3 in the groundwater the correlation coefficient and the factor analysis show that redox action is the more important trigger than dissolution of carbonate minerals to iodine enrichment the strongly negative loading of no3 0 846 represent reducing environment of groundwater as shown in the fig 11c these areas with higher factor scores indicate greater groundwater reducing and higher concentrations of iodine and bromine comparing fig 4b and fig 11c the spatial distribution of high i groundwater is generally coincident with high scores of the factor 2 in a word the fa results suggest that formation of high i groundwater is preferentially controlled by reducing conditions in the factor 3 explaining 16 36 of the total variance f shows the highest positive loading and ca2 shows the lowest negative loading this principal component indicates that fluoride concentration in groundwater is significantly controlled by the behaviors of ca2 in groundwater a notable negative correlation between f and ca2 is observed in the present study area and other fluoride enriched regions due to calcium fluoride solubility equilibrium li et al 2016a parvaiz et al 2021 podgorski et al 2018 in zone 1 ca2 is the dominantly cationic composition and high concentration of ca2 restrain releases of f in zone 2 and zone 3 both saturation of calcite and dolomite and cation exchange between ca2 and na lead to ca2 removal in groundwater consequently high f groundwater is widely distributed in zone 2 and zone 3 which is supported by the spatial distribution of high factor scores in fig 11d besides hco3 and na has a relatively high loading in the factor 1 table 1 the hydrochemical components in zone 2 and zone 3 are mainly of hco3 na type high aqueous hco3 can not only promote the desorption of f derived from the surface of amorphous fe al oxyhydroxides and clay minerals but also promote the dissolution of calcium fluoride guo et al 2007b qiao et al 2022 5 conclusion the present study aimed to reveal the hydrochemistry salinization origin and driving forces of fluoride and iodine enrichment in groundwater in the lower flood plain of the yellow river the major findings are as follows 1 in the study area the groundwater is slightly alkaline ph 7 62 9 16 and saline tds 475 7002 mg l the typical hydrochemical types of shallow groundwater include hco3 na mg hco3 ca mg and so4 cl ca mg water rock interactions and evaporation contribute to groundwater salinization calcite and dolomite are over saturated in groundwater while gypsum halite and fluorite are under saturated 2 the distribution of groundwater f and i is clearly defined by sediment zones high f and i groundwater is mainly distributed in the paleo yellow river alluvial plain zone 2 and alluvial lacustrine plain zone 3 while low concentrations of f and i are observed in the piedmont alluvial proluvial plain zone 1 the results of gibbs diagram end member diagram and factor analysis show that groundwater f mainly originates from geogenic sources of fluorine bearing minerals in addition organic matter enriched alluvial lacustrine sediments are probably the main source of groundwater i in zone 2 and zone 3 3 groundwater f enrichment is promoted by the alkaline and high hco3 conditions precipitation of calcite and dolomite and cation exchange evaporation is only partly responsible for the groundwater enrichment of f in slightly saline water tds 3000 mg l and strong evapotranspiration would restrict the f concentration due to fluorite solubility control in contrast the hydrogeochemical characteristics of high i groundwater indicate that salinization has a weak influence on i enrichment and that reducing conditions favor i release future studies should investigate the speciation and spatial evolution of fluoride and iodine in both groundwater and sediments along hydrogeological profiles to further determine factors controlling their contrasting geochemical processes credit authorship contribution statement chuanshun zhi conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft funding acquisition bill x

1846,the role of fog in the relict laurel forests of the macaronesia is still not fully understood and it is even more relevant in the canary islands where precipitations are rather scarce and summers are dry eddy covariance co2 exchange f co2 measurements in a brezal de tejo elfin cloud forest in tenerife canary islands over a four weeks period during the wet season showed that the vegetation can sustain a carbon assimilation rate in an environment of fog leading to higher median water use efficiency values 19 5 μmol mg 1 wue 68 3 μmol mg 1 than during no fog periods wue 1 8 μmol mg 1 being highest under thick fog wue 68 3 μmol mg 1 median f co2 values across the day were slightly greater under foggy versus no fog conditions during the study period these increments were more prominent under a low light environment especially in the morning thus highlighting the important difference between cloud immersion versus high clouds a greater proportion of light diffusivity due to fog may enhance carbon assimilation although additional concomitant factors may intervene during thick fog conditions also net carbon assimilation was initiated earlier under foggy conditions during cloud immersion and depleted light the maximal co2 exchange f co2 max diurnal values were higher than those observed when fog was absent additionally f co2 max remained high f co2 max 13 μmol m 2 s 1 for large vapour pressure deficit conditions vpd 0 6 kpa all this is indicative of a profligate water use strategy of the vegetation presumably due to low stomatal control fog was present during 36 9 of the time and as a consequence the estimated mean daily settling flux of water droplets was 1 186 mg m 2 s 1 for the entire period measured the cumulative settling flux was 1 30 mm compared to the 97 6 mm of rainfall and the 36 6 mm of throughfall and the canopy was wet at least 33 3 of the time the results suggest that such an anisohydric behaviour of the vegetation permits a continuous growth with maximal water use efficiency while the frequent presence of fog and wetting of the canopy would minimize the risk of cavitation associated with such non conservative water use response keywords cloud immersion eddy covariance fog deposition laurisilva liquid water content subtropical forest water use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction cloud forests cover 0 4 of the world land surface and are considered one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to global warming foster 2001 karger et al 2021 thus their study becomes relevant under a climate change scenario for instance alterations in the cloud base height have been related to population declines in montane cloud forests karmalkar et al 2008 pounds et al 1999 still et al 1999 van beusekom et al 2017 while global climate models predict a future downward shift of the cloud base in the macaronesian biogeographic region sperling et al 2004 the importance of the laurel cloud forests of the macaronesian oceanic islands is widely recognized pérez de paz 1990 their large number of endemic species with strong ecological specialization and limited dispersal ability make these hotspots of biodiversity particularly susceptible to alterations in the environmental conditions nogué et al 2013 patiño et al 2016 whittaker and fernández palacios 2007 the anaga massif in tenerife canary islands houses an important representation of these laurisilva forests and as such was declared biosphere reserve by unesco it is home to 196 different vascular plants with 102 endemisms and supports 1900 terrestrial invertebrates with 329 species present exclusively in tenerife and 95 being endemic of anaga this ecosystem represents a relict of the lauraceae forests that originally extended throughout the mediterranean basin during the neogene era and that sought refuge in more temperate areas such as the canary islands and the other atlantic macaronesian archipelagos after the quaternarian glaciation fernández palacios et al 2011 kondraskov et al 2015 rodríguez sánchez and arroyo 2008 fog in the macaronesian region is a consequence of the vertical thermal structure of the atmosphere at these latitudes cao et al 2007 characterized by the existence of a thermal inversion in altitude due to the subsidence associated with the descending branch of hadley s general circulation cell carrillo et al 2016 because of this trade wind driven moist air masses stop their orographic lifting along the ne side of the steepest islands leading to a permanent stratocumulus layer at 900 1500 m a s l font tullot 1956 this foggy environment sustains a forest with abundant mosses and other bryophytes and an umbrophile understory that develops below evergreen trees pérez de paz 1990 santos guerra 1990 the survival of these plant communities has been related to the influence of low cloud immersion and fog axelrod 1975 gioda et al 1995 patiño et al 2016 ritter et al 2008 2009 2019 which may compensate the scarce precipitations and dry summers of the canary islands aboal et al 2013 regalado and ritter 2021 ritter et al 2019 the consequences of fog water interception by leaves and how this affects both the plant water and carbon relations remains an open question in this and other cloud forests dawson and goldsmith 2018 more importantly than an additional water source fog has been shown to supress plant transpiration in this ritter et al 2009 and other cloud forests burgess and dawson 2004 chung et al 2017 hutley et al 1997 johnson and smith 2008 reinhardt and smith 2008 furthermore cloud immersion and cloudy skies may enhance carbon assimilation johnson and smith 2006 law et al 2002 because of a more photosynthetically efficient light quality johnson and smith 2006 li et al 2014 reinhardt et al 2010 this has been shown to be the case among others in boreal goulden et al 1997 subalpine monson et al 2002 temperate deciduous baldocchi 1997 rocha et al 2004 and evergreen forests price and black 1991 thus a reduced transpiration and associated increased carbon assimilation due to low clouds may lead to an increased water use efficiency lamaud et al 1996 rocha et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 several studies have investigated the transpiration and co2 assimilation of tree species representative of the laurisilva based on discrete porometric and gas exchange measurements on leaves gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a b tausz et al 2004 zöhlen et al 1995 among other characteristic species of the laurel forest the gas exchange response of laurus novocanariensis rivas mart et al formerly laurus azorica gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 persea indica l gonzález rodríguez et al 2002a and myrica faya ait gonzález rodríguez et al 2002b was studied low irradiances 20 μmol photons m2 s 1 were sufficient to achieve maximal conductance an indication of the shade tolerance and umbrophilous character of these tree species also under high atmospheric vapour pressure deficit laurisilva plants exhibited both relatively large values of stomatal conductance and transpiration rates this evidenced a weak stomatal control and paradoxically a non conservative water use strategy a response that is typical of tree species not subject to prolonged drought periods gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a noticeably this profligate water use behaviour has been also reported in the cloud immersed californian redwood forests burgess and dawson 2004 and the yellow cypress montane cloud forests of taiwan chu et al 2014 in another representative tree species of the canarian laurel forests myrica faya a substantial night time sap flow was observed under conditions of high nocturnal atmospheric evaporative demand an additional indication of such non conservative water use strategy regalado and ritter 2021 furthermore regalado and ritter 2021 suggested that this seemingly paradoxical weak stomatal control in trees species of an ecosystem where pluviometry is relatively low such as the canarian laurel forests may be alleviated by the foggy environment thus permitting a sustained carbon assimilation rate and growth across the year direct measurements of energy water and carbon dioxide exchange between the vegetation and the atmosphere is an alternative technique to those mentioned above and eddy covariance is currently the most widely used for this purpose baumberger et al 2021 chu et al 2014 goldstein et al 2000 lópez olivari et al 2015 scartazza et al 2014 thus vapour and carbon dioxide turbulent flows may be precisely determined from continuous records of wind speed in the three spatial directions temperature relative humidity water vapour and co2 densities baldocchi 2003 baldocchi et al 2001 furthermore measurements obtained at a single location can be treated as average exchange rates between the land surface and the atmosphere without disturbing the plant canopy thus providing a means of observing the functioning of the entire ecosystem and not just individual trees dugas 1993 also direct measurements of gas exchange in fog wet leaves in cloud forests can present methodological difficulties reinhardt and smith 2008 which can therefore be avoided with the eddy covariance system however the success of the eddy covariance technique depends on the fulfilment of some initial hypotheses such as the consideration of ideal conditions of stability and horizontal homogeneity baldocchi et al 1988 therefore in order to obtain reliable measurements under non ideal situations such as those that occur in a forested complex terrain with roughness and non uniform vegetation the phenomena of advection and divergence must be taken into account baldocchi et al 2000 lee 1998 vickers and mahrt 2006 moreover when this technique is used in cloud forests the question arises as to what extent fog water fluxes contribute to the overall water inputs such flows are those resulting from the variation of the vertical wind speed and the fog liquid water content turbulent flux from the gravitational settling of fog droplets deposition flux as well as that caused by the condensation of water vapour condensation flux or the interception of droplets by inertial impaction onto leaves in this regard eugster et al 2006 concluded from eddy covariance measurements performed in a puerto rican cloud forest that the water flow inputs associated with fog droplets could not be assumed negligible apart from this the eddy covariance technique has been used in a fairly limited number of studies in environments affected by dew and or fog baumberger et al 2021 breuer et al 2021 chu et al 2014 el madany et al 2016 li et al 2021 in this study energy and mass turbulent fluxes determined with the eddy covariance technique were analysed in an elfin cloud forest located in the area of special conservation of the anaga massif in tenerife canary islands in order to determine to what extent fog may affect the dynamics of these fluxes in this unique ecosystem our objectives are to determine how fog affects the carbon influx droplet deposition and water use efficiency of the laurel forest vegetation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is located at the highest altitude 1015 m a s l of the anaga massif cruz de taborno fig 1 a in the facilities of the spanish air navigation agency aena 28 32 9 61 n 16 16 8 91 w it is situated below the thermal inversion and thus often immersed in clouds being exposed to the prevailing ne trade winds it is affected by frequent fog episodes and high relative humidity all over the year annual mean temperatures are mild and do not exceed 14 c rainfall is 1130 281 mm year 1 ritter et al 2019 the terrain slope is 22 east and 9 southerly the canopy is homogenous up to 250 m eastward and 150 m southward the vegetation is classified as brezal de tejo a subformation derived from the fayal brezal where erica platycodon webb et berth rivas mart et al or tejo in the former substitutes another tree like heather erica arborea or brezo in the latter this hyperhumid community is found between 800 and 1100 m of altitude in steep wind exposed areas pérez de paz 1990 the main tree species characteristic of the brezal de tejo at the experimental site are the lauroid leaf tree faya m faya 47 and especially the tejo with needle like leaves e platycodon 53

m2 m 2 as it has been previously reported in other laurel forests of tenerife leaves are mainly concentrated in the upper crown with little leaf area below morales et al 1996a b the understory consists mainly in ferns and some lianiform epiphytes the abundant community of mosses and lichens on tree trunks and branches are sustained by the high ambient humidity fig 1b the soils are of volcanic origin with andic characteristics fernández caldas et al 1982 höllermann 1981 organic matter content in the top horizon is 38 and apparent texture is loamy sand the carbon content decreases with soil depth and texture turns clayey porosity is large 65 5 and as a consequence of the characteristic microporosity of andic soils the water retention capacity is high regalado and ritter 2021 2 2 measuring equipment 2 2 1 meteorological instrumentation measurements were carried out during the wet season ritter et al 2019 from february the 12th until march the 11th 2018 every 1 min micrometeorological variables were obtained with sensors installed on top of a 6 m tall scaffolding tower supplemented with a 1 5 m mast installed at its upper vertex placed on the southern edge of a deforested esplanade global radiation rg was measured with a pyranometer sks 1110 skye instruments ltd powys united kingdom and par with a photosynthetic light smart sensor s lia m003 onset computer

above the canopy were measured with a hmp45c thermo hygrometer campbell scientific ltd lougborough uk wind speed was measured with a a100r anemometer campbell scientific ltd lougborough uk placed at 7 m in the tower these 1 minute measurements were taken with a combilog data logger up gmbh cottbus germany and were averaged every 30 min a hobo micro meteorological station h21 002 onset computer corporation usa with a thermo hygrometer s thb m002 onset computer corporation usa provided data of ambient temperature and relative humidity below the canopy 40 cm above ground temperature and relative humidity were measured every second and stored as 30 min averages based on these daily averages were computed these data in combination with the temperature and water vapour density values provided by the eddy covariance system above the canopy were necessary to determine the vertical advection in turbulent fluxes see section 2 2 4 below 2 2 2 fog characterization to gather information about fog presence and potential fog water affection at the site a sheltered wire harp flat fog water collector was oriented towards the predominant ne wind direction at a height of 4 5 m and connected to a raingauge below the fog gauge consists of three screens separated 1 cm apart from each other each screen was built with 0 5 mm nylon fishing line strung back and forth between the teeth of two band saw blades used as guides rendering 3 mm center center spacing between filaments and a fractional coverage of 0 5 3 0 167 regalado and ritter 2017 fog water collection fwc was referred to the vertical cross sectional area 46 46 cm2 of the fog gauge screen l m 2 in addition reductions in visibility ω m due to fog were monitored with a forward scatter infrared visibilimeter cs120 campbell scientific ltd usa which provides ω values in the meteorological optical range mor foggy events were defined as those when ω 1 km with thick fog corresponding to ω 0 1 km dense fog to 0 1 ω 0 2 km and light fog to 0 2 ω 1 km fog free conditions are those when visibility was ω 1 km glickman 2000 eugster et al 2006 2 2 3 rainfall and throughfall instrumentation rainfall was measured with a 0 2 mm resolution spoon tipping raingauge rain o matic professional pronamic bekhøi international trading engineering co ltd silkeborg denmark placed in the open the throughfall thf that occurs due to rainfall and fog water canopy dripping onto the soil surface was monitored with 11 tipping bucket raingauges davis instruments corp california connected to hobo event dataloggers onset computer corp bourne usa these were supplemented with 3 additional spoon tipping raingauges rain o matic professional connected to a combilog datalogger and the measurements were totalized and stored in 15 min intervals the raingauges orifice was augmented with a plastic funnel 28 7 cm equipped with a filter to avoid obstruction by falling leaves and were cleaned periodically every two weeks the 14 raingauges were randomly distributed on the ground over an area of 20 m 8 m fig 1b 2 2 4 eddy covariance the eddy covariance system was installed on a sloped forested area over a 6 m high triangular base scaffolding tower ect 30 m away from the meteorological instruments the tower was supplemented with a 2 80 m mast installed at its upper vertex perpendicular to it at a height of 8 15 m above the ground a 1 20 m long tubular arm was fixed and oriented in the main wind direction at the end of this arm the eddy covariance system was screwed remaining at a distance of approximately 2 15 m above the nearby canopy the system consists of an open path gas analyzer with an integrated three dimensional sonic anemometer irgason campbell scientific ltd usa it measures simultaneously absolute carbon dioxide and water vapour densities air temperature barometric pressure three dimensional wind speed and sonic temperature the system also consists of a temperature sensor betatherm 100k6a1ia 107 thermistor campbell scientific ltd lougborough uk that was installed in the same arm measurements were taken at 10 hz and stored as 30 min averages in a cr3000 datalogger campbell scientific ltd usa the easyflux dl software campbell scientific ltd usa was used for data processing to compute the advective term required to calculate the sensible and latent heat fluxes see appendix a temperature and rh at the midpoint between the measurement height and the base of the ect were obtained by interpolation of the air temperature and rh data provided by the eddy covariance system and the hobo micro meteorological station 2 2 5 soil instrumentation soil heat flux and temperature measurements in the top soil horizon were necessary for the calculation of the soil heat flux g these variables were measured using a heat flux plate hfp01sc campbell scientific ltd usa and two thermocouple pairs tcav campbell scientific ltd usa respectively the heat flux plate was buried 8 cm deep approximately 2 m from the base of the ect the thermocouples were buried at two soil depths 2 and 6 cm these were located on both sides of the heat flux plate at a distance of 30 cm measurements of both the thermocouples and the soil heat flux plate were taken at 1 minute intervals and average values were recorded every 30 min the volumetric water content in the soil θ was measured with two tdr trime ez probes imko gmbh ettlingen germany approximately one meter away from the ect the trime ez probe consists of two 16 cm long rods separated 4 cm so the representative measurement soil volume is approximately 700 cm3 the rods were inserted horizontally into the soil on the side of a trench opened for this purpose both superficially 10 cm and in depth 80 cm measurements were taken every 5 minutes in a combilog logger up gmbh cottbus germany and averaged every 30 min 2 3 eddy covariance data quality analysis and flux footprint under foggy conditions co2 and water vapour density measurements may be affected by obstruction of the gas analyzer s optical path due to water droplets passing through or water condensation on the analyzer lenses to ensure the quality of the data only raw co2 and h2o densities for which the intensity of the gas analyzer signal was 70 were taken as valid discarding the rest of the data for the calculation of 30 min fluxes to verify that the data fulfilled the atmospheric stability condition which is assumed in the turbulent flux theory appendix a a quality analysis was performed based on the non relative state and the integral turbulence characteristics tests energy fluxes were calculated only for those measurements with quality grade 3 appendix b in order to determine the origin of the water vapour and the atmospheric co2 measured by the eddy covariance system and therefore the source of the fluxes several models can be used to characterize the instrumentation influence area or flux footprint this was obtained using the most updated flux footprint prediction model proposed by kljun et al 2015 which is based on restrictive turbulence conditions fig 1c 2 4 data analysis the variables were illustrated and discussed based on their evolution during the study period or at each day hour comparisons were performed based on boxplots i e in terms of the median value and its dispersion 1st and 3rd quartiles the wilcoxon whitney mann test was used to evaluate the differences in median values under various fog visibility conditions neuhäuser 2011 2 5 model fitting the response of the maximal net ecosystem co2 flux f co2 max to variations in the meteorological variables rn par and vpd was quantified in terms of enveloping curves these are defined as the fitting monotonic curves that describe the co2 flux f co2 maxima i e such enveloping curves quantify the vegetation response to changes in a given variable when the other ambient conditions are optimal the computation and model fitting procedures were implemented in a matlab the mathworks inc natick ma usa computer code regalado and ritter 2019 2 6 water use efficiency the water use efficiency wue μmol mg 1 of the ecosystem was defined as the ratio between the biomass produced by the vegetation and the amount of water transpired kuglitsch et al 2008 in the absence of other sources or sinks of co2 the biomass was quantified from the rate of carbon assimilation by the vegetation f co2 μmol m 2 s 1 in turn water losses were determined from the stand evapotranspiration et mg m 2 s 1 estimated here as the et of a partially wet hypostomatic canopy ritter et al 2019 therefore the water use efficiency was computed for diurnal hours only rn 10 w m 2 as 1 wue f c o 2 et 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions and soil related variables ambient temperatures were mild throughout the period of study with a mean standard deviation value of 10 3 2 7 c and a minimum of 6 1 c these temperatures are typical of the winter season in the area ritter et al 2019 regalado and ritter 2021 the average relative humidity was above 90 rh 91 2 15 1 and mean global radiation was 154 2 253 9 w m 2 foggy events ω 1 km were more frequent at night and represented 36 9 of the total hours of the study period with thick ω 100 m and dense fog 100 ω 200 m occurring 13 4 and 15 1 of the time respectively total precipitation was 97 6 mm and excluding those rainy episodes the fog water collection occurred 28 6 of the time throughfall as a consequence of rainfall and or fog water canopy dripping was detected 33 3 of the time and thus the stand was wet for at least 223 5 h total thf 36 6 mm represented 37 5 of rainfall the rainfall occurring on doy 52 54 and 56 contributed mostly to those cumulative values which produced the greatest thf events cf fig 2 a and c these rainfall events resulted in significant increments in the soil water content θ especially in the most superficial horizon reaching up to saturation values θ 0 7 m3 m 3 in some instances fig 2d e in contrast throughfall events associated with fog conditions ω 1 km exhibited low values 0 2 mm and were not reflected in the soil moisture data soil moisture remained above the permanent wilting point θ 0 39 m3 m 3 for the period of study and was higher in the deep horizon θ 0 52 m3 m 3 the fog gauge collected water mainly when visibility was low ω 0 2 km fig 2b ritter et al 2019 foggy conditions were clearly associated with a reduction in radiation table 1 rg fig 3 a 4a f rn fig 3b and par fig 4 b g and with very low vpd fig 3c fig 4c h lower ambient temperatures fig 4d i and higher wind speeds fig 4e j these daily course changes in the meteorological variables under both fog and fog free conditions were not only observed during the period of study but were sustained across the year left versus right panels in fig 4 net radiation varied according to rg fig 3a b being positive during daylight hours and negative during the night the dynamics of the evapotranspiration fig 3d was consistent with the evolution of rg fig 3a and vpd fig 3c during the study period soil heat flux g oscillated between negative and positive values during night time and daylight hours respectively fig 3e the low g values observed in doy 56 were associated with a rapid increase in soil water content fig 2d due to large rainfall events fig 2a 3 2 eddy covariance and soil energy fluxes the sensible heat flux h took large values compared to the latent heat flux le such that the difference between h and le increased linearly with rn fig 5 suggesting that the energy associated with temperature variations was greater than that involved in phase changes in contrast on foggy periods ω 1 km when rn did not exceed 200 w m 2 smaller h values were observed a linear correlation between median g values at each hour of the day during foggy versus fog free conditions was obtained r 2 0 938 this was also the case for h r 2 0 667 rn r 2 0 918 rg r 2 0 916 and par r 2 0 892 but not so for le r 2 0 216 table 1 comparing such median values of le h and g with respect to rn under both foggy and fog free conditions satisfactory linear correlations were obtained table 2 focusing on the slope values of the above regression equations it follows that median values of le h and g represent 13 53 4 of median rn under fog free conditions respectively similarly under foggy conditions h and g represent 38 and 5 of median rn while no acceptable correlation was obtained for le such a low contribution of net radiation to soil heat flux may be explained by the canopy coverage since g depends on vegetation density humes et al 1994 norman et al 2000 and varies unevenly with respect to rn throughout the day fuchs and hadas 1972 kustas et al 2000 with full canopy cover g is generally 0 1rn and its contribution to the energy balance a 1 may thus be considered negligible santanello and friedl 2003 as it would be also the case in the present study 3 3 fog water fluxes fig 6 shows the number of hours with different visibility conditions for each day of the study period fig 6a and the mean daily values of liquid water fluxes due to fog fig 6b c larger fog water fluxes were obtained during days with most of the time being under thick and dense fog conditions ω 0 2 km with thick and dense fog occurring 13 4 and 15 1 of the time respectively fig 6a fog water fluxes due to the gravitational settling of fog droplets i e deposition flux fs as well as that caused by the condensation of water vapour i e condensation flux fc were estimated as detailed in appendix c the daily mean settling flux of fog droplets fs 0 103 mm day 1 1 186 mg m 2 s 1 was higher than that of condensation fc 0 093 mm day 1 1 073 mg m 2 s 1 under foggy conditions fig 6b c the total fluxes for the period were fs 1 30 mm and fc 1 00 mm in terms of energy contributions the mean condensation flux was low fc 2 653 1 738 w m 2 compared to h 62 50 135 93 w m 2 and le 55 36 77 78 w m 2 and of the same order of magnitude than g 0 67 14 44 w m 2 to put these estimates into context and their relative importance with respect to other fog water inputs to the forest the daily mean fog water collection rate obtained from the fog gauge data was also computed ffwc 8 491 mm day 1 98 279 mg m 2 s 1 fig 6d although the efficiencies of droplets interception by the fog gauge and the canopy differ regalado and ritter 2021 these are collected in both cases by inertial impaction and therefore the former gives an indication of the potential fog water interception of the stand cf fig 2b c the small relative contribution of fs to the total water flux was also acknowledged by eugster et al 2006 who reported a value of fs 4 36 mm day 1 in the cloud forests of pico del este this larger fs estimate was justified based on the high frequency of fog occurrence at pico del este i e 85 with ω 0 2 km persisting 74 of the time other studies reported lower fog deposition values of 0 05 2 3 mm day 1 cf table 2 in eugster et al 2006 closer to the one obtained at our site i e fs 0 103 mm day 1 with a 36 9 248 h fog affection and low visibility ω 0 2 km occurring 28 5 191 5 h of the time to put these numbers in context in a 4 year period 2015 2018 study at the site it was shown that ω 1 km during 46 9 of the time and that february march were not the foggiest months being may to september when the greatest average number of hours per month with ω 0 2 km were registered 295 h month 1 a period during which the site was often immersed in the cloud ritter et al 2019 thus the deposition of fog droplets is likely to be higher around summer time when the altitude of the inversion layer coincides with that of the site this is also relevant since summer is the driest season in terms of pluviometry and therefore the importance of fog becomes even more evident 3 4 variation of the ecosystem co2 flux f co2 with the meteorological conditions the co2 exchange between the ecosystem and the atmosphere f co2 is defined in a 10 such that f co2 0 indicates a downward flux towards the vegetation carbon assimilation increased with net radiation until reaching maxima around rn 400 w m 2 from this value onwards f co2 remained steady for rn 200 w m 2 maximums of f co2 were registered in the presence of fog ω 1 km fig 7 a the response of f co2 with respect to photosynthetically active radiation par followed a similar trend to that of rn that is f co2 increased with par up to values close to 0 6 mmol m 2 s 1 when f co2 max 30 μmol m 2 s 1 values were reached under fog conditions when fog was absent f co2 max reached lower maximum values of 20 μmol m 2 s 1 i e 33 smaller cf enveloping curves in fig 7b a similar plant response to light has been previously observed in gas exchange measurements in laurel trees leaves showing that these became saturated at 25 38 of full sunlight zöhlen et al 1995 gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a b fog has been shown to significantly reduce radiation across all hours of the day at this site fig 4 see also ritter et al 2019 regalado and ritter 2021 but also in another area of tenerife regalado and ritter 2017 in the laurel forests of the garajonay national park in la gomera island ritter et al 2008 and in different cloud forests across the world alvarado barrientos et al 2014 bittencourt et al 2019 eugster et al 2006 obregon et al 2011 the degree of radiation decline above the canopy depends on visibility and time of the year but can be as high as 60 during thick fog ω 0 1 km hours ritter et al 2019 for the period of the current study rn was 23 lower under foggy conditions ω 1 km this reduction can even be more pronounced in the understory with 90 radiation attenuation due to the relatively dense canopy aschan et al 1994 ritter et al 2019 yet the vegetation seems to be well adapted to this low irradiance conditions during the study period maximizing carbon assimilation under the attenuated light of foggy events it has been previously suggested that the quality of light under cloud immersion with a greater degree of scattering may be more photosynthetically appropriate than direct beam sunlight dengel and grace 2010 johnson and smith 2006 reinhardt et al 2010 still et al 2009 urban et al 2007 and thus laurel species might take advantage of this diffused light environment to maximize carbon capture during foggy hours the ratio of diffuse radiation rd over par at our site decreased with visibility such that the rd par medians were 0 827 kj mmol 1 ω 0 1 km 0 827 kj mmol 1 0 1 ω 0 2 km 0 692 kj mmol 1 0 2 ω 1 km and 0 467 kj mmol 1 ω 1 km fig 7c this seems to support the hypothesis that a greater proportion of light diffusivity during fog periods may enhance carbon assimilation f co2 max varied in this study with ambient temperature and this usually exhibits a bell shape response gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a b accordingly it reached maximum absolute values between 7 c and 10 c under both foggy and non foggy conditions from 10 c up to 16 c f co2 max halved decreasing from 30 down to 15 μmol m 2 s 1 results not shown this is consistent with previously reported canopy conductance temperature responses in the laurel cloud forests of la gomera showing for e g m faya maximal conductance around 9 11 c and a rapid decline outside this range ritter and regalado 2017 f co2 max showed a downward trend with vpd starting from f co2 max 30 μmol m 2 s 1 when vpd 0 and remaining around 13 μmol m 2 s 1 for vpd 0 6 kpa enveloping curve in fig 7d consistently gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a b found that laurel tree species exhibited a low stomatal control responding to elevated vpd by decreasing leaf conductance but only down to values sufficient to maintain a significant carbon assimilation rate see also ritter and regalado 2017 3 5 temporal evolution of the ecosystem water and carbon exchange fluxes the temporal variation of the measured co2 flux f co2 across the day during the study period showed maxima located around 1 00 p m the average of diurnal maxima was f co2 max 19 0 μmol m 2 s 1 ω 1 km and f co2 max 16 9 μmol m 2 s 1 ω 1 km fig 8 a c this gaseous exchange is coupled to an associated water vapour loss through transpiration and it is thus reflected in the estimated evapotranspiration with maximal et values consistently occurring in the central hours of the day fig 8b d when analysing the behaviour of f co2 with respect to variations in ω we observed that the assimilation of co2 by the vegetation was not severely affected by the fog conditions fig 8e this was not the case of the evapotranspiration with strong reductions in et during foggy ω 1 km versus fog free periods ω 1 km fig 8b d f using sap flow gauges inserted in m faya and e arborea trees ritter et al 2009 reported that fog greatly reduced transpiration more than one order of magnitude with respect to fog free conditions in the laurel forest of la gomera canary islands these results were recently corroborated by regalado and ritter 2021 in m faya at the same site as the current study furthermore these authors suggested that such foggy environment may permit a sustained carbon assimilation rate without the associated cavitation risks of the anisohydric water use strategy and weak stomatal control typical of these species our results point also in this direction where we have shown that the carbon influx was maintained even under foggy conditions during the study period consistently gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a b reported that during a wet day with vpd 0 5 kpa maximum carbon assimilation rates amax were measured in l azorica p indica and m faya in contraposition to the lower values and sharp decrease of amax observed in a cloudless day with vpd 1 kpa although these authors did not monitor fog the low vpd attenuated light and lower leaf temperature during their wet day may be comparable with the foggy conditions of this study while maximal f co2 values were obtained in central hours carbon assimilation started earlier and lasted longer in the afternoon under foggy conditions during the study period fig 8a c to this respect it should be mentioned that transpiration and high stomatal conductance during night time are widespread among ecosystems and species dawson et al 2007 for instance high rates of nocturnal transpiration were reported in a costa rican elfin cloud forest feild and holbrook 2000 and in a tropical montane cloud forest in mexico alvarado barrientos et al 2015 gotsch et al 2014 using sap flow gauges regalado and ritter 2021 showed that a significant nocturnal transpiration of m faya occurred at this site representing 23 of the total daily xylematic water transport and that this was enhanced by foliar moistening due to preceding fog diurnal events see also alvarado barrientos et al 2015 given that fog was more frequent at the site during night ritter et al 2019 this nocturnal transpiration may be considered therefore relevant in the overall vegetation activity such nocturnal gas exchange has been suggested to be a consequence of the aforementioned weak stomatal control due to leaky stomata and their incapability to fully close at night another non exclusive hypothesis is that it may facilitate carbon assimilation early in the morning because stomata would be already open at dawn dawson et al 2007 seibt et al 2007 zeppel et al 2014 this is consistent with the results shown in fig 8a c which indicate that net carbon assimilation started earlier in the morning under foggy conditions during the study period this hypothesis has been suggested for plants growing in low light environments that may depend on short periods of direct irradiance or sunflecks for photosynthesizing dawson et al 2007 pearcy et al 1994 the response of laurel forest species to sunflecks has not been investigated but we have already commented that these may function at low irradiances occurring e g during foggy conditions or in the understory gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 thus the vegetation would be able to assimilate carbon very early in the morning having the stomata open during low vpd foggy nights would not result in significant water loss yet the vegetation would benefit from this early preparation for carbon assimilation finally night time transpiration has been suggested to promote nutrient uptake by the root system in nutrient deficient soils scholz et al 2007 although volcanic soils are highly fertile they may exhibit selective retention of potassium ions wada 1985 and phosphorous negrín et al 1995 and thus nocturnal transpiration might benefit plant growth 3 6 water use efficiency median f co2 values across the day were slightly higher under foggy versus no fog conditions but were not significantly different during the study period fig 9 a these differences however were accentuated under a low light environment rn 200 w m 2 especially in the morning that is under foggy versus cloudy conditions fig 9b this highlights the important difference between cloud immersion versus high clouds thus the vegetation was capable of maximizing net carbon assimilation under the saturated water vapour conditions lower temperatures and radiation that took place during cloud immersed foggy periods i e under perhumid conditions based on experiments where artificial fog was applied onto plant saplings of sequoia sempervirens simonin et al 2009 and drimys brasiliensis eller et al 2013 it has been previously suggested that fog has a positive effect on plant carbon gain during dense fog events and or rainfall the canopy may become wet as a result of the interception and deposition of water droplets fig 2a b fig 6 thus the resulting water layer resting on the leaves surface might impair gas exchange through stomata due to the much lower diffusivity of co2 in water letts and mulligan 2005 this does not seem to be always the case here since carbon assimilation was maintained under foggy conditions during the study period plants in general and laurel forest tree species are not an exception in this respect borgesen 1924 marrero and nogales 2005 have developed different adaptations to minimize this effect such as e g leaves with cereous hydrophobic epicuticules and an abaxial distribution of stomata aparecido et al 2017 parkhurst 1978 pariyar et al 2017 in addition evaporation of the water film may enhance stomatal conductance by increasing the humidity in the vicinity of the leaves thus alleviating the vegetation water stress and consequently promoting the assimilation of carbon chu et al 2014 katata 2014 kume et al 2006 furthermore we have shown earlier at this site that canopy moistening associated to fog water interception may result in leaf water uptake by m faya and therefore the hydration of the canopy regalado and ritter 2021 in this regard alvarado barrientos et al 2014 2015 reported that stomatal conductance of a pine plantation was enhanced during fog events and hypothesized that fog water may hydrate leaf tissues rather than occlude stomata in order to quantify the benefit of this sustained carbon assimilation rate under foggy conditions we computed the water use efficiency wue under different visibility ranges fig 10 a for comparison purposes four visibility intervals that characterize the different fog types were selected i e thick fog ω 0 1 km dense fog 0 1 ω 0 2 km light fog 0 2 ω 1 km and no fog ω 1 km the mean vpd associated with each of these intervals were 0 kpa 0 00031 kpa 0 0061 kpa and 0 231 kpa respectively for ω 1 km median values of wue were of the same order of magnitude for the three classes considered under foggy conditions 19 5 μmol mg 1 0 2 ω 1 km 23 2 μmol mg 1 0 1 ω 0 2 km and 68 3 μmol mg 1 ω 0 1 km in contrast a median wue value of 1 8 μmol mg 1 was observed when ω 1 km such differences in wue are a consequence of reduced et during foggy periods fig 3d fig 8b due to the prevailing meteorological conditions fig 4 and not much as a consequence of increased f co2 fig 9 when comparing the various fog conditions significant differences were found between thick and dense fog p 0 0078 and thick and light fog p 0 001 but not between dense and light fog p 0 2480 in the same way a significant difference p 0 001 was obtained when comparing wue under fog ω 1 km and no fog conditions ω 1 km this difference was also observed when considering various time periods throughout the day fig 10b and low light conditions rn 200 w m 2 fig 10c accordingly gonzález rodríguez et al 2002a b reported higher wue values across a day with low vpd 1 kpa with respect to a cloudless day with high vpd 1 kpa in both p indica and m faya these results stress once more the relevant effect that fog may have on the use of water and carbon assimilation by trees of these cloud forests although not many studies have investigated the wue of cloud forests reinhardt and smith 2008 cloudy skies have been related to larger wue lamaud et al 1996 rocha et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 this has been explained in terms of a larger proportion of diffuse radiation rd more photosynthetically efficient than direct sun light over par under cloud cover li et al 2014 johnson and smith 2006 reinhardt et al 2010 in our case no distinctions in median rd par were observed for thick ω 0 1 km and dense fog 0 1 ω 0 2 km at the site fig 7c and yet marked differences in wue were obtained for these two visibility classes fig 10a thus although an increase in diffuse radiation due to light scattering by fog droplets seems a plausible hypothesis these results suggest that additional concomitant factors may intervene during thick fog conditions in this respect it should be notice that a higher reduction in rg and increased fog water collection have been reported at the site for thick ω 0 1 km versus dense fog 0 1 ω 0 2 km ritter et al 2019 4 conclusions eddy covariance together with concomitant meteorological variables and throughfall measurements were carried out over a four weeks period during the wet season in a brezal de tejo cloud forest these permitted to asses to what degree the net carbon assimilation of the ecosystem was affected by cloud immersion fog presence and light conditions trees may adopt different approaches for dealing with a limited resource of rainfall i e a profligate anisohydric or a conservative isohydric water use strategy our results in consonance with previous studies in various laurisilva tree species indicate that the brezal de tejo cloud forest follows a non conservative strategy probably due to a low stomatal control such anisohydric response permitted a sustained carbon assimilation rate during the study period and presumably a continuous growth of the vegetation the risks of hydraulic failure due to cavitation associated with anisohydricity are though minimised due to the frequent 36 9 of the time fog presence i e low vpd conditions in the area in addition the leaf water intake of intercepted fog droplets previously reported at this site for m faya may help hydrate the canopy and refill embolized conduits thus providing an additional safeguard mechanism against the surmisable cavitation associated with anisohydricity in this respect our throughfall measurements indicated that the brezal de tejo canopy remained wet for at least one third of the time during the period of study additionally we have shown that the mean settling flux of fog water droplets onto the stand was fs 0 103 mm day 1 and was thus more important than the condensation fc 0 093 mm day 1 despite a 71 4 reduction in median net radiation under foggy conditions the carbon influx during the study period was not affected under these conditions of depleted light rn 200 w m 2 such that f co2 max values were higher than during those situations when fog was not present an indication of the adaptation of the stand to umbrophilous environments that highlights the difference between cloud immersion and cloudy skies by contrast maximal f co2 remained elevated f co2 max 13 μmol m 2 s 1 for vpd 0 6 kpa hinting to the aforementioned low stomatal control such that the vegetation responded to elevated vpd by decreasing stomatal conductance but only down to values large enough to maintain a substantial carbon assimilation rate furthermore a significant co2 flux was observed early in the morning during foggy periods another indication of reduced stomatal regulation due to leaky leaf pores and their inability to fully close in the dark that was earlier confirmed at the site using sap flow gauges the prevailing meteorological conditions of low vpd mild temperatures and a greater proportion of diffuse radiation in the area led to a greater median water use efficiency of the ecosystem under foggy conditions that occurred 36 9 of the time 19 5 μmol mg 1 wue 68 3 μmol mg 1 versus no fog periods wue 1 8 μmol mg 1 future climate change scenarios predict a shift in the altitude of the cloud base and warmer temperatures in the macaronesia area and therefore a modification of the current climatological conditions that sustain the laurel forests our results indicate that this would affect both the growth and the water relations of these relict

micrometeorological fluxes prior to computing the turbulent fluxes of matter and energy with the eddy covariance technique the quality of the measurements was checked based on the energy balance

was evaluated in non ideal conditions this is considering that advection is not negligible in the vertical and longitudinal directions and assuming that the variation of the horizontal flux occurs in the mean wind direction axis x in order to determine the advective term we used the one dimensional advection method proposed by lee 1998 i e no horizontal divergence of the turbulent flux and no horizontal advection were assumed finnigan 1999 baldocchi et al 2000 since for the calculation of said terms we needed measurements that were not available thus integration of a 2 with respect to the

term for f co2 thus it was only computed for the sensible and latent heat exchanges appendix b eddy covariance data quality tests signal strength and cospectral analysis b 1 eddy covariance data quality tests to verify that the data fulfilled the atmospheric stability condition which is assumed in the turbulent flux theory a quality analysis was performed based on the following two tests the relative non stationarity rncov test to confirm the steady state conditions and the relative integral turbulence characteristics itc test to define turbulence conditions the first test computes an index rncov expressed in percentage that represents the average of the difference between the 5 minutes and 30 minutes covariance values of a scalar and the vertical wind speed with respect to the 30

temperature t the density of water vapor ρ v the density of co2 ρco2 or the horizontal components of the wind speed u and v the subscript r indicates variables obtained after the double rotation and the subscript i denotes the ith covariance of the ith 5 minutes interval i 1 6 in each 30 minutes period based on the rncov a quality grade was assigned from the interval 1 9 table b1 the second test computes an index itcs that expresses the turbulence degree in percentage as the relative difference of the standard deviation of a fluctuating scalar s such as temperature wind speed or momentum normalized by a scale factor such as the friction speed or the scale temperature tillmann 1972 with respect to the itc computed in conditions of fully developed turbulence itcs model based on the resulting index a quality grade was assigned from the interval 1 9 table b1 thus for temperature the itct is given by foken et al 2012 b2 it c t 100 t 2 r t i t c t m o del it c t m o d e l where t is the instantaneous variation of temperature and t is the scaling temperature computed as kaimal and finnigan 1994 b3 t t w u f where t w is the covariance of the temperature and the vertical wind speed

wind speed components itcw itcu were calculated similarly as described in foken et al 2012 the itc for the covariance of temperature and the vertical wind speed itctw was used to describe the turbulent conditions and was set equal to the maximum value of itct and itcw i e b5 itc tw m a x itc t itc w the itc for momentum flux itctau was estimated similarly when double rotations tanner and

after the first rotation combining the quality grades resulting from both tests an overall quality grade system allows to assess the quality of the data such a grade value of 1 denotes the best quality while 9 indicates the worst overall quality table b1 foken et al 2004 based on this procedure the energy fluxes were calculated here only with good quality measurements corresponding to restrictive overall quality grades 3 foken and wichura 1996 foken et al 2012 on the other hand to ensure a turbulent condition when analyzing the carbon flux f co2 the friction velocity u f was set to exceed the threshold value of 0 2 m s 1 because higher u f values are associated with better air mix b 2 corrections and filtering procedures adopted in the easyflux dl the data processing and the

1846,the role of fog in the relict laurel forests of the macaronesia is still not fully understood and it is even more relevant in the canary islands where precipitations are rather scarce and summers are dry eddy covariance co2 exchange f co2 measurements in a brezal de tejo elfin cloud forest in tenerife canary islands over a four weeks period during the wet season showed that the vegetation can sustain a carbon assimilation rate in an environment of fog leading to higher median water use efficiency values 19 5 μmol mg 1 wue 68 3 μmol mg 1 than during no fog periods wue 1 8 μmol mg 1 being highest under thick fog wue 68 3 μmol mg 1 median f co2 values across the day were slightly greater under foggy versus no fog conditions during the study period these increments were more prominent under a low light environment especially in the morning thus highlighting the important difference between cloud immersion versus high clouds a greater proportion of light diffusivity due to fog may enhance carbon assimilation although additional concomitant factors may intervene during thick fog conditions also net carbon assimilation was initiated earlier under foggy conditions during cloud immersion and depleted light the maximal co2 exchange f co2 max diurnal values were higher than those observed when fog was absent additionally f co2 max remained high f co2 max 13 μmol m 2 s 1 for large vapour pressure deficit conditions vpd 0 6 kpa all this is indicative of a profligate water use strategy of the vegetation presumably due to low stomatal control fog was present during 36 9 of the time and as a consequence the estimated mean daily settling flux of water droplets was 1 186 mg m 2 s 1 for the entire period measured the cumulative settling flux was 1 30 mm compared to the 97 6 mm of rainfall and the 36 6 mm of throughfall and the canopy was wet at least 33 3 of the time the results suggest that such an anisohydric behaviour of the vegetation permits a continuous growth with maximal water use efficiency while the frequent presence of fog and wetting of the canopy would minimize the risk of cavitation associated with such non conservative water use response keywords cloud

cover 0 4 of the world land surface and are considered one of the most vulnerable ecosystems to global warming foster 2001 karger et al 2021 thus their study becomes relevant under a climate change scenario for instance alterations in the cloud base height have been related to population declines in montane cloud forests karmalkar et al 2008 pounds et al 1999 still et al 1999 van beusekom et al 2017 while global climate models predict a future downward shift of the cloud base in the macaronesian biogeographic region sperling et al 2004 the importance of the laurel cloud forests of the macaronesian oceanic islands is widely recognized pérez de paz 1990 their large number of endemic species with strong ecological specialization and limited dispersal ability make these hotspots of biodiversity particularly susceptible to alterations in the environmental conditions nogué et al 2013 patiño et al 2016 whittaker and fernández palacios 2007 the anaga massif in tenerife canary islands houses an important representation of these laurisilva forests and as such was declared biosphere reserve by unesco it is home to 196 different vascular plants with 102 endemisms and supports 1900 terrestrial invertebrates with 329 species present exclusively in tenerife and 95 being endemic of anaga this ecosystem represents a relict of the lauraceae forests that originally extended throughout the mediterranean basin during the neogene era and that sought refuge in more temperate areas such as the canary islands and the other atlantic macaronesian archipelagos after the quaternarian glaciation fernández palacios et al 2011 kondraskov et al 2015 rodríguez sánchez and arroyo 2008 fog in the macaronesian region is a consequence of the vertical thermal structure of the atmosphere at these latitudes cao et al 2007 characterized by the existence of a thermal inversion in altitude due to the subsidence associated with the descending branch of hadley s general circulation cell carrillo et al 2016 because of this trade wind driven moist air masses stop their orographic lifting along the ne side of the steepest islands leading to a permanent stratocumulus layer at 900 1500 m a s l font tullot 1956 this foggy environment sustains a forest with abundant mosses and other bryophytes and an umbrophile understory that develops below evergreen trees pérez de paz 1990 santos guerra 1990 the survival of these plant communities has been related to the influence of low cloud immersion and fog axelrod 1975 gioda et al 1995 patiño et al 2016 ritter et al 2008 2009 2019 which may compensate the scarce precipitations and dry summers of the canary islands aboal et al 2013 regalado and ritter 2021 ritter et al 2019 the consequences of fog water interception by leaves and how this affects both the plant water and carbon relations remains an open question in this and other cloud forests dawson and goldsmith 2018 more importantly than an additional water source fog has been shown to supress plant transpiration in this ritter et al 2009 and other cloud forests burgess and dawson 2004 chung et al 2017 hutley et al 1997 johnson and smith 2008 reinhardt and smith 2008 furthermore cloud immersion and cloudy skies may enhance carbon assimilation johnson and smith 2006 law et al 2002 because of a more photosynthetically efficient light quality johnson and smith 2006 li et al 2014 reinhardt et al 2010 this has been shown to be the case among others in boreal goulden et al 1997 subalpine monson et al 2002 temperate deciduous baldocchi 1997 rocha et al 2004 and evergreen forests price and black 1991 thus a reduced transpiration and associated increased carbon assimilation due to low clouds may lead to an increased water use efficiency lamaud et al 1996 rocha et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 several studies have investigated the transpiration and co2 assimilation of tree species representative of the laurisilva based on discrete porometric and gas exchange measurements on leaves gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a b tausz et al 2004 zöhlen et al 1995 among other characteristic species of the laurel forest the gas exchange response of laurus novocanariensis rivas mart et al formerly laurus azorica gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 persea indica l gonzález rodríguez et al 2002a and myrica faya ait gonzález rodríguez et al 2002b was studied low irradiances 20 μmol photons m2 s 1 were sufficient to achieve maximal conductance an indication of the shade tolerance and umbrophilous character of these tree species also under high atmospheric vapour pressure deficit laurisilva plants exhibited both relatively large values of stomatal conductance and transpiration rates this evidenced a weak stomatal control and paradoxically a non conservative water use strategy a response that is typical of tree species not subject to prolonged drought periods gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a noticeably this profligate water use behaviour has been also reported in the cloud immersed californian redwood forests burgess and dawson 2004 and the yellow cypress montane cloud forests of taiwan chu et al 2014 in another representative tree species of the canarian laurel forests myrica faya a substantial night time sap flow was observed under conditions of high nocturnal atmospheric evaporative demand an additional indication of such non conservative water use strategy regalado and ritter 2021 furthermore regalado and ritter 2021 suggested that this seemingly paradoxical weak stomatal control in trees species of an ecosystem where pluviometry is relatively low such as the canarian laurel forests may be alleviated by the foggy environment thus permitting a sustained carbon assimilation rate and growth across the year direct measurements of energy water and carbon dioxide exchange between the vegetation and the atmosphere is an alternative technique to those mentioned above and eddy covariance is currently the most widely used for this purpose baumberger et al 2021 chu et al 2014 goldstein et al 2000 lópez olivari et al 2015 scartazza et al 2014 thus vapour and carbon dioxide turbulent flows may be precisely determined from continuous records of wind speed in the three spatial directions temperature relative humidity water vapour and co2 densities baldocchi 2003 baldocchi et al 2001 furthermore measurements obtained at a single location can be treated as average exchange rates between the land surface and the atmosphere without disturbing the plant canopy thus providing a means of observing the functioning of the entire ecosystem and not just individual trees dugas 1993 also direct measurements of gas exchange in fog wet leaves in cloud forests can present methodological difficulties reinhardt and smith 2008 which can therefore be avoided with the eddy covariance system however the success of the eddy covariance technique depends on the fulfilment of some initial hypotheses such as the consideration of ideal conditions of stability and horizontal homogeneity baldocchi et al 1988 therefore in order to obtain reliable measurements under non ideal situations such as those that occur in a forested complex terrain with roughness and non uniform vegetation the phenomena of advection and divergence must be taken into account baldocchi et al 2000 lee 1998 vickers and mahrt 2006 moreover when this technique is used in cloud forests the question arises as to what extent fog water fluxes contribute to the overall water inputs such flows are those resulting from the variation of the vertical wind speed and the fog liquid water content turbulent flux from the gravitational settling of fog droplets deposition flux as well as that caused by the condensation of water vapour condensation flux or the interception of droplets by inertial impaction onto leaves in this regard eugster et al 2006 concluded from eddy covariance measurements performed in a puerto rican cloud forest that the water flow inputs associated with fog droplets could not be assumed negligible apart from this the eddy covariance technique has been used in a fairly limited number of studies in environments affected by dew and or fog baumberger et al 2021 breuer et al 2021 chu et al 2014 el madany et al 2016 li et al 2021 in this study energy and mass turbulent fluxes determined with the eddy covariance technique were analysed in an elfin cloud forest located in the area of special conservation of the anaga massif in tenerife canary islands in order to determine to what extent fog may affect the dynamics of these fluxes in this unique ecosystem our objectives are to determine how fog affects the carbon influx droplet deposition and water use efficiency of the laurel forest vegetation 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study site is located at the highest altitude 1015 m a s l of the anaga massif cruz de taborno fig 1 a in the facilities of the spanish air navigation agency aena 28 32 9 61 n 16 16 8 91 w it is situated below the thermal inversion and thus often immersed in clouds being exposed to the prevailing ne trade winds it is affected by frequent fog episodes and high relative humidity all over the year annual mean temperatures are mild and do not exceed 14 c rainfall is 1130 281 mm year 1 ritter et al 2019 the terrain slope is 22 east and 9 southerly the canopy is homogenous up to 250 m eastward and 150 m southward the vegetation is classified as brezal de tejo a subformation derived from the fayal brezal where erica platycodon webb et berth rivas mart et al or tejo in the former substitutes another tree like heather erica arborea or brezo in the latter this hyperhumid community is found between 800 and 1100 m of altitude in steep wind exposed areas pérez de

consists mainly in ferns and some lianiform epiphytes the abundant community of mosses and lichens on tree trunks and branches are sustained by the high ambient humidity fig 1b the soils are of volcanic origin with andic characteristics fernández caldas et al 1982 höllermann 1981 organic matter content in the top horizon is 38 and apparent texture is loamy sand the carbon content decreases with soil depth and texture turns clayey porosity is large 65 5 and as a consequence of the characteristic microporosity of andic soils the water retention capacity is high regalado and ritter 2021 2 2 measuring equipment 2 2 1 meteorological instrumentation measurements were carried out during the wet season ritter et al 2019 from february the 12th until march the 11th 2018 every 1 min micrometeorological variables were obtained with sensors installed on top of a 6 m tall scaffolding tower supplemented with a 1 5 m mast installed at its upper vertex placed on the southern edge of a deforested esplanade global radiation rg was measured with a pyranometer sks 1110 skye instruments ltd powys united kingdom and par with a photosynthetic light smart sensor s lia m003 onset computer

above the canopy were measured with a hmp45c thermo hygrometer campbell scientific ltd lougborough uk wind speed was measured with a a100r anemometer campbell scientific ltd lougborough uk placed at 7 m in the tower these 1 minute measurements were taken with a combilog data logger up gmbh cottbus germany and were averaged every 30 min a hobo micro meteorological station h21 002 onset computer corporation usa with a thermo hygrometer s thb m002 onset computer corporation usa provided data of ambient temperature and relative humidity below the canopy 40 cm above ground temperature and relative humidity were measured every second and stored as 30 min averages based on these daily averages were computed these data in combination with the temperature and water vapour density values provided by the eddy covariance system above the canopy were necessary to determine the vertical advection in turbulent fluxes see section 2 2 4 below 2 2 2 fog characterization to gather information about fog presence and potential fog water affection at the site a sheltered wire harp flat fog water collector was oriented towards the predominant ne wind direction at a height of 4 5 m and connected to a raingauge below the fog gauge consists of three screens separated 1 cm apart from each other each screen was built with 0 5 mm nylon fishing line strung back and forth between the teeth of two band saw blades used as guides rendering 3 mm center center spacing between filaments and a fractional coverage of 0 5 3 0 167 regalado and ritter 2017 fog water collection fwc was referred to the vertical cross sectional area 46 46 cm2 of the fog gauge screen l m 2 in addition reductions in visibility ω m due to fog were monitored with a forward scatter infrared visibilimeter cs120 campbell scientific ltd usa which provides ω values in the meteorological optical range mor foggy events were defined as those when ω 1 km with thick fog corresponding to ω 0 1 km dense fog to 0 1 ω 0 2 km and light fog to 0 2 ω 1 km fog free conditions are those when visibility was ω 1 km glickman 2000 eugster et al 2006 2 2 3 rainfall and throughfall instrumentation rainfall was measured with a 0 2 mm resolution spoon tipping raingauge rain o matic professional pronamic bekhøi international trading engineering co ltd silkeborg denmark placed in the open the throughfall thf that occurs due to rainfall and fog water canopy dripping onto the soil surface was monitored with 11 tipping bucket raingauges davis instruments corp california connected to hobo event dataloggers onset computer corp bourne usa these were supplemented with 3 additional spoon tipping raingauges rain o matic professional connected to a combilog datalogger and the measurements were totalized and stored in 15 min intervals the raingauges orifice was augmented with a plastic funnel 28 7 cm equipped with a filter to avoid obstruction by falling leaves and were cleaned periodically every two weeks the 14 raingauges were randomly distributed on the ground over an area of 20 m 8 m fig 1b 2 2 4 eddy covariance the eddy covariance system was installed on a sloped forested area over a 6 m high triangular base scaffolding tower ect 30 m away from the meteorological instruments the tower was supplemented with a 2 80 m mast installed at its upper vertex perpendicular to it at a height of 8 15 m above the ground a 1 20 m long tubular arm was fixed and oriented in the main wind direction at the end of this arm the eddy covariance system was screwed remaining at a distance of approximately 2 15 m above the nearby canopy the system consists of an open path gas analyzer with an integrated three dimensional sonic anemometer irgason campbell scientific ltd usa it measures simultaneously absolute carbon dioxide and water vapour densities air temperature barometric pressure three dimensional wind speed and sonic temperature the system also consists of a temperature sensor betatherm 100k6a1ia 107 thermistor campbell scientific ltd lougborough uk that was installed in the same arm measurements were taken at 10 hz and stored as 30 min averages in a cr3000 datalogger campbell scientific ltd usa the easyflux dl software campbell scientific ltd usa was used for data processing to compute the advective term required to calculate the sensible and latent heat fluxes see appendix a temperature and rh at the midpoint between the measurement height and the base of the ect were obtained by interpolation of the air temperature and rh data provided by the eddy covariance system and the hobo micro meteorological station 2 2 5 soil instrumentation soil heat flux and temperature measurements in the top soil horizon were necessary for the calculation of the soil heat flux g these variables were measured using a heat flux plate hfp01sc campbell scientific ltd usa and two thermocouple pairs tcav campbell scientific ltd usa respectively the heat flux plate was buried 8 cm deep approximately 2 m from the base of the ect the thermocouples were buried at two soil depths 2 and 6 cm these were located on both sides of the heat flux plate at a distance of 30 cm measurements of both the thermocouples and the soil heat flux plate were taken at 1 minute intervals and average values were recorded every 30 min the volumetric water content in the soil θ was measured with two tdr trime ez probes imko gmbh ettlingen germany approximately one meter away from the ect the trime ez probe consists of two 16 cm long rods separated 4 cm so the representative measurement soil volume is approximately 700 cm3 the rods were inserted horizontally into the soil on the side of a trench opened for this purpose both superficially 10 cm and in depth 80 cm measurements were taken every 5 minutes in a combilog logger up gmbh cottbus germany and averaged every 30 min 2 3 eddy covariance data quality analysis and flux footprint under foggy conditions co2 and water vapour density measurements may be affected by obstruction of the gas analyzer s optical path due to water droplets passing through or water condensation on the analyzer lenses to ensure the quality of the data only raw co2 and h2o densities for which the intensity of the gas analyzer signal was 70 were taken as valid discarding the rest of the data for the calculation of 30 min fluxes to verify that the data fulfilled the atmospheric stability condition which is assumed in the turbulent flux theory appendix a a quality analysis was performed based on the non relative state and the integral turbulence characteristics tests energy fluxes were calculated only for those measurements with quality grade 3 appendix b in order to determine the origin of the water vapour and the atmospheric co2 measured by the eddy covariance system and therefore the source of the fluxes several models can be used to characterize the instrumentation influence area or flux footprint this was obtained using the most updated flux footprint prediction model proposed by kljun et al 2015 which is based on restrictive turbulence conditions fig 1c 2 4 data analysis the variables were illustrated and discussed based on their evolution during the study period or at each day hour comparisons were performed based on boxplots i e in terms of the median value and its dispersion 1st and 3rd quartiles the wilcoxon whitney mann test was used to evaluate the differences in median values under various fog visibility conditions neuhäuser 2011 2 5 model fitting the response of the maximal net ecosystem co2 flux f co2 max to variations in the meteorological variables rn par and vpd was quantified in terms of enveloping curves these are defined as the fitting monotonic curves that describe the co2 flux f co2 maxima i e such enveloping curves quantify the vegetation response to changes in a given variable when the other ambient conditions are optimal the computation and model fitting procedures were implemented in a matlab the mathworks inc natick ma usa computer code regalado and ritter 2019 2 6 water use efficiency the water use efficiency wue μmol mg 1 of the ecosystem was defined as the ratio between the biomass produced by the vegetation and the amount of water transpired kuglitsch et al 2008 in the absence of other sources or sinks of co2 the biomass was quantified from the rate of carbon assimilation by the vegetation f co2 μmol m 2 s 1 in turn water losses were determined from the stand evapotranspiration et mg m 2 s 1 estimated here as the et of a partially wet hypostomatic canopy ritter et al 2019 therefore the water use efficiency was computed for diurnal hours only rn 10 w m 2 as 1 wue f c o 2 et 3 results and discussion 3 1 meteorological conditions and soil related variables ambient temperatures were mild throughout the period of study with a mean standard deviation value of 10 3 2 7 c and a minimum of 6 1 c these temperatures are typical of the winter season in the area ritter et al 2019 regalado and ritter 2021 the average relative humidity was above 90 rh 91 2 15 1 and mean global radiation was 154 2 253 9 w m 2 foggy events ω 1 km were more frequent at night and represented 36 9 of the total hours of the study period with thick ω 100 m and dense fog 100 ω 200 m occurring 13 4 and 15 1 of the time respectively total precipitation was 97 6 mm and excluding those rainy episodes the fog water collection occurred 28 6 of the time throughfall as a consequence of rainfall and or fog water canopy dripping was detected 33 3 of the time and thus the stand was wet for at least 223 5 h total thf 36 6 mm represented 37 5 of rainfall the rainfall occurring on doy 52 54 and 56 contributed mostly to those cumulative values which produced the greatest thf events cf fig 2 a and c these rainfall events resulted in significant increments in the soil water content θ especially in the most superficial horizon reaching up to saturation values θ 0 7 m3 m 3 in some instances fig 2d e in contrast throughfall events associated with fog conditions ω 1 km exhibited low values 0 2 mm and were not reflected in the soil moisture data soil moisture remained above the permanent wilting point θ 0 39 m3 m 3 for the period of study and was higher in the deep horizon θ 0 52 m3 m 3 the fog gauge collected water mainly when visibility was low ω 0 2 km fig 2b ritter et al 2019 foggy conditions were clearly associated with a reduction in radiation table 1 rg fig 3 a 4a f rn fig 3b and par fig 4 b g and with very low vpd fig 3c fig 4c h lower ambient temperatures fig 4d i and higher wind speeds fig 4e j these daily course changes in the meteorological variables under both fog and fog free conditions were not only observed during the period of study but were sustained across the year left versus right panels in fig 4 net radiation varied according to rg fig 3a b being positive during daylight hours and negative during the night the dynamics of the evapotranspiration fig 3d was consistent with the evolution of rg fig 3a and vpd fig 3c during the study period soil heat flux g oscillated between negative and positive values during night time and daylight hours respectively fig 3e the low g values observed in doy 56 were associated with a rapid increase in soil water content fig 2d due to large rainfall events fig 2a 3 2 eddy covariance and soil energy fluxes the sensible heat flux h took large values compared to the latent heat flux le such that the difference between h and le increased linearly with rn fig 5 suggesting that the energy associated with temperature variations was greater than that involved in phase changes in contrast on foggy periods ω 1 km when rn did not exceed 200 w m 2 smaller h values were observed a linear correlation between median g values at each hour of the day during foggy versus fog free conditions was obtained r 2 0 938 this was also the case for h r 2 0 667 rn r 2 0 918 rg r 2 0 916 and par r 2 0 892 but not so for le r 2 0 216 table 1 comparing such median values of le h and g with respect to rn under both foggy and fog free conditions satisfactory linear correlations were obtained table 2 focusing on the slope values of the above regression equations it follows that median values of le h and g represent 13 53 4 of median rn under fog free conditions respectively similarly under foggy conditions h and g represent 38 and 5 of median rn while no acceptable correlation was obtained for le such a low contribution of net radiation to soil heat flux may be explained by the canopy coverage since g depends on vegetation density humes et al 1994 norman et al 2000 and varies unevenly with respect to rn throughout the day fuchs and hadas 1972 kustas et al 2000 with full canopy cover g is generally 0 1rn and its contribution to the energy balance a 1 may thus be considered negligible santanello and friedl 2003 as it would be also the case in the present study 3 3 fog water fluxes fig 6 shows the number of hours with different visibility conditions for each day of the study period fig 6a and the mean daily values of liquid water fluxes due to fog fig 6b c larger fog water fluxes were obtained during days with most of the time being under thick and dense fog conditions ω 0 2 km with thick and dense fog occurring 13 4 and 15 1 of the time respectively fig 6a fog water fluxes due to the gravitational settling of fog droplets i e deposition flux fs as well as that caused by the condensation of water vapour i e condensation flux fc were estimated as detailed in appendix c the daily mean settling flux of fog droplets fs 0 103 mm day 1 1 186 mg m 2 s 1 was higher than that of condensation fc 0 093 mm day 1 1 073 mg m 2 s 1 under foggy conditions fig 6b c the total fluxes for the period were fs 1 30 mm and fc 1 00 mm in terms of energy contributions the mean condensation flux was low fc 2 653 1 738 w m 2 compared to h 62 50 135 93 w m 2 and le 55 36 77 78 w m 2 and of the same order of magnitude than g 0 67 14 44 w m 2 to put these estimates into context and their relative importance with respect to other fog water inputs to the forest the daily mean fog water collection rate obtained from the fog gauge data was also computed ffwc 8 491 mm day 1 98 279 mg m 2 s 1 fig 6d although the efficiencies of droplets interception by the fog gauge and the canopy differ regalado and ritter 2021 these are collected in both cases by inertial impaction and therefore the former gives an indication of the potential fog water interception of the stand cf fig 2b c the small relative contribution of fs to the total water flux was also acknowledged by eugster et al 2006 who reported a value of fs 4 36 mm day 1 in the cloud forests of pico del este this larger fs estimate was justified based on the high frequency of fog occurrence at pico del este i e 85 with ω 0 2 km persisting 74 of the time other studies reported lower fog deposition values of 0 05 2 3 mm day 1 cf table 2 in eugster et al 2006 closer to the one obtained at our site i e fs 0 103 mm day 1 with a 36 9 248 h fog affection and low visibility ω 0 2 km occurring 28 5 191 5 h of the time to put these numbers in context in a 4 year period 2015 2018 study at the site it was shown that ω 1 km during 46 9 of the time and that february march were not the foggiest months being may to september when the greatest average number of hours per month with ω 0 2 km were registered 295 h month 1 a period during which the site was often immersed in the cloud ritter et al 2019 thus the deposition of fog droplets is likely to be higher around summer time when the altitude of the inversion layer coincides with that of the site this is also relevant since summer is the driest season in terms of pluviometry and therefore the importance of fog becomes even more evident 3 4 variation of the ecosystem co2 flux f co2 with the meteorological conditions the co2 exchange between the ecosystem and the atmosphere f co2 is defined in a 10 such that f co2 0 indicates a downward flux towards the vegetation carbon assimilation increased with net radiation until reaching maxima around rn 400 w m 2 from this value onwards f co2 remained steady for rn 200 w m 2 maximums of f co2 were registered in the presence of fog ω 1 km fig 7 a the response of f co2 with respect to photosynthetically active radiation par followed a similar trend to that of rn that is f co2 increased with par up to values close to 0 6 mmol m 2 s 1 when f co2 max 30 μmol m 2 s 1 values were reached under fog conditions when fog was absent f co2 max reached lower maximum values of 20 μmol m 2 s 1 i e 33 smaller cf enveloping curves in fig 7b a similar plant response to light has been previously observed in gas exchange measurements in laurel trees leaves showing that these became saturated at 25 38 of full sunlight zöhlen et al 1995 gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a b fog has been shown to significantly reduce radiation across all hours of the day at this site fig 4 see also ritter et al 2019 regalado and ritter 2021 but also in another area of tenerife regalado and ritter 2017 in the laurel forests of the garajonay national park in la gomera island ritter et al 2008 and in different cloud forests across the world alvarado barrientos et al 2014 bittencourt et al 2019 eugster et al 2006 obregon et al 2011 the degree of radiation decline above the canopy depends on visibility and time of the year but can be as high as 60 during thick fog ω 0 1 km hours ritter et al 2019 for the period of the current study rn was 23 lower under foggy conditions ω 1 km this reduction can even be more pronounced in the understory with 90 radiation attenuation due to the relatively dense canopy aschan et al 1994 ritter et al 2019 yet the vegetation seems to be well adapted to this low irradiance conditions during the study period maximizing carbon assimilation under the attenuated light of foggy events it has been previously suggested that the quality of light under cloud immersion with a greater degree of scattering may be more photosynthetically appropriate than direct beam sunlight dengel and grace 2010 johnson and smith 2006 reinhardt et al 2010 still et al 2009 urban et al 2007 and thus laurel species might take advantage of this diffused light environment to maximize carbon capture during foggy hours the ratio of diffuse radiation rd over par at our site decreased with visibility such that the rd par medians were 0 827 kj mmol 1 ω 0 1 km 0 827 kj mmol 1 0 1 ω 0 2 km 0 692 kj mmol 1 0 2 ω 1 km and 0 467 kj mmol 1 ω 1 km fig 7c this seems to support the hypothesis that a greater proportion of light diffusivity during fog periods may enhance carbon assimilation f co2 max varied in this study with ambient temperature and this usually exhibits a bell shape response gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a b accordingly it reached maximum absolute values between 7 c and 10 c under both foggy and non foggy conditions from 10 c up to 16 c f co2 max halved decreasing from 30 down to 15 μmol m 2 s 1 results not shown this is consistent with previously reported canopy conductance temperature responses in the laurel cloud forests of la gomera showing for e g m faya maximal conductance around 9 11 c and a rapid decline outside this range ritter and regalado 2017 f co2 max showed a downward trend with vpd starting from f co2 max 30 μmol m 2 s 1 when vpd 0 and remaining around 13 μmol m 2 s 1 for vpd 0 6 kpa enveloping curve in fig 7d consistently gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a b found that laurel tree species exhibited a low stomatal control responding to elevated vpd by decreasing leaf conductance but only down to values sufficient to maintain a significant carbon assimilation rate see also ritter and regalado 2017 3 5 temporal evolution of the ecosystem water and carbon exchange fluxes the temporal variation of the measured co2 flux f co2 across the day during the study period showed maxima located around 1 00 p m the average of diurnal maxima was f co2 max 19 0 μmol m 2 s 1 ω 1 km and f co2 max 16 9 μmol m 2 s 1 ω 1 km fig 8 a c this gaseous exchange is coupled to an associated water vapour loss through transpiration and it is thus reflected in the estimated evapotranspiration with maximal et values consistently occurring in the central hours of the day fig 8b d when analysing the behaviour of f co2 with respect to variations in ω we observed that the assimilation of co2 by the vegetation was not severely affected by the fog conditions fig 8e this was not the case of the evapotranspiration with strong reductions in et during foggy ω 1 km versus fog free periods ω 1 km fig 8b d f using sap flow gauges inserted in m faya and e arborea trees ritter et al 2009 reported that fog greatly reduced transpiration more than one order of magnitude with respect to fog free conditions in the laurel forest of la gomera canary islands these results were recently corroborated by regalado and ritter 2021 in m faya at the same site as the current study furthermore these authors suggested that such foggy environment may permit a sustained carbon assimilation rate without the associated cavitation risks of the anisohydric water use strategy and weak stomatal control typical of these species our results point also in this direction where we have shown that the carbon influx was maintained even under foggy conditions during the study period consistently gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 2002a b reported that during a wet day with vpd 0 5 kpa maximum carbon assimilation rates amax were measured in l azorica p indica and m faya in contraposition to the lower values and sharp decrease of amax observed in a cloudless day with vpd 1 kpa although these authors did not monitor fog the low vpd attenuated light and lower leaf temperature during their wet day may be comparable with the foggy conditions of this study while maximal f co2 values were obtained in central hours carbon assimilation started earlier and lasted longer in the afternoon under foggy conditions during the study period fig 8a c to this respect it should be mentioned that transpiration and high stomatal conductance during night time are widespread among ecosystems and species dawson et al 2007 for instance high rates of nocturnal transpiration were reported in a costa rican elfin cloud forest feild and holbrook 2000 and in a tropical montane cloud forest in mexico alvarado barrientos et al 2015 gotsch et al 2014 using sap flow gauges regalado and ritter 2021 showed that a significant nocturnal transpiration of m faya occurred at this site representing 23 of the total daily xylematic water transport and that this was enhanced by foliar moistening due to preceding fog diurnal events see also alvarado barrientos et al 2015 given that fog was more frequent at the site during night ritter et al 2019 this nocturnal transpiration may be considered therefore relevant in the overall vegetation activity such nocturnal gas exchange has been suggested to be a consequence of the aforementioned weak stomatal control due to leaky stomata and their incapability to fully close at night another non exclusive hypothesis is that it may facilitate carbon assimilation early in the morning because stomata would be already open at dawn dawson et al 2007 seibt et al 2007 zeppel et al 2014 this is consistent with the results shown in fig 8a c which indicate that net carbon assimilation started earlier in the morning under foggy conditions during the study period this hypothesis has been suggested for plants growing in low light environments that may depend on short periods of direct irradiance or sunflecks for photosynthesizing dawson et al 2007 pearcy et al 1994 the response of laurel forest species to sunflecks has not been investigated but we have already commented that these may function at low irradiances occurring e g during foggy conditions or in the understory gonzález rodríguez et al 2001 thus the vegetation would be able to assimilate carbon very early in the morning having the stomata open during low vpd foggy nights would not result in significant water loss yet the vegetation would benefit from this early preparation for carbon assimilation finally night time transpiration has been suggested to promote nutrient uptake by the root system in nutrient deficient soils scholz et al 2007 although volcanic soils are highly fertile they may exhibit selective retention of potassium ions wada 1985 and phosphorous negrín et al 1995 and thus nocturnal transpiration might benefit plant growth 3 6 water use efficiency median f co2 values across the day were slightly higher under foggy versus no fog conditions but were not significantly different during the study period fig 9 a these differences however were accentuated under a low light environment rn 200 w m 2 especially in the morning that is under foggy versus cloudy conditions fig 9b this highlights the important difference between cloud immersion versus high clouds thus the vegetation was capable of maximizing net carbon assimilation under the saturated water vapour conditions lower temperatures and radiation that took place during cloud immersed foggy periods i e under perhumid conditions based on experiments where artificial fog was applied onto plant saplings of sequoia sempervirens simonin et al 2009 and drimys brasiliensis eller et al 2013 it has been previously suggested that fog has a positive effect on plant carbon gain during dense fog events and or rainfall the canopy may become wet as a result of the interception and deposition of water droplets fig 2a b fig 6 thus the resulting water layer resting on the leaves surface might impair gas exchange through stomata due to the much lower diffusivity of co2 in water letts and mulligan 2005 this does not seem to be always the case here since carbon assimilation was maintained under foggy conditions during the study period plants in general and laurel forest tree species are not an exception in this respect borgesen 1924 marrero and nogales 2005 have developed different adaptations to minimize this effect such as e g leaves with cereous hydrophobic epicuticules and an abaxial distribution of stomata aparecido et al 2017 parkhurst 1978 pariyar et al 2017 in addition evaporation of the water film may enhance stomatal conductance by increasing the humidity in the vicinity of the leaves thus alleviating the vegetation water stress and consequently promoting the assimilation of carbon chu et al 2014 katata 2014 kume et al 2006 furthermore we have shown earlier at this site that canopy moistening associated to fog water interception may result in leaf water uptake by m faya and therefore the hydration of the canopy regalado and ritter 2021 in this regard alvarado barrientos et al 2014 2015 reported that stomatal conductance of a pine plantation was enhanced during fog events and hypothesized that fog water may hydrate leaf tissues rather than occlude stomata in order to quantify the benefit of this sustained carbon assimilation rate under foggy conditions we computed the water use efficiency wue under different visibility ranges fig 10 a for comparison purposes four visibility intervals that characterize the different fog types were selected i e thick fog ω 0 1 km dense fog 0 1 ω 0 2 km light fog 0 2 ω 1 km and no fog ω 1 km the mean vpd associated with each of these intervals were 0 kpa 0 00031 kpa 0 0061 kpa and 0 231 kpa respectively for ω 1 km median values of wue were of the same order of magnitude for the three classes considered under foggy conditions 19 5 μmol mg 1 0 2 ω 1 km 23 2 μmol mg 1 0 1 ω 0 2 km and 68 3 μmol mg 1 ω 0 1 km in contrast a median wue value of 1 8 μmol mg 1 was observed when ω 1 km such differences in wue are a consequence of reduced et during foggy periods fig 3d fig 8b due to the prevailing meteorological conditions fig 4 and not much as a consequence of increased f co2 fig 9 when comparing the various fog conditions significant differences were found between thick and dense fog p 0 0078 and thick and light fog p 0 001 but not between dense and light fog p 0 2480 in the same way a significant difference p 0 001 was obtained when comparing wue under fog ω 1 km and no fog conditions ω 1 km this difference was also observed when considering various time periods throughout the day fig 10b and low light conditions rn 200 w m 2 fig 10c accordingly gonzález rodríguez et al 2002a b reported higher wue values across a day with low vpd 1 kpa with respect to a cloudless day with high vpd 1 kpa in both p indica and m faya these results stress once more the relevant effect that fog may have on the use of water and carbon assimilation by trees of these cloud forests although not many studies have investigated the wue of cloud forests reinhardt and smith 2008 cloudy skies have been related to larger wue lamaud et al 1996 rocha et al 2004 zhang et al 2011 this has been explained in terms of a larger proportion of diffuse radiation rd more photosynthetically efficient than direct sun light over par under cloud cover li et al 2014 johnson and smith 2006 reinhardt et al 2010 in our case no distinctions in median rd par were observed for thick ω 0 1 km and dense fog 0 1 ω 0 2 km at the site fig 7c and yet marked differences in wue were obtained for these two visibility classes fig 10a thus although an increase in diffuse radiation due to light scattering by fog droplets seems a plausible hypothesis these results suggest that additional concomitant factors may intervene during thick fog conditions in this respect it should be notice that a higher reduction in rg and increased fog water collection have been reported at the site for thick ω 0 1 km versus dense fog 0 1 ω 0 2 km ritter et al 2019 4 conclusions eddy covariance together with concomitant meteorological variables and throughfall measurements were carried out over a four weeks period during the wet season in a brezal de tejo cloud forest these permitted to asses to what degree the net carbon assimilation of the ecosystem was affected by cloud immersion fog presence and light conditions trees may adopt different approaches for dealing with a limited resource of rainfall i e a profligate anisohydric or a conservative isohydric water use strategy our results in consonance with previous studies in various laurisilva tree species indicate that the brezal de tejo cloud forest follows a non conservative strategy probably due to a low stomatal control such anisohydric response permitted a sustained carbon assimilation rate during the study period and presumably a continuous growth of the vegetation the risks of hydraulic failure due to cavitation associated with anisohydricity are though minimised due to the frequent 36 9 of the time fog presence i e low vpd conditions in the area in addition the leaf water intake of intercepted fog droplets previously reported at this site for m faya may help hydrate the canopy and refill embolized conduits thus providing an additional safeguard mechanism against the surmisable cavitation associated with anisohydricity in this respect our throughfall measurements indicated that the brezal de tejo canopy remained wet for at least one third of the time during the period of study additionally we have shown that the mean settling flux of fog water droplets onto the stand was fs 0 103 mm day 1 and was thus more important than the condensation fc 0 093 mm day 1 despite a 71 4 reduction in median net radiation under foggy conditions the carbon influx during the study period was not affected under these conditions of depleted light rn 200 w m 2 such that f co2 max values were higher than during those situations when fog was not present an indication of the adaptation of the stand to umbrophilous environments that highlights the difference between cloud immersion and cloudy skies by contrast maximal f co2 remained elevated f co2 max 13 μmol m 2 s 1 for vpd 0 6 kpa hinting to the aforementioned low stomatal control such that the vegetation responded to elevated vpd by decreasing stomatal conductance but only down to values large enough to maintain a substantial carbon assimilation rate furthermore a significant co2 flux was observed early in the morning during foggy periods another indication of reduced stomatal regulation due to leaky leaf pores and their inability to fully close in the dark that was earlier confirmed at the site using sap flow gauges the prevailing meteorological conditions of low vpd mild temperatures and a greater proportion of diffuse radiation in the area led to a greater median water use efficiency of the ecosystem under foggy conditions that occurred 36 9 of the time 19 5 μmol mg 1 wue 68 3 μmol mg 1 versus no fog periods wue 1 8 μmol mg 1 future climate change scenarios predict a shift in the altitude of the cloud base and warmer temperatures in the macaronesia area and therefore a modification of the current climatological conditions that sustain the laurel forests our results indicate that this would affect both the growth and the water relations of these relict

average mixing ratio of the component in the atmosphere ρ a kg m 3 is the mean air density and u v and w are the components of the mean wind speed in the x y and z directions respectively equation a 2 was evaluated in non ideal conditions this is considering that advection is not negligible in the vertical and longitudinal directions and assuming that the variation of the horizontal flux occurs in the mean wind direction axis x in order to determine the advective term we used the one dimensional advection method proposed by lee 1998 i e no horizontal divergence of the turbulent flux and no horizontal advection were assumed finnigan 1999 baldocchi et al 2000 since for the calculation of said terms we needed measurements that were not available thus integration of a 2 with respect to the

term for f co2 thus it was only computed for the sensible and latent heat exchanges appendix b eddy covariance data quality tests signal strength and cospectral analysis b 1 eddy covariance data quality tests to verify that the data fulfilled the atmospheric stability condition which is assumed in the turbulent flux theory a quality analysis was performed based on the following two tests the relative non stationarity rncov test to confirm the steady state conditions and the relative integral turbulence characteristics itc test to define turbulence conditions the first test computes an index rncov expressed in percentage that represents the average of the difference between the 5 minutes and 30 minutes covariance values of a scalar and the vertical wind speed with respect to the 30 minutes covariance s w foken et al 2012 b1 r n cov 100 1 6 i 1 6 s w ri s w r s w r where w is the vertical wind speed s represents the scalar of interest such as the sonic temperature ts the temperature t the density of water vapor ρ v the density of co2 ρco2 or the horizontal components of the wind speed u and v the subscript r indicates variables obtained after the double rotation and the subscript i denotes the ith covariance of the ith 5 minutes interval i 1 6 in each 30 minutes period based on the rncov a quality grade was assigned from the interval 1 9 table b1 the second test computes an index itcs that expresses the turbulence degree in percentage as the relative difference of the standard deviation of a fluctuating scalar s such as temperature wind speed or momentum normalized by a scale factor such as the friction speed or the scale temperature tillmann 1972 with respect to the itc computed in conditions of fully developed turbulence itcs model based on the resulting index a quality grade was assigned from the interval 1 9 table b1 thus for temperature the itct is given by foken et al 2012 b2 it c t 100 t 2 r t i t c t m o del it c t m o d e l where t is the instantaneous variation of temperature and t is the scaling temperature computed as kaimal and finnigan 1994 b3 t t w u f where t w is the covariance of the temperature and the vertical wind speed

wind speed components itcw itcu were calculated similarly as described in foken et al 2012 the itc for the covariance of temperature and the vertical wind speed itctw was used to describe the turbulent conditions and was set equal to the maximum value of itct and itcw i e b5 itc tw m a x itc t itc w the itc for momentum flux itctau was estimated similarly when double rotations tanner and thurtell 1969 wilczak et al 2001 were used b6 itc tau m a x itc u itc w where the subscript u refers to the horizontal component of the wind speed i e the stream wise wind speed which is obtained after the first rotation combining the quality grades resulting from both tests an overall quality grade system allows to assess the quality of the data such a grade value of 1 denotes the best quality while 9 indicates the worst overall quality table b1 foken et al 2004 based on this procedure the energy fluxes were calculated here only with good quality measurements corresponding to restrictive overall quality grades 3 foken and wichura 1996 foken et al 2012 on the other hand to ensure a turbulent condition when analyzing the carbon flux f co2 the friction velocity u f was set to exceed the threshold value of 0 2 m s 1 because higher u f values are associated with better air mix b 2 corrections and filtering procedures adopted in the easyflux dl the data processing and the fluxes calculation were carried out with the easyflux dl software the corrections and the filters applied by the software are summarized in table b2 appendix c estimation of the liquid water content

1847,mitigation of localized pluvial flooding is one of the major resiliency goals in urban environments and green stormwater infrastructure gsi has the potential to deliver such an outcome however there is a lack of systematic approaches to prioritize investment in different candidate areas this study provides a framework to identify vulnerable stormwater drainage inlets and their contributing areas prioritize them identify dominant factors in their selection assess the potential of gsi in mitigating their overflows and compare the impact and its cost to gray infrastructure upgrade alternatives using swmm 5 1 013 decision trees and a volumetric based assessment of gsi overflow capture we applied the framework to the city of dallas texas for three design storms with three gsi practices bioretention cells raingardens and rainwater harvesting tanks results showed that there was a significant increase in the number of overflowing stormwater drainage inlets referred to as hotspots and their contributing subwatersheds referred to as opportunity areas with more intense storms especially in problematic watersheds also prioritization results provided a series of maps to rank the opportunity areas based on overflow severity recurrence of the overflows and gsi availability moreover classification results showed that inlet features especially the inlet depth were the dominant factors in the identification of the non problematic inlets finally the gsi impact assessment showed substantial overflow mitigation even at the very high severity levels when gsi is comprehensively deployed across opportunity areas despite gray infrastructure upgrades yielding higher reduction levels their cost per cubic meter was higher than gsi therefore a combination of gsi and gray results in maximum overflow reduction at a lower cost compared to common practices keywords green stormwater infrastructure localized inlet pluvial flooding opportunity subwatersheds stormwater investment prioritization resilient urban watershed planning data availability due to contractual agreements the collected network data and numerical models cannot be publicly shared the remaining supplementary data is publicly accessible see acknowledgments section 1 introduction non tropical and severe floods accounted for 20 of the damage and 45 of the frequency of natural disasters in the u s between 1980 and 2011 smith and katz 2013 the severity and frequency of the damages have been progressively exacerbated due to climate change impacts on precipitation and extreme

combined total of 14 flood disasters ncei 2020 pluvial and localized urban flooding is one of the common flooding categories in urban settings rosenzweig et al 2018 see 2019 this category of flood risk accounts for about one third of flood risk exposure in the united kingdom houston et al 2011 specifically drainage inlet flooding which happens when the capacity of the stormwater inlet does not meet the volume and intensity of runoff or when runoff cannot effectively be routed to the inlet is one of the forms of such flooding bulti and abebe 2020 palla et al 2018 one increasingly popular solution to mitigate the increased flooding hazard within an urban setting is to reintroduce natural infiltration elements in the form of green stormwater infrastructure gsi into urban planning and design to decrease the effects of runoff from impervious surfaces by recreating or imitating the natural hydrological processes of the land such as soil infiltration and detention eakin et al 2021

especially stormwater inlet flooding has a growing interest concern in different metropolitan areas in the u s and many officials are looking into an array of solutions including gsi to address it green et al 2021 heidari et al 2022a at the same time there is a growing body of literature on gsi impact assessment and site prioritization with respect to flooding and stormwater capture at large scales garcia cuerva et al 2018 presented a framework that places gsi in pre identified marginalized communities and assessed the impact on peak flow and total runoff for different gsi scenarios in the walnut creek watershed in raleigh north carolina omitaomu et al 2021 proposed a gsi placement framework based on the likelihood of flood events and established a gsi prioritization scheme which was applied to the city of knoxville tennessee their analysis used projected precipitation data and knowledge of existing flood zones li et al 2020 proposed a methodology to identify priority areas to

implementation lucas and sample 2015 compared the gsi performance during cso events in a case study area and determined that gsi provides a more sustainable alternative to gray infrastructure options haghighatafshar et al 2019 introduced a hybrid modeling concept to simulate flooding cost and action cost of blue green infrastructure bgi and conventional urban sewers in a multi objective optimization algorithm applied to selected sub catchments in malmö sweden to understand the bigger picture of the modeling studies conducted to simulate the impact of gsi at large scales bell et al 2020 compiled an up to date review of the literature to assess how gsi implementation correlates with stormwater peak flow and runoff reduction the ultimate goal of this study is similar to some of the aforementioned studies in the sense that it identifies opportunity areas for small gsi practices rainwater harvesting cisterns rain gardens and bioretention cells that can be effectively implemented to mitigate stormwater inlet flooding where existing gray infrastructure traditional stormwater infrastructure such as gutters drains and pipes is under capacity for design storms however none of the aforementioned studies provided a wholistic prioritization framework at a city scale to identify opportunity investment areas based on inlet overflow numerical simulations analyze the contributing factors and comparatively present gsi vs gray infrastructure mitigation capacities and costs therefore this study contributes to the existing body of literature from several perspectives identification of stormwater inlet flooding and opportunity subwatersheds this study uses computational simulation to identify overflowing stormwater drainage inlets during design storms which contribute significantly to the entire concept of pluvial flooding and the investment areas subwatersheds prioritizing and classification of opportunity areas the study presents a framework to prioritize the identified areas with the goal of mitigating inlet flooding using several metrics the severity and frequency recurrence of inlets that overflow during different design storms and availability of areas for gsi implementation to mitigate the inlet flooding the study also provides classification metrics to identify how the network and subwatershed features affect the chances of an inlet overflowing or a watershed being identified as an opportunity subwatershed gsi impact assessment and gray vs green comparison the study further analyzes the impact of gsi on the mitigation of stormwater inlet flooding at a city level and compares its effectiveness and cost to the alternative gray infrastructure options essentially this study is providing an answer to a research question that traditionally was viewed as an optimization problem with maximization of overflow reduction and minimization of cost serving as objectives however the decision space and consequently the spatial constraints are not clearly defined on the onset of the problem therefore the study not only identified the decision space and spatial constrains but also provides a comparative analysis to assess the impacts of two sets of solutions i e green and gray infrastructure solutions 2 case study and methodology the dallas fort worth metroplex is one of the fastest growing areas in the united states with

and the federal emergency management agency fema the watersheds were then further delineated based on elevation and stormwater inlet network using arcgis 10 7 1 esri inc hydrology toolset areas with a substantial portion of their encompassing subwatersheds outside the city boundaries areas with restricted access to their drainage network data and areas with missing or limited drainage network data were excluded from this study eventually a total of 479 km2 53 of the area within the city limits and 79 of all the inlets was analyzed in this study for a breakdown of the analyzed area within different watersheds in this study see appendix 1 table a1 3 methods the proposed framework in this study allows decision makers to understand the behavior of their drainage network and to implement gsi to avoid stormwater inlet flooding accordingly the framework consists of three main parts see fig 2 a identification of stormwater inlet hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds b determination of prioritized areas and the contributing factors to the identification and prioritization results c assessment of the effectiveness and cost of gsi investment and comparison to those of gray infrastructure alternatives in the following sections we further elaborate on the purpose and role of each step within the proposed framework 3 1 hotspots and opportunity subwatershed this section is aimed to identify the drainage inlets prone to stormwater overflow referred to as hotspots from their contributing subwatersheds referred to as opportunity subwatersheds 3 1 1 data collection in this study swmm 5 1 013 usepa 2015 models were developed for each watershed within the city the swmm model is one of the most commonly used urban drainage models used in the literature sañudo et al 2020 several input datasets and modeling parameters were established to construct and execute the swmm models stormwater network a digitized stormwater network file was created for each watershed the network features included information on the geographic location of the nodes the inlets and junctions of the stormwater network stormwater pipes size and length and their connectivity and inlet geometry these files were made from two primary sources each facilitated by the city of dallas water utility department manually collected stormwater engineering plats from the survey vault at the city of dallas water utilities department and pre constructed arcgis layers of the stormwater systems the manually collected stormwater network data in the plats were later digitized into arcgis esri layers and where available the city s arcgis files were used to improve on the digitized plat files digital elevation model dem dem topographic maps were used to assist the subwatershed delineation process identify the surface water routes and determine the surface elevation of inlets and channels a usgs dem with a 10 meter resolution was used for this study usgs 2021 land use land cover lulc map two land cover maps were used in this study lulc maps downloaded from usgs usgs 2016 were used to determine the imperviousness of the delineated subwatersheds higher resolution land type data showing the type of impervious lands and structures were also acquired from the trust for public land smart growth for dallas tool tpl 2018 to determine gsi implementation candidate sites see section 2 5 flowlines usgs nhd dataset usgs 2018 was used to extract the channel and river flow lines and to assign surface water flow routes in the delineation 3 1 2 data pre processing upon collection of the required data for the analysis manual drainage network data were digitized to arcgis shapefiles geoswmm toolboxes streams tech 2019 were then used to convert the shapefiles into swmm model input files the connectivity of the drainage network including channels and flowlines and their conduit slopes was checked and corrected when needed the drainage network elevation and land cover data associated with elevated highways and expressways were excluded from this study 3 1 3 watershed delineation upon preparation of land surface data and stormwater drainage data subwatersheds boundaries were delineated using the hydrology toolset in arcmap 10 7 1 the 10 m dem was used for the delineation with the d8 algorithm for flow directions mark et al 1984 also the choice of snap distance required a calibration process see section 2 3 4 for more details after the delineation process two categories of areas were excluded from the analysis areas within the system that the delineation process ignored potentially due to depressions direct contributions to channels or lack of data on the outlet drainage pour points and subwatersheds with an area less than 404 m2 as they will not present meaningful results after joining with land surface type layers such criteria resulted in 25 and 0 55 reduction in the delineated area respectively fig 3 shows the delineation results as well as the drainage network for one of the watersheds in the city for a breakdown of the subwatershed area statistics see appendix 1 table a2 3 1 4 swmm model creation and calibration as mentioned swmm models were used to identify overflowing stormwater inlets hotspots for various return period storms across the city since gsi can be implemented on vegetated areas not reflected in the scs nrcs curve number method green ampt method was used to model infiltration losses the three parameters used for green ampt were the recommended values according to swmm manual for clay soil that is most common in dallas rossman and huber 2015 additional details on the infiltration parameters can be found in appendix 2 swmm s main rainfall runoff process was used to route hydrologic flows to nodes to delineate the subwatersheds every instance of a subwatershed was assumed to contribute to an inlet in cases where multiple inlets which were close to each other could be located within one subwatershed the inlet with the lowest floor elevation was assigned as the outlet to the corresponding subwatershed the objective of the swmm model was to mimic the stormwater overflow that leads to localized pluvial stormwater inlet flooding from the contributing area the calibration process in this study was intended to identify the delineation parameters resulting in maximum delineated subwatershed areal coverage the delineation parameter was the travel distance referred to as a snap distance in section 3 1 3 from the farthest distance in a subwatershed to its outlet after an extensive trial and error process for all the watersheds the calibration results showed the use of 528 cells as the snap distance yielded maximum delineated area since the purpose of this study was to identify the overflowing nodes and estimate their overflow volumes for gsi design purposes ponding was allowed so then the overflow volumes could be computed this assumption enabled runoff depth to accumulate in an artificial column over the stormwater inlet node the resulting artificial overflow depth values were used to identify whether a node was overflowing and the overflow severity specific model parameters used within the swmm models are presented in appendix 2 3 1 5 rainfall specification three design storms were analyzed in this study 100 year storm 1 chance of occurrence within a given year 10 year storm 10 chance and 2 year storm 50 chance each lasting for 24 hours the current 24 hour rainfall data for these return period storms were obtained from noaa s atlas 14 perica et al 2018 the natural resources conservation service nrcs type iii rainfall distribution usda nrcs 2015 was used to determine the hourly precipitation rate within a 24 hour period the choice of a 100 year design storm lasting for 24 h relates to the city drainage design manual city of dallas 2019 which requires that any upgrades to the gray drainage stormwater network be designed to meet such an event thus the 100 year 1 return period storm was used as a basis to compare the overflow reductions and costs between green and gray infrastructure options in this study the 10 and 2 year design storms were also analyzed to show the potential emerging patterns across different storms 3 1 6 model simulation after trial and error the routing step to execute the swmm models was selected as 10 seconds with a variability adjustment factor of 75 to avoid numerical instability in the drainage network for the 1 d dynamic wave simulations specifically at the stormwater inlets for which the hydrographs were computed once the swmm models were executed their report files were analyzed for 36 hours after the start of the storm to determine the maximum depths at the stormwater inlets across the subwatersheds the inlets at which the maximum depth was reported to exceed the depth of the inlets at any given time during the simulations were reported as stormwater hotspots the simulations were conducted again using the swmm package in python pathirana 2018 to determine the area between the depth hydrographs and the inlet capacity which includes surcharge capacity the area represents the total overflow volume at that node upon identification of overflowing inlet hotspots opportunity subwatersheds which contribute to hotspots were subsequently identified 3 2 prioritization and contributing factors 3 2 1 prioritization to target investments subwatersheds the following priority metrics were used p sev i the severity of overflow at each stormwater inlet for design storm i i 2 10 or 100 p rec the recurrence of a subwatershed being identified as an opportunity for the three rainfall events p gsi the ratio of available gsi area within the opportunity subwatersheds from total subwatershed area p r e c s e v the averages of recurrence and severity for the most extreme design storms i e 100 year p total the average of recurrence severity for 100 year design storms and gsi area ratios for the severity prioritization p sev i five categories of overflow volumes were defined based on five quantiles i e very low low intermediate high and very high the overflow volumes were computed after deducting the inlet volume capacity from the area under the hydrograph throughout the simulation period for each inlet once the classes were identified for the prioritization a value of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 or 1 0 was assigned to opportunity subwatersheds if they were classified as very low low intermediate high and very high respectively for the recurrence prioritization p rec if a subwatershed was only identified as an opportunity for the 100 year storm it was assigned a value of 0 33 low if the subwatershed was identified as an opportunity for both 10 and 100 year storms it was assigned a value of 0 66 intermediate otherwise it was assigned a value of 1 0 high for the ratio of available gsi area within opportunity subwatersheds the areas of subwatersheds for bioretention and rain gardens were calculated see section 3 3 2 added together and then divided by the total area of the subwatersheds the ratios were then divided into five intervals to contain an equal number of observations within each and assigned values from 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 or 1 0 this metric p gsi shows the total level of potential gsi investment opportunity within a subwatershed the other metric p r e c s e v was the average of the p sev 100 severity for 100 year and recurrence p rec to show that accounting for both overflow related metrics how the opportunity subwatershed could be prioritized the last metric p total was the average of all the previously defined metrics severity for 100 year p sev 100 ratio p gsi and recurrence p rec to present an overall picture from all the defined metrics 3 2 2 classification to understand what parameters contribute to the prioritization results the prioritization results were then classified against the independent features for each subwatershed that were used in the swmm models subwatershed area subwatershed imperviousness subwatershed width subwatershed average slope and percentage of available area for gsi additionally the features related to the drainage network were also added to the classification procedure stormwater inlet depth for the contributing inlet invert elevation of the stormwater contributing inlet surcharge depth of the stormwater contributing inlet and total inlet depths including the surcharge depth the dependent parameters that were classified in this process were a subwatershed being identified as an opportunity or not for the three design storms p sev 2 100 p rec and p r e c s e v to classify the subwatersheds decision tree classifiers with a gini impurity criterion as a splitting function best splitter strategy at each node maximum depth of 7 for each tree and minimum samples of 15 within each leaf were used the python scikit learn package was used to implement and visualize the decision tree classification pedregosa et al 2011 the metrics used to analyze the classifier s performance were the f1 harmonic mean of precision and recall for each classification hand et al 2021 and the gini impurity value suthaharan 2016 the goal of the classification was to have both parameters as high as possible with a minimum of 50 for each class if such an objective within each class was not achievable after the classification a mix and match of the nearby classes e g very low and low was attempted to check whether such combinations would achieve the classification goals 3 3 comparative gsi impact assessment 3 3 1 gsi parameter specification once the opportunity subwatersheds were identified the impacts of gsi implementation within each of them were spatially evaluated with respect to three types of gsi practices bioretention areas rain gardens and rainwater harvesting cisterns while other gsi practices have the potential to offer meaningful stormwater management benefits including urban flood management tarrant regional water district 2018 epa 2020 the three practices modeled were chosen due to their cost efficiency and their ability to improve infiltration when distributed throughout urban watersheds in general the design specification of gsi systems accounts for site specific parameters such as ordinance requirements costs public acceptance native vegetation and soils for the purpose of this study uniform design specifications as described in table 1 were used for widespread implementation across all opportunity subwatersheds for more information on the general definition and design of the three gsi practices see jack et al 2021 3 3 2 gsi area identification to estimate the potential volume of runoff that could be captured by gsi in a storm event the maximum available area for each gsi practice within opportunity subwatersheds were assessed standard spatial criteria were developed for widespread implementation across all watersheds to identify the candidate opportunity sites for the gsi practices using arcgis using arcgis land type layers provided by the trust for public land tpl tpl 2018 and the city of dallas city of dallas 2020a spatial rules specified in table 2 were applied to opportunity subwatersheds to assess the total available space for gsi implementation the arcgis data included information on the total number of structures planting strips parking lots nonresidential sidewalks and medians 3 3 3 gsi impact assessment upon calculation of the maximum potential area for gsi within each opportunity subwatershed a series of spreadsheets were constructed to estimate the maximum potential in overflow volume reduction based on the aforementioned assumptions maximum storage capacity for gsi type for each opportunity subwatershed larger watersheds presented in fig 1 and at the city were calculated by equations 1 3 in the volumetric based spreadsheets 1 bioretention c a p a c i t y 10 o f p a r k s

commercial sidewalk area are the areal values see spatial criteria in table 2 3 3 4 comparison to gray infrastructure alternatives finally the cost of gsi scenarios associated with the overflow reduction within each opportunity subwatershed was estimated to do so a collection of the cost values used in the literature and experiences of practitioners from texas and washington dc was gathered to achieve a range for typical construction and maintenance costs for each gsi system considered including engineering costs for a complete list of the cost values see appendix 4 after excluding land costs using the midrange cost values assuming full volume capture by a standard design during each design storm the costs per cubic meter of overflow volume reduction on an annualized basis were calculated summarized in table 3 once gsi costs at the respective opportunity subwatersheds were calculated the costs of overflow reduction via gsi at the opportunity subwatershed watershed and the city level for each design storm were estimated on a cost per cubic meter basis next the capacity and costs per cubic meter for gsi were compared to those associated with gray infrastructure investment to reduce the overflow from the 100 year 1 return period storm the following analysis was conducted to estimate the capacity and costs of upgrades in gray stormwater to reduce overflow volumes within each opportunity subwatershed locate and determine the sizes of existing pipes in the opportunity subwatersheds leading to overflowing inlets execute the swmm models by incrementally increasing sizes for the located pipes up to the maximum diameter size of 96 in until no overflow occurs or maximum flow reduction was achieved if 100 reduction was not achieved with the maximum pipe size estimate the capital cost of improvement with gray infrastructure using unit costs calculated by averaging material and engineering fees provided by the city of dallas water utilities dwu staff email to author july 20 2020 the normalized capital costs of overflow reduction per cubic meter were then calculated and compared to those for the gsi practices although important the maintenance costs for gray infrastructure were not available and were therefore not included in the comparative analysis for both green and gray 4 results and discussions 4 1 hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds results showing the stormwater inlet hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds across the city for the three design storms are presented in fig 4 the means of recommended cumulative precipitation for the 2 10 and 100 year design storms based on noaa projections for the area are 4 6 and 9 5 in respectively results show increasing system hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds with increased return periods as expected focusing on the percentage change from the 2 to the 10 year the increase in cumulative precipitation 50 results in a 44 increase in system hotpots and 68 in the area of opportunity subwatersheds comparing the 10 and 100 year simulations results showed a 58 increase in precipitation leads to an increase of 39 in system hotpots and 45 in the area of opportunity subwatersheds also comparing the 2 and the 100 year design storms the 138 increase in precipitation results in an increase in system hotpots and opportunity subwatersheds by 100 and 145 respectively 4 2 prioritization and contributing factors fig 5 shows the severity of the overflow p sev across the hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds in the city for the three design storms it shows that opportunity subwatersheds with intermediate to very high severities are not evenly distributed across the watersheds in fact the southernmost watershed in the city i e five mile creek has the highest number of severe classes of hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds table 4 shows the breakdowns of the number of opportunity subwatersheds and hotspots and p sev the majority of opportunity subwatersheds and hotspots are located within four of the watersheds five mile joe s creek cedar creek and white rock on the other hand no opportunity subwatersheds were identified for two of the watersheds bachman and chalk hill the severity of the overflow problem for five mile and joe s creek were expected based on the correspondence with the city of dallas water utilities department a potential contributing factor is the older network in those watersheds and thus inadequate design standards that were applied to their design according to the drainage needs assessment by the city jordan 2012 joe s creek in particular has been one of the watersheds of interest for flooding research and modeling analysis vieux et al 2013 fig 6 shows prioritization results for the p rec p r e c s e v p gsi p total prioritization schemes among subwatersheds respectively fig 6a presenting the recurrence priorities p rec highlights the areas at which stormwater inlets overflow act in a more sensitive manner to the increase in the magnitude of the design storm this recurrence prioritization scheme shows how different areas within a city can be ranked if the sensitivity to increase in the design storm interval is the factor of concern fig 6b shows the subwatersheds that were ranked based on the percentage of area available for gsi implementation from the total subwatershed area p gsi fig 6c presents the subwatersheds that were ranked based on the averages of recurrence and 100 year severity of overflow at their respective outlets stormwater inlets p r e c s e v the high and very high categories in this map represent the subwatersheds identified as opportunities for all design storms and have the highest severity classes if gsi availability or lack thereof was not a factor of concern the subwatersheds with the very high high categories in this prioritization scheme were the ones demanding the greatest attention fig 6d shows the subwatersheds that were ranked based on the averages of recurrence and 100 year severity of overflow and the gsi availability area p total as the next step decision tree classifiers were used to classify the prioritization and opportunity identification results as mentioned in section 2 4 2 it is worth noting that the priorities based on the ratio of available gsi area and the total average priorities presented in fig 6d were not included in this analysis as they relate to land use characteristics and site suitability based on ordinance codes fig 7 a c show the best classification results for opportunity vs non opportunity for the 2 year 10 year and 100 year design storms the total inlet node depth i e node depth plus surcharge depth significantly contributes to the correct classification identification of non opportunity subwatersheds interestingly the classification metrics were significantly low for the opportunity subwatersheds even after applying one to three additional conditions to the trees such observations show that with the specified parameters and models it was fairly difficult to identify the opportunity subwatershed on the basis of model parameters and in the absence of model simulations but it was easier to identify those that were not an opportunity subwatershed another factor to consider is that this classification was based on a series of input and output data and doesn t constitute a causal relationship between them fig 7d f show the best classification results for p sev classes for the 2 year 10 year and 100 year design storms also if there was a possibility to combine adjacent severity classes together after classification to elevate the f 1 harmonic mean of precision and recall and gini impurity values above 50 the classes were combined and the updated tree with higher scores were constructed the results suggest the stormwater drainage inlet features specifically total node depth and node depth were the first level contributing factors to the classification process such observation re confirms that for effective classification predicting of the p sev i node depth and total node depth were the first level dominant factors additionally for the 2 year and 10 year storms a total node depth of 9 65 ft 2 94 m can reliably be used as an upper limit for predicting nodes overflowing in the very low low and intermediate severity classes in this study fig 7g and h show the best classification results for p rec and p r e c s e v for p rec classification subwatershed areas seem to appear as the first level determining factor followed by node depth and total node depth also the classification process for the latter metric was observed to be challenging as high scores were not achieved with a reasonably low number of conditions 4 3 comparative gsi impact assessment fig 8 shows the results of the gsi candidate area identification process for the 100 year opportunity subwatersheds as the most expansive coverage of opportunity subwatersheds across the city based on the identification results for the 100 year storm the candidate area for bioretention is identified at a significantly higher coverage than raingardens i e 3 6 km2 compared to 0 9 km2 also among the five types of land cover used to identify candidate areas for bioretention parking lots with 2 8 km2 80 of available space for bioretention and commercial sidewalks with 0 002 km2 0 05 of the space had the largest and lowest shares of bioretention area parks planting strips within public right of way and vegetated median have 0 55 0 15 and 0 04 km2 of candidate area with 15 4 4 2 and 1 2 of the available public space respectively moreover around 47 700 units are identified as potential structures including commercial and residential based on the volumetric estimation of the reductions in the overflow volumes using gsi implementation at the candidate locations the reductions in overflow volumes at the stormwater inlets were computed and then compared to pre gsi implementation scenarios table 5 shows the total identified areas per event as well as estimated overflow volume reduction at the city level for all the events and all the gsi candidate areas bioretention cells show the highest potential of overflow volume capture among the three gsi practices with approximately 2 4 times more overflow reductions than the combined potential captures from raingardens and rainwater cistern fig 9 also shows the results of pre gsi overflow compared to those post gsi implementation using the same overflow classification ranges the estimates show an overall reduction in the number and p sev of overflowing hotspots and thus their opportunity subwatersheds however the impact of the gsi are not equally distributed with five classes of p sev for the three design storms table 6 shows percentage reductions within each class p sev at the city level for the three design storms maximum reductions in the total number of hotspots and area of opportunity subwatersheds via gsi implementation happen with the 2 year design storm followed by the 10 year and 100 year see table 6 this pattern is consistent with the expectation that gsi is most effective with precipitations of lower magnitude however even for a 100 year storm there is an estimated 78 reduction in the number of overflowing inlets in the very high category interestingly the highest reduction in the number of hotspots post gsi implementation among the overflow categories is associated with the very high category indicating the role that gsi practices can play in locations severely affected by localized flooding regardless of the intensity of the rainfall event another important takeaway from table 6 was that although the total number of hotspots changed by no more than 17 with the gsi implementation at a city level the severity of overflow failure in the system drastically decreased suggesting that the entire drainage system is more capable of handling the intense storm moreover for all the design storms the number of hotspots in the very low category is increased such a pattern indicates that overflows from a number of hotspots in categories with higher severities have been reduced to very low in the post gsi scenario table 7 shows the results of overflow reductions and the associated cost per cubic meter summarized at the watershed level results show that deployment of gsi across all candidate locations in the opportunity subwatersheds for the 2 10 and 100 year design storms captures approximately 31 25 and 17 of the modeled overflow respectively as expected the share of overflow reduction decreases with the increase in precipitation magnitude however based on the assumptions used in this study the cost of overflow reduction was almost equal between the three design storms at a 528 per cubic meter capital cost and 634 per cubic meter with the inclusion of maintenance for a breakdown of the overflow reductions and associated costs at the watershed level see appendix 5 table a8 table 8 shows the comparative results of overflow reduction and associated costs for the gsi vs gray infrastructure options based on the assumptions and models used in this study the results show that gsi is a cost effective solution on a per cubic meter basis to mitigate overflow in each watershed compared to gray infrastructure upgrade i e pipe size increase 5 3 102 4 8 101 m3 for gsi compared to 2 8 103 8 6 101 m3 for gray on the other hand based on the scope of the models and assumptions used in this study gray infrastructure seems to mitigate more overflow at the city level 34 3 28 2 for gray compared to 17 4 4 4 for gsi the results suggest that 100 year overflow cannot be eliminated with any of the two infrastructure options alone therefore combining the two solutions yielded a 41 5 reduction in the overflow volume at the city level at 1 9 103 m3 which was a higher reduction than the solutions therefore the results suggest that the two categories of infrastructure need to be combined to achieve the maximum possible reduction at the lowest possible cost for a comparative breakdown of the overflow captures and associated costs for gsi vs gray infrastructure at the watershed level see appendix 5 table a9 5 conclusions this study presented a framework that identifies stormwater inlet flooding hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds contributing to them for three designs storms 2 50 10 10 and 100 year 1 24 hour storms using epa swmm 5 1 013 followed by a spatial analysis to prioritize investment in the drainage system and application of decision trees to classify the identified hotspots and areas finally the study provides an assessment of the maximum potential impact of three gsi practices bioretention rain gardens and rainwater harvesting cisterns on overflow reduction at the watershed and city levels it also compares the overflow reduction potentials as well as their costs to those associated with upgrading the gray infrastructure system the results were specific to the city of dallas case study however the methodology and framework can be applied to any other urban area where sufficient data as described in section 2 exists the hotspot and opportunity subwatershed identification results show that for the three design storms of interest in this study the increase in the return period resulted in a substantial increase in the number of hotspots and opportunity subwatershed across the city this part of the study was particularly in the interest of local decision makers as it provided a roadmap to guide investment and attention into certain areas in the city the prioritization results provide an array of decision making spatial maps to prioritize investment in gsi practices or gray infrastructure upgrades across a city based on the severity of overflow at each identified inlet recurrence of overflow after the three design storms gsi availability and averages of the mentioned metrics decision tree classifiers also show that stormwater inlet features specifically total depth play an important role in the classification identification of non problematic inlets the gsi impact analysis results show that if deployed in all identified opportunity areas approximately 31 25 and 17 of overflows resulting from the executed 2 10 and 100 year storms respectively could be reduced at an average cost of approximately 6 3 102 m3 this substantial level of reduction was a promising assessment and was mostly associated with the bioretention implementation also gsi implementation offers a reduction of up to 78 in the number of overflowing nodes in the very high severity class across the city therefore gsi implementation shows potential in directing the drainage system to respond to severe rainfall events in a resilient manner by reducing the overflow severities finally by comparing the overflow reduction capacities and costs results show that gsi practices at the city level were approximately 77 less costly on a per cubic meter basis than gray infrastructure upgrades for the 100 year design storm however more overflow can be captured with gray infrastructure upgrades compared to gsi interestingly the combined solution of green and gray offers the highest overflow reduction at approximately 45 1 reduction for the 100 year design storm and at a lower cost per cubic meter than gray alone which proved to be another point of interest for the local decision makers 6 recommendation and future research a major future step to complement this study is the addition of real world observation data on pluvial flooding and overflowing inlets during intense rainfalls by doing so the simulation results showing the overflowing nodes can be calibrated against real world observation and can be used to predict the system s behavior against future events the utilization of monitoring stations or crowdsourced methods to collect such data at a city scale is among the methods that could allow better understanding of the response of stormwater drainage networks in a real world urban setting further investigation of the impact of climate change projections and their uncertainties on rainfall is a very important next step that can further improve the understanding of the drainage system resiliency to future events furthermore the projection of land use and urban configuration might take futuristic analysis closer to reality additionally the application of 2 d overflow modeling to assess the localized pluvial flooding resulting from inlet overflow can guide decision making for emergency response and traffic routing assistance during extreme rainfall events such an analysis requires a higher resolution of land cover data and consequently higher computational requirements and resources compared to the ones used in this study this analysis focused solely on inlet pluvial flooding and did not investigate riverine flooding which has been the most common area of research and analysis in the hydrology realm as a result the addition of riverine flooding to the analysis would further improve understanding of the response of the urban system to the general flooding phenomenon furthermore conducting the same analysis but with a distributed hydrological model that can operate at a higher spatial resolution scale can further improve the understanding of surface water routing prior to stormwater reaching the drainage network as well as gsi effectiveness at the site additional high level resolutions of soil data missing drainage network data and other stormwater capture infrastructure data would help understand the high resolution real world dynamics of stormwater in the urban land cover finally the addition of socio economic metrics e g social vulnerability or equity land use and other planning objectives into the prioritization scheme would further elaborate on how the hydrological factors can assist in directing investment in marginalized communities by analyzing the citywide patterns between aforementioned metrics and the severity of overflow research questions around the under investments to alleviate urban flooding can be investigated and future plans can be made with consideration of the social impacts and consequences declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

share of planting strips based on the following guidelines from section 51a 10 125 of article x in the city of dallas code of ordinances city of dallas 2018 and seattle department of transportation n d a 1 5 m buffer assumption from utility poles vaults fire hydrant and meters was used for gsi implementation in planting strips also based on a gsi project in king county wa usa king county 2017 in this project we assumed the entire width of the planting strips could be allocated to bioretention cells eighteen blocks within the five mile watershed were sampled for each of their sidewalks widths and lengths their planting strips widths and lengths and the suitable lengths of the planting strips that satisfy the buffer requirements were calculated by doing so the ratios of planting strip length to the length and planting strip suitable for bioretention after satisfying buffer requirements to sidewalk lengths were determined finally by applying an adjustment factor of 0 5 assuming only 50 of the planting strip area was used for bioretention cells with our design specifics the final recommended ratio for the ratio of candidate area for bioretention cells implementation to the planter strip areas after satisfying the buffer requirement and adjustment factors was determined to be 0 35 for more information on the sidewalks sw and planting strips ps sampling analysis see table a4

1847,mitigation of localized pluvial flooding is one of the major resiliency goals in urban environments and green stormwater infrastructure gsi has the potential to deliver such an outcome however there is a lack of systematic approaches to prioritize investment in different candidate areas this study provides a framework to identify vulnerable stormwater drainage inlets and their contributing areas prioritize them identify dominant factors in their selection assess the potential of gsi in mitigating their overflows and compare the impact and its cost to gray infrastructure upgrade alternatives using swmm 5 1 013 decision trees and a volumetric based assessment of gsi overflow capture we applied the framework to the city of dallas texas for three design storms with three gsi practices bioretention cells raingardens and rainwater harvesting tanks results showed that there was a significant increase in the number of overflowing stormwater drainage inlets referred to as hotspots and their contributing subwatersheds referred to as opportunity areas with more intense storms especially in problematic watersheds also prioritization results provided a series of maps to rank the opportunity areas based on overflow severity recurrence of the overflows and gsi availability moreover classification results showed that inlet features especially the inlet depth were the dominant factors in the identification of the non problematic inlets finally the gsi impact assessment showed substantial overflow mitigation even at the very high severity levels when gsi is comprehensively deployed across opportunity areas despite gray infrastructure upgrades yielding higher reduction levels their cost per cubic meter was higher than gsi therefore a combination of gsi and gray results in maximum overflow reduction at a lower cost compared to common practices keywords green stormwater infrastructure localized inlet pluvial flooding opportunity subwatersheds

remaining supplementary data is publicly accessible see acknowledgments section 1 introduction non tropical and severe floods accounted for 20 of the damage and 45 of the frequency of natural disasters in the u s between 1980 and 2011 smith and katz 2013 the severity and frequency of the damages have been progressively exacerbated due to climate change impacts on precipitation and extreme weather martinich and crimmins 2019 in the last decade the united states has had 18 non hurricane inland flood disasters costing roughly 4 6 billion per event whereas the previous three decades have a combined total of 14 flood disasters ncei 2020 pluvial and localized urban flooding is one of the common flooding categories in urban settings rosenzweig et al 2018 see 2019 this category of flood risk accounts for about one third of flood risk exposure in the united kingdom houston et al 2011 specifically drainage inlet flooding which happens when the capacity of the stormwater inlet does not meet the volume and intensity of runoff or when runoff cannot effectively be routed to the inlet is one of the forms of such flooding bulti and abebe 2020 palla et al 2018 one increasingly popular solution to mitigate the increased flooding hazard within an urban setting is to reintroduce natural infiltration elements in the form of green stormwater infrastructure gsi into urban planning and design to decrease the effects of runoff from impervious surfaces by recreating or imitating the natural hydrological processes of the land such as soil infiltration and detention eakin et al 2021 gill et al 2007 hua et al 2020 huang et al 2020 li et al 2020 mcphillips et al 2020 mei et al 2018 gsi practices in addition to runoff management have the potential to offer an array of benefits to

especially stormwater inlet flooding has a growing interest concern in different metropolitan areas in the u s and many officials are looking into an array of solutions including gsi to address it green et al 2021 heidari et al 2022a at the same time there is a growing body of literature on gsi impact assessment and site prioritization with respect to flooding and stormwater capture at large scales garcia cuerva et al 2018 presented a framework that places gsi in pre identified marginalized communities and assessed the impact on peak flow and total runoff for different gsi scenarios in the walnut creek watershed in raleigh north carolina omitaomu et al 2021 proposed a gsi placement framework based on the likelihood of flood events and established a gsi prioritization scheme which was applied to the city of knoxville tennessee their analysis used projected precipitation data and knowledge of existing flood zones li et al 2020 proposed a methodology to identify priority areas to place gi in the city of ghent belgium their multi dimensional analysis focused on pluvial flood risk prone areas based on prior maps and didn t delve into the analysis of the impacts of the gsi implementation lucas and sample 2015 compared the gsi performance during cso events in a case study area and determined that gsi provides a more sustainable alternative to gray infrastructure options haghighatafshar et al 2019 introduced a hybrid modeling concept to simulate flooding cost and action cost of blue green infrastructure bgi and conventional urban sewers in a multi objective optimization algorithm applied to selected sub catchments in malmö sweden to understand the bigger picture of the modeling studies conducted to simulate the impact of gsi at large scales bell et al 2020 compiled an up to date review of the literature to assess how gsi implementation correlates with stormwater peak flow and runoff reduction the ultimate goal of this study is similar to some of the aforementioned studies in the sense that it identifies opportunity areas for small gsi practices rainwater harvesting cisterns rain gardens and bioretention cells that can be effectively implemented to mitigate stormwater inlet flooding where existing gray infrastructure traditional stormwater infrastructure such as gutters drains and pipes is under capacity for design storms however none of the aforementioned studies provided a wholistic prioritization framework at a city scale to identify opportunity investment areas based on inlet overflow numerical simulations analyze the contributing factors and comparatively present gsi vs gray infrastructure mitigation capacities and costs therefore this study contributes to the existing body of literature from several perspectives identification of stormwater inlet flooding and opportunity subwatersheds this study uses computational simulation to identify overflowing stormwater drainage inlets during design storms which contribute significantly to the entire concept of pluvial flooding and the investment areas subwatersheds prioritizing and classification of opportunity areas the study presents a framework to prioritize the identified areas with the goal of mitigating inlet flooding using several metrics the severity and frequency recurrence of inlets that overflow during different design storms and availability of areas for gsi implementation to mitigate the inlet flooding the study also provides classification metrics to identify how the network and subwatershed features affect the chances of an inlet overflowing or a watershed being identified as an opportunity subwatershed gsi impact assessment and gray vs green comparison the study further analyzes the impact of gsi on the mitigation of stormwater inlet flooding at a city level and compares its effectiveness and cost to the alternative gray infrastructure options essentially this study is providing an answer to a research question that traditionally was viewed as an optimization problem with maximization of overflow reduction and minimization of cost serving as objectives however the decision space and consequently the spatial constraints are not clearly defined on the onset of the problem therefore the study not only identified the decision space and spatial constrains but also provides a comparative analysis to assess the impacts of two sets of solutions i e green and gray infrastructure solutions 2 case study and methodology the dallas fort worth metroplex is one of the fastest growing areas in the united states with dallas having a population of 1 3 million and rising u s census bureau 2020 the area was hit by several intense storms in the past few years most notably in august 2022 with a magnitude of a historical proportion dey and douglas 2022 due to more intense rain events happening in the area there is a growing interest in understanding pluvial flooding and investing in the drainage infrastructure along with these objectives safaei moghadam et al 2022 evaluated the potential for pluvial flood prediction using crowdsourced navigation apps and depression based digital elevation model dem analysis at the road segments with surface depression defined as the difference between the raw dem and the smoothed dem for hydrologic modeling lindsay and dhun 2015 in the city of dallas this study focuses on the city of dallas with an area of about 901 km2 the city was analyzed using a bottom up approach by first dividing the city into ten watersheds see fig 1 as defined by the city and the federal emergency management agency fema the watersheds were then further delineated based on elevation and stormwater inlet network using arcgis 10 7 1 esri inc hydrology toolset areas with a substantial portion of their encompassing subwatersheds outside the city boundaries areas with restricted access to their drainage network data and areas with missing or limited drainage network data were excluded from this study eventually a total of 479 km2 53 of the area within the city limits and 79 of all the inlets was analyzed in this study for a breakdown of the analyzed area within different watersheds in this study see appendix 1 table a1 3 methods the proposed framework in this study allows decision makers to understand the behavior of their drainage network and to implement gsi to avoid stormwater inlet flooding accordingly the framework consists of three main parts see fig 2 a identification of stormwater inlet hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds b determination of prioritized areas and the contributing factors to the identification and prioritization results c assessment of the effectiveness and cost of gsi investment and comparison to those of gray infrastructure alternatives in the following sections we further elaborate on the purpose and role of each step within the proposed framework 3 1 hotspots and opportunity subwatershed this section is aimed to identify the drainage inlets prone to stormwater overflow referred to as hotspots from their contributing subwatersheds referred to as opportunity subwatersheds 3 1 1 data collection in this study swmm 5 1 013 usepa 2015 models were developed for each watershed within the city the swmm model is one of the most commonly used urban drainage models used in the literature sañudo et al 2020 several input datasets and modeling parameters were established to construct and execute the swmm models stormwater network a digitized stormwater network file was created for each watershed the network features included information on the geographic location of the nodes the inlets and junctions of the stormwater network stormwater pipes size and length and their connectivity and inlet geometry these files were made from two primary sources each facilitated by the city of dallas water utility department manually collected stormwater engineering plats from the survey vault at the city of dallas water utilities department and pre constructed arcgis layers of the stormwater systems the manually collected stormwater network data in the plats were later digitized into arcgis esri layers and where available the city s arcgis files were used to improve on the digitized plat files digital elevation model dem dem topographic maps were used to assist the subwatershed delineation process identify the surface water routes and determine the surface elevation of inlets and channels a usgs dem with a 10 meter resolution was used for this study usgs 2021 land use land cover lulc map two land cover maps were used in this study lulc maps downloaded from usgs usgs 2016 were used to determine the imperviousness of the delineated subwatersheds higher resolution land type data showing the type of impervious lands and structures were also acquired from the trust for public land smart growth for dallas tool tpl 2018 to determine gsi implementation candidate sites see section 2 5 flowlines usgs nhd dataset usgs 2018 was used to extract the channel and river flow lines and to assign surface water flow routes in the delineation 3 1 2 data pre processing upon collection of the required data for the analysis manual drainage network data were digitized to arcgis shapefiles geoswmm toolboxes streams tech 2019 were then used to convert the shapefiles into swmm model input files the connectivity of the drainage network including channels and flowlines and their conduit slopes was checked and corrected when needed the drainage network elevation and land cover data associated with elevated highways and expressways were excluded from this study 3 1 3 watershed delineation upon preparation of land surface data and stormwater drainage data subwatersheds boundaries were delineated using the hydrology toolset in arcmap 10 7 1 the 10 m dem was used for the delineation with the d8 algorithm for flow directions mark et al 1984 also the choice of snap distance required a calibration process see section 2 3 4 for more details after the delineation process two categories of areas were excluded from the analysis areas within the system that the delineation process ignored potentially due to depressions direct contributions to channels or lack of data on the outlet drainage pour points and subwatersheds with an area less than 404 m2 as they will not present meaningful results after joining with land surface type layers such criteria resulted in 25 and 0 55 reduction in the delineated area respectively fig 3 shows the delineation results as well as the drainage network for one of the watersheds in the city for a breakdown of the subwatershed area statistics see appendix 1 table a2 3 1 4 swmm model creation and calibration as mentioned swmm models were used to identify overflowing stormwater inlets hotspots for various return period storms across the city since gsi can be implemented on vegetated areas not reflected in the scs nrcs curve number method green ampt method was used to model infiltration losses the three parameters used for green ampt were the recommended values according to swmm manual for clay soil that is most common in dallas rossman and huber 2015 additional details on the infiltration parameters can be found in appendix 2 swmm s main rainfall runoff process was used to route hydrologic flows to nodes to delineate the subwatersheds every instance of a subwatershed was assumed to contribute to an inlet in cases where multiple inlets which were close to each other could be located within one subwatershed the inlet with the lowest floor elevation was assigned as the outlet to the corresponding subwatershed the objective of the swmm model was to mimic the stormwater overflow that leads to localized pluvial stormwater inlet flooding from the contributing area the calibration process in this study was intended to identify the delineation parameters resulting in maximum delineated subwatershed areal coverage the delineation parameter was the travel distance referred to as a snap distance in section 3 1 3 from the farthest distance in a subwatershed to its outlet after an extensive trial and error process for all the watersheds the calibration results showed the use of 528 cells as the snap distance yielded maximum delineated area since the purpose of this study was to identify the overflowing nodes and estimate their overflow volumes for gsi design purposes ponding was allowed so then the overflow volumes could be computed this assumption enabled runoff depth to accumulate in an artificial column over the stormwater inlet node the resulting artificial overflow depth values were used to identify whether a node was overflowing and the overflow severity specific model parameters used within the swmm models are presented in appendix 2 3 1 5 rainfall specification three design storms were analyzed in this study 100 year storm 1 chance of occurrence within a given year 10 year storm 10 chance and 2 year storm 50 chance each lasting for 24 hours the current 24 hour rainfall data for these return period storms were obtained from noaa s atlas 14 perica et al 2018 the natural resources conservation service nrcs type iii rainfall distribution usda nrcs 2015 was used to determine the hourly precipitation rate within a 24 hour period the choice of a 100 year design storm lasting for 24 h relates to the city drainage design manual city of dallas 2019 which requires that any upgrades to the gray drainage stormwater network be designed to meet such an event thus the 100 year 1 return period storm was used as a basis to compare the overflow reductions and costs between green and gray infrastructure options in this study the 10 and 2 year design storms were also analyzed to show the potential emerging patterns across different storms 3 1 6 model simulation after trial and error the routing step to execute the swmm models was selected as 10 seconds with a variability adjustment factor of 75 to avoid numerical instability in the drainage network for the 1 d dynamic wave simulations specifically at the stormwater inlets for which the hydrographs were computed once the swmm models were executed their report files were analyzed for 36 hours after the start of the storm to determine the maximum depths at the stormwater inlets across the subwatersheds the inlets at which the maximum depth was reported to exceed the depth of the inlets at any given time during the simulations were reported as stormwater hotspots the simulations were conducted again using the swmm package in python pathirana 2018 to determine the area between the depth hydrographs and the inlet capacity which includes surcharge capacity the area represents the total overflow volume at that node upon identification of overflowing inlet hotspots opportunity subwatersheds which contribute to hotspots were subsequently identified 3 2 prioritization and contributing factors 3 2 1 prioritization to target investments subwatersheds the following priority metrics were used p sev i the severity of overflow at each stormwater inlet for design storm i i 2 10 or 100 p rec the recurrence of a subwatershed being identified as an opportunity for the three rainfall events p gsi the ratio of available gsi area within the opportunity subwatersheds from total subwatershed area p r e c s e v the averages of recurrence and severity for the most extreme design storms i e 100 year p total the average of recurrence severity for 100 year design storms and gsi area ratios for the severity prioritization p sev i five categories of overflow volumes were defined based on five quantiles i e very low low intermediate high and very high the overflow volumes were computed after deducting the inlet volume capacity from the area under the hydrograph throughout the simulation period for each inlet once the classes were identified for the prioritization a value of 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 or 1 0 was assigned to opportunity subwatersheds if they were classified as very low low intermediate high and very high respectively for the recurrence prioritization p rec if a subwatershed was only identified as an opportunity for the 100 year storm it was assigned a value of 0 33 low if the subwatershed was identified as an opportunity for both 10 and 100 year storms it was assigned a value of 0 66 intermediate otherwise it was assigned a value of 1 0 high for the ratio of available gsi area within opportunity subwatersheds the areas of subwatersheds for bioretention and rain gardens were calculated see section 3 3 2 added together and then divided by the total area of the subwatersheds the ratios were then divided into five intervals to contain an equal number of observations within each and assigned values from 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 or 1 0 this metric p gsi shows the total level of potential gsi investment opportunity within a subwatershed the other metric p r e c s e v was the average of the p sev 100 severity for 100 year and recurrence p rec to show that accounting for both overflow related metrics how the opportunity subwatershed could be prioritized the last metric p total was the average of all the previously defined metrics severity for 100 year p sev 100 ratio p gsi and recurrence p rec to present an overall picture from all the defined metrics 3 2 2 classification to understand what parameters contribute to the prioritization results the prioritization results were then classified against the independent features for each subwatershed that were used in the swmm models subwatershed area subwatershed imperviousness subwatershed width subwatershed average slope and percentage of available area for gsi additionally the features related to the drainage network were also added to the classification procedure stormwater inlet depth for the contributing inlet invert elevation of the stormwater contributing inlet surcharge depth of the stormwater contributing inlet and total inlet depths including the surcharge depth the dependent parameters that were classified in this process were a subwatershed being identified as an opportunity or not for the three design storms p sev 2 100 p rec and p r e c s e v to classify the subwatersheds decision tree classifiers with a gini impurity criterion as a splitting function best splitter strategy at each node maximum depth of 7 for each tree and minimum samples of 15 within each leaf were used the python scikit learn package was used to implement and visualize the decision tree classification pedregosa et al 2011 the metrics used to analyze the classifier s performance were the f1 harmonic mean of precision and recall for each classification hand et al 2021 and the gini impurity value suthaharan 2016 the goal of the classification was to have both parameters as high as possible with a minimum of 50 for each class if such an objective within each class was not achievable after the classification a mix and match of the nearby classes e g very low and low was attempted to check whether such combinations would achieve the classification goals 3 3 comparative gsi impact assessment 3 3 1 gsi parameter specification once the opportunity subwatersheds were identified the impacts of gsi implementation within each of them were spatially evaluated with respect to three types of gsi practices bioretention areas rain gardens and rainwater harvesting cisterns while other gsi practices have the potential to offer meaningful stormwater management benefits including urban flood management tarrant regional water district 2018 epa 2020 the three practices modeled were chosen due to their cost efficiency and their ability to improve infiltration when distributed throughout urban watersheds in general the design specification of gsi systems accounts for site specific parameters such as ordinance requirements costs public acceptance native vegetation and soils for the purpose of this study uniform design specifications as described in table 1 were used for widespread implementation across all opportunity subwatersheds for more information on the general definition and design of the three gsi practices see jack et al 2021 3 3 2 gsi area identification to estimate the potential volume of runoff that could be captured by gsi in a storm event the maximum available area for each gsi practice within opportunity subwatersheds were assessed standard spatial criteria were developed for widespread implementation across all watersheds to identify the candidate opportunity sites for the gsi practices using arcgis using arcgis land type layers provided by the trust for public land tpl tpl 2018 and the city of dallas city of dallas 2020a spatial rules specified in table 2 were applied to opportunity subwatersheds to assess the total available space for gsi implementation the arcgis data included information on the total number of structures planting strips parking lots nonresidential sidewalks and medians 3 3 3 gsi impact assessment upon calculation of the maximum potential area for gsi within each opportunity subwatershed a series of spreadsheets were constructed to estimate the maximum potential in overflow volume reduction based on the aforementioned assumptions maximum storage capacity for gsi type for each opportunity subwatershed larger watersheds presented in fig 1 and at the city were calculated by equations 1 3 in the volumetric based spreadsheets 1 bioretention c a p a c i t y 10 o f p a r k s

commercial sidewalk area are the areal values see spatial criteria in table 2 3 3 4 comparison to gray infrastructure alternatives finally the cost of gsi scenarios associated with the overflow reduction within each opportunity subwatershed was estimated to do so a collection of the cost values used in the literature and experiences of practitioners from texas and washington dc was gathered to achieve a range for typical construction and maintenance costs for each gsi system considered including engineering costs for a complete list of the cost values see appendix 4 after excluding land costs using the midrange cost values assuming full volume capture by a standard design during each design storm the costs per cubic meter of overflow volume reduction on an annualized basis were calculated summarized in table 3 once gsi costs at the respective opportunity subwatersheds were calculated the costs of overflow reduction via gsi at the opportunity subwatershed watershed and the city level for each design storm were estimated on a cost per cubic meter basis next the capacity and costs per cubic meter for gsi were compared to those associated with gray infrastructure investment to reduce the overflow from the 100 year 1 return period storm the following analysis was conducted to estimate the capacity and costs of upgrades in gray stormwater to reduce overflow volumes within each opportunity subwatershed locate and determine the sizes of existing pipes in the opportunity subwatersheds leading to overflowing inlets execute the swmm models by incrementally increasing sizes for the located pipes up to the maximum diameter size of 96 in until no overflow occurs or maximum flow reduction was achieved if 100 reduction was not achieved with the maximum pipe size estimate the capital cost of improvement with gray infrastructure using unit costs calculated by averaging material and engineering fees provided by the city of dallas water utilities dwu staff email to author july 20 2020 the normalized capital costs of overflow reduction per cubic meter were then calculated and compared to those for the gsi practices although important the maintenance costs for gray infrastructure were not available and were therefore not included in the comparative analysis for both green and gray 4 results and discussions 4 1 hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds results showing the stormwater inlet hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds across the city for the three design storms are presented in fig 4 the means of recommended cumulative precipitation for the 2 10 and 100 year design storms based on noaa projections for the area are 4 6 and 9 5 in respectively results show increasing system hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds with increased return periods as expected focusing on the percentage change from the 2 to the 10 year the increase in cumulative precipitation 50 results in a 44 increase in system hotpots and 68 in the area of opportunity subwatersheds comparing the 10 and 100 year simulations results showed a 58 increase in precipitation leads to an increase of 39 in system hotpots and 45 in the area of opportunity subwatersheds also comparing the 2 and the 100 year design storms the 138 increase in precipitation results in an increase in system hotpots and opportunity subwatersheds by 100 and 145 respectively 4 2 prioritization and contributing factors fig 5 shows the severity of the overflow p sev across the hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds in the city for the three design storms it shows that opportunity subwatersheds with intermediate to very high severities are not evenly distributed across the watersheds in fact the southernmost watershed in the city i e five mile creek has the highest number of severe classes of hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds table 4 shows the breakdowns of the number of opportunity subwatersheds and hotspots and p sev the majority of opportunity subwatersheds and hotspots are located within four of the watersheds five mile joe s creek cedar creek and white rock on the other hand no opportunity subwatersheds were identified for two of the watersheds bachman and chalk hill the severity of the overflow problem for five mile and joe s creek were expected based on the correspondence with the city of dallas water utilities department a potential contributing factor is the older network in those watersheds and thus inadequate design standards that were applied to their design according to the drainage needs assessment by the city jordan 2012 joe s creek in particular has been one of the watersheds of interest for flooding research and modeling analysis vieux et al 2013 fig 6 shows prioritization results for the p rec p r e c s e v p gsi p total prioritization schemes among subwatersheds respectively fig 6a presenting the recurrence priorities p rec highlights the areas at which stormwater inlets overflow act in a more sensitive manner to the increase in the magnitude of the design storm this recurrence prioritization scheme shows how different areas within a city can be ranked if the sensitivity to increase in the design storm interval is the factor of concern fig 6b shows the subwatersheds that were ranked based on the percentage of area available for gsi implementation from the total subwatershed area p gsi fig 6c presents the subwatersheds that were ranked based on the averages of recurrence and 100 year severity of overflow at their respective outlets stormwater inlets p r e c s e v the high and very high categories in this map represent the subwatersheds identified as opportunities for all design storms and have the highest severity classes if gsi availability or lack thereof was not a factor of concern the subwatersheds with the very high high categories in this prioritization scheme were the ones demanding the greatest attention fig 6d shows the subwatersheds that were ranked based on the averages of recurrence and 100 year severity of overflow and the gsi availability area p total as the next step decision tree classifiers were used to classify the prioritization and opportunity identification results as mentioned in section 2 4 2 it is worth noting that the priorities based on the ratio of available gsi area and the total average priorities presented in fig 6d were not included in this analysis as they relate to land use characteristics and site suitability based on ordinance codes fig 7 a c show the best classification results for opportunity vs non opportunity for the 2 year 10 year and 100 year design storms the total inlet node depth i e node depth plus surcharge depth significantly contributes to the correct classification identification of non opportunity subwatersheds interestingly the classification metrics were significantly low for the opportunity subwatersheds even after applying one to three additional conditions to the trees such observations show that with the specified parameters and models it was fairly difficult to identify the opportunity subwatershed on the basis of model parameters and in the absence of model simulations but it was easier to identify those that were not an opportunity subwatershed another factor to consider is that this classification was based on a series of input and output data and doesn t constitute a causal relationship between them fig 7d f show the best classification results for p sev classes for the 2 year 10 year and 100 year design storms also if there was a possibility to combine adjacent severity classes together after classification to elevate the f 1 harmonic mean of precision and recall and gini impurity values above 50 the classes were combined and the updated tree with higher scores were constructed the results suggest the stormwater drainage inlet features specifically total node depth and node depth were the first level contributing factors to the classification process such observation re confirms that for effective classification predicting of the p sev i node depth and total node depth were the first level dominant factors additionally for the 2 year and 10 year storms a total node depth of 9 65 ft 2 94 m can reliably be used as an upper limit for predicting nodes overflowing in the very low low and intermediate severity classes in this study fig 7g and h show the best classification results for p rec and p r e c s e v for p rec classification subwatershed areas seem to appear as the first level determining factor followed by node depth and total node depth also the classification process for the latter metric was observed to be challenging as high scores were not achieved with a reasonably low number of conditions 4 3 comparative gsi impact assessment fig 8 shows the results of the gsi candidate area identification process for the 100 year opportunity subwatersheds as the most expansive coverage of opportunity subwatersheds across the city based on the identification results for the 100 year storm the candidate area for bioretention is identified at a significantly higher coverage than raingardens i e 3 6 km2 compared to 0 9 km2 also among the five types of land cover used to identify candidate areas for bioretention parking lots with 2 8 km2 80 of available space for bioretention and commercial sidewalks with 0 002 km2 0 05 of the space had the largest and lowest shares of bioretention area parks planting strips within public right of way and vegetated median have 0 55 0 15 and 0 04 km2 of candidate area with 15 4 4 2 and 1 2 of the available public space respectively moreover around 47 700 units are identified as potential structures including commercial and residential based on the volumetric estimation of the reductions in the overflow volumes using gsi implementation at the candidate locations the reductions in overflow volumes at the stormwater inlets were computed and then compared to pre gsi implementation scenarios table 5 shows the total identified areas per event as well as estimated overflow volume reduction at the city level for all the events and all the gsi candidate areas bioretention cells show the highest potential of overflow volume capture among the three gsi practices with approximately 2 4 times more overflow reductions than the combined potential captures from raingardens and rainwater cistern fig 9 also shows the results of pre gsi overflow compared to those post gsi implementation using the same overflow classification ranges the estimates show an overall reduction in the number and p sev of overflowing hotspots and thus their opportunity subwatersheds however the impact of the gsi are not equally distributed with five classes of p sev for the three design storms table 6 shows percentage reductions within each class p sev at the city level for the three design storms maximum reductions in the total number of hotspots and area of opportunity subwatersheds via gsi implementation happen with the 2 year design storm followed by the 10 year and 100 year see table 6 this pattern is consistent with the expectation that gsi is most effective with precipitations of lower magnitude however even for a 100 year storm there is an estimated 78 reduction in the number of overflowing inlets in the very high category interestingly the highest reduction in the number of hotspots post gsi implementation among the overflow categories is associated with the very high category indicating the role that gsi practices can play in locations severely affected by localized flooding regardless of the intensity of the rainfall event another important takeaway from table 6 was that although the total number of hotspots changed by no more than 17 with the gsi implementation at a city level the severity of overflow failure in the system drastically decreased suggesting that the entire drainage system is more capable of handling the intense storm moreover for all the design storms the number of hotspots in the very low category is increased such a pattern indicates that overflows from a number of hotspots in categories with higher severities have been reduced to very low in the post gsi scenario table 7 shows the results of overflow reductions and the associated cost per cubic meter summarized at the watershed level results show that deployment of gsi across all candidate locations in the opportunity subwatersheds for the 2 10 and 100 year design storms captures approximately 31 25 and 17 of the modeled overflow respectively as expected the share of overflow reduction decreases with the increase in precipitation magnitude however based on the assumptions used in this study the cost of overflow reduction was almost equal between the three design storms at a 528 per cubic meter capital cost and 634 per cubic meter with the inclusion of maintenance for a breakdown of the overflow reductions and associated costs at the watershed level see appendix 5 table a8 table 8 shows the comparative results of overflow reduction and associated costs for the gsi vs gray infrastructure options based on the assumptions and models used in this study the results show that gsi is a cost effective solution on a per cubic meter basis to mitigate overflow in each watershed compared to gray infrastructure upgrade i e pipe size increase 5 3 102 4 8 101 m3 for gsi compared to 2 8 103 8 6 101 m3 for gray on the other hand based on the scope of the models and assumptions used in this study gray infrastructure seems to mitigate more overflow at the city level 34 3 28 2 for gray compared to 17 4 4 4 for gsi the results suggest that 100 year overflow cannot be eliminated with any of the two infrastructure options alone therefore combining the two solutions yielded a 41 5 reduction in the overflow volume at the city level at 1 9 103 m3 which was a higher reduction than the solutions therefore the results suggest that the two categories of infrastructure need to be combined to achieve the maximum possible reduction at the lowest possible cost for a comparative breakdown of the overflow captures and associated costs for gsi vs gray infrastructure at the watershed level see appendix 5 table a9 5 conclusions this study presented a framework that identifies stormwater inlet flooding hotspots and opportunity subwatersheds contributing to them for three designs storms 2 50 10 10 and 100 year 1 24 hour storms using epa swmm 5 1 013 followed by a spatial analysis to prioritize investment in the drainage system and application of decision trees to classify the identified hotspots and areas finally the study provides an assessment of the maximum potential impact of three gsi practices bioretention rain gardens and rainwater harvesting cisterns on overflow reduction at the watershed and city levels it also compares the overflow reduction potentials as well as their costs to those associated with upgrading the gray infrastructure system the results were specific to the city of dallas case study however the methodology and framework can be applied to any other urban area where sufficient data as described in section 2 exists the hotspot and opportunity subwatershed identification results show that for the three design storms of interest in this study the increase in the return period resulted in a substantial increase in the number of hotspots and opportunity subwatershed across the city this part of the study was particularly in the interest of local decision makers as it provided a roadmap to guide investment and attention into certain areas in the city the prioritization results provide an array of decision making spatial maps to prioritize investment in gsi practices or gray infrastructure upgrades across a city based on the severity of overflow at each identified inlet recurrence of overflow after the three design storms gsi availability and averages of the mentioned metrics decision tree classifiers also show that stormwater inlet features specifically total depth play an important role in the classification identification of non problematic inlets the gsi impact analysis results show that if deployed in all identified opportunity areas approximately 31 25 and 17 of overflows resulting from the executed 2 10 and 100 year storms respectively could be reduced at an average cost of approximately 6 3 102 m3 this substantial level of reduction was a promising assessment and was mostly associated with the bioretention implementation also gsi implementation offers a reduction of up to 78 in the number of overflowing nodes in the very high severity class across the city therefore gsi implementation shows potential in directing the drainage system to respond to severe rainfall events in a resilient manner by reducing the overflow severities finally by comparing the overflow reduction capacities and costs results show that gsi practices at the city level were approximately 77 less costly on a per cubic meter basis than gray infrastructure upgrades for the 100 year design storm however more overflow can be captured with gray infrastructure upgrades compared to gsi interestingly the combined solution of green and gray offers the highest overflow reduction at approximately 45 1 reduction for the 100 year design storm and at a lower cost per cubic meter than gray alone which proved to be another point of interest for the local decision makers 6 recommendation and future research a major future step to complement this study is the addition of real world observation data on pluvial flooding and overflowing inlets during intense rainfalls by doing so the simulation results showing the overflowing nodes can be calibrated against real world observation and can be used to predict the system s behavior against future events the utilization of monitoring stations or crowdsourced methods to collect such data at a city scale is among the methods that could allow better understanding of the response of stormwater drainage networks in a real world urban setting further investigation of the impact of climate change projections and their uncertainties on rainfall is a very important next step that can further improve the understanding of the drainage system resiliency to future events furthermore the projection of land use and urban configuration might take futuristic analysis closer to reality additionally the application of 2 d overflow modeling to assess the localized pluvial flooding resulting from inlet overflow can guide decision making for emergency response and traffic routing assistance during extreme rainfall events such an analysis requires a higher resolution of land cover data and consequently higher computational requirements and resources compared to the ones used in this study this analysis focused solely on inlet pluvial flooding and did not investigate riverine flooding which has been the most common area of research and analysis in the hydrology realm as a result the addition of riverine flooding to the analysis would further improve understanding of the response of the urban system to the general flooding phenomenon furthermore conducting the same analysis but with a distributed hydrological model that can operate at a higher spatial resolution scale can further improve the understanding of surface water routing prior to stormwater reaching the drainage network as well as gsi effectiveness at the site additional high level resolutions of soil data missing drainage network data and other stormwater capture infrastructure data would help understand the high resolution real world dynamics of stormwater in the urban land cover finally the addition of socio economic metrics e g social vulnerability or equity land use and other planning objectives into the prioritization scheme would further elaborate on how the hydrological factors can assist in directing investment in marginalized communities by analyzing the citywide patterns between aforementioned metrics and the severity of overflow research questions around the under investments to alleviate urban

this project we assumed the entire width of the planting strips could be allocated to bioretention cells eighteen blocks within the five mile watershed were sampled for each of their sidewalks widths

1848,introducing additional information sources such as hydrochemical signatures and water isotopes into the model calibration has shown to be useful to enhance model robustness by increasing parameter identifiability and maintaining simulation reliability our study explores the added value of discharge young water fractions fyw derived from the volume weighted δ18o concentrations on the model reliability as a calibration constraint for this we coupled a karst hydrological model varkarst with a catchment scale transport model storage selection sas function approach to simulate discharge δ18o concentration δ18oq and corresponding fyw we performed a multi variable calibration scheme by simultaneously constraining a large model ensemble 1x106 realizations with respect to the model performance on discharge and fyw by searching a model output space in which the model performance on discharge and model performance on fyw provides an optimal trade off we extracted hydrologically more informative model realizations we tested our calibration approach at the wasseralm spring which supplies drinking water to the city of vienna austria the contribution of the information content of fyw to the model robustness was assessed by the degree of reduction in the parameter and simulation uncertainties our results indicate that the inclusion of fyw notably reduced the uncertainty in model parameters 6 parameters out of 8 simulations 14 vs 10 by δ18oq and water balance components for the model internal states around 40 our findings reveal that fyw confirms the model reliability kge 0 71 0 01 in validation in that it mainly reduces the parameter equifinality by providing physically more plausible and identifiable parameter sets therefore fyw is a potentially useful metric to better constrain the model outputs thereby limiting the model uncertainty keywords young water fractions hydrological model equifinality model calibration uncertainty data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction increasing model robustness requires dealing with different sources of uncertainties including model structural uncertainty parameter and simulation uncertainties renard et al 2011 vrugt et al 2008 of these parameter uncertainty is critical as it is generally attributed to the model simulation reliability bittner et al 2021 hartmann et al 2017a b wu et al 2021 in this regard diagnostic analysis is essential to ensure the model robustness with a detailed investigation of the model structural suitability performance analysis parameter identifiability and simulation uncertainty melsen and guse 2021 pfannerstill et al 2015 traditionally model parameterization is focused on a single variable typically discharge as it mainly characterizes the integrated response of the hydrological system guse et al 2016 széles et al 2020 however even if this approach yields a reasonable model performance it does not guarantee parameter identifiability and thus there is still a risk of parameter equifinality multiple parameter sets provide equally acceptable model simulations beven and freer 2001 beven 2006 kelleher et al 2017 this is mainly because model calibration based on the single variable could either conceal the system s hydrological functioning or may compensate for the model structural inadequacies for this reason different response variables e g soil moisture groundwater levels demirel et al 2019 ireson et al 2022 rödiger et al 2014 catchment signatures e g aridity index baseflow index addor et al 2018 liu et al 2021 nijzink et al 2018 and additional information sources e g hydrochemical signatures and water isotopes hartmann et al 2013a li et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 are essential to address equifinality issue her and chaubey 2015 khatami et al 2019 sarrazin et al 2022 teweldebrhan et al 2018 thereby enhancing model simulation reliability the stable isotopic composition of water e g oxygen 18 18o and deuterium 2h is widely utilized in hydro geo logical modelling studies birkel et al 2020 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 jasechko 2019 particularly in delineating the groundwater recharge

2018 preferential flow paths berghuijs and kirchner 2017 zhang et al 2020 and transient time distributions kaandorp et al 2018 jing et al 2019 for instance 18o is one of the perfect proxies in providing orthogonal information as to how water and solutes are partitioned stored and transported in the hydrological system fenicia et al 2008 kirchner 2006 seibert and mcdonnell 2002 therefore 18o is served as a useful metric for further understanding of local and global scale hydrological processes particularly flow and transport processes in the hydrological system e g fekete et al 2006 hartmann et al 2021a holmes et al 2020 on that account the inclusion of this information content into the model confinement increases the model simulation reliability either by identifying water partitioning across the model compartments e g ala aho et al 2017 piovano et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 or by better constraining the model output e g hartmann et al 2013a stadnyk and holmes 2020 zhang et al 2019 one valuable aspect of stable isotopes is that it enables us to estimate water age distributions that mainly refer to the water or solute travel time distributions ttds e g piovano et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 ttds reflect the different flow paths e g matrix conduit of a hydrological system based on a characteristic time scale for this reason ttd is employed as a system specific age descriptor that defines how systems store and release water e g benettin et al 2022 hrachowitz et al 2016 remondi et al 2018 in turn allowing better identification of the storage mixing characteristics and flow paths berghuijs and kirchner 2017 mcdonnell and beven 2014 broadly the mean transit time mtt is used as a functional water age index as it provides valuable insight into the system s internal dynamics by integrating ttds into the single age metric e g hrachowitz et al 2011 piovano et al 2018 however the reliable quantification of mtt is often more difficult kirchner 2016a sprenger et al 2019 xiao et al 2022 and problematic seeger and weiler 2014 woolfenden and ginn 2009 for that there has been a subject of high interest in identifying alternative water age metrics which are more prone to capture the time variant hydrological characteristics benettin et al 2017a 2017b gou et al 2022 kirchner 2016b lutz et al 2018 on that ground since the system young water age predominantly reflects the hydrological functioning of fast and preferential flow pathways such as fissures cracks and fractures kirchner 2016a 2016b song et al 2017 it is more descriptive in capturing the temporal variations of the storage discharge dynamics jing et al 2019 maxwell et al 2019 rusjan et al 2019 in this respect as an emerging diagnostic metric discharge young water fraction fyw is one of the useful water age metrics that define a proportion of water younger than a certain threshold kirchner 2016a von freyberg et al 2018 stockinger et al 2019 fyw is mainly derived from the 18o composition of water by sinewave fitting to the amplitudes of input and output isotope signals while the threshold value is for instance represented by 2 3 months for the streamflow fyw kirchner 2016a 2016b since fyw principally characterizes the hydrological systems fast flow dynamics berghuijs and kirchner 2017 von freyberg et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 it potentially distinguishes the main contribution of the newly added water to the system discharge for that reason fyw could be a crucial benchmark to reveal and compare the system specific dynamics çallı et al 2023 gallart et al 2020 that are mainly controlled by the discrete flow characteristics fissures fractures and conduits this is especially important for fractured and karst water resources in which the fast flow component frequently dominates the system s hydrological functioning considering that using age based hydrological information in the model conditioning for karst hydrological models could enable us to identify more informative model realizations from the model output while simultaneously conveying more relevant hydrological information throughout the model parameterization nonetheless as a potential information content for the fast flow controlled karst hydrological systems in which way and to what extent fyw influences the model reliability remains unclear and needs to be examined the study explores to what extent the information content of discharge age plays a role in model parametrization as a calibration constraint as fyw filters the key information about the karst system s hydrological functioning and thus conveys the discharge age based knowledge throughout the model calibration we hypothesized that the robustness of karst water resources predictions could be achieved by constraining model output with fyw for this purpose we coupled a transport model storage selection function approach with a process oriented karst hydrological model varkarst to simulate the δ18o concentrations of discharge δ18oq and fyw derived from the volume weighted δ18o concentrations afterward we performed a multi variable calibration scheme by simultaneously searching a pareto optimal model output space from which hydrologically more informative model realizations could be extracted in doing that we kept δ18oq simulations as a model benchmark to disentangle the influence of fyw on the model robustness to test our hypothesis we applied our calibration approach to a large karst spring that contributes to the water supply of the city of vienna austria the findings offer a better representation of karst aquifers hydrological functioning in modelling studies thereby potentially providing a new research direction for the management of karst water resources 2 case study wasseralm karst spring vienna austria 2 1 experimental site the investigated karst system is located approximately 100 km southwest of vienna austria at the border between the styria and lower austria regions the study area lies in the higher part of the northern schneealpe on average 802 m above sea level fig 1 the schneealpe is a karst massive belonging to the northern calcareous alps dominated by triassic and upper jurassic carbonates bauer et al 2012 rank et al 2006 gasser et al 2009 in the study area the calcareous alpine unit is underlain by the impermeable layer consisting of shales and sandstones called the greywacke zone characterized by the complex internal structure due to the several tectonic and metamorphic events rank et al 1992 2006 gasser et al 2009 maloszewski et al 2002 the schneealpe karst massive consists of a 900 1000 m thickness of middle triassic carbonates triassic limestone and dolomite bauer et al 2012 rank et al 1992 this massive is characterized by a typical plateau an approximately 30 km2 dullinger et al 2001 which hosts several karst landforms including caves sinkholes polygenetic poljes and dry valleys bauer 1969 bauer et al 2012 hilberg 2016 due to the high karstification over the region approximately 75 of the precipitation quickly infiltrates into the aquifer system via karst landforms mainly by dolines and sinkholes e g gattinger 1980 bauer et al 2012 hilberg 2016 wasseralm spring is one of the drinking water sources of the city of vienna which was captured between 1894 and 1897 during the construction of the 1st vienna water line the karst aquifer is characterized by maloszewski 2000 and maloszewski et al 2002 as a dual system that consists of a less permeable fissured porous matrix with high storage capacity and a high permeable karstic channel with low storage capacity the mean daily discharge of the wasseralm spring is approximately 240 l s and it was classified as a typical dolomitic spring by bauer 1969 gattinger 1973 rank et al 2006 considering the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the karst groundwater in the study area the water type of the 1st vienna water line is characterized by the typical dolomitic limestone formation ca mg hco3 hydrochemical facies in which the main cations are ca2 67 and mg2 29 while hco3 represents the dominant anion by the 87 of total anions stadt wien 2023 last access 27 03 2023 the electrical conductivity ec values of the wasseralm spring vary between 260 and 283 µs cm rank et al 2006 the approximate recharge area for wasseralm spring and sieben springs was delineated by maloszewski et al 2002 at around 23 km2 while the catchment area for wasseralm spring was defined at 6 7 km2 by rank et al 2006 the mean annual precipitation including snow component is around 1360 mm 01 01 1993 31 12 2016 comprising potential evapotranspiration by nearly 350 mmy 1 maloszewski et al 2002 rank et al 2006 the snowmelt plays an important role in defining the recharge discharge processes of the karstic system which results in flashy flow characteristics in the hydrographs particularly for the spring season during which the wasseralm discharge reaches 1000 1200 l s 2 2 available data we used daily meteorological data including max min air temperature c atmospheric and vapour pressure hpa total and fresh snow depth cm wind speed mean relative humidity global radiation j cm 2 obtained at the mürzzuschlag weather station 758 m located at approximately 14 km southeast of the study area the daily precipitation data 01 01 1975 31 12 2016 at nasswald wasseralm nassbach weather station 774 m and wasseralm spring discharge data 01 01 1995 31 12 2016 were downloaded from https ehyd gv at table 1 the monthly stable oxygen 18 δ18o of precipitation δ18op and discharge δ18oq and monthly spring discharge data collected over 17 years 31 01 1973 27 11 1990 were digitized from the study of maloszewski et al 2002 according to the historical data record of δ18o the mean content of the annual volume weighted δ18op value was 11 18 with a median and standard deviation values 15 41 and 3 43 respectively the yearly content of δ18oq was represented by 11 81 with the median value of 11 7 and a standard deviation of 0 38 to adapt the time resolution of the measured isotope concentration to our modelling framework we interpolated monthly δ18op and spring discharge values to the daily values using the stepwise backward function and linear interpolation method respectively supplement a 3 methodology we explored the value of discharge young water fractions fyw as an additional information source for the model confinement therefore we coupled a karst hydrological model varkarst with a catchment scale transport model storage selection sas function the varkarst model s outputs effective recharge and discharge were used as prognostic forcing fluxes to feed the sas model this one way coupling allows us to avoid increasing the model structural complexity thereby keeping the number model parameters low and sticking to the principle of model parsimony for the model conditioning of the coupled model we simultaneously constrained a large model ensemble 1x106 realizations by the model performance on spring discharge and the model performance on the discharge young water fractions fyw by doing that we aimed to extract physically more realistic parameter sets from the model output the contribution of newly added discharge age based information content with fyw into the model confinement was then assessed by the uncertainty analysis of the model parameters discharge simulations and water balance estimates of model internal fluxes 3 1 models 3 1 1 stable isotope transport model for the simulation of δ18o concentration in spring discharge δ18oq and corresponding young water fractions fyw we used the storage selection sas function approach implemented in the tran sas package v 01 hereinafter referred to the sas model by benettin and bertuzzo 2018 the sas model focuses on the non stationary character of the transient time distributions ttds to temporarily differentiate water ages from reservoir storage this is accomplished by the rank aged storage concept e g benettin and bertuzzo 2018 botter et al 2011 smith et al 2018 which tracks water ages in storage thus identifying water age relationships between input and output water parcels the sas model numerically solves the solute tracer mass balance equation eq 1 in a control volume applied to each water parcel in storage to compute the concentration of an ideal tracer in the outflux it can be either discharge or evapotranspiration or both 1 dm dt c j j c q q c et e t where m is the tracer mass in storage j l3t 1 q l3t 1 and et l3t 1 refer to precipitation evapotranspiration and discharge c j ml 3 c q ml 3 and c et ml 3 denote the solute concentrations of each flux respectively for simplicity we only considered discharge as a system outflow to solve eq 1 thus adapting in our modelling framework the solute concentration of discharge c q t is then calculated by using the following formula 2 c q t 0 c j t t t p q t t d t here t t is the age of the water parcel or tracer defined by the time between the current time t t is the time of the water parcel entered into the system p q t t t 1 refers to ttds at time t which is calculated based on the age ranked storage s t t describing the amount of water in storage whose age is younger than or equal to age t at time t 3 p q t t ω s t t s t t where s t t defines ageing water storage and ω s t t is the travel time probability density function pdf expressing each water age t removed from the storage in the sas model the age distribution of the storage is defined based on the selection of an appropriate sas function e g power law beta function and gamma distributions in general the sas function is not known and obtained from the observed tracer based on the mass balance equation eq 1 by a set of model calibrations for our study we employed beta function as a suitable functional form to simulate c q ml 3 for our case the δ18o concentration of karst spring discharge the beta function is defined by a two shape parameter beta α β and expressed as follows visser et al 2019 4 beta α β t α 1 1 t β 1 ω q t where ω q refers to the pdfs of the age ranked discharge α and β represent the two positive shape parameters when the shape parameters are obtained as α 1 and β 1 it implies that there are no age preferences from the storage of interest thereby referring to the complete mixing process further the shape parameters α 1 and β 1 characterize younger ages while α 1 and β 1 indicates the age preferences for older ages e g benettin and bertuzzo 2018 nguyen et al 2021 the time variant fyw is not directly observed and thus it was derived from the volume weighted δ18o concentrations based on the discharge age distribution by editing the sas model codes therefore we computed dynamic fyw using the beta function form given eq 4 considering age ranked discharge generated by the sas model 5 f yw b e t a α β τ 0 τ w t α 1 1 t β 1 d t where τ yw is the threshold value of discharge young water age which was defined at 35 days for our spring discharge 3 1 2 simulation of karst discharge and groundwater storage dynamics the varkarst model hartmann et al 2013a was used to simulate spring discharge and groundwater storage dynamics the model separates the soil epikarst and groundwater reservoirs as sub routines to simulate i soil and epikarst depths ii fractions of concentrated and diffusive recharge to the groundwater iii epikarst hydrodynamics and iv groundwater dynamics brenner et al 2018 hartmann et al 2014 varkarst is structured by 8 parameters table 2 and forced on a daily time step with daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration snowmelt is an important part of the aquifer recharge in mountainous karst catchments çallı et al 2022 xu et al 2022 therefore as the varkarst model structure does not include a snow module we implemented the snowmelt routine using the degree day concept in eq 6 kustas et al 2004 to represent snow accumulation and melting 6 melt d d f t i t m where melt accounts for snowmelt flux mmd 1 and ddf is the degree day factor mm c 1d 1 ti represents the average daily temperature in the day i while tm is the temperature at which snowmelt begins to pre process the precipitation as forcing input tm and ddf were set to 0 c and 3 5 mm c 1d 1 respectively the physically plausible parameter values for tm c and ddf mm c 1d 1 were obtained from the previous research in austrian catchments he et al 2014 parajka et al 2005 2007 daily potential evapotranspiration mmd 1 was estimated by the penman monteith approach allen et al 2006 3 2 modelling framework 3 2 1 parameter estimation procedure the model performance was measured by kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 eq 7 kge ranges from negative infinity to 1 with the optimum value of 1 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 w i t h α σ s σ o a n d β μ s μ o where r is the linear correlation between the simulated and observed states α is the ratio for the standard deviations indicating the similarity between the simulated and observed variables β expresses the ratio of the mean of the simulated variable to the observed mean to assess the model performance on different model variables we applied kge separately on spring discharge kgeq δ18o concentration in spring discharge kgeδ 18 o and discharge young water fractions fyw kgefyw then we used the mathematical symbol of the intersection to refer to the combinations of each simulated variable thereby denoting kgeq kgefyw kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgeδ18o kgefyw as multi variable calibration constraints to obtain a continuous time series of fyw the sas model had to be parameterized for that reason we carried out a model calibration that fully explored the parameter space of the beta function with two shape parameters α and β afterward based on monthly simulated and observed δ18oq for 01 02 1975 27 11 1990 a threshold value of kge 0 4 was used to extract the behavioural δ18oq realizations from the model initial ensemble appendix a therefore we used the median of behavioural fyw simulations which were obtained from the behavioural δ18oq realizations as the calibration benchmark for the coupled model conditioning the model parameters of varkarst were sampled by the latin hypercube sampling lhs scheme based on the uniform distribution assumption the feasible parameter range was chosen from previous studies by maloszewski et al 2002 and hartmann et al 2016 table 2 the coupled model was run by 1x106 times on a daily time step using the parameter array of the varkarst model with the fixed sas model parameters α 0 85 and β 4 56 3 2 2 model conditioning scheme we ran the coupled model for 42 years over the period of 01 01 1975 31 12 2016 this was necessary since the data period for the δ18o concentrations of precipitation and discharge δ18op and δ18oq and observed daily spring discharge do not overlap with each other table 1 that way the varkarst model was conditioned by the period of 01 01 1995 31 12 2016 when discharge was available whereas the period between 01 01 1975 and 31 12 1990 was used to simulate δ18oq and corresponding fyw for both conditioning periods we applied separate split sampling tests klemeš 1986 the available data for daily spring discharge 01 01 1995 31 12 2016 was split into two sub periods thereby denoting the model calibration 01 10 1995 01 10 2008 and validation 02 10 2008 31 12 2016 similarly the sas model is covered by the periods of 26 01 1977 28 01 1983 for model calibration and 20 02 1983 27 10 1990 for validation an approximate 2 year period prior to the model calibration was allocated as a model warm up for each conditioning therefore the split sampling test procedure was performed on the observed daily discharge δ18oq and fyw to assess the performance of the coupled model 3 2 3 uncertainty quantification the estimation of parameter and simulation uncertainty was carried out similar to the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology beven and binley 1992 to reveal the parameter uncertainty we reduced the initial parameter sets 1x106 by discarding model realizations below the threshold value of kge 0 75 this value was applied to each calibration constraint i e kgeq kgeq kgefyw kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgeδ18o kgefyw therefore we assessed the reduction in each parameter location to quantify the strength of the confinement based on the percentile method 25th and 75th percentiles the parameter and simulation uncertainties were then quantified by the reductions in the interquartile ranges iqr to assess the uncertainty in water balance for the simulated sum of model internal fluxes we considered the water balance estimates for the matrix and conduit compartments for that we used the whole simulation period 01 10 1995 30 09 2016 and the periods that reflect the dry and wet conditions 14 wet and 7 dry periods see supplement b 4 results 4 1 model output constrained by δ18o and fyw fig 2 a demonstrates the size reductions in the initial parameter ensemble 1x106 depending on the applied calibration constraints that successfully met the threshold value of kge 0 75 overall both kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgefyw significantly reduce the initial ensemble as compared to kgeq with 15 530 realizations specifically kgeq kgefyw 0 75 distinctly differs from other constraints in that it ensures a notable reduction in the initial ensemble with 3462 realizations out of one million ensemble the reduction is also much higher than that of kgeq kgδ18o accounted by 5048 behavioural runs notably kgeq kgefyw kgeδ18o lead to a fair reduction in the initial parameter size as compared to kgeq kgeδ18o with a more confined range by the parameter size reduction of 89 fig 2b demonstrates the surface plots indicating the distribution of model performance for an ensemble of one million run based on the model competing criteria kge for each variable on the left side of the figure the model output is simultaneously confined by the model performance on spring discharge kgeq and the model performance on fyw kgefyw similarly the right side of the panel indicates the model confinement by the model performance on spring discharge kgeq and the model performance on δ18oq kgeδ18o overall a more condensed bump called the pareto optimal model region enables us to capture a higher model performance efficiency for both aspects of the model ensemble implying the better representation of the discharge and fyw for this reason the region satisfying the pareto optimal solutions is more prone to convey hydrologically more versatile information this information essentially refers to the extracted process based knowledge of the system water age preferences captured by the model therefore it is fair to infer that kgeq kgefyw is a reasonable choice as a calibration constraint to capture more informative model realizations from the initial ensemble this is mainly because kgeq kgefyw can successfully meet a better model refinement in identifying both aspects of each realization on the pareto optimal model region represented by approximately 0 65 kgeq and 0 65 0 8 kgefyw by comparison the model output confined by kgeq kgeδ18o illustrates relatively sporadic pareto region in which one does not necessarily guarantee that the better model performance on discharge kgeq ensure a higher model efficiency on the simulation of δ18oq 4 2 model parameter uncertainty the behavioural parameter sets from the split sampling test procedure kgeq 0 75 kgeq kgeδ18o 0 75 and kgeq kgefyw 0 75 and model validation results are provided in table 3 overall the behavioural parameter sets obtained by kgeq kgefyw 0 75 provide relatively successful model validation with a kge value of 0 71 0 01 ensemble mean standard deviation thus indicating an improvement in the model performance as compared to those with kgeq 0 61 0 04 and kgeq kgeδ18o 0 67 0 02 the posterior distributions of the behavioural parameter sets obtained by each calibration constraint are provided in fig 3 overall the inclusion of both information sources substantially reduce the parameter uncertainty fig 3a table 3 while simultaneously providing better parameter identifiability in fig 3b 6 parameters out of 8 in total more specifically the changes in the distance between the 25th and 75th percentiles of several parameter locations including agw ke d αf kc mm and a km2 reveal the considerable impact of the additional information sources on the applied confinement strategy here the ranges of parameters are substantially confined by the applied calibration constraint all of which are represented by rather narrower iqrs thus allowing a significant reduction in the parameter uncertainty except for ase and vs mm for instance the reduction in the parameter range for αgw is around 43 by kgeq kgefyw and 35 by kgeq kgeδ18o as compared to kgeq alone further the parameter kc d loosely corresponds to its initial range by the calibration constraints without auxiliary information sources 31 for both δ18o and fyw similarly the iqr reduction in parameter αf is nearly 18 by kgeq kgeδ18o and 24 by kgeq kgefyw here ke d is the second parameter whose uncertainty is fairly reduced by the inclusion of fyw information content thereby providing a rather narrow bandwidth fig 3a with the lower median values of 29 71 d by kgeq kgeδ18o and 27 17 d by kgeq kgefyw notably kgeq kgefyw leads to substantial confinement for ke d thus ensuring a narrower iqr with a 37 bandwidth reduction as compared to kgeq kgeδ18o table 3 ke also represents one of the more identifiable model parameters together with a km2 when it is confined by kgeq kgefyw fig 3a demonstrates that the range for vs mm is not necessarily affected by the inclusion of additional information sources by comparison it indicates relatively better confinement by kgeq kgefyw with a median value of 281 35 mm contrarily kgeq kgeδ18o better reduces the parameter distance of ve mm than that of kgeq kgefyw with a reduction of 8 kgeq kgefyw results in similar confinement as in kgeq kgeδ18o for a km2 while providing similar median values 6 15 km2 and 6 20 km2 respectively further kgeq kgeδ18o kgefyw decreases the median value of αf without satisfying any further reduction in iqr for kgeq kgeδ18o however neither kgeq kgeδ18o nor kgeq kgefyw confirms any further refinement in the parameter range for soil epikarst depth variability constant ase except for shifting the median values 1 04 and 0 76 respectively instead both calibration constraints result in an increment in the parameter uncertainty 25 by kgeq kgeδ18o and 12 by kgeq kgefyw this finding is also indicated by the identifiability plot for ase which is represented by plateau like shapes for each model constraint fig 3b 4 3 model simulation uncertainty the behavioural simulations for δ18oq and fyw are displayed in fig 4 overall the model reasonably simulates each variable while better capturing the hydrological variations over the simulation periods yet although the simulations of discharge isotopic composition δ18oq fig 4a mainly reflect the seasonal pattern of observed δ18oq there are still instabilities starting from the mid of 1981 until 1984 during which the model generally overestimates the δ18oq simulations this therefore results in a wider uncertainty for δ18oq simulations conversely fyw is well established by the model both for calibration 1978 1983 and validation 1984 1990 periods in which the upper bound of the confidence interval better resembles the benchmark fyw as opposed to the lower bound fig 4b the simulation uncertainty of daily spring discharge 01 01 1995 31 12 2016 is provided in fig 5 this figure further reveals to what extent the simulation uncertainty is reduced by the inclusion of each information content δ18o and fyw into the model calibration overall the 95 confidence bound of kgeq kgefyw exhibits a relatively narrower bandwidth than that of kgeq kgeδ18o thereby allowing a reasonable reduction in the discharge simulation uncertainty with the bandwidth reduction of 14 in total 10 by kgeq kgeδ18o this reduction is more visible over the calibration period 01 10 1999 01 10 2004 during which spring discharge low flow are relatively better captured by kgeq kgefyw fig 3c however discharge high flow is not entirely confined by both constraints kgeq kgefyw and kgeq kgeδ18o especially during the time over which snowmelt mainly dominates the spring discharge such as may june 2006 and 2009 4 4 uncertainty in water balance components the uncertainty in water balance components i e effective recharge reff mmy 1 actual evapotranspiration aet mmy 1 and spring discharge qspring mmy 1 are provided in fig 6 a c here the mean annual contribution of each component is estimated for the whole simulation period 01 10 1995 30 09 2016 as well as two contrasting hydrological conditions wet and dry periods further the effective recharge and discharge for the matrix reffmatrix and qmatrix and conduit reffconduit and qconduit compartments are demonstrated to assess the uncertainty in model internal fluxes fig 6d e overall fig 6 reveals that fyw plays a critical role in reducing uncertainty for the water balance estimates particularly for reff and qspring however hardly any confinement in the uncertainty bounds is achieved by the inclusion of δ18oq information into model calibration particularly for the aet estimates which results in an increased simulation uncertainty with an approximate value of 34 conversely fyw leads to a significant reduction in the uncertainty bound by nearly 22 to a certain extent the inclusion of fyw information into model calibration provides higher mean values for aet 273 9 mmy 1 for whole 270 3 mmy 1 for wet and 278 7 mmy 1 for dry periods than those by δ18oq 266 4 mmy 1 262 9 mmy 1 and 271 1 mmy 1 in the same manner compatibly slightly less reff with the mean value of 1094 4 mmy 1 was estimated by fyw than δ18oq with the mean value of 1103 0 mmy 1 for the whole simulation period therefore fyw reasonably maintains less estimates for qspring 1094 6 mmy 1 1168 4 mmy 1 and 996 3 mmy 1 as opposed to the values obtained by δ18oq 1103 5 mmy 1 1178 4 mmy 1 and 1003 6 mmy 1for whole wet and dry periods respectively fig 6d e indicates the added value of fyw information content for the model calibration in that the better confinement in the water balances for matrix and conduit compartments are ensured overall the iqr reductions in both compartments are accounted for approximately 43 by the inclusion of fyw into the model calibration whereas δ18oq represents the reduction by 32 here the confinement by fyw for the estimated water balance of both components effective recharge and discharge under dry periods is slightly better than that of wet conditions 42 vs 40 comparatively the mean annual contributions of reffconduit and qconduit are slightly better constrained than reffmatrix and qmatrix additionally fyw leads to a fair decline in the estimated mean values of reffconduit and qconduit 538 5 mmy 1 and 538 7 mmy 1 as compared to δ18oq 566 6 mmy 1 and 566 8 mmy 1 likewise the higher mean values of reffmatrix and qmatrix 555 9 mmy 1 and 595 6 mmy 1 are obtained by fyw than those by δ18oq 536 4 mmy 1 and 574 9 mmy 1 5 discussion in this study we presented the added value of fyw as a derived information content from the volume weighted δ18o concentrations as a calibration constraint to increase the robustness of karst model predictions overall the split sample test results table 3 the physically meaningful parameter sets fig 3 the reduction in the parameter and simulation uncertainties fig 3 fig 5 as well as the improved estimates of the water balance components fig 6 prove the reasonable improvement in the model robustness this therefore indicates that fyw could be used as a useful calibration constraint 5 1 plausibility of estimated model parameters the feasible parameter range obtained by both kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgefyw can be used as effective parameters to characterize the hydrological behaviour of the karstic catchment fig 3a with their more identifiable ranges fig 3b to a certain extent the parameters including αf a km2 ke d and vs mm ve mm are mainly associated with the properties of the soil and epikarst reservoirs and thus each of which is strongly related to the physical characteristics of the karst aquifer by reflecting the hydrological hydrodynamic behaviour of the system spellman et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 similarly the deep groundwater zone parameters including kc d and αgw are also strongly confined by the additional information sources δ18o and fyw ve mm is one of the critical parameters that controls the flow and transport processes in the karst aquifers especially inferring the solute storage and mixing processes e g perrin et al 2003 schuler et al 2020 spellman et al 2022 wang et al 2022 however it is not a trivial task to obtain an identifiable value for ve mm during the model parametrization mainly due to the lack of state flux observations e g soil moisture in the soil and epikarst zones berthelin et al 2020 çallı et al 2022 for that reason the estimated values for the soil and epikarst zone are frequently assessed by soft knowledge and or expert elicitation considering the catchment hydro geo logical and physical characteristics in this sense the median value of ve mm represented by 996 mm kgeq kgeδ18o and 970 mm kgeq kgefyw reasonably overlap the physical characteristics of the karstic system maloszewski et al 2002 table 3 formed under highly karstified regions bauer 1969 bauer et al 2012 hilberg 2016 similarly the obtained values for vs mm by both calibration constraints 225 mm and 281 mm typically refer to the existence of a thin soil zone over the karst catchment this finding is particularly compatible with the fact that soil thickness in karst regions is rather thin and frequently patchy hilberg 2016 furthermore as the schneealpe karst massive is represented by the mid height range mountainous karst region which cannot exceed the highest tree line the soil and vegetation cover e g alpine pastureland and grassland are generally thin dullinger et al 2001 droin et al 2018 gasser et al 2009 ke d diagnoses the timing of flow predominantly occurring from the epikarst to the matrix reservoir for instance the lower values for ke d are mainly associated with shorter travel time in the epikarst zone thereby resembling the higher percolation rate from the epikarst to the matrix considering this the more reasonable and identifiable range for ke d is therefore obtained by the inclusion of the fyw information content into the model calibration fig 3a table 3 further ke is accounted for a relatively lower median value of 27 17 d than those of kgeq kgeδ18o 29 71 d and kgeq 39 67 d somewhat the estimated values of ke d by kgeq kgefyw mainly correspond to the physical characteristics of schneealpe massive maloszewski et al 2002 rank et al 2006 due to the high karstification e g bauer et al 2012 hilberg 2016 similarly the substantial reduction in the parameter uncertainty for ke d by fyw around 38 upholds that since fyw predominantly characterizes the existence of the preferential flow paths çallı et al 2023 it is more informative about the epikarst related hydraulic properties especially where the soil cover is very limited as in our case area fig 3a a fair confinement in the initial range for the parameter a km2 is achieved both by kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgefyw fig 3a thus providing similar iqr reductions with an approximate value of 13 additionally the parameter range of a km2 with the median values of 6 15 km2 by kgeq kgeδ18o and 6 20 km2 by kgeq kgefyw is physically plausible table 2 in that both values mainly agree with the finding by rank et al 2006 in which the recharge area for the wasseralm spring was estimated around 6 70 km2 given the fact that a km2 is the most sensitive model parameter see appendix b it may dominate the model results by compensating for the model performance with the non identifiable and or physically non meaningful values indeed this compensation is generally considered as one of the calibration problems for modelling studies in karst water resources e g hartmann et al 2013a 2013b mudarra et al 2019 especially when the model is only conditioned by the discharge variable without considering any additional information sources such as hydrochemical signatures and water stable isotopes hence the estimated values for a km2 by both model constraints could also be seen as a crucial outcome to reinforce the obtained values for the soil and epikarst reservoirs vs mm and ve mm since both reservoirs typically represent the shallow sub systems of the karst aquifers chang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 the storage capacity of each reservoir is strongly dependent on the variable contributing recharge area hartmann et al 2015 mudarra et al 2019 for that reason the physically meaningful range obtained for a km2 by fyw and δ18o reasonably supports the estimated values for vs and ve fig 3a the high values for ve mm and low values for ke d entail that the model simulates an increased amount of diffusive percolation rate from the epikarst to the matrix storage thus resulting in a reduction in the amount of concentrated recharge from the epikarst to the conduit this hydrodynamical behaviour is perfectly resembled by relatively higher values of kc d with the mean value of 7 79 d by kgeq kgefyw by which the diffusive recharge is more than concentrated recharge likewise the parameter agw which essentially controls the mean residence time of the water in the matrix reservoir is notably constrained by kgeq kgefyw 43 fig 3a this finding is in an agreement with the slightly better confinement in the estimated water balance components of the matrix reservoir reffmatrix 42 and qmatrix 42 by kgeq kgefyw as compared to the conduit reffconduit 40 and qconduit 41 fig 6d e furthermore the low values of agw and ase demonstrate the development of preferential flow paths over the karst aquifer ford and williams 2007 because our site is characterized by a high degree of karstification bauer et al 2012 hilberg 2016 the values obtained by kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgefyw are therefore physically more reasonable however ase is not necessarily constrained by both information sources either fyw or δ18o this can be explained by the fact that since ase plays a major role in regulating the spatial variability of the depth of soil epikarst reservoirs ve mm and vs mm the distinct physical representation of this parameter in a rather small catchment for our case the recharge contributing area a was defined by around 6 5 km2 may not be possible thus resulting in less identifiability for ase fig 3b 5 2 improved estimates of model simulations and water balance components it is noteworthy that the inclusion of fyw information content into the model calibration fairly increases the model skill in the validation period table 3 by providing better model performance on discharge simulations with a lower standard deviation 0 71 0 01 as compared to those by kgeq kgeδ18o 0 61 0 02 and kgeq 0 67 0 04 this finding underpins the reliability of the behavioral parameter set by kgeq kgefyw fig 3 additionally even though the model calibration was performed under relatively wet conditions the parameter sets are still representative of the model validation relatively dry year period it should also be noted that the model did not perform well in simulating δ18o concentrations in spring discharge fig 4a hence resulting in overestimation in the model simulations for certain time periods this could be either attributed to the sas model structural inadequacy or associated with the weak parameterization of the sas model that is strongly dependent on the selected functional form for our case the sas model was parametrized by the beta function one critical reason for this overestimation could also be attributed to the evaporation process occurring over the soil epikarst atmosphere interface since evaporation from soil particularly influences the evaporation related heavy isotope enrichment in the shallow zone waters soil and epikarst e g koeniger et al 2016 liu et al 2022 the uncertainties in the estimation of actual evaporation by the model could result in some instabilities in the δ18oo simulations fig 4a to a certain extent as the soil zone represents the shallow water depth with relatively slow water movement the light isotopes e g 16o are more likely to evaporate than the heavy isotopes e g 18o ultimately leading to enrichment in the heavy isotope concentration δ18o in water content e g gat and gonfiantini 1981 koeniger et al 2016 the consistency in model results also requires diagnosing the simulation uncertainty in the model internal fluxes and water balance components particularly considering the hydrological variability in the model simulations e g shafii and tolson 2015 in this regard the positive influence of fyw on the model consistency is more visible for the reduction in the simulated water balance uncertainty fig 6 especially considering the simulated sum of model internal fluxes matrix and conduit compartments fig 6d e to some extent the information content of fyw ensures an improved estimate in the water balance thus constraining the simulation uncertainties for three water budget components i e reff aet and qspring fig 6a c moreover the estimated mean values of all three components are compatible with the site conditions where the mean annual precipitation is around 1360 mm which comprises the potential evapotranspiration by nearly 350 mmy 1 maloszewski et al 2002 rank et al 2006 specifically reff contributes to the annual water budget by the mean value of 1103 mmy 1 while aet and qspring are estimated by 274 mmy 1and 1095 mmy 1 respectively fig 6d e additionally the iqr reductions in water budget components by kgeq kgefyw are even more than those in dry periods for the matrix and conduit compartments 43 this could be explained by the fact that the saturations of both compartments are likely to decrease under dry conditions during which both reservoirs are more prone to capture vertical infiltration from the soil epikarst reservoirs trček 2007 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 by comparison as the soil and epikarst reservoirs are relatively saturated partially or completely during wet periods incoming water prefers to move laterally rather than vertically infiltrate in turn bypassing a large part of the matrix components aquilina et al 2006 aley and kirkland 2012 tobin et al 2021 therefore most of the spring discharge is characterized by saturation excess water transferring through the preferential flow paths fractures conduits etc indeed this hydrodynamic behaviour is particularly common in highly karstified plateaus in which karstic landforms such as sinkhole frequency are relatively high as in our case area the mean annual recharge contributions of the matrix and conduit compartments to the karst aquifer s water budget are quite similar fig 6d e this indicates that although the matrix environment volumetrically dominates the total storage of the aquifer the highly conductive conduit is still largely responsible for the system s hydrological response additionally due to the fast hydrological response concentrated and rapid infiltration recharge into the conduit the conduit represents the most vulnerable part of karstic systems e g hartmann et al 2021a liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 to the changes in the aquifer boundary such as climate land use and contamination risks çelik and çallı 2021 bittner et al 2018 ravbar 2013 for that reason reducing uncertainties in the water balance of the conduit compartment by the inclusion of fyw information content in model calibration is valuable to obtain robust predictions fig 6d e this is particularly important in defining solutions for contamination related problems in karst water resources likewise as a more stable part of the karst aquifer the uncertainty reduction in the water balance estimates for the matrix component enables for better capturing of realistic predictions especially under hydrologically dry periods therefore given that fyw is a process diagnostic metric to distinguish fast and slow recharge and groundwater dynamics this additional information content could be helpful for water management plans it should also be considered that the model simulations are slightly better resembled by fyw than δ18oq figs 2 5 furthermore handling the simulation uncertainties by δ18o for the water balance components is not entirely possible for our case fig 6 one possible explanation would be the transformation of monthly δ18o values δ18oq and δ18op into daily values table 1 supplement a which may result in less biased fyw derived from the daily measured isotope however considering physically meaningful parameters obtained by the inclusion of fyw into the model calibration scheme fig 2 and fig 3 the reasonable simulations fig 4 and thus improved estimates for the water budget components fig 6 we are convinced by the fact that fyw is valuable as a time variant hydrological signature to fairly increase the model reliability this is primarily because fyw reflects the fast response characteristics of the hydrological system as conduit dominated flow in karst aquifer rather than focusing on an overall system behaviour as opposed to δ18oo 5 3 the equifinality considering the information content of discharge stable isotope and fyw the initial parameter set constrained against the discharge variable with the threshold value for kge 0 75 kgeq 0 75 is encouraging to reasonably resemble the system s hydrological response figs 2 5 however this does not necessarily mean that the behavioural parameter set by kgeq 0 75 does correspond to the physically meaningful parameters indeed the parameter equifinality can still exist khatami et al 2019 sarrazin et al 2022 thereby implying that there are still unfavourable parameter values providing physically implausible model simulations and or model internal fluxes and states çallı et al 2022 hartmann et al 2021b fortunately the reduction of parameter equifinality can be reduced by the additional observations in the model calibration such as soil moisture and infiltration process understanding ford et al 2017 kelleher et al 2017 as well as introducing additional information sources into the model calibration scheme in this respect the model robustness can be achieved by the inclusion of δ18o and fyw information contents fig 3 and fig 5 into the model calibration in that physically more plausible and identifiable model parameters are obtained by kgeq kgefyw and kgeq kgeδ18o fig 3 therefore the behavioural parameter sets for both δ18o and fyw confidentially provide better discharge simulations annual water balance estimates and model internal fluxes fig 5 fig 6 thereby eliminating the model equifinality as compared to kgeq alone the multi variable calibration facilitates limiting the number of behavioural simulations by searching for more informative realizations on the pareto optimal model output fig 2b this therefore leads to a fair reduction in the broad range of acceptable solutions fig 2a more specifically the added value of fyw is distinguishable in providing physically more meaningful and identifiable model parameters fig 3b particularly considering the plausible values for the sensitive model parameters a km2 ke d appendix b therefore the behavioural parameter set that met kgeq kgefyw 0 75 ensures a fair improvement in the model simulations for the spring discharge table 3 thus better resembling the discharge s high flow characteristics fig 5 where snowmelt dominates the spring flow behaviour this implies that fyw either better imprints the key hydrodynamics of the karstic system or it mainly reflects the system s responsive characteristics as closely as it was structured in the model architecture either way this makes fyw a more robust and dynamic diagnostic metric in exploring more informative model realizations from the model output especially for limiting the parameter equifinality this interpretation could also be associated with the findings by kirchner 2016a 2016b in that fyw offers a mechanistic explanation of heterogeneous system characteristics and thus reveals the system s hydrological response and its underlying process 6 conclusions this paper presents the first attempt at revealing the added value of discharge young water fractions fyw in the model calibration to increase the model robustness by incorporating the information content of fyw as a calibration constraint we fairly increased the parameter reliability while obtaining physically more plausible parameter sets and reducing the model equifinality the main findings from the study are as followed as an additional information source fyw could enable us to capture system hydrodynamic behaviour while simultaneously defining the storage mixing process based on the water age distribution fyw is a time variant process diagnostic metric to better constrain the model outputs and identify the hydrologically more informative model realizations on the pareto front in which water age information could be conveyed throughout the behavioural model realizations fyw could either be used as an alternative calibration constraint to increase the model reliability or be served as a useful diagnostic metric in the tracer aided or isotope enabled hydrological models in this respect fyw could be used as a response variable for the calibration of rainfall runoff models to disentangle the dynamics of streamflow specifically it could unravel as to how streamflow functions in a changing world particularly considering the impact of climate change and contamination risks on the fast flow component therefore since fyw is a hydrological system specific and time variant process signature it could allow us to judge the model reliability by the examination of the multiple model structures model compartments and model internal fluxes thereby diagnosing the model structural

1848,introducing additional information sources such as hydrochemical signatures and water isotopes into the model calibration has shown to be useful to enhance model robustness by increasing parameter identifiability and maintaining simulation reliability our study explores the added value of discharge young water fractions fyw derived from the volume weighted δ18o concentrations on the model reliability as a calibration constraint for this we coupled a karst hydrological model varkarst with a catchment scale transport model storage selection sas function approach to simulate discharge δ18o concentration δ18oq and corresponding fyw we performed a multi variable calibration scheme by simultaneously constraining a large model ensemble 1x106 realizations with respect to the model performance on discharge and fyw by searching a model output space in which the model performance on discharge and model performance on fyw provides an optimal trade off we extracted hydrologically more informative model realizations we tested our calibration approach at the wasseralm spring which supplies drinking water to the city of vienna austria the contribution of the information content of fyw to the model robustness was assessed by the degree of reduction in the parameter and simulation uncertainties our results indicate that the inclusion of fyw notably reduced the uncertainty in model parameters 6 parameters out of 8 simulations 14 vs 10 by δ18oq and water balance components for the model internal states around 40 our findings reveal that fyw confirms the model reliability kge 0 71 0 01 in validation in that it mainly reduces the parameter equifinality by providing physically more plausible and identifiable parameter sets therefore fyw is a potentially useful metric to better constrain the model outputs thereby limiting the model uncertainty keywords young water fractions hydrological model equifinality model calibration uncertainty data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction increasing model robustness requires dealing with different sources of uncertainties including model structural uncertainty parameter and simulation uncertainties renard et al 2011 vrugt et al 2008 of these parameter uncertainty is critical as it is generally attributed to the model simulation reliability bittner et al 2021 hartmann et al 2017a b wu et al 2021 in this regard diagnostic analysis is essential to ensure the model robustness with a detailed investigation of the model structural suitability performance analysis parameter identifiability and simulation uncertainty melsen and guse 2021 pfannerstill et al 2015 traditionally model parameterization is focused on a single variable typically discharge as it mainly characterizes the integrated response of the hydrological system guse et al 2016 széles et al 2020 however even if this approach yields a reasonable model performance it does not guarantee parameter identifiability and thus there is still a risk of parameter equifinality multiple parameter sets provide equally acceptable model simulations beven and freer 2001 beven 2006 kelleher et al 2017 this is mainly because model calibration based on the single variable could either conceal the system s hydrological functioning or may compensate for the model structural inadequacies for this

oxygen 18 18o and deuterium 2h is widely utilized in hydro geo logical modelling studies birkel et al 2020 mcguire and mcdonnell 2006 jasechko 2019 particularly in delineating the groundwater recharge

2018 preferential flow paths berghuijs and kirchner 2017 zhang et al 2020 and transient time distributions kaandorp et al 2018 jing et al 2019 for instance 18o is one of the perfect proxies in providing orthogonal information as to how water and solutes are partitioned stored and transported in the hydrological system fenicia et al 2008 kirchner 2006 seibert and mcdonnell 2002 therefore 18o is served as a useful metric for further understanding of local and global scale hydrological processes particularly flow and transport processes in the hydrological system e g fekete et al 2006 hartmann et al 2021a holmes et al 2020 on that account the inclusion of this information content into the model confinement increases the model simulation reliability either by identifying water partitioning across the model compartments e g ala aho et al 2017 piovano et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 or by better constraining the model output e g hartmann et al 2013a stadnyk and holmes 2020 zhang et al 2019 one valuable aspect of stable isotopes is that it enables us to estimate water age distributions that mainly refer to the water or solute travel time distributions ttds e g piovano et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 ttds reflect the different flow paths e g matrix conduit of a hydrological system based on a characteristic time scale for this reason ttd is employed as a system specific age

characteristics and flow paths berghuijs and kirchner 2017 mcdonnell and beven 2014 broadly the mean transit time mtt is used as a functional water age index as it provides valuable insight into the system s internal dynamics by integrating ttds into the single age metric e g hrachowitz et al 2011 piovano et al 2018 however the reliable quantification of mtt is often more difficult kirchner 2016a sprenger et al 2019 xiao et al 2022 and problematic seeger and weiler 2014 woolfenden and ginn 2009 for that there has been a subject of high interest in identifying alternative water age metrics which are more prone to capture the time variant hydrological characteristics benettin et al 2017a 2017b gou et al 2022 kirchner 2016b lutz et al 2018 on that ground since the system young water age predominantly reflects the hydrological functioning of fast and preferential flow pathways such as fissures cracks and fractures kirchner 2016a 2016b song et al 2017 it is more descriptive in capturing the temporal variations of the storage discharge dynamics jing et al 2019 maxwell et al 2019 rusjan et al 2019 in this respect as an emerging diagnostic metric discharge young water fraction fyw is one of the useful water age metrics that define a proportion of water younger than a certain threshold kirchner 2016a von freyberg et al 2018 stockinger et al 2019 fyw is mainly derived from the 18o composition of water by sinewave fitting to the amplitudes of input and output isotope signals while the threshold value is for instance represented by 2 3 months for the streamflow fyw kirchner 2016a 2016b since fyw principally characterizes the hydrological systems fast flow dynamics berghuijs and kirchner 2017 von freyberg et al 2018 zhang et al 2021 it potentially distinguishes the main contribution of the newly added water to the system discharge for that reason fyw could be a crucial benchmark to reveal and compare the system specific dynamics çallı et al 2023 gallart et al 2020 that are mainly controlled by the discrete flow characteristics fissures fractures and conduits this is especially important for fractured and karst water resources in which the fast flow component frequently dominates the system s hydrological functioning considering that using age based hydrological information in the model conditioning for karst hydrological models could enable us to identify more informative model realizations from the model output while simultaneously conveying more relevant hydrological information throughout the model parameterization nonetheless as a potential information content for the fast flow controlled karst hydrological systems in which way and to what extent fyw influences the model reliability remains unclear and needs to be examined the study explores to what extent the information content of discharge age plays a role in model parametrization as a calibration constraint as fyw filters the key information about the karst system s hydrological functioning and thus conveys the discharge age based knowledge throughout the model calibration we hypothesized that the robustness of karst water resources predictions could be achieved by constraining model output with fyw for this purpose we coupled a transport model storage selection function approach with a process oriented karst hydrological model varkarst to simulate the δ18o concentrations of discharge δ18oq and fyw derived from the volume weighted δ18o concentrations afterward we performed a multi variable calibration scheme by simultaneously searching a pareto optimal model output space from which hydrologically more informative model realizations could be extracted in doing that we kept δ18oq simulations as a model benchmark to disentangle the influence of fyw on the model robustness to test our hypothesis we applied our calibration approach to a large karst spring that contributes to the water supply of the city of vienna austria the findings offer a better representation of karst aquifers hydrological functioning in modelling studies thereby potentially providing a new research direction for the management of karst water resources 2 case study wasseralm karst spring vienna austria 2 1 experimental site the investigated karst system is located approximately 100 km southwest of vienna austria at the border between the styria and lower austria regions the study area lies in the higher part of the northern schneealpe on average 802 m above sea level fig 1 the schneealpe is a karst massive belonging to the northern calcareous alps dominated by triassic and upper jurassic carbonates bauer et al 2012 rank et al 2006 gasser et al 2009 in the study area the calcareous alpine unit is underlain by the impermeable layer consisting of shales and sandstones called the greywacke zone characterized by the complex internal structure due to the several tectonic and metamorphic events rank et al 1992 2006 gasser et al 2009 maloszewski et al 2002 the schneealpe karst massive consists of a 900 1000 m thickness of middle triassic carbonates triassic limestone and dolomite bauer et al 2012 rank et al 1992 this massive is characterized by a typical plateau an approximately 30 km2 dullinger et al 2001 which hosts several karst landforms including caves sinkholes polygenetic poljes and dry valleys bauer 1969 bauer et al 2012 hilberg 2016 due to the high karstification over the region approximately 75 of the precipitation quickly infiltrates into the aquifer system via karst landforms mainly by dolines and sinkholes e g gattinger 1980 bauer et al 2012 hilberg 2016 wasseralm spring is one of the drinking water sources of the city of vienna which was captured between 1894 and 1897 during the construction of the 1st vienna water line the karst aquifer is characterized by maloszewski 2000 and maloszewski et al 2002 as a dual system that consists of a less permeable fissured porous matrix with high storage capacity and a high permeable karstic channel with low storage capacity the mean daily discharge of the wasseralm spring is approximately 240 l s and it was classified as a typical dolomitic spring by bauer 1969 gattinger 1973 rank et al 2006 considering the hydrogeochemical characteristics of the karst groundwater in the study area the water type of the 1st vienna water line is characterized by the typical dolomitic limestone formation ca mg hco3 hydrochemical facies in which the main cations are ca2 67 and mg2 29 while hco3 represents the dominant anion by the 87 of total anions stadt wien 2023 last access 27 03 2023 the electrical conductivity ec values of the wasseralm spring vary between 260 and 283 µs cm rank et al 2006 the approximate recharge area for wasseralm spring and sieben springs was delineated by maloszewski et al 2002 at around 23 km2 while the catchment area for wasseralm spring was defined at 6 7 km2 by rank et al 2006 the mean annual precipitation including snow component is around 1360 mm 01 01 1993 31 12 2016 comprising potential evapotranspiration by nearly 350 mmy 1 maloszewski et al 2002 rank et al 2006 the snowmelt plays an important role in defining the recharge discharge processes of the karstic system which results in flashy flow characteristics in the hydrographs particularly for the spring season during which the wasseralm discharge reaches 1000 1200 l s 2 2 available data we used daily meteorological data including max min air temperature c atmospheric and vapour pressure hpa total and fresh snow depth cm wind speed mean relative humidity global radiation j cm 2 obtained at the mürzzuschlag weather station 758 m located at approximately 14 km southeast of the study area the daily precipitation data 01 01 1975 31 12 2016 at nasswald wasseralm nassbach weather station 774 m and wasseralm spring discharge data 01 01 1995 31 12 2016 were downloaded from https ehyd gv at table 1 the monthly stable oxygen 18 δ18o of precipitation δ18op and discharge δ18oq and monthly spring discharge data collected over 17 years 31 01 1973 27 11 1990 were digitized from the study of maloszewski et al 2002 according to the historical data record of δ18o the mean content of the annual volume weighted δ18op value was 11 18 with a median and standard deviation values 15 41 and 3 43 respectively the yearly content of δ18oq was represented by 11 81 with the median value of 11 7 and a standard deviation of 0 38 to adapt the time resolution of the measured isotope concentration to our modelling framework we interpolated monthly δ18op and spring discharge values to the daily values using the stepwise backward function and linear interpolation method respectively supplement a 3 methodology we explored the value of discharge young water fractions fyw as an additional information source for the model confinement therefore we coupled a karst hydrological model varkarst with a catchment scale transport model storage selection sas function the varkarst model s outputs effective recharge and discharge were used as prognostic forcing fluxes to feed the sas model this one way coupling allows us to avoid increasing the model structural complexity thereby keeping the number model parameters low and sticking to the principle of model parsimony for the model conditioning of the coupled model we simultaneously constrained a large model ensemble 1x106 realizations by the model performance on spring discharge and the model performance on the discharge young water fractions fyw by doing that we aimed to extract physically more realistic parameter sets from the model output the contribution of newly added discharge age based information content with fyw into the model confinement was then assessed by the uncertainty analysis of the model parameters discharge simulations and water balance estimates of model internal fluxes 3 1 models 3 1 1 stable isotope transport model for the simulation of δ18o concentration in spring discharge δ18oq and corresponding young water fractions fyw we used the storage selection sas function approach implemented in the tran sas package v 01 hereinafter referred to the sas model by benettin and bertuzzo 2018 the sas model focuses on the non stationary character of the transient time distributions ttds to temporarily differentiate water ages from reservoir storage this is accomplished by the rank aged storage concept e g benettin and bertuzzo 2018 botter et al 2011 smith et al 2018 which tracks water ages in storage thus identifying water age relationships between input and output water parcels the sas model numerically solves the solute tracer mass balance equation eq 1 in a control volume applied to each water parcel in storage to compute the concentration of an ideal tracer in the outflux it can be either discharge or evapotranspiration or both 1 dm dt c j j c q q c et e t where m is the tracer mass in storage j l3t 1 q l3t 1 and et l3t 1 refer to precipitation evapotranspiration and discharge c j ml 3 c q ml 3 and c et ml 3 denote the solute concentrations of each flux respectively for simplicity we only considered discharge as a system outflow to solve eq 1 thus adapting in our modelling framework the solute concentration of discharge c q t is then calculated by using the following formula 2 c q t 0 c j t t t p q t t d t here t t is the age of the water parcel or tracer defined by the time between the current time t t is the time of the water parcel entered into the system p q t t t 1 refers to ttds at time t which is calculated based on the age ranked storage s t t describing the amount of water in storage whose age is younger than or equal to age t at time t 3 p q t t ω s t t s t t where s t t defines ageing water storage and ω s t t is the travel time probability density function pdf expressing each water age t removed from the storage in the sas model the age distribution of the storage is defined based on the selection of an appropriate sas function e g power law beta function and gamma distributions in general the sas function is not known and obtained from the observed tracer based on the mass balance equation eq 1 by a set of model calibrations for our study we employed beta function as a suitable functional form to simulate c q ml 3 for our case the δ18o concentration of karst spring discharge the beta function is defined by a two shape parameter beta α β and expressed as follows visser et al 2019 4 beta α β t α 1 1 t β 1 ω q t where ω q refers to the pdfs of the age ranked discharge α and β represent the two positive shape parameters when the shape parameters are obtained as α 1 and β 1 it implies that there are no age preferences from the storage of interest thereby referring to the complete mixing process further the shape parameters α 1 and β 1 characterize younger ages while α 1 and β 1 indicates the age preferences for older ages e g benettin and bertuzzo 2018 nguyen et al 2021 the time variant fyw is not directly observed and thus it was derived from the volume weighted δ18o concentrations based on the discharge age distribution by editing the sas model codes therefore we computed dynamic fyw using the beta function form given eq 4 considering age ranked discharge generated by the sas model 5 f yw b e t a α β τ 0 τ w t α 1 1 t β 1 d t where τ yw is the threshold value of discharge young water age which was defined at 35 days for our spring discharge 3 1 2 simulation of karst discharge and groundwater storage dynamics the varkarst model hartmann et al 2013a was used to simulate spring discharge and groundwater storage dynamics the model separates the soil epikarst and groundwater reservoirs as sub routines to simulate i soil and epikarst depths ii fractions of concentrated and diffusive recharge to the groundwater iii epikarst hydrodynamics and iv groundwater dynamics brenner et al 2018 hartmann et al 2014 varkarst is structured by 8 parameters table 2 and forced on a daily time step with daily precipitation and potential evapotranspiration snowmelt is an important part of the aquifer recharge in mountainous karst catchments çallı et al 2022 xu et al 2022 therefore as the varkarst model structure does not include a snow module we implemented the snowmelt routine using the degree day concept in eq 6 kustas et al 2004 to represent snow accumulation and melting 6 melt d d f t i t m where melt accounts for snowmelt flux mmd 1 and ddf is the degree day factor mm c 1d 1 ti represents the average daily temperature in the day i while tm is the temperature at which snowmelt begins to pre process the precipitation as forcing input tm and ddf were set to 0 c and 3 5 mm c 1d 1 respectively the physically plausible parameter values for tm c and ddf mm c 1d 1 were obtained from the previous research in austrian catchments he et al 2014 parajka et al 2005 2007 daily potential evapotranspiration mmd 1 was estimated by the penman monteith approach allen et al 2006 3 2 modelling framework 3 2 1 parameter estimation procedure the model performance was measured by kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 eq 7 kge ranges from negative infinity to 1 with the optimum value of 1 7 kge 1 r 1 2 α 1 2 β 1 2 w i t h α σ s σ o a n d β μ s μ o where r is the linear correlation between the simulated and observed states α is the ratio for the standard deviations indicating the similarity between the simulated and observed variables β expresses the ratio of the mean of the simulated variable to the observed mean to assess the model performance on different model variables we applied kge separately on spring discharge kgeq δ18o concentration in spring discharge kgeδ 18 o and discharge young water fractions fyw kgefyw then we used the mathematical symbol of the intersection to refer to the combinations of each simulated variable thereby denoting kgeq kgefyw kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgeδ18o kgefyw as multi variable calibration constraints to obtain a continuous time series of fyw the sas model had to be parameterized for that reason we carried out a model calibration that fully explored the parameter space of the beta function with two shape parameters α and β afterward based on monthly simulated and observed δ18oq for 01 02 1975 27 11 1990 a threshold value of kge 0 4 was used to extract the behavioural δ18oq realizations from the model initial ensemble appendix a therefore we used the median of behavioural fyw simulations which were obtained from the behavioural δ18oq realizations as the calibration benchmark for the coupled model conditioning the model parameters of varkarst were sampled by the latin hypercube sampling lhs scheme based on the uniform distribution assumption the feasible parameter range was chosen from previous studies by maloszewski et al 2002 and hartmann et al 2016 table 2 the coupled model was run by 1x106 times on a daily time step using the parameter array of the varkarst model with the fixed sas model parameters α 0 85 and β 4 56 3 2 2 model conditioning scheme we ran the coupled model for 42 years over the period of 01 01 1975 31 12 2016 this was necessary since the data period for the δ18o concentrations of precipitation and discharge δ18op and δ18oq and observed daily spring discharge do not overlap with each other table 1 that way the varkarst model was conditioned by the period of 01 01 1995 31 12 2016 when discharge was available whereas the period between 01 01 1975 and 31 12 1990 was used to simulate δ18oq and corresponding fyw for both conditioning periods we applied separate split sampling tests klemeš 1986 the available data for daily spring discharge 01 01 1995 31 12 2016 was split into two sub periods thereby denoting the model calibration 01 10 1995 01 10 2008 and validation 02 10 2008 31 12 2016 similarly the sas model is covered by the periods of 26 01 1977 28 01 1983 for model calibration and 20 02 1983 27 10 1990 for validation an approximate 2 year period prior to the model calibration was allocated as a model warm up for each conditioning therefore the split sampling test procedure was performed on the observed daily discharge δ18oq and fyw to assess the performance of the coupled model 3 2 3 uncertainty quantification the estimation of parameter and simulation uncertainty was carried out similar to the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation glue methodology beven and binley 1992 to reveal the parameter uncertainty we reduced the initial parameter sets 1x106 by discarding model realizations below the threshold value of kge 0 75 this value was applied to each calibration constraint i e kgeq kgeq kgefyw kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgeδ18o kgefyw therefore we assessed the reduction in each parameter location to quantify the strength of the confinement based on the percentile method 25th and 75th percentiles the parameter and simulation uncertainties were then quantified by the reductions in the interquartile ranges iqr to assess the uncertainty in water balance for the simulated sum of model internal fluxes we considered the water balance estimates for the matrix and conduit compartments for that we used the whole simulation period 01 10 1995 30 09 2016 and the periods that reflect the dry and wet conditions 14 wet and 7 dry periods see supplement b 4 results 4 1 model output constrained by δ18o and fyw fig 2 a demonstrates the size reductions in the initial parameter ensemble 1x106 depending on the applied calibration constraints that successfully met the threshold value of kge 0 75 overall both kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgefyw significantly reduce the initial ensemble as compared to kgeq with 15 530 realizations specifically kgeq kgefyw 0 75 distinctly differs from other constraints in that it ensures a notable reduction in the initial ensemble with 3462 realizations out of one million ensemble the reduction is also much higher than that of kgeq kgδ18o accounted by 5048 behavioural runs notably kgeq kgefyw kgeδ18o lead to a fair reduction in the initial parameter size as compared to kgeq kgeδ18o with a more confined range by the parameter size reduction of 89 fig 2b demonstrates the surface plots indicating the distribution of model performance for an ensemble of one million run based on the model competing criteria kge for each variable on the left side of the figure the model output is simultaneously confined by the model performance on spring discharge kgeq and the model performance on fyw kgefyw similarly the right side of the panel indicates the model confinement by the model performance on spring discharge kgeq and the model performance on δ18oq kgeδ18o overall a more condensed bump called the pareto optimal model region enables us to capture a higher model performance efficiency for both aspects of the model ensemble implying the better representation of the discharge and fyw for this reason the region satisfying the pareto optimal solutions is more prone to convey hydrologically more versatile information this information essentially refers to the extracted process based knowledge of the system water age preferences captured by the model therefore it is fair to infer that kgeq kgefyw is a reasonable choice as a calibration constraint to capture more informative model realizations from the initial ensemble this is mainly because kgeq kgefyw can successfully meet a better model refinement in identifying both aspects of each realization on the pareto optimal model region represented by approximately 0 65 kgeq and 0 65 0 8 kgefyw by comparison the model output confined by kgeq kgeδ18o illustrates relatively sporadic pareto region in which one does not necessarily guarantee that the better model performance on discharge kgeq ensure a higher model efficiency on the simulation of δ18oq 4 2 model parameter uncertainty the behavioural parameter sets from the split sampling test procedure kgeq 0 75 kgeq kgeδ18o 0 75 and kgeq kgefyw 0 75 and model validation results are provided in table 3 overall the behavioural parameter sets obtained by kgeq kgefyw 0 75 provide relatively successful model validation with a kge value of 0 71 0 01 ensemble mean standard deviation thus indicating an improvement in the model performance as compared to those with kgeq 0 61 0 04 and kgeq kgeδ18o 0 67 0 02 the posterior distributions of the behavioural parameter sets obtained by each calibration constraint are provided in fig 3 overall the inclusion of both information sources substantially reduce the parameter uncertainty fig 3a table 3 while simultaneously providing better parameter identifiability in fig 3b 6 parameters out of 8 in total more specifically the changes in the distance between the 25th and 75th percentiles of several parameter locations including agw ke d αf kc mm and a km2 reveal the considerable impact of the additional information sources on the applied confinement strategy here the ranges of parameters are substantially confined by the applied calibration constraint all of which are represented by rather narrower iqrs thus allowing a significant reduction in the parameter uncertainty except for ase and vs mm for instance the reduction in the parameter range for αgw is around 43 by kgeq kgefyw and 35 by kgeq kgeδ18o as compared to kgeq alone further the parameter kc d loosely corresponds to its initial range by the calibration constraints without auxiliary information sources 31 for both δ18o and fyw similarly the iqr reduction in parameter αf is nearly 18 by kgeq kgeδ18o and 24 by kgeq kgefyw here ke d is the second parameter whose uncertainty is fairly reduced by the inclusion of fyw information content thereby providing a rather narrow bandwidth fig 3a with the lower median values of 29 71 d by kgeq kgeδ18o and 27 17 d by kgeq kgefyw notably kgeq kgefyw leads to substantial confinement for ke d thus ensuring a narrower iqr with a 37 bandwidth reduction as compared to kgeq kgeδ18o table 3 ke also represents one of the more identifiable model parameters together with a km2 when it is confined by kgeq kgefyw fig 3a demonstrates that the range for vs mm is not necessarily affected by the inclusion of additional information sources by comparison it indicates relatively better confinement by kgeq kgefyw with a median value of 281 35 mm contrarily kgeq kgeδ18o better reduces the parameter distance of ve mm than that of kgeq kgefyw with a reduction of 8 kgeq kgefyw results in similar confinement as in kgeq kgeδ18o for a km2 while providing similar median values 6 15 km2 and 6 20 km2 respectively further kgeq kgeδ18o kgefyw decreases the median value of αf without satisfying any further reduction in iqr for kgeq kgeδ18o however neither kgeq kgeδ18o nor kgeq kgefyw confirms any further refinement in the parameter range for soil epikarst depth variability constant ase except for shifting the median values 1 04 and 0 76 respectively instead both calibration constraints result in an increment in the parameter uncertainty 25 by kgeq kgeδ18o and 12 by kgeq kgefyw this finding is also indicated by the identifiability plot for ase which is represented by plateau like shapes for each model constraint fig 3b 4 3 model simulation uncertainty the behavioural simulations for δ18oq and fyw are displayed in fig 4 overall the model reasonably simulates each variable while better capturing the hydrological variations over the simulation periods yet although the simulations of discharge isotopic composition δ18oq fig 4a mainly reflect the seasonal pattern of observed δ18oq there are still instabilities starting from the mid of 1981 until 1984 during which the model generally overestimates the δ18oq simulations this therefore results in a wider uncertainty for δ18oq simulations conversely fyw is well established by the model both for calibration 1978 1983 and validation 1984 1990 periods in which the upper bound of the confidence interval better resembles the benchmark fyw as opposed to the lower bound fig 4b the simulation uncertainty of daily spring discharge 01 01 1995 31 12 2016 is provided in fig 5 this figure further reveals to what extent the simulation uncertainty is reduced by the inclusion of each information content δ18o and fyw into the model calibration overall the 95 confidence bound of kgeq kgefyw exhibits a relatively narrower bandwidth than that of kgeq kgeδ18o thereby allowing a reasonable reduction in the discharge simulation uncertainty with the bandwidth reduction of 14 in total 10 by kgeq kgeδ18o this reduction is more visible over the calibration period 01 10 1999 01 10 2004 during which spring discharge low flow are relatively better captured by kgeq kgefyw fig 3c however discharge high flow is not entirely confined by both constraints kgeq kgefyw and kgeq kgeδ18o especially during the time over which snowmelt mainly dominates the spring discharge such as may june 2006 and 2009 4 4 uncertainty in water balance components the uncertainty in water balance components i e effective recharge reff mmy 1 actual evapotranspiration aet mmy 1 and spring discharge qspring mmy 1 are provided in fig 6 a c here the mean annual contribution of each component is estimated for the whole simulation period 01 10 1995 30 09 2016 as well as two contrasting hydrological conditions wet and dry periods further the effective recharge and discharge for the matrix reffmatrix and qmatrix and conduit reffconduit and qconduit compartments are demonstrated to assess the uncertainty in model internal fluxes fig 6d e overall fig 6 reveals that fyw plays a critical role in reducing uncertainty for the water balance estimates particularly for reff and qspring however hardly any confinement in the uncertainty bounds is achieved by the inclusion of δ18oq information into model calibration particularly for the aet estimates which results in an increased simulation uncertainty with an approximate value of 34 conversely fyw leads to a significant reduction in the uncertainty bound by nearly 22 to a certain extent the inclusion of fyw information into model calibration provides higher mean values for aet 273 9 mmy 1 for whole 270 3 mmy 1 for wet and 278 7 mmy 1 for dry periods than those by δ18oq 266 4 mmy 1 262 9 mmy 1 and 271 1 mmy 1 in the same manner compatibly slightly less reff with the mean value of 1094 4 mmy 1 was estimated by fyw than δ18oq with the mean value of 1103 0 mmy 1 for the whole simulation period therefore fyw reasonably maintains less estimates for qspring 1094 6 mmy 1 1168 4 mmy 1 and 996 3 mmy 1 as opposed to the values obtained by δ18oq 1103 5 mmy 1 1178 4 mmy 1 and 1003 6 mmy 1for whole wet and dry periods respectively fig 6d e indicates the added value of fyw information content for the model calibration in that the better confinement in the water balances for matrix and conduit compartments are ensured overall the iqr reductions in both compartments are accounted for approximately 43 by the inclusion of fyw into the model calibration whereas δ18oq represents the reduction by 32 here the confinement by fyw for the estimated water balance of both components effective recharge and discharge under dry periods is slightly better than that of wet conditions 42 vs 40 comparatively the mean annual contributions of reffconduit and qconduit are slightly better constrained than reffmatrix and qmatrix additionally fyw leads to a fair decline in the estimated mean values of reffconduit and qconduit 538 5 mmy 1 and 538 7 mmy 1 as compared to δ18oq 566 6 mmy 1 and 566 8 mmy 1 likewise the higher mean values of reffmatrix and qmatrix 555 9 mmy 1 and 595 6 mmy 1 are obtained by fyw than those by δ18oq 536 4 mmy 1 and 574 9 mmy 1 5 discussion in this study we presented the added value of fyw as a derived information content from the volume weighted δ18o concentrations as a calibration constraint to increase the robustness of karst model predictions overall the split sample test results table 3 the physically meaningful parameter sets fig 3 the reduction in the parameter and simulation uncertainties fig 3 fig 5 as well as the improved estimates of the water balance components fig 6 prove the reasonable improvement in the model robustness this therefore indicates that fyw could be used as a useful calibration constraint 5 1 plausibility of estimated model parameters the feasible parameter range obtained by both kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgefyw can be used as effective parameters to characterize the hydrological behaviour of the karstic catchment fig 3a with their more identifiable ranges fig 3b to a certain extent the parameters including αf a km2 ke d and vs mm ve mm are mainly associated with the properties of the soil and epikarst reservoirs and thus each of which is strongly related to the physical characteristics of the karst aquifer by reflecting the hydrological hydrodynamic behaviour of the system spellman et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 similarly the deep groundwater zone parameters including kc d and αgw are also strongly confined by the additional information sources δ18o and fyw ve mm is one of the critical parameters that controls the flow and transport processes in the karst aquifers especially inferring the solute storage and mixing processes e g perrin et al 2003 schuler et al 2020 spellman et al 2022 wang et al 2022 however it is not a trivial task to obtain an identifiable value for ve mm during the model parametrization mainly due to the lack of state flux observations e g soil moisture in the soil and epikarst zones berthelin et al 2020 çallı et al 2022 for that reason the estimated values for the soil and epikarst zone are frequently assessed by soft knowledge and or expert elicitation considering the catchment hydro geo logical and physical characteristics in this sense the median value of ve mm represented by 996 mm kgeq kgeδ18o and 970 mm kgeq kgefyw reasonably overlap the physical characteristics of the karstic system maloszewski et al 2002 table 3 formed under highly karstified regions bauer 1969 bauer et al 2012 hilberg 2016 similarly the obtained values for vs mm by both calibration constraints 225 mm and 281 mm typically refer to the existence of a thin soil zone over the karst catchment this finding is particularly compatible with the fact that soil thickness in karst regions is rather thin and frequently patchy hilberg 2016 furthermore as the schneealpe karst massive is represented by the mid height range mountainous karst region which cannot exceed the highest tree line the soil and vegetation cover e g alpine pastureland and grassland are generally thin dullinger et al 2001 droin et al 2018 gasser et al 2009 ke d diagnoses the timing of flow predominantly occurring from the epikarst to the matrix reservoir for instance the lower values for ke d are mainly associated with shorter travel time in the epikarst zone thereby resembling the higher percolation rate from the epikarst to the matrix considering this the more reasonable and identifiable range for ke d is therefore obtained by the inclusion of the fyw information content into the model calibration fig 3a table 3 further ke is accounted for a relatively lower median value of 27 17 d than those of kgeq kgeδ18o 29 71 d and kgeq 39 67 d somewhat the estimated values of ke d by kgeq kgefyw mainly correspond to the physical characteristics of schneealpe massive maloszewski et al 2002 rank et al 2006 due to the high karstification e g bauer et al 2012 hilberg 2016 similarly the substantial reduction in the parameter uncertainty for ke d by fyw around 38 upholds that since fyw predominantly characterizes the existence of the preferential flow paths çallı et al 2023 it is more informative about the epikarst related hydraulic properties especially where the soil cover is very limited as in our case area fig 3a a fair confinement in the initial range for the parameter a km2 is achieved both by kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgefyw fig 3a thus providing similar iqr reductions with an approximate value of 13 additionally the parameter range of a km2 with the median values of 6 15 km2 by kgeq kgeδ18o and 6 20 km2 by kgeq kgefyw is physically plausible table 2 in that both values mainly agree with the finding by rank et al 2006 in which the recharge area for the wasseralm spring was estimated around 6 70 km2 given the fact that a km2 is the most sensitive model parameter see appendix b it may dominate the model results by compensating for the model performance with the non identifiable and or physically non meaningful values indeed this compensation is generally considered as one of the calibration problems for modelling studies in karst water resources e g hartmann et al 2013a 2013b mudarra et al 2019 especially when the model is only conditioned by the discharge variable without considering any additional information sources such as hydrochemical signatures and water stable isotopes hence the estimated values for a km2 by both model constraints could also be seen as a crucial outcome to reinforce the obtained values for the soil and epikarst reservoirs vs mm and ve mm since both reservoirs typically represent the shallow sub systems of the karst aquifers chang et al 2019 yu et al 2021 the storage capacity of each reservoir is strongly dependent on the variable contributing recharge area hartmann et al 2015 mudarra et al 2019 for that reason the physically meaningful range obtained for a km2 by fyw and δ18o reasonably supports the estimated values for vs and ve fig 3a the high values for ve mm and low values for ke d entail that the model simulates an increased amount of diffusive percolation rate from the epikarst to the matrix storage thus resulting in a reduction in the amount of concentrated recharge from the epikarst to the conduit this hydrodynamical behaviour is perfectly resembled by relatively higher values of kc d with the mean value of 7 79 d by kgeq kgefyw by which the diffusive recharge is more than concentrated recharge likewise the parameter agw which essentially controls the mean residence time of the water in the matrix reservoir is notably constrained by kgeq kgefyw 43 fig 3a this finding is in an agreement with the slightly better confinement in the estimated water balance components of the matrix reservoir reffmatrix 42 and qmatrix 42 by kgeq kgefyw as compared to the conduit reffconduit 40 and qconduit 41 fig 6d e furthermore the low values of agw and ase demonstrate the development of preferential flow paths over the karst aquifer ford and williams 2007 because our site is characterized by a high degree of karstification bauer et al 2012 hilberg 2016 the values obtained by kgeq kgeδ18o and kgeq kgefyw are therefore physically more reasonable however ase is not necessarily constrained by both information sources either fyw or δ18o this can be explained by the fact that since ase plays a major role in regulating the spatial variability of the depth of soil epikarst reservoirs ve mm and vs mm the distinct physical representation of this parameter in a rather small catchment for our case the recharge contributing area a was defined by around 6 5 km2 may not be possible thus resulting in less identifiability for ase fig 3b 5 2 improved estimates of model simulations and water balance components it is noteworthy that the inclusion of fyw information content into the model calibration fairly increases the model skill in the validation period table 3 by providing better model performance on discharge simulations with a lower standard deviation 0 71 0 01 as compared to those by kgeq kgeδ18o 0 61 0 02 and kgeq 0 67 0 04 this finding underpins the reliability of the behavioral parameter set by kgeq kgefyw fig 3 additionally even though the model calibration was performed under relatively wet conditions the parameter sets are still representative of the model validation relatively dry year period it should also be noted that the model did not perform well in simulating δ18o concentrations in spring discharge fig 4a hence resulting in overestimation in the model simulations for certain time periods this could be either attributed to the sas model structural inadequacy or associated with the weak parameterization of the sas model that is strongly dependent on the selected functional form for our case the sas model was parametrized by the beta function one critical reason for this overestimation could also be attributed to the evaporation process occurring over the soil epikarst atmosphere interface since evaporation from soil particularly influences the evaporation related heavy isotope enrichment in the shallow zone waters soil and epikarst e g koeniger et al 2016 liu et al 2022 the uncertainties in the estimation of actual evaporation by the model could result in some instabilities in the δ18oo simulations fig 4a to a certain extent as the soil zone represents the shallow water depth with relatively slow water movement the light isotopes e g 16o are more likely to evaporate than the heavy isotopes e g 18o ultimately leading to enrichment in the heavy isotope concentration δ18o in water content e g gat and gonfiantini 1981 koeniger et al 2016 the consistency in model results also requires diagnosing the simulation uncertainty in the model internal fluxes and water balance components particularly considering the hydrological variability in the model simulations e g shafii and tolson 2015 in this regard the positive influence of fyw on the model consistency is more visible for the reduction in the simulated water balance uncertainty fig 6 especially considering the simulated sum of model internal fluxes matrix and conduit compartments fig 6d e to some extent the information content of fyw ensures an improved estimate in the water balance thus constraining the simulation uncertainties for three water budget components i e reff aet and qspring fig 6a c moreover the estimated mean values of all three components are compatible with the site conditions where the mean annual precipitation is around 1360 mm which comprises the potential evapotranspiration by nearly 350 mmy 1 maloszewski et al 2002 rank et al 2006 specifically reff contributes to the annual water budget by the mean value of 1103 mmy 1 while aet and qspring are estimated by 274 mmy 1and 1095 mmy 1 respectively fig 6d e additionally the iqr reductions in water budget components by kgeq kgefyw are even more than those in dry periods for the matrix and conduit compartments 43 this could be explained by the fact that the saturations of both compartments are likely to decrease under dry conditions during which both reservoirs are more prone to capture vertical infiltration from the soil epikarst reservoirs trček 2007 zhang et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 by comparison as the soil and epikarst reservoirs are relatively saturated partially or completely during wet periods incoming water prefers to move laterally rather than vertically infiltrate in turn bypassing a large part of the matrix components aquilina et al 2006 aley and kirkland 2012 tobin et al 2021 therefore most of the spring discharge is characterized by saturation excess water transferring through the preferential flow paths fractures conduits etc indeed this hydrodynamic behaviour is particularly common in highly karstified plateaus in which karstic landforms such as sinkhole frequency are relatively high as in our case area the mean annual recharge contributions of the matrix and conduit compartments to the karst aquifer s water budget are quite similar fig 6d e this indicates that although the matrix environment volumetrically dominates the total storage of the aquifer the highly conductive conduit is still largely responsible for the system s hydrological response additionally due to the fast hydrological response concentrated and rapid infiltration recharge into the conduit the conduit represents the most vulnerable part of karstic systems e g hartmann et al 2021a liu et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 to the changes in the aquifer boundary such as climate land use and contamination risks çelik and çallı 2021 bittner et al 2018 ravbar 2013 for that reason reducing uncertainties in the water balance of the conduit compartment by the inclusion of fyw information content in model calibration is valuable to obtain robust predictions fig 6d e this is particularly important in defining solutions for contamination related problems in karst water resources likewise as a more stable part of the karst aquifer the uncertainty reduction in the water balance estimates for the matrix component enables for better capturing of realistic predictions especially under hydrologically dry periods therefore given that fyw is a process diagnostic metric to distinguish fast and slow recharge and groundwater dynamics this additional information content could be helpful for water management plans it should also be considered that the model simulations are slightly better resembled by fyw than δ18oq figs 2 5 furthermore handling the simulation uncertainties by δ18o for the water balance components is not entirely possible for our case fig 6 one possible explanation would be the transformation of monthly δ18o values δ18oq and δ18op into daily values table 1 supplement a which may result in less biased fyw derived from the daily measured isotope however considering physically meaningful parameters obtained by the inclusion of fyw into the model calibration scheme fig 2 and fig 3 the reasonable simulations fig 4 and thus improved estimates for the water budget components fig 6 we are convinced by the fact that fyw is valuable as a time variant hydrological signature to fairly increase the model reliability this is primarily because fyw reflects the fast response characteristics of the hydrological system as conduit dominated flow in karst aquifer rather than focusing on an overall system behaviour as opposed to δ18oo 5 3 the equifinality considering the information content of discharge stable isotope and fyw the initial parameter set constrained against the discharge variable with the threshold value for kge 0 75 kgeq 0 75 is encouraging to reasonably resemble the system s hydrological response figs 2 5 however this does not necessarily mean that the behavioural parameter set by kgeq 0 75 does correspond to the physically meaningful parameters indeed the parameter equifinality can still exist khatami et al 2019 sarrazin et al 2022 thereby implying that there are still unfavourable parameter values providing physically implausible model simulations and or model internal fluxes and states çallı et al 2022 hartmann et al 2021b fortunately the reduction of parameter equifinality can be reduced by the additional observations in the model calibration such as soil moisture and infiltration process understanding ford et al 2017 kelleher et al 2017 as well as introducing additional information sources into the model calibration scheme in this respect the model robustness can be achieved by the inclusion of δ18o and fyw information contents fig 3 and fig 5 into the model calibration in that physically more plausible and identifiable model parameters are obtained by kgeq kgefyw and kgeq kgeδ18o fig 3 therefore the behavioural parameter sets for both δ18o and fyw confidentially provide better discharge simulations annual water balance estimates and model internal fluxes fig 5 fig 6 thereby eliminating the model equifinality as compared to kgeq alone the multi variable calibration facilitates limiting the number of behavioural simulations by searching for more informative realizations on the pareto optimal model output fig 2b this therefore leads to a fair reduction in the broad range of acceptable solutions fig 2a more specifically the added value of fyw is distinguishable in providing physically more meaningful and identifiable model parameters fig 3b particularly considering the plausible values for the sensitive model parameters a km2 ke d appendix b therefore the behavioural parameter set that met kgeq kgefyw 0 75 ensures a fair improvement in the model simulations for the spring discharge table 3 thus better resembling the discharge s high flow characteristics fig 5 where snowmelt dominates the spring flow behaviour this implies that fyw either better imprints the key hydrodynamics of the karstic system or it mainly reflects the system s responsive characteristics as closely as it was structured in the model architecture either way this makes fyw a more robust and dynamic diagnostic metric in exploring more informative model realizations from the model output especially for limiting the parameter equifinality this interpretation could also be associated with the findings by kirchner 2016a 2016b in that fyw offers a mechanistic explanation of heterogeneous system characteristics and thus reveals the system s hydrological response and its underlying process 6 conclusions this paper presents the first attempt at revealing the added value of discharge young water fractions fyw in the model calibration to increase the model robustness by incorporating the information content of fyw as a calibration constraint we fairly increased the parameter reliability while obtaining physically more plausible parameter sets and reducing the model equifinality the main findings from the study are as followed as an additional information source fyw could enable us to capture system hydrodynamic behaviour while simultaneously defining the storage mixing process based on the water age distribution fyw is a time variant process diagnostic metric to better constrain the model outputs and identify the hydrologically more informative model realizations on the pareto front in which water age information could be conveyed throughout the behavioural model realizations fyw could either be used as an alternative calibration constraint to increase the model reliability or be served as a useful diagnostic metric in the tracer aided or isotope enabled hydrological models in this respect fyw could be used as a response variable for the calibration of rainfall runoff models to disentangle the dynamics of streamflow specifically it could unravel as to how streamflow functions in a changing world particularly considering the impact of climate change and contamination risks on the fast flow component therefore since fyw is a hydrological system specific and time variant process signature it could allow us to judge the model reliability by the examination of the multiple model structures model compartments and model internal fluxes thereby diagnosing the model structural

1849,flow velocity is an important indicator when evaluating rill erosion flow dynamics in recent decades incorporating straw in farmland fields has become an effective method of utilizing maize straw resources however the effect of straw incorporation on the rill flow velocity of sloping farmland is unclear in this study experimental treatments with three gradients of maize straw length 6 9 and 12 cm incorporation depth 9 12 and 15 cm and straw amount 1000 4500 and 8000 kg ha 1 were set up flow velocity was measured via an electrolyte tracer measurement system and the comprehensive effect of straw incorporation on the rill erosion flow velocity of sloping farmland was clarified using structural equation modeling the results showed that the mean flow velocity of straw incorporated sloping land was 0 120 0 189 m s 1 which was 13 25 44 92 lower than that of bare land the flow path became convoluted owing to the residual straw on the soil surface which increased the flow resistance thereby reducing the flow velocity straw length had the greatest effect on flow velocity with a contribution rate of 46 67 and significant increases in velocity were observed with increases in straw length owing to the water collecting function of the exposed straw on the soil surface in addition the flow velocity increased with an increase in runoff and decreased with an increase in infiltration but had no evident response to sediment yield increasing the straw amount had a negative impact on soil bulk density and infiltration resulting in an increase in rill flow velocity the incorporation depth had a very small effect on flow velocity the results are helpful for understanding the changes in rill flow velocity and interpreting the soil erosion process on sloping farmland with straw incorporation keywords rill flow velocity straw incorporation straw length straw amount incorporation depth sloping farmland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flow velocity is an important indicator for evaluating the dynamic mechanism of soil erosion and represents the basis for determining many of the hydrodynamic parameters of runoff liu et al 2020a yang et al 2018 during rill erosion on hillslopes flow velocity is influenced by discharge sediment infiltration slope roughness flow resistance and soil properties di stefano et al 2019 2022 giménez and govers 2008 nicosia et al 2022 wang et al 2020 and directly related to soil detachment transport and deposition rahma et al 2013 yang et al 2020 zhuang et al 2018 in rill erosion the mean flow velocity can be estimated by the flow regime method and the flow resistance law di stefano et al 2022 the flow regime method refers to estimating the flow velocity as a power function of flow discharge which is a quantitative relationship derived from both river hydraulics and extensive measurements in rills di stefano et al 2013 leopold and maddock 1953 on the cross section of rills the mean velocity can be calculated by dividing flow discharge by the cross sectional area leopold and maddock 1953 an increase in flow discharge leads to an increase in velocity while the cross sectional width and depth are affected by a feedback of flow discharge thereby inhibiting the increase in velocity di stefano et al 2013 the flow resistance law is an empirical equation including flow resistance coefficients such as those of chezy manning and darcy weisbach di stefano et al 2022 the detachment and deposition of sediments during erosion reshape the rill geometry and adjust the flow channel roughness nearing et al 1997 thereby changing flow resistance coefficients and affecting the flow velocity huang et al 2018 liu et al 2020a as the rill shape is difficult to determine and accurate flow resistance coefficients are not easily obtained govers 1992 the flow regime method was adopted in this study furthermore the movement of sediment in the flow can dissipate flow energy and increase the sediment viscosity coefficient resulting in a decrease in the rill flow velocity zhang et al 2010 runoff is generated at the surface when the rate of incoming water is greater than the infiltration rate which influences the runoff coefficient wang et al 2022b wang et al 2020 residue mulching on soil surface can increase the soil roughness and darcy weisbach coefficient thereby reducing rill flow velocity omidvar et al 2019 rahma et al 2017 rahma et al 2019 in addition soil properties can influence the runoff process and sediment concentration such as the soil bulk density bd total porosity tp field capacity fc soil organic matter som and humic substances hs hieke and schmidt 2013 liu et al 2020b mamedov et al 2016 sun et al 2020 tian et al 2017 resulting in the changes in flow velocity maize is a major crop worldwide and the annual production of maize straw resources is enormous in china reaching 216 03 mt yr 1 liu et al 2022 maize straw incorporation is widely applied and has been promoted by the government li et al 2018a li et al 2020 attributed to its stouter stalks and thicker leaves crushed maize straw is typically characterized by larger width and volume compared with wheat straw leys et al 2010 fresh maize straw also has a significantly higher c n ratio and hemicellulose content than wheat straw resulting in slower decomposition min et al 2022 thapa et al 2022 wang et al 2012 undecomposed fine debris has clear edges and perimeters which could result in high frictional retardation in shallow water flows dunkerley 2003 owing to the miniaturization of agricultural machinery straw incorporation on sloping farmland has become convenient and can save considerable human labor chen et al 2017 generally straw incorporation has a positive impact on the physical chemical and biological properties of agricultural soils and improves crop yields adimassu et al 2019 alijani et al 2012 straw return can maintain soil moisture zhao et al 2022 because it reduces evaporation and increases infiltration li et al 2018b montenegro et al 2013 straw decomposition is beneficial for soil carbon sequestration nutrient accumulation enzymatic activity improvement and fungal and bacterial growth berhane et al 2020 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 zhang and marschner 2017 zhao et al 2016 in a previous study implementing a long term 10 year straw return strategy significantly increased soil organic carbon storage by 32 44 in the 0 100 cm layer but decreased inorganic carbon storage xie et al 2023 however straw return also increases soil nitrous oxide and methane emissions jiang et al 2019 li et al 2021 excess straw return has a negative impact on crop yields liu et al 2022 soil properties and residual straw vary depending on the working conditions such as the straw type straw crushing length incorporation depth and incorporation amount franti et al 1996a franti et al 1996b straw return is considered an effective method for controlling soil erosion and nutrient loss dai et al 2018 li et al 2020 prosdocimi et al 2016 changes in the soil environment caused by straw incorporation can affect soil erosion resistance and runoff hydrodynamics which differentiate the erosion process along rills from that along conventionally cultivated sloping land keesstra et al 2019 knapen et al 2008 straw return decreases the reynolds and froude numbers and increases the soil roughness di stefano et al 2022 liu et al 2021 omidvar et al 2019 giménez and govers 2008 found that when straw was incorporated to a soil depth of 7 8 cm the mean flow velocity prominently decreased with the increase in the straw incorporation rate when the flow rate was 16 68 l min 1 the application of 4 3 t ha 1 straw to the field reduced the flow velocity by 50 liu et al 2020a found that the flow velocity exponentially decreases with an increase in wheat straw incorporation rates and can be reduced by more than half when the incorporation rate is 8 t ha 1 and the mixed depth is 20 cm wang et al 2019 found that when litter is incorporated into the topsoil within a depth of 5 cm the overland flow velocity varies from 0 061 to 0 114 m s 1 furthermore wheat straw mulched at 8 t ha 1 increased soil loss under heavy rainfall conditions owing to the water collecting effect of straw in rill and reduction of the erosion resistant soil seal rahma et al 2017 in general many researchers have used remolded soil indoors to study the mechanical effects of fresh straw covering the surface in such experiments the flow is applied to the shear planes caused by straw which can change the surface tension frictional drag and shear stress thereby changing rill flow velocity however indoor experiments with remolded soil are vastly different from field experiments with in situ soil and the hydraulic conditions of rill investigated in field experiments are closer to the situation on actual farmland di stefano et al 2022 moreover the variations in rill velocity caused by the changes in soil physiochemical properties following straw decomposition have not been considered in addition different working conditions of straw length straw incorporation depth and straw amount will cause variations in rill velocity the dye tracer method is widely used to measure rill flow velocity yang et al 2020 however in most studies the movement of dyes is tracked by visual observation and involves considerable human error di stefano et al 2021 the incorporation and mulching of straw increase the difficulty in observing the tracer movement resulting in inaccurate records of tracer migration time and large errors in flow velocity calculations in addition the surface velocity needs to use a correction factor to obtain the average velocity and the reynolds number and rill shape positively affect correction factor yang et al 2020 indeed the hydraulic characteristics and shape of rill sections under straw return conditions are complex and changeable making it difficult to measure the correction factor liu et al 2020a by contrast the electrolyte tracer method has been successfully applied to velocity measurements for residual mulch on the soil surface with the advantages of high accuracy and small error feng et al 2020 gao et al 2021 lei et al 2010 lei et al 2005 shi et al 2015 liu et al 2021 and rahma et al 2013 have used this method to measure the flow velocity on straw mulched soil surfaces and revealed that it could produce accurate measurements even at flow velocities as low as 0 06 m s 1 therefore we hypothesized that the shape and distribution of straw incorporated in soil might have a blocking or concentrating effect on water flow resulting in a decrease or increase in flow velocity hypothesis i moreover straw residue and decomposition can affect the soil infiltration capacity and erosion processes by changing the soil physicochemical properties thereby indirectly influencing flow velocity during the erosion process hypothesis ii in this study we used the electrolyte tracer method to trace the flow velocity on hillslopes under straw incorporation with three gradients straw length incorporation depth and straw amount the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the response of rill flow velocity on hillslopes to straw length straw incorporation depth and straw returning amount and 2 to systematically evaluate the effect of the key factors influencing rill flow velocity under straw incorporating conditions in situ 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted in the shuangheyu catchment 118 7 14 52 e 35 38 8 34 n which is in the northern rocky mountainous area of china the catchment covers an area of 0 24 km2 and is at an altitude of 198 m it has a temperate continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 13 7 c and mean annual rainfall of 803 0 mm approximately 70 of the rainfall is concentrated in summer which is short and intense and can induce serious soil erosion the soil type is sandy loam as classified by the usda soil classification system and consists of 68 7 sand 1 4 clay and 29 9 silt this type of soil is prone to erosion during heavy rainfall balacco 2013 maize is widely planted in rocky and hilly areas because it is highly drought resistant straw incorporation by rotary tillage is a common agricultural management strategy in the study area fig 1 shows the residual straw on the soil surface after rotary tillage maize incorporation in this catchment and the surrounding areas has been conducted for approximately 10 years and this is representative of the practices in the northern rocky mountainous area of china sample collections in the field and runoff plot experiments were conducted in october 2021 2 2 experimental design and processes in this study an orthogonal l9 33 array was used to arrange three factors with three gradients straw length 6 9 and 12 cm incorporation depth 9 12 and 15 cm and straw amount 1000 4500 and 8000 kg ha 1 table 1 the gradients of each factor were determined by the cultivation measures and straw return standard operating quality for straw smashing machines ny t 500 2015 the standard requires a straw crushing length of 10 cm to ensure the reliability and applicability of the results the measured straw length was 6 12 cm which reflected the actual straw crushing length the straw incorporation depth was set to 9 15 cm according to the common rototilling depth according to the local agricultural situation and crop yields 8000 4500 and 1000 kg ha 1 correspond to the full amount of straw half amount of straw and the amount of residues left after maize harvesting respectively a runoff plot 5 0 8 m was constructed on in situ sloping farmland fig 2 a all treatments were repeated three times plus the control group for 28 plots the slope of sloping farmland in this area is 5 15 the gentle slopes of 5 are leveled whereas slopes of 15 are terraced the 10 slope was selected to build the plots based on preliminary tests the soil slope direction and management of all plots were consistent after the maize harvest in november 2020 the air dried maize stalks were crushed using a chopper yielding the specified lengths of straw the straw amount was multiplied by the plot area to get actual straw amount for runoff plot the weighed straw was evenly distributed on the plot soil surface and then incorporated at different depths using a rototiller fig 1 based on local tillage cultivation 7 5 g m 2 of urea nitrogen was applied to each plot to decrease the c n ratio notably the differences in soil properties between the plots were caused by the different straw treatments before and during the experiment the weather was sunny and the soil was dry for several consecutive days soil at 0 5 cm depth was collected from each plot before scouring and the soil moisture of all plots was 5 5 to 6 7 which had no influence on the soil erosion process li et al 2022 based on the local precipitation data and previous tests it was determined that the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h 1 conformed to the rainfall intensity with a return period of 50 years which would lead to obvious rills on sloping farmland by multiplying the rain intensity by the plot area the flow discharge during the scouring test was 8 l min 1 over a duration of 40 min in the scouring test a peristaltic pump was used at the top of the plot to provide constant flow discharge within relative error of 3 the pump flow was energy dissipated by a baffler and irrigated into the plot freely and evenly liu et al 2016 a gauze cloth 20 cm long 10 cm wide and 1 cm thick was placed beneath the baffler to prevent headward erosion mixed samples of runoff and sediment were collected at 1 min intervals with 10 l buckets and immediately weighed the sediment was dried at 105 c for 12 h and weighed fig 2a runoff rate l h 1 ratio of total runoff to runoff production time soil loss rate kg h 1 ratio of total sediment to runoff production time were calculated nine rectangular plots 2 4 2 4 m with the same straw incorporation treatments were constructed near runoff plots the soil slope and management of these plots were consistent with those of the runoff plots the infiltration rate and soil physicochemical properties were measured in the same periods 2 3 flow velocity and soil infiltration the electrolyte tracer measurement system fig 2b used to estimate the flow velocity comprised a computer a data logger three probe sensors and an electrolyte injector ban et al 2020 the pulse conductivity of the water flow with kcl as the electrolyte can be continuously monitored using the probe sensor and recorded on the computer using a data logger the software accompanying the system in the computer could process the signal and obtain the electrolyte concentration fitting curve fig 3 a the water flow velocity was calculated using the solute transport model lei et al 2010 lei et al 2005 the electrolyte injector was placed 0 7 m from the top of the plot fig 2b and the electrolyte was injected into the runoff every 3 min after runoff generation three probe sensors were inserted into the rill at distances of 1 3 m upstream rill 2 1 m midstream rill and 2 9 m lower rill away from the electrolyte injector to monitor the change in electrolyte concentration based on previous tests stream power and flow velocity on the mobile bed rill decreased along the rill in the upstream rill stream power was large and soil was always detached in the lower rill sediment deposition easily occurred resulting in unstable rill shape in the early stage of scouring the midstream rill was in a development stage and soil detachment and deposition occurred alternately in the later stage of scouring the rill was in a stable stage therefore the flow velocity measured by the midstream rill probe could reflect the rill development process and the calculated mean flow velocity was reliable accordingly the data measured by the midstream rill probe were used to represent the flow velocity of the entire rill the flow velocity values derived from the experiment are shown in fig 3b the mean flow velocity over the entire period was analyzed a point source permeability measurement system was used to measure the soil infiltration capacity the system consists of a camera calibrated circle plate computer peristaltic pump and tripod fig 2c the biological residues on the soil surface were cleaned prior to the measurement the peristaltic pump provided a steady flow of 25 ml min 1 for 30 min and the water was input into the soil surface at a fixed point the camera automatically captured an image of the expanding wet area once per minute hao et al 2020 the infiltration rate at different moments was calculated using eq 1 mao et al 2011 1 i n q j 1 n 1 i j δ a n j 1 δ a 1 where in is the soil infiltration rate at time n mm h 1 q is the water flow rate ml min 1 and δa is the increase in the wet area for a given period mm2 according to the measured water infiltration process fig 4 the average infiltration rate during the last 28 30 min was used as the stable infiltration rate which reflects the infiltration capacity of the soil 2 4 soil physicochemical properties and other indicators three known volumes of in situ soil samples were randomly collected from each rectangular plot using stainless steel rings 10 cm deep and 14 cm inner diameter soil bd tp and fc were measured via the volumetric mass method the som content was determined via the potassium dichromate volumetric method the sodium pyrophosphate sodium hydroxide leaching method was used to separate the hs components the residual straw in the soil samples within the stainless steel rings was collected by washing drying and weighing and the amount in each plot was calculated the flow velocity decrease percentage vdp was calculated using eq 2 under different conditions 2 vdp v i v 0 v 0 100 where vdp is the flow velocity decrease percentage v 0 is the flow velocity on the slope without straw and v i is the flow velocity under the different straw treatments 2 5 data analysis the effects of straw length incorporation depth and amount on the flow velocity were determined based on a general linear model glm glm assumes that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear and direct and it is used to study the variation in the dependent variable caused by different levels of the independent variables factors multiple comparisons were performed to compare the differences in flow velocity soil physicochemical properties and erosion indicators among the treatments with significance set at p 0 05 all data are expressed as the mean of three replicates standard deviation s d pearson correlation coefficients were used to test correlations between the flow velocity and its influencing factors at a significance level of 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed using the ibm spss 26 0 structural equation modeling sem is a theoretical model based on knowledge framework and statistical analysis which can be used to systematically address the interaction effects of complex influencing factors on target indicators huang et al 2022 sem can be defined as the use of two or more cause effect equations to model multivariate relationships grace 2006 sem is best thought of as a quantitative modeling approach rather than a specific statistical technique sem is suitable for testing networks of causal relationships which is distinguished from most other statistical techniques eisenhauer et al 2015 sem path analysis was used to evaluate the soil property erosion interaction on the flow velocity using maximum likelihood estimations we sought and developed the optimal sem by adding the experimental observation index based on the existing theoretical knowledge of the discipline the model included soil physicochemical properties soil infiltration capacity soil erosion indicators and straw shape and spatial distribution on the slope the ratio of the maximum likelihood chi square value to the degrees of freedom chi df goodness of fit index gfi adjusted goodness of fit index agfi root mean square error of approximation rmsea and normed fit index nfi were used to evaluate the sem fit rmsea values of 0 1 indicated that the model met the requirements and low rmsea values indicated high model fitting accuracy the gfi 0 90 and agfi 0 80 indicated a good fit zhao et al 2019 the nfi can represent the degree of improvement in the fitness of the model compared with the statistical base model the sem was constructed using ibm spss amos 26 3 results 3 1 rill flow velocity under straw incorporation treatments the mean flow velocities of the different treatments were analyzed based on the glm and the results are shown in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 for the glm was 0 535 straw length and straw amount had a significant positive effect on flow velocity p 0 05 while incorporation depth had no significant effect on flow velocity the contribution of straw length to flow velocity was the highest 46 67 followed by straw amount 13 33 the contribution of the incorporation depth to the flow velocity was 0 indicating that incorporation depth had no direct effect on the flow velocity the effect of incorporation depth on flow velocity was not significant therefore variations in flow velocity and vdp under different straw lengths and amounts are plotted in fig 5 compared to bare ground without straw incorporation straw incorporation reduced the flow velocity as shown in fig 5b the minimum flow velocity is 0 120 m s 1 treatment 1 and the maximum is 0 189 m s 1 treatment 9 the flow velocity significantly increased from 0 143 to 0 184 m s 1 when the straw length was increased from 6 to 12 cm p 0 05 when the straw amount was increased from 1000 to 8000 kg ha 1 the flow velocity initially increased and then leveled off when the straw length was 6 cm the flow velocities at 4500 and 8000 kg ha 1 were significantly higher than that at 1000 kg ha 1 the flow vdp was used to display the decrease in flow velocity fig 5c the rate of flow velocity under all treatments were reduced by 13 25 to 44 92 compared with that of the control the maximum and minimum vdps were obtained under the 1000 kg ha 1 straw amount the longer the straw length the smaller the vdp when the straw length was 6 cm a low straw amount further reduced the flow velocity to 33 68 when the straw length was 12 cm the effect of straw incorporation on the slope flow velocity was the lowest 3 2 soil properties under straw incorporation treatments we screened out soil physicochemical indicators related to erosion through previous tests and statistical analysis the differences in soil properties among the plots during the field scouring experiment were completely caused by the differences in straw treatments fig 6 shows that when the straw length was 9 cm the high straw amount presented a significantly lower bd 1 256 g cm 3 compared with the other two straw amounts bd 1 360 g cm 3 and 1 363 g cm 3 the fc of all treatments were between 22 08 and 24 59 humic substances were the main component of som accounting for 57 95 to 65 88 across all treatments hs ranged from 1 407 to 1 783 g kg 1 and som ranged from 2 427 to 3 070 g kg 1 table 3 the stable soil infiltration rate decreased from 7 5 to 4 0 mm h 1 with increasing straw length under 8000 kg ha 1 straw and it was lowest under the high straw amount and long straw conditions the straw lengths of 9 and 12 cm resulted in a low stable infiltration rate with increasing straw amount straw amount had a small effect on the stable infiltration rate when the straw length was 6 cm 3 3 runoff and sediment yield under straw incorporation treatments fig 7 shows that the response of runoff and sediment to straw incorporation was smaller than that the response of flow velocity the runoff rates ranged from 57 70 to 111 46 l h 1 and soil loss rates ranged from 3 33 to 14 81 kg h 1 for the different straw treatments the runoff and soil loss rates increased with increasing straw length the lowest runoff and soil loss rates occurred following treatment with 6 cm straw incorporated at 1000 kg ha 1 and these values were reduced by 30 16 l h 1 and 4 20 kg h 1 compared to those of the control respectively 3 4 key factors influencing flow velocity 3 4 1 correlation analysis fig 8 shows the pearson correlation coefficients for flow velocity with influencing factors and variables flow velocity was positively correlated with straw length r 0 70 p 0 001 runoff rate r 0 58 p 0 01 and soil loss rate r 0 44 p 0 05 furthermore flow velocity increased with increases in the straw amount and decreases in the stable infiltration rate the stable infiltration rate showed different trends with different indicators it was positively correlated with incorporation depth and bd and negatively correlated with straw amount and tp significantly in addition the runoff rate was highly correlated with the soil loss rate p 0 001 and positively correlated with bd p 0 01 bd showed the opposite trend to straw amount p 0 05 hs was highly correlated with som p 0 001 but had no significant correlation with other indicators the residual straw was positively correlated with incorporation depth and straw amount p 0 05 3 4 2 structural equation modeling sem path analysis was used to analyze the variation mechanism of the flow velocity under straw incorporation conditions fig 9 because of the strong covariance between hs and som only hs was introduced to induce the best model fit soil total porosity was ignored because of the redundancy of bd and tp among the soil properties the model fitness indicators are listed in table 4 the chi df gfi rmsea and nfi results met the sem evaluation criteria and all agfi values were above 0 7 indicating that the models were suitable for the data of this study straw length directly affected the flow velocity path coefficient of 0 48 p 0 001 and runoff rate path coefficient of 0 33 p 0 05 fig 9a among all the factors runoff rate had the highest positive effect on flow velocity path coefficient of 0 63 p 0 001 whereas infiltration rate had a negative effect path coefficient of 0 40 p 0 001 moreover bd indirectly affected flow velocity by increasing the runoff and infiltration rates and hs indirectly affected flow velocity by reducing the infiltration rate the amount of incorporated straw had a negative effect on bd fc and infiltration rate fig 9b straw incorporation depth and amount indirectly affected flow velocity by increasing and decreasing water infiltration path coefficient of 0 41 and 0 48 p 0 01 and 0 05 respectively although this trend was not observed for straw length consistent with the model a hs increased flow velocity by decreasing water infiltration fig 9c the path of incorporation depth to flow velocity represents the direct effect of incorporation depth on flow velocity fig 9c the standardization coefficient of the path is very low 0 05 p 0 05 which corroborates the glm results table 2 in general sem path analysis revealed that straw length runoff rate and soil infiltration capacity were the key factors affecting flow velocity 4 discussion 4 1 soil properties affect flow velocity bd fc and hs were identified as the main indicators of the soil physicochemical properties that influence flow velocity a long term straw return study showed that an increase in straw amount increased soil porosity and decreased bd blanco canqui and lal 2007 in short term straw incorporation soil structure was greatly affected by tillage the tillage layer soil was loose resulting in an increase in soil porosity and a decrease in bd liu et al 2020b zhuang et al 2018 found that a high bd 1 5 g cm 3 could lead to low infiltration and high runoff which increased the water flow energy and flow velocity in this study sandy loam soil had a low bd 1 3 g cm 3 and high soil infiltration capacity however residual straw buried in soil blocked the soil pores and the vertical infiltration of water encountered resistance which reduced the infiltration rate smets et al 2011 and indirectly increased rill flow velocity fig 9b with the increase in straw amount from 1000 to 8000 kg ha 1 the stable infiltration rate decreased from 8 44 to 5 78 mm h 1 furthermore fc reflects the ability of soil to hold water and is related to soil porosity the more water the soil holds the lower the soil infiltration capacity yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2023 found that wheat straw incorporation and nitrogen fertilization significantly increased the fc however the fc decreased following the incorporation of both wheat and maize straw and nitrogen fertilization indicating that excessive straw return had adverse effects on the fc and soil porosity fig 9b in our study increasing the straw amount from 1000 to 8000 kg ha 1 caused a decrease in the fc from 24 15 to 23 02 in addition hs can negatively affect the soil infiltration rate as suggested by mamedov et al 2016 clay particles are adsorbed by negatively charged humic acid and exhibit hydrophobicity piccolo and mbagwu 1999 after aggregate destruction clay particles are dispersed in soil pores to block water infiltration thereby reducing the soil infiltration rate hao et al 2020 mamedov et al 2016 4 2 relationship between runoff sediment and flow velocity on slopes with an exposed surface and loose soil the flow velocity associated with rill erosion can be calculated using the empirical equation of flow discharge and velocity govers 1992 nearing et al 1999 showed that the determination coefficients of linear and power regressions of velocity vs flow discharge were 0 90 and 0 92 respectively the power relationship was due to the variability of the hydraulic parameters along the rill and the irregularity of rill morphology dunkerley 2003 nearing et al 1997 variability in flow width and depth interfered with and weakened the linear effect of discharge on flow velocity di stefano et al 2013 di stefano et al 2022 however when the rill shape is stable this interference may be small under mean flow velocity and mean discharge conditions because hydraulic parameters may fluctuate within a small range in this study linear regression of velocity and runoff rate data yielded similar coefficients of determination to power regression 0 338 vs 0 345 and the linear regression of velocity yielded high path coefficients and fitting degree in the sem fig 9 and table 4 in addition a significant relationship between the flow velocity and sediment detachment rate was not observed nearing et al 1999 and this was confirmed in our study as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 in most cases the effect of sediment transport on rill flow resistance was almost negligible di stefano et al 2022 4 3 mechanism of the effect of straw incorporation on flow velocity in this study straw incorporation reduced rill flow velocity 0 120 to 0 189 m s 1 under all straw treatments compared to bare ground fig 5b giménez and govers 2008 obtained a mean rill flow velocity of 0 17 m s 1 under a flow discharge of 16 2 l min 1 when wheat straw was incorporated into soil at 4310 kg ha 1 to a depth of 8 cm in this study the mean rill flow velocity was 0 160 0 177 m s 1 under a flow discharge of 8 l min 1 after incorporating maize straw at 4500 kg ha 1 this confirmed the finding of foster et al 1982 that the effect of maize straw on soil erosion was similar to that of wheat straw liu et al 2020b found that the morphological characteristics of residues such as residue length density residue surface area density and residue volume ratio caused few differences when residue length is 2 cm and had little effect on soil loss one reason for the decrease in flow velocity caused by straw is that straw increases frictional resistance which consumes flow energy and changes hydraulic characteristics dunkerley 2003 liu et al 2021 straw incorporation increased the manning roughness and darcy weisbach friction coefficients omidvar et al 2019 and decreased the reynolds and froude numbers liu et al 2021 friction between straw and soil reduces the erosive nature of water flow because part of the flow shear stress is applied to the residue and no longer acts on the soil particles knapen et al 2008 bio detritus has many edges or perimeters thereby forming a meniscus related to the surface tension draw up of the water surface which increases the spatial variability of flow depth around the residue and produces greater friction drag dunkerley 2002 2003 moreover surface straw was shown to be beneficial to tortuous path formation wang et al 2022b the messy distribution of surface residues could effectively block flow and increase flow paths which could dissipate flow energy and reduce flow velocity polyakov et al 2020 rahma et al 2017 compared with that on bare slope the flow path in a rill bed was more tortuous dunkerley 2003 zeng et al 2020 notably the messy distribution of straw may cause frequent changes in flow path the rill may sinuate multiple times over a short distance with large curvature and short arc length fig 10 b the more the straw mulched on soil surface the more tortuous the rills in fact we observed that on bare ground without straw blocking the flow path was straight fig 10a and the flow velocity was high 4 3 1 effects of straw length on flow velocity the rill flow velocity significantly increased with increasing straw length fig 5a the flow velocity significantly increased from 0 143 to 0 184 m s 1 when the length of the straw was increased from 6 to 12 cm p 0 05 which might be attributed to the changes in the water collecting area and the pathway ma et al 2022 wang et al 2022a fig 11 a longer straw can produce larger water catchments with greater collection effects thereby leading to more runoff and greater flow velocity zeng et al 2020 which was confirmed in this study fig 9a the standardized path coefficient of straw and rill velocity was 0 48 p 0 001 furthermore fig 11b shows that when straw cannot be carried by water flow the straw perpendicular to the flow path blocks the flow water bypasses straw and scours the side wall of rill and lateral erosion is more likely to occur however in most cases straw is not perpendicular to the flow path or is displaced by the flow resulting in the straw lie obliquely in rill this can cause water collecting accelerating the downcut and shortening the rill width fig 11a resulting in increased flow velocity compared with 1 and 3 cm long straw the 20 cm long straw could produce a straighter pathway with less slope resistance resulting in a greater flow velocity parhizkar et al 2021 in addition less roughness on the longer straw surface reduces the flow resistance and increases the flow velocity short straws are more conducive to the formation of transverse and overlapping spatial structures on the soil surface than long straws dunkerley 2003 zeng et al 2020 these structured microdams can extend the water infiltration time resulting in more infiltration fig 9a and lower flow velocity wang et al 2022a whelan and anderson 1996 4 3 2 effects of straw amount on flow velocity flow velocity showed an increasing trend and then leveled off with increases in straw amount although all values with straw incorporation were lower than that of bare ground fig 5a when more straw is incorporated into the soil buried residues reduce the pore connectivity between the surface and deeper layers of the soil residues hinder the vertical infiltration of water over small areas promoting the lateral movement of the water smets et al 2011 wang et al 2022b decreases in the soil infiltration rate increase the surface runoff thereby increasing the flow velocity wang et al 2022b wang et al 2020 however other studies have revealed that flow velocity decreases with increasing straw amount liu et al 2020a wang et al 2019 for example liu et al 2020a found that the mean reduction rates of flow velocity were 28 44 44 09 and 55 56 for straw incorporation rates of 2 4 and 8 t ha 1 respectively when surface straw residue is abundant it can be mobilized by overland currents to form debris dams leading to pond water which further to reduce the flow velocity liu et al 2020a polyakov et al 2020 4 3 3 effects of incorporation depth on flow velocity the effect of the straw incorporation depth on flow velocity was not significant and its contribution rate in glm was 0 table 2 wang et al 2022b suggested that runoff velocity was primarily affected by the residues exposed on the soil surface whereas the buried residues in soil had little effect on the runoff hydraulic characteristics this can be explained by the effects of straw incorporation and mulching wang et al 2020 the increase in incorporation depth is accompanied by an increase in the depth of the soil tillage layer resulting in greater soil porosity zhang et al 2020 this can increase infiltration rate thereby reducing surface flow velocity fig 9c however a greater incorporation depth implies that more straw is buried and less is on the soil surface thereby decreasing the mulching effect of residue on the surface microtopography giménez and govers 2008 consequently the blocking effect of straw on flow weakens which in turn increases the runoff fig 9c dunkerley 2003 wang et al 2019 found that flow velocity increased with decreasing litter surface coverage after plant residues were incorporated to a soil depth of 5 cm 5 conclusions this study performed runoff plot scour experiments to investigate the effects of straw length straw incorporation depth and straw amount on the rill flow velocity of sloping farmlands the results showed that the mean flow velocity of the rill ranged from 0 120 to 0 189 m s 1 under the different straw treatments and these values were 13 25 44 92 lower than that of bare ground after maize straw was incorporated the flow path became convoluted owing to the residual straw on the soil surface which increased the flow resistance thereby reducing the flow velocity the straw length factor had the greatest effect on rill flow velocity on hillslopes with a contribution rate of 46 67 followed by straw amount as the straw length increased the flow velocity significantly increased long exposed straw on the surface does not effectively block water flow rather it causes a water collecting effect that increases the flow velocity in addition the incorporation depth and straw amount could indirectly influence rill flow velocity through the soil properties infiltration capacity and erosion process the flow velocity increased with increasing runoff and decreased with increasing infiltration but had no evident response to sediment yield an increase in soil bulk density could promote runoff and soil infiltration capacity however humic substances produced by straw decomposition could inhibit infiltration capacity in general the response of rill velocity to straw incorporation depends on straw length runoff rate and infiltration rate in the future the influence of straw incorporation on the hydraulic characteristics of rill under simulated rainfall of variable rainfall intensity needs to be studied these findings provide a better understanding of the soil erosion processes following straw

1849,flow velocity is an important indicator when evaluating rill erosion flow dynamics in recent decades incorporating straw in farmland fields has become an effective method of utilizing maize straw resources however the effect of straw incorporation on the rill flow velocity of sloping farmland is unclear in this study experimental treatments with three gradients of maize straw length 6 9 and 12 cm incorporation depth 9 12 and 15 cm and straw amount 1000 4500 and 8000 kg ha 1 were set up flow velocity was measured via an electrolyte tracer measurement system and the comprehensive effect of straw incorporation on the rill erosion flow velocity of sloping farmland was clarified using structural equation modeling the results showed that the mean flow velocity of straw incorporated sloping land was 0 120 0 189 m s 1 which was 13 25 44 92 lower than that of bare land the flow path became convoluted owing to the residual straw on the soil surface which increased the flow resistance thereby reducing the flow velocity straw length had the greatest effect on flow velocity with a contribution rate of 46 67 and significant increases in velocity were observed with increases in straw length owing to the water collecting function of the exposed straw on the soil surface in addition the flow velocity increased with an increase in runoff and decreased with an increase in infiltration but had no evident response to sediment yield increasing the straw amount had a negative impact on soil bulk density and infiltration resulting in an increase in rill flow velocity the incorporation depth had a very small effect on flow velocity the results are helpful for understanding the changes in rill flow velocity and interpreting the soil erosion process on sloping farmland with straw incorporation keywords rill flow velocity straw incorporation straw length straw amount incorporation depth sloping farmland data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction flow velocity is an important indicator for evaluating the dynamic mechanism of soil erosion and represents the basis for determining many of the hydrodynamic parameters of runoff liu et al 2020a yang et al 2018 during rill erosion on hillslopes flow velocity is influenced by discharge sediment infiltration slope roughness flow resistance and soil properties di stefano et al 2019 2022 giménez and govers 2008 nicosia et al 2022 wang et al 2020 and directly related to soil detachment transport and deposition rahma et al 2013 yang et al 2020 zhuang et al 2018 in rill erosion the mean flow velocity can be estimated by the flow regime method and the flow resistance law di stefano et al 2022 the flow regime method refers to estimating the flow velocity as a power function of flow discharge which is a quantitative relationship derived from both river hydraulics and extensive measurements in rills di stefano et al 2013 leopold and maddock 1953 on the cross section of rills the mean velocity can be calculated by dividing flow discharge by the cross sectional area leopold and maddock 1953 an increase in flow discharge leads to an increase in velocity while the cross sectional width and depth are affected by a feedback of flow discharge thereby inhibiting the increase in velocity di stefano et al 2013 the flow resistance law is an empirical equation including flow resistance coefficients such as those of chezy manning and darcy weisbach di stefano et al 2022 the detachment and deposition of sediments during erosion reshape the rill geometry and adjust the flow channel roughness nearing et al 1997 thereby changing flow resistance coefficients and affecting the flow velocity huang et al 2018 liu et al 2020a as the rill shape is difficult to determine and accurate flow resistance coefficients are not easily obtained govers 1992 the flow regime method was adopted in this study furthermore the movement of sediment in the flow can dissipate flow energy and increase the sediment viscosity coefficient resulting in a decrease in the rill flow velocity zhang et al 2010 runoff is generated at the surface when the rate of incoming water is greater than the infiltration rate which influences the runoff coefficient wang et al 2022b wang et al 2020 residue mulching on soil surface can increase the soil roughness and darcy weisbach coefficient thereby reducing rill flow velocity omidvar et al 2019 rahma et al 2017 rahma et al 2019 in addition soil properties can influence the runoff process and sediment concentration such as the soil bulk density bd total porosity tp field capacity fc soil organic matter som and humic substances hs hieke and schmidt 2013 liu et al 2020b mamedov et al 2016 sun et al 2020 tian et al 2017 resulting in the changes in flow velocity maize is a major crop worldwide and the annual production of maize straw resources is enormous in china reaching 216 03 mt yr 1 liu et al 2022 maize straw incorporation is widely applied and has been promoted by the government li et al 2018a li et al 2020 attributed to its stouter stalks and thicker leaves crushed maize straw is typically characterized by larger width and volume compared with wheat straw leys et al 2010 fresh maize straw also has a significantly higher c n ratio and hemicellulose content than wheat straw resulting in slower decomposition min et al 2022 thapa et al 2022 wang et al 2012 undecomposed fine debris has clear edges and perimeters which could result in high frictional retardation in shallow water flows dunkerley 2003 owing to the miniaturization of agricultural machinery straw incorporation on sloping farmland has become convenient and can save considerable human labor chen et al 2017 generally straw incorporation has a positive impact on the physical chemical and biological properties of agricultural soils and improves crop yields adimassu et al 2019 alijani et al 2012 straw return can maintain soil moisture zhao et al 2022 because it reduces evaporation and increases infiltration li et al 2018b montenegro et al 2013 straw decomposition is beneficial for soil carbon sequestration nutrient accumulation enzymatic activity improvement and fungal and bacterial growth berhane et al 2020 li et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 zhang and marschner 2017 zhao et al 2016 in a previous study implementing a long term 10 year straw return strategy significantly increased soil organic carbon storage by 32 44 in the 0 100 cm layer but decreased inorganic carbon storage xie et al 2023 however straw return also increases soil nitrous oxide and methane emissions jiang et al 2019 li et al 2021 excess straw return has a negative impact on crop yields liu et al 2022 soil properties and residual straw vary depending on the working conditions such as the straw type straw crushing length incorporation depth and incorporation amount franti et al 1996a franti et al 1996b straw return is considered an effective method for controlling soil erosion and nutrient loss dai et al 2018 li et al 2020 prosdocimi et al 2016 changes in the soil environment caused by straw incorporation can affect soil erosion resistance and runoff hydrodynamics which differentiate the erosion process along rills from that along conventionally cultivated sloping land keesstra et al 2019 knapen et al 2008 straw return decreases the reynolds and froude numbers and increases the soil roughness di stefano et al 2022 liu et al 2021 omidvar et al 2019 giménez and govers 2008 found that when straw was incorporated to a soil depth of 7 8 cm the mean flow velocity prominently decreased with the increase in the straw incorporation rate when the flow rate was 16 68 l min 1 the application of 4 3 t ha 1 straw to the field reduced the flow velocity by 50 liu et al 2020a found that the flow velocity exponentially decreases with an increase in wheat straw incorporation rates and can be reduced by more than half when the incorporation rate is 8 t ha 1 and the mixed depth is 20 cm wang et al 2019 found that when litter is incorporated into the topsoil within a depth of 5 cm the overland flow velocity varies from 0 061 to 0 114 m s 1 furthermore wheat straw mulched at 8 t ha 1 increased soil loss under heavy rainfall conditions owing to the water collecting effect of straw in rill and reduction of the erosion resistant soil seal rahma et al 2017 in general many researchers have used remolded soil indoors to study the mechanical effects of fresh straw covering the surface in such experiments the flow is applied to the shear planes caused by straw which can change the surface tension frictional drag and shear stress thereby changing rill flow velocity however indoor experiments with remolded soil are vastly different from field experiments with in situ soil and the hydraulic conditions of rill investigated in field experiments are closer to the situation on actual farmland di stefano et al 2022 moreover the variations in rill velocity caused by the changes in soil physiochemical properties following straw decomposition have not been considered in addition different working conditions of straw length straw incorporation depth and straw amount will cause variations in rill velocity the dye tracer method is widely used to measure rill flow velocity yang et al 2020 however in most studies the movement of dyes is tracked by visual observation and involves considerable human error di stefano et al 2021 the incorporation and mulching of straw increase the difficulty in observing the tracer movement resulting in inaccurate records of tracer migration time and large errors in flow velocity calculations in addition the surface velocity needs to use a correction factor to obtain the average velocity and the reynolds number and rill shape positively affect correction factor yang et al 2020 indeed the hydraulic characteristics and shape of rill sections under straw return conditions are complex and changeable making it difficult to measure the correction factor liu et al 2020a by contrast the electrolyte tracer method has been successfully applied to velocity measurements for residual mulch on the soil surface with the advantages of high accuracy and small error feng et al 2020 gao et al 2021 lei et al 2010 lei et al 2005 shi et al 2015 liu et al 2021 and rahma et al 2013 have used this method to measure the flow velocity on straw mulched soil surfaces and revealed that it could produce accurate measurements even at flow velocities as low as 0 06 m s 1 therefore we hypothesized that the shape and distribution of straw incorporated in soil might have a blocking or concentrating effect on water flow resulting in a decrease or increase in flow velocity hypothesis i moreover straw residue and decomposition can affect the soil infiltration capacity and erosion processes by changing the soil physicochemical properties thereby indirectly influencing flow velocity during the erosion process hypothesis ii in this study we used the electrolyte tracer method to trace the flow velocity on hillslopes under straw incorporation with three gradients straw length incorporation depth and straw amount the objectives of this study were 1 to determine the response of rill flow velocity on hillslopes to straw length straw incorporation depth and straw returning amount and 2 to systematically evaluate the effect of the key factors influencing rill flow velocity under straw incorporating conditions in situ 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted in the shuangheyu catchment 118 7 14 52 e 35 38 8 34 n which is in the northern rocky mountainous area of china the catchment covers an area of 0 24 km2 and is at an altitude of 198 m it has a temperate continental monsoon climate with a mean annual temperature of 13 7 c and mean annual rainfall of 803 0 mm approximately 70 of the rainfall is concentrated in summer which is short and intense and can induce serious soil erosion the soil type is sandy loam as classified by the usda soil classification system and consists of 68 7 sand 1 4 clay and 29 9 silt this type of soil is prone to erosion during heavy rainfall balacco 2013 maize is widely planted in rocky and hilly areas because it is highly drought resistant straw incorporation by rotary tillage is a common agricultural management strategy in the study area fig 1 shows the residual straw on the soil surface after rotary tillage maize incorporation in this catchment and the surrounding areas has been conducted for approximately 10 years and this is representative of the practices in the northern rocky mountainous area of china sample collections in the field and runoff plot experiments were conducted in october 2021 2 2 experimental design and processes in this study an orthogonal l9 33 array was used to arrange three factors with three gradients straw length 6 9 and 12 cm incorporation depth 9 12 and 15 cm and straw amount 1000 4500 and 8000 kg ha 1 table 1 the gradients of each factor were determined by the cultivation measures and straw return standard operating quality for straw smashing machines ny t 500 2015 the standard requires a straw crushing length of 10 cm to ensure the reliability and applicability of the results the measured straw length was 6 12 cm which reflected the actual straw crushing length the straw incorporation depth was set to 9 15 cm according to the common rototilling depth according to the local agricultural situation and crop yields 8000 4500 and 1000 kg ha 1 correspond to the full amount of straw half amount of straw and the amount of residues left after maize harvesting respectively a runoff plot 5 0 8 m was constructed on in situ sloping farmland fig 2 a all treatments were repeated three times plus the control group for 28 plots the slope of sloping farmland in this area is 5 15 the gentle slopes of 5 are leveled whereas slopes of 15 are terraced the 10 slope was selected to build the plots based on preliminary tests the soil slope direction and management of all plots were consistent after the maize harvest in november 2020 the air dried maize stalks were crushed using a chopper yielding the specified lengths of straw the straw amount was multiplied by the plot area to get actual straw amount for runoff plot the weighed straw was evenly distributed on the plot soil surface and then incorporated at different depths using a rototiller fig 1 based on local tillage cultivation 7 5 g m 2 of urea nitrogen was applied to each plot to decrease the c n ratio notably the differences in soil properties between the plots were caused by the different straw treatments before and during the experiment the weather was sunny and the soil was dry for several consecutive days soil at 0 5 cm depth was collected from each plot before scouring and the soil moisture of all plots was 5 5 to 6 7 which had no influence on the soil erosion process li et al 2022 based on the local precipitation data and previous tests it was determined that the rainfall intensity of 120 mm h 1 conformed to the rainfall intensity with a return period of 50 years which would lead to obvious rills on sloping farmland by multiplying the rain intensity by the plot area the flow discharge during the scouring test was 8 l min 1 over a duration of 40 min in the scouring test a peristaltic pump was used at the top of the plot to provide constant flow discharge within relative error of 3 the pump flow was energy dissipated by a baffler and irrigated into the plot freely and evenly liu et al 2016 a gauze cloth 20 cm long 10 cm wide and 1 cm thick was placed beneath the baffler to prevent headward erosion mixed samples of runoff and sediment were collected at 1 min intervals with 10 l buckets and immediately weighed the sediment was dried at 105 c for 12 h and weighed fig 2a runoff rate l h 1 ratio of total runoff to runoff production time soil loss rate kg h 1 ratio of total sediment to runoff production time were calculated nine rectangular plots 2 4 2 4 m with the same straw incorporation treatments were constructed near runoff plots the soil slope and management of these plots were consistent with those of the runoff plots the infiltration rate and soil physicochemical properties were measured in the same periods 2 3 flow velocity and soil infiltration the electrolyte tracer measurement system fig 2b used to estimate the flow velocity comprised a computer a data logger three probe sensors and an electrolyte injector ban et al 2020 the pulse conductivity of the water flow with kcl as the electrolyte can be continuously monitored using the probe sensor and recorded on the computer using a data logger the software accompanying the system in the computer could process the signal and obtain the electrolyte concentration fitting curve fig 3 a the water flow velocity was calculated using the solute transport model lei et al 2010 lei et al 2005 the electrolyte injector was placed 0 7 m from the top of the plot fig 2b and the electrolyte was injected into the runoff every 3 min after runoff generation three probe sensors were inserted into the rill at distances of 1 3 m upstream rill 2 1 m midstream rill and 2 9 m lower rill away from the electrolyte injector to monitor the change in electrolyte concentration based on previous tests stream power and flow velocity on the mobile bed rill decreased along the rill in the upstream rill stream power was large and soil was always detached in the lower rill sediment deposition easily occurred resulting in unstable rill shape in the early stage of scouring the midstream rill was in a development stage and soil detachment and deposition occurred alternately in the later stage of scouring the rill was in a stable stage therefore the flow velocity measured by the midstream rill probe could reflect the rill development process and the calculated mean flow velocity was reliable accordingly the data measured by the midstream rill probe were used to represent the flow velocity of the entire rill the flow velocity values derived from the experiment are shown in fig 3b the mean flow velocity over the entire period was analyzed a point source permeability measurement system was used to measure the soil infiltration capacity the system consists of a camera calibrated circle plate computer peristaltic pump and tripod fig 2c the biological residues on the soil surface were cleaned prior to the measurement the peristaltic pump provided a steady flow of 25 ml min 1 for 30 min and the water was input into the soil surface at a fixed point the camera automatically captured an image of the expanding wet area once per minute hao et al 2020 the infiltration rate at different moments was calculated using eq 1 mao et al 2011 1 i n q j 1 n 1 i j δ a n j 1 δ a 1 where in is the soil infiltration rate at time n mm h 1 q is the water flow rate ml min 1 and δa is the increase in the wet area for a given period mm2 according to the measured water infiltration process fig 4 the average infiltration rate during the last 28 30 min was used as the stable infiltration rate which reflects the infiltration capacity of the soil 2 4 soil physicochemical properties and other indicators three known volumes of in situ soil samples were randomly collected from each rectangular plot using stainless steel rings 10 cm deep and 14 cm inner diameter soil bd tp and fc were measured via the volumetric mass method the som content was determined via the potassium dichromate volumetric method the sodium pyrophosphate sodium hydroxide leaching method was used to separate the hs components the residual straw in the soil samples within the stainless steel rings was collected by washing drying and weighing and the amount in each plot was calculated the flow velocity decrease percentage vdp was calculated using eq 2 under different conditions 2 vdp v i v 0 v 0 100 where vdp is the flow velocity decrease percentage v 0 is the flow velocity on the slope without straw and v i is the flow velocity under the different straw treatments 2 5 data analysis the effects of straw length incorporation depth and amount on the flow velocity were determined based on a general linear model glm glm assumes that the relationship between the dependent and independent variables is linear and direct and it is used to study the variation in the dependent variable caused by different levels of the independent variables factors multiple comparisons were performed to compare the differences in flow velocity soil physicochemical properties and erosion indicators among the treatments with significance set at p 0 05 all data are expressed as the mean of three replicates standard deviation s d pearson correlation coefficients were used to test correlations between the flow velocity and its influencing factors at a significance level of 0 05 all statistical analyses were performed using the ibm spss 26 0 structural equation modeling sem is a theoretical model based on knowledge framework and statistical analysis which can be used to systematically address the interaction effects of complex influencing factors on target indicators huang et al 2022 sem can be defined as the use of two or more cause effect equations to model multivariate relationships grace 2006 sem is best thought of as a quantitative modeling approach rather than a specific statistical technique sem is suitable for testing networks of causal relationships which is distinguished from most other statistical techniques eisenhauer et al 2015 sem path analysis was used to evaluate the soil property erosion interaction on the flow velocity using maximum likelihood estimations we sought and developed the optimal sem by adding the experimental observation index based on the existing theoretical knowledge of the discipline the model included soil physicochemical properties soil infiltration capacity soil erosion indicators and straw shape and spatial distribution on the slope the ratio of the maximum likelihood chi square value to the degrees of freedom chi df goodness of fit index gfi adjusted goodness of fit index agfi root mean square error of approximation rmsea and normed fit index nfi were used to evaluate the sem fit rmsea values of 0 1 indicated that the model met the requirements and low rmsea values indicated high model fitting accuracy the gfi 0 90 and agfi 0 80 indicated a good fit zhao et al 2019 the nfi can represent the degree of improvement in the fitness of the model compared with the statistical base model the sem was constructed using ibm spss amos 26 3 results 3 1 rill flow velocity under straw incorporation treatments the mean flow velocities of the different treatments were analyzed based on the glm and the results are shown in table 2 the coefficient of determination r2 for the glm was 0 535 straw length and straw amount had a significant positive effect on flow velocity p 0 05 while incorporation depth had no significant effect on flow velocity the contribution of straw length to flow velocity was the highest 46 67 followed by straw amount 13 33 the contribution of the incorporation depth to the flow velocity was 0 indicating that incorporation depth had no direct effect on the flow velocity the effect of incorporation depth on flow velocity was not significant therefore variations in flow velocity and vdp under different straw lengths and amounts are plotted in fig 5 compared to bare ground without straw incorporation straw incorporation reduced the flow velocity as shown in fig 5b the minimum flow velocity is 0 120 m s 1 treatment 1 and the maximum is 0 189 m s 1 treatment 9 the flow velocity significantly increased from 0 143 to 0 184 m s 1 when the straw length was increased from 6 to 12 cm p 0 05 when the straw amount was increased from 1000 to 8000 kg ha 1 the flow velocity initially increased and then leveled off when the straw length was 6 cm the flow velocities at 4500 and 8000 kg ha 1 were significantly higher than that at 1000 kg ha 1 the flow vdp was used to display the decrease in flow velocity fig 5c the rate of flow velocity under all treatments were reduced by 13 25 to 44 92 compared with that of the control the maximum and minimum vdps were obtained under the 1000 kg ha 1 straw amount the longer the straw length the smaller the vdp when the straw length was 6 cm a low straw amount further reduced the flow velocity to 33 68 when the straw length was 12 cm the effect of straw incorporation on the slope flow velocity was the lowest 3 2 soil properties under straw incorporation treatments we screened out soil physicochemical indicators related to erosion through previous tests and statistical analysis the differences in soil properties among the plots during the field scouring experiment were completely caused by the differences in straw treatments fig 6 shows that when the straw length was 9 cm the high straw amount presented a significantly lower bd 1 256 g cm 3 compared with the other two straw amounts bd 1 360 g cm 3 and 1 363 g cm 3 the fc of all treatments were between 22 08 and 24 59 humic substances were the main component of som accounting for 57 95 to 65 88 across all treatments hs ranged from 1 407 to 1 783 g kg 1 and som ranged from 2 427 to 3 070 g kg 1 table 3 the stable soil infiltration rate decreased from 7 5 to 4 0 mm h 1 with increasing straw length under 8000 kg ha 1 straw and it was lowest under the high straw amount and long straw conditions the straw lengths of 9 and 12 cm resulted in a low stable infiltration rate with increasing straw amount straw amount had a small effect on the stable infiltration rate when the straw length was 6 cm 3 3 runoff and sediment yield under straw incorporation treatments fig 7 shows that the response of runoff and sediment to straw incorporation was smaller than that the response of flow velocity the runoff rates ranged from 57 70 to 111 46 l h 1 and soil loss rates ranged from 3 33 to 14 81 kg h 1 for the different straw treatments the runoff and soil loss rates increased with increasing straw length the lowest runoff and soil loss rates occurred following treatment with 6 cm straw incorporated at 1000 kg ha 1 and these values were reduced by 30 16 l h 1 and 4 20 kg h 1 compared to those of the control respectively 3 4 key factors influencing flow velocity 3 4 1 correlation analysis fig 8 shows the pearson correlation coefficients for flow velocity with influencing factors and variables flow velocity was positively correlated with straw length r 0 70 p 0 001 runoff rate r 0 58 p 0 01 and soil loss rate r 0 44 p 0 05 furthermore flow velocity increased with increases in the straw amount and decreases in the stable infiltration rate the stable infiltration rate showed different trends with different indicators it was positively correlated with incorporation depth and bd and negatively correlated with straw amount and tp significantly in addition the runoff rate was highly correlated with the soil loss rate p 0 001 and positively correlated with bd p 0 01 bd showed the opposite trend to straw amount p 0 05 hs was highly correlated with som p 0 001 but had no significant correlation with other indicators the residual straw was positively correlated with incorporation depth and straw amount p 0 05 3 4 2 structural equation modeling sem path analysis was used to analyze the variation mechanism of the flow velocity under straw incorporation conditions fig 9 because of the strong covariance between hs and som only hs was introduced to induce the best model fit soil total porosity was ignored because of the redundancy of bd and tp among the soil properties the model fitness indicators are listed in table 4 the chi df gfi rmsea and nfi results met the sem evaluation criteria and all agfi values were above 0 7 indicating that the models were suitable for the data of this study straw length directly affected the flow velocity path coefficient of 0 48 p 0 001 and runoff rate path coefficient of 0 33 p 0 05 fig 9a among all the factors runoff rate had the highest positive effect on flow velocity path coefficient of 0 63 p 0 001 whereas infiltration rate had a negative effect path coefficient of 0 40 p 0 001 moreover bd indirectly affected flow velocity by increasing the runoff and infiltration rates and hs indirectly affected flow velocity by reducing the infiltration rate the amount of incorporated straw had a negative effect on bd fc and infiltration rate fig 9b straw incorporation depth and amount indirectly affected flow velocity by increasing and decreasing water infiltration path coefficient of 0 41 and 0 48 p 0 01 and 0 05 respectively although this trend was not observed for straw length consistent with the model a hs increased flow velocity by decreasing water infiltration fig 9c the path of incorporation depth to flow velocity represents the direct effect of incorporation depth on flow velocity fig 9c the standardization coefficient of the path is very low 0 05 p 0 05 which corroborates the glm results table 2 in general sem path analysis revealed that straw length runoff rate and soil infiltration capacity were the key factors affecting flow velocity 4 discussion 4 1 soil properties affect flow velocity bd fc and hs were identified as the main indicators of the soil physicochemical properties that influence flow velocity a long term straw return study showed that an increase in straw amount increased soil porosity and decreased bd blanco canqui and lal 2007 in short term straw incorporation soil structure was greatly affected by tillage the tillage layer soil was loose resulting in an increase in soil porosity and a decrease in bd liu et al 2020b zhuang et al 2018 found that a high bd 1 5 g cm 3 could lead to low infiltration and high runoff which increased the water flow energy and flow velocity in this study sandy loam soil had a low bd 1 3 g cm 3 and high soil infiltration capacity however residual straw buried in soil blocked the soil pores and the vertical infiltration of water encountered resistance which reduced the infiltration rate smets et al 2011 and indirectly increased rill flow velocity fig 9b with the increase in straw amount from 1000 to 8000 kg ha 1 the stable infiltration rate decreased from 8 44 to 5 78 mm h 1 furthermore fc reflects the ability of soil to hold water and is related to soil porosity the more water the soil holds the lower the soil infiltration capacity yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2023 found that wheat straw incorporation and nitrogen fertilization significantly increased the fc however the fc decreased following the incorporation of both wheat and maize straw and nitrogen fertilization indicating that excessive straw return had adverse effects on the fc and soil porosity fig 9b in our study increasing the straw amount from 1000 to 8000 kg ha 1 caused a decrease in the fc from 24 15 to 23 02 in addition hs can negatively affect the soil infiltration rate as suggested by mamedov et al 2016 clay particles are adsorbed by negatively charged humic acid and exhibit hydrophobicity piccolo and mbagwu 1999 after aggregate destruction clay particles are dispersed in soil pores to block water infiltration thereby reducing the soil infiltration rate hao et al 2020 mamedov et al 2016 4 2 relationship between runoff sediment and flow velocity on slopes with an exposed surface and loose soil the flow velocity associated with rill erosion can be calculated using the empirical equation of flow discharge and velocity govers 1992 nearing et al 1999 showed that the determination coefficients of linear and power regressions of velocity vs flow discharge were 0 90 and 0 92 respectively the power relationship was due to the variability of the hydraulic parameters along the rill and the irregularity of rill morphology dunkerley 2003 nearing et al 1997 variability in flow width and depth interfered with and weakened the linear effect of discharge on flow velocity di stefano et al 2013 di stefano et al 2022 however when the rill shape is stable this interference may be small under mean flow velocity and mean discharge conditions because hydraulic parameters may fluctuate within a small range in this study linear regression of velocity and runoff rate data yielded similar coefficients of determination to power regression 0 338 vs 0 345 and the linear regression of velocity yielded high path coefficients and fitting degree in the sem fig 9 and table 4 in addition a significant relationship between the flow velocity and sediment detachment rate was not observed nearing et al 1999 and this was confirmed in our study as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 in most cases the effect of sediment transport on rill flow resistance was almost negligible di stefano et al 2022 4 3 mechanism of the effect of straw incorporation on flow velocity in this study straw incorporation reduced rill flow velocity 0 120 to 0 189 m s 1 under all straw treatments compared to bare ground fig 5b giménez and govers 2008 obtained a mean rill flow velocity of 0 17 m s 1 under a flow discharge of 16 2 l min 1 when wheat straw was incorporated into soil at 4310 kg ha 1 to a depth of 8 cm in this study the mean rill flow velocity was 0 160 0 177 m s 1 under a flow discharge of 8 l min 1 after incorporating maize straw at 4500 kg ha 1 this confirmed the finding of foster et al 1982 that the effect of maize straw on soil erosion was similar to that of wheat straw liu et al 2020b found that the morphological characteristics of residues such as residue length density residue surface area density and residue volume ratio caused few differences when residue length is 2 cm and had little effect on soil loss one reason for the decrease in flow velocity caused by straw is that straw increases frictional resistance which consumes flow energy and changes hydraulic characteristics dunkerley 2003 liu et al 2021 straw incorporation increased the manning roughness and darcy weisbach friction coefficients omidvar et al 2019 and decreased the reynolds and froude numbers liu et al 2021 friction between straw and soil reduces the erosive nature of water flow because part of the flow shear stress is applied to the residue and no longer acts on the soil particles knapen et al 2008 bio detritus has many edges or perimeters thereby forming a meniscus related to the surface tension draw up of the water surface which increases the spatial variability of flow depth around the residue and produces greater friction drag dunkerley 2002 2003 moreover surface straw was shown to be beneficial to tortuous path formation wang et al 2022b the messy distribution of surface residues could effectively block flow and increase flow paths which could dissipate flow energy and reduce flow velocity polyakov et al 2020 rahma et al 2017 compared with that on bare slope the flow path in a rill bed was more tortuous dunkerley 2003 zeng et al 2020 notably the messy distribution of straw may cause frequent changes in flow path the rill may sinuate multiple times over a short distance with large curvature and short arc length fig 10 b the more the straw mulched on soil surface the more tortuous the rills in fact we observed that on bare ground without straw blocking the flow path was straight fig 10a and the flow velocity was high 4 3 1 effects of straw length on flow velocity the rill flow velocity significantly increased with increasing straw length fig 5a the flow velocity significantly increased from 0 143 to 0 184 m s 1 when the length of the straw was increased from 6 to 12 cm p 0 05 which might be attributed to the changes in the water collecting area and the pathway ma et al 2022 wang et al 2022a fig 11 a longer straw can produce larger water catchments with greater collection effects thereby leading to more runoff and greater flow velocity zeng et al 2020 which was confirmed in this study fig 9a the standardized path coefficient of straw and rill velocity was 0 48 p 0 001 furthermore fig 11b shows that when straw cannot be carried by water flow the straw perpendicular to the flow path blocks the flow water bypasses straw and scours the side wall of rill and lateral erosion is more likely to occur however in most cases straw is not perpendicular to the flow path or is displaced by the flow resulting in the straw lie obliquely in rill this can cause water collecting accelerating the downcut and shortening the rill width fig 11a resulting in increased flow velocity compared with 1 and 3 cm long straw the 20 cm long straw could produce a straighter pathway with less slope resistance resulting in a greater flow velocity parhizkar et al 2021 in addition less roughness on the longer straw surface reduces the flow resistance and increases the flow velocity short straws are more conducive to the formation of transverse and overlapping spatial structures on the soil surface than long straws dunkerley 2003 zeng et al 2020 these structured microdams can extend the water infiltration time resulting in more infiltration fig 9a and lower flow velocity wang et al 2022a whelan and anderson 1996 4 3 2 effects of straw amount on flow velocity flow velocity showed an increasing trend and then leveled off with increases in straw amount although all values with straw incorporation were lower than that of bare ground fig 5a when more straw is incorporated into the soil buried residues reduce the pore connectivity between the surface and deeper layers of the soil residues hinder the vertical infiltration of water over small areas promoting the lateral movement of the water smets et al 2011 wang et al 2022b decreases in the soil infiltration rate increase the surface runoff thereby increasing the flow velocity wang et al 2022b wang et al 2020 however other studies have revealed that flow velocity decreases with increasing straw amount liu et al 2020a wang et al 2019 for example liu et al 2020a found that the mean reduction rates of flow velocity were 28 44 44 09 and 55 56 for straw incorporation rates of 2 4 and 8 t ha 1 respectively when surface straw residue is abundant it can be mobilized by overland currents to form debris dams leading to pond water which further to reduce the flow velocity liu et al 2020a polyakov et al 2020 4 3 3 effects of incorporation depth on flow velocity the effect of the straw incorporation depth on flow velocity was not significant and its contribution rate in glm was 0 table 2 wang et al 2022b suggested that runoff velocity was primarily affected by the residues exposed on the soil surface whereas the buried residues in soil had little effect on the runoff hydraulic characteristics this can be explained by the effects of straw incorporation and mulching wang et al 2020 the increase in incorporation depth is accompanied by an increase in the depth of the soil tillage layer resulting in greater soil porosity zhang et al 2020 this can increase infiltration rate thereby reducing surface flow velocity fig 9c however a greater incorporation depth implies that more straw is buried and less is on the soil surface thereby decreasing the mulching effect of residue on the surface microtopography giménez and govers 2008 consequently the blocking effect of straw on flow weakens which in turn increases the runoff fig 9c dunkerley 2003 wang et al 2019 found that flow velocity increased with decreasing litter surface coverage after plant residues were incorporated to a soil depth of 5 cm 5 conclusions this study performed runoff plot scour experiments to investigate the effects of straw length straw incorporation depth and straw amount on the rill flow velocity of sloping farmlands the results showed that the mean flow velocity of the rill ranged from 0 120 to 0 189 m s 1 under the different straw treatments and these values were 13 25 44 92 lower than that of bare ground after maize straw was incorporated the flow path became convoluted owing to the residual straw on the soil surface which increased the flow resistance thereby reducing the flow velocity the straw length factor had the greatest effect on rill flow velocity on hillslopes with a contribution rate of 46 67 followed by straw amount as the straw length increased the flow velocity significantly increased long exposed straw on the surface does not effectively block water flow rather it causes a water collecting effect that increases the flow velocity in addition the incorporation depth and straw amount could indirectly influence rill flow velocity through the soil properties infiltration capacity and erosion process the flow velocity increased with increasing runoff and decreased with increasing infiltration but had no evident response to sediment yield an increase in soil bulk density could promote runoff and soil infiltration capacity however humic substances produced by straw decomposition could inhibit infiltration capacity in general the response of rill velocity to straw incorporation depends on straw length runoff rate and infiltration rate in the future the influence of straw incorporation on the hydraulic characteristics of rill under simulated rainfall of variable rainfall intensity needs to be studied these findings provide a better understanding of the soil erosion processes following straw incorporation credit authorship contribution statement jingjiang li conceptualization methodology data curation formal analysis investigation visualization writing original draft qianjin liu funding
