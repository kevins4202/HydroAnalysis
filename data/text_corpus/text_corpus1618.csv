8090,study region africa the lake chad transboundary aquifer study focus to understand transboundary groundwater hydrodynamics and estimate quantitative groundwater fluxes values between aquifer sharing countries to enable estimations we developed an updated 3d quasi steady state regional groundwater flow model of the chad formation based on integrating extensive available information and reflecting the best current conceptual understanding to date the conceptual model was tentatively assessed by a steady state numerical model based on modflow new hydrological insights for the region this model simulates lateral groundwater flows between neighboring countries and also provides insights into the large scale flow pattern and flows among hydroestratigraphic units modeling indicated that groundwater fluxes through international borders exist between basin sharing countries except between central african republic and cameroon where a buffer area was considered for modeling purposes leading to more uncertain results from 14ºn parallel to further north data are scanty and outcomes should be carefully considered forecasting transboundary impacts indicated that changes in recharge rates were more sensitive that changes in groundwater abstraction to date abstraction represents a small part of the water balance but if it increases it can become a driving factor in the future land use change and water use in the source areas southern area will have the strongest impact on transboundary groundwater flows due to changes in recharge which will lead to quantitative changes in groundwater levels artesian conditions or even water quality key words lake chad basin numerical modeling groundwater transboundary flux 1 introduction the lake chad basin is an inland drainage system that includes lake chad and covers an area of about 2355 000 km2 in the eastern part of the sahel region africa it is shared by algeria cameroon central african republic chad libya niger nigeria and sudan to a greater or lesser extent the water resources in the lake chad basin are the source of livelihoods and economic development and the hydrologic dynamics of the lake and its basin are closely linked with economic productivity and food security as member states make efforts to develop water resources for economic growth the lake chad basin commission has the mandate to monitor and understand water resources and their use in order to ensure sustainable transboundary water resources management several aquifers have been identified in the basin where the sedimentary chad aquifer formation caf is of primary use and is one of the largest aquifer systems in the world because it extends along the entire basin igrac 2012 igrac unesco ihp 2015 in the present day while water availability is not a limiting factor in the southern tropical part of the basin it constitutes the main water resource in the northern area there is concern about increasing abstractions possibly causing significant impacts on the basin s ecosystems water level and the lake chad extent and groundwater level drawdown in individual countries and local areas which have led the water charter to be adopted www cblt org en themes lake chad water charter vehicle sub regional integration and security the aim is to promote sustainable development through the integrated equitable and coordinated management of natural resources particularly the basin s water resources at the basin level one key issue involves water availability in sharing countries and further transboundary management rivera and candela 2018a thus an updated groundwater model that includes all the available information to date is a useful representation to understand the current groundwater dynamics system numerical modeling is a key tool used to represent current understanding by putting existing data to good use informing about new data collection efforts and forecasting behavior the efforts herein indicated to better understand groundwater dynamics contribute to this goal modeling groundwater resources is no new undertaking in the chad basin for the chad aquifer formation quaternary lower pliocene and continental terminal aquifers fig 1 and since the pioneering modeling works of schneider 1989 and eberschweiler 1993 with the gardenia code based on data from 1960 some hydrogeological models have been developed to date only a few of them are on a regional scale but they do not cover the entire hydrogeological basin and hydro stratigraphical units of the chad formation up to date information and concerns about transboundary issues have not been investigated regionally leblanc 2002 mainly focused on the recharge and discharge areas definition for the quaternary aquifer by combining satellite imaginary data gis methods and modflow 96 based on a single layer of variable grid transient mode based on noaa avhrr and grace remote sensing data boronina and ramillien 2008 used feflow to simulate the quaternary aquifer piezometric map including domes and depressions with a single unconfined layer with this regional transient modeling the system extension coverage of the quaternary aquifer covered about 500 000 km2 which correspond to the basin central region lake chad and its surroundings and the chari baguirmi area their outcomes pointed out data sparseness the weak aquifer impact of groundwater abstraction and natural recharge spatial variability both models reproduced existing piezometric depressions by taking exfiltration to be a discharge mechanism locally and based mainly on modflow with different hydrological objectives and after considering diverse areal extension ranges modeling efforts that focus on the unconfined quaternary aquifer have been made in certain areas of interest the result of the steady state modeling done of the chari baguirmi quaternary aquifer depression by massuel 2001 and abderamane 2012 indicate lake chad s limited contribution major seasonal inputs from the chari river and the long residence time of the deep groundwater in depressions as provided by chemical and isotopic data abderamane 2012 to reproduce the kazdell plain niger piezometric depression fig 2 gaultier 2004 jointly simulated a change in precipitation in the last 30 years with exfiltration to evaluate the past and present hydrogeochemical processes of the kazdell niger and bornu nigeria areas zaïri 2008 defined a monolayer transient model in the chari logone area candela et al 2014 developed a flow model for the upper aquifer q and ct that focused on forcing climate parameters to assess groundwater recharge in the present study the hydrogeological conceptual model of aquifer system development in the chad formation hydrogeological system s natural extent is defined by linking hydrogeological and geochemical data with the 3d geological model of the lake chad basin here conceptualization involves identifying and describing physical processes heads and flows of the groundwater controlling groundwater movement and storage in the hydrogeological system it includes data collection reviews and analyses while critical data are reviewed to ensure that errors are lacking for further modeling this is a prerequisite for designing the numerical model the aim of developing a numerical groundwater quasi steady state 3d regional flow model is to provide a quantitative tool that assesses land and water use impacts on the environment and groundwater systems model development was based on the conceptual model defined for the 2004 2011 period the main objectives at the global and transboundary levels were understanding groundwater flow processes developing relations between aquifer units groundwater recharge and extraction locations and rates 2 study area the lake chad transboundary aquifer the lake chad hydrologic basin lies between 6 n and 24 n latitude and between 8 e and 24 e

nigeria cameroun and chad the basin is separated to the west by a watershed from the niger river the plain has a low relief landscape with heights from above 3000 m in the north nw and sw to 165 m in the center bodélé depression the region extends from the forested savannah in the south to the savannah in the central part and to the desert areas in the north the conventional basin s heterogeneously spread population is estimated at about 44 million the population s water supply is mainly groundwater from a number of shallow wells in all the transboundary countries but no allocation sharing agreement has been reached nijsten et al 2018 the most important activity for over 60 of the population is rain fed or flood recession based agriculture in the chari logone and komadougou yobé basins and irrigated agriculture from dams or groundwater agriculture is the main water use with intensive agriculture in areas of nigeria and cameroon the area is characterized by wide spatial climate variability with the arid north of n djamena zone a subhumid climate in the central part and a humid climate in the south the mean annual rainfall ranges between 10 mm and 1900 mm

agencies e g wb 2020 and academic institutions have many documented sources the chad aquifer formation fao 1973 schneider 1989 main objective of modeling extends along the entire basin and is composed of the following hydrostratigraphical units fig 3 i the upper phreatic aquifer made up of quaternary deposits q ii the lower pliocene materials the intermediate confined aquifer lpli iii a deep semiconfined aquifer made up of continental terminal deposits ct oligocene miocene the upper pliocene pli constitutes the confining clay layer hydraulic connectivity between different aquifers exists and also between surface water lakes and rivers and groundwater groundwater exploitation takes place mainly in the quaternary aquifer and the ct in the southern area where it outcrops and only deep boreholes exploit aquifers in the most important cities i e n djamena the quaternary unconfined aquifer holocene and pleistocene includes deposits of aeolian sands and fluviodeltaic materials that cover most of the surface area geology average thickness is 40 m and ranges from 2 m to 185 m the aquifer considered to be continuous on the lcb scale is heterogeneous with considerable lateral variability sediment type and facies distribution the lower pliocene confined aquifer consists of lacustrine clay with some alternating alluvial sand layers at the bottom of the formation red sand it extends over most of the chad area toward niger manga with boundaries on crystalline rocks w the termit basin nw and the agadem basin ne it is found only in boreholes deeper than 100 m at around 300 m and 200 m in the central part of manga in niger sabljak 1998 and 450 m south of lake chad antea egis bceom ciat 2012 thickness vastly varies between 30 and 50 m on boundaries and it may reach 150 m in the central part of chad it presents flowing artesian conditions in some areas of the nigerian part the continental terminal confined unconfined aquifer is made up of sandy clayey deposits laterites and iron sand are present bhata area and it only outcrops in the southern basin part thickness is around 25 m on eastern boundaries fitri area and can reach 600 m in existing tectonic grabens but is generally around 100 m the caf potentiometric surface water table aquifer composed of q and lpli ct for the most complete spatial and time period coverage 2008 2011 is plotted in fig 4 the scarce groundwater level data for the deep confined aquifer lpli ct only allow groundwater contours to be displayed in the southern part the regional groundwater flow is toward the central and northern basin zones bodelé north of kanem fig 1 the highest measured groundwater level is 370 m a s l in the southern basin part where the main natural recharge takes place the groundwater level generally lowers toward lake chad and to the upper northern basin part the lowlands however very little information is available about this latter area the lowest values are always observed in depressed zones with a minimum value of 240 m a s l chari baguirmi two piezometric domes are present north of lake chad and are associated with the dune fields recharge area high groundwater values also appear on the southern margins corresponding to the outcropping aquifer recharge area naturally occurring extended piezometric depressions exist in bornou and kazdell sw of the lake and yaéré and chari baguirmi e of the lake fig 4 with the groundwater level at a depth of 40 60 m below the soil surface for the q aquifer compiled information on transmissivity t and hydraulic conductivity k table 1 leblanc 2002 indicates that t values range from 10 4 to 10 3 m2 s in the southern and western basin parts and from 10 2 to 10 1 m2 s in the eastern and central basin parts k values go from 10 6 to 10 5 m s in the western part and from 10 4 to 10 3 m s in the eastern part therefore the hydraulic parameters in the aquifer significantly differ the aquifer testing data that define key parameters for the q and lpli ct are available in a few locations 2 2 the conceptual hydrogeological model from top holocene to bottom tertiary the caf hydrogeological system is formed by three hydrostratigraphic aquifer units q lpli ct and one aquitard pli clays basin boundaries are crystalline rocks granite schists that outcrop in the eastern and southern parts on the chad and nigeria borders with sandstones tibesti and nubian aquifer system in the north fig 2 boundaries are controlled mainly by faults and basal and lateral unconformities the unconfined q aquifer upper aquifer is separated from the lpli confined intermediate aquifer by an aquitard of pliocene clays the deep ct aquifer is mainly confined and only outcrops in the northern and southern basin parts fig 1 tertiary where it is hydraulically connected to the q aquifer fig 5 depicts the chad formation hydrostratigraphical units schema which shows the areas of active recharge and discharge flow system and the dominant input output processes that occur in the basin recharge from rainfall the main water source predominantly occurs via infiltration directly to outcropping aquifers unconfined upper and mainly takes place on southern margins including a narrow zone for the ct where high precipitation occurs and in the dune systems kanem and harr areas q to the north it accounts for between 0 and 13 of total precipitation wb 2020 the groundwater inflow in the upper aquifer also takes place through river groundwater interactions during flood periods in eastern and southern parts chari logone and komadougou yobé river systems vertical leakage or cross formational flow upwardly from the aquitard through the overlying q occurs south of manga the lateral inflow from the weathered crystalline bedrock on the southern and western boundaries may also take place in the northern part input from the nubian sandstone aquifer and tibesti may exist to the saline yoa lake ne of faya largeau and bodelé depression eggermont et al 2008 grenier et al 2009 kröpelin et al 2008 to date at present lake chad is an in transit hydrologically open system lake ensuring removal of dissolved salts exchanges between lake and the quaternary aquifer are not significant and according to isotopic data are limited up to a distance of around 50 km from the lake s shore zaïri 2008 lcbc ird 2016 the aquifer system discharge occurs via the surface water systems inflow gain flows from q and ct in the southern basin part and by groundwater abstraction through agricultural and drinking pumping wells mainly from the q aquifer groundwater discharge may occur to the lowlands northern region at the bodelé depression the lowest topographic point of the basin approx 165 m 3 methodology the adopted methodological approach to assess transboundary groundwater fluxes includes an updated understanding of the groundwater dynamics in the caf and further development of a steady state three dimensional 3d numerical model for the 2008 2011 period the model is based on the improved conceptual model the quantitative data analysis includes a review understanding and quality assessment of the following i daily rainfall and temperature data series from ground stations to assess natural recharge ii lithological logs to better define aquifer geometry iii spatial distribution of groundwater head observations and groundwater exploitation to define groundwater status and use iv aquifer testing to define the key hydrodynamic parameters v land use land cover and soil mapping for natural recharge assessments 3 1 data source

bgs http earthwise bgs ac uk the geological data retrieved and compiled from a number of scientific and technical publications were mainly provided by lcbc institut de recherche pour le développement ird reseau and brgm to characterize the geometry of sedimentary formations subsurface geological information was obtained from 430 lithological well logs datasets selection was based on those records considered quite precise with measured clearly geo localized attributes and with observations made whenever a change in stratigraphic sequence occurred and measurements were taken deep drilling generally for oil research occurs only in a few spots the ground based daily precipitation p and temperature t time series for 25 meteorological stations in the basin were compiled from the trans african hydro meteorological observatory tahmo platform van de giesen et al 2014 of the whole historic data record 1973 2018 the 2005 2014 period was chosen as that which presents the narrowest data gaps 20 in the time series in order to infer a groundwater level map for the 2008 2011 period water level measurements in wells piezometers or open wells were taken from public databases lcbc and reports the final selection included a dataset of 250 out of 9356 water points 3 1 1 applied tools the basin s three dimensional geological architecture was generated with the rockware code rockworks 17 based on the geological logs description the top and bottom depths of hydrostratigraphical units were obtained the model was also adjusted with existing cross sections and geophysical information from the literature the three dimensional geological model constitutes the basis for the 3d numerical flow model groundwater natural recharge in the caf for the 2005 2011 period was quantified with visualbalan v 2 0 samper et al 2005 a suitable spatially distributed computer code for long term simulations of the daily water balance in soil the vadose zone and the aquifer output was imported to the numerical flow model as model input 3 2 groundwater modeling 3 2 1 regional model definition modeling approach the aquifer system flow model steady state was performed with the modflow 2005 harbaugh et al 2000 under modelmuse 3 10 interface winston 2009 for the 2008 2011 baseline period the numerical model covers the chad formation aquifer system areal extension 1900 000 km2 based on outcropping geological materials and hydrogeological boundary conditions quaternary pliocene continental terminal basement the model domain extended beyond the caf s geological hydrogeological boundaries cretaceous and weathered granite basement buffer area to reduce the impact of the assumed boundary conditions on model outcomes fig 6 the top domain was set at the srtm30 dem topographic elevation the model domain was discretized into 198 rows and 187 columns with a cell size of 10 10 km the resulting mesh had 37 026 cells 18 967 active ones the model layer structure included four horizontal layers based on defined hydro stratigraphic units q pli aquitard lpli ct vertical discretization comprised 20 horizontal numerical layers total thickness of 530 m with the following distribution in depth layer 1 unconfined five sublayers 8 m thick 40 m total thickness layer 2 confined unconfined five sublayers 30 m thick 150 m total thickness layer 3 confined five sublayers 28 m thick 140 m total thickness layer 4 confined five sublayers 40 m thick 200 m total thickness for each model cell 379 340 active cells out of 740 520 value hydrogeological properties or node parameters were assigned according to the existing hydrostratigraphical units of each layer in order to simulate the hydraulic head condition in the chari baguirmi and bornou depressions a 40 meter deep drain covering the chari baguirmi and bornou areas was defined drain discharges input groundwater from the lateral boundaries to the northern basin part bodelé depression fig 1 the assumption of this geological draining layer is founded on the paleostratigraphical data that result from sedimentary deposition during ancient mega chad lake coastal migration 3 2 2 the initial and boundary conditions the initial condition groundwater hydraulic state at the start of the model run corresponds to the head levels from the potentiometric map fig 4 with 240 m and 270 m in the chari baguirmi depression and the bornou depression respectively three types of flow boundary conditions were defined head dependent flux specified flux and constant head the boundary conditions are presented in fig 6 the boundaries of the model domain were considered impervious due to the nature of the geological materials limiting the unit which shaped the zero flux boundary condition and no flow was simulated for the subsurface lower boundary model domain aquifer bottom head dependent flux conditions were considered at the chari logone komadougou yobé rivers and tributaries and the major chad and fitri lakes for the river boundary conditions riverbed conductance values used in modflow were based on river bed sedimentary deposit properties riverbed bottom and head of the river were obtained from dem lakes and dams were simulated by a constant head condition on the northern basin boundary lowlands the bodelé depression was simulated using a constant head boundary given the uncertainty of the bedrock top location this deep boundary was not included in the model the recharge and abstraction rates from wells were the specified flux conditions the spatially distributed recharge 2008 2011 independently estimated with visualbalan at the daily rate and based on meteorological data records from 25 tamoh stations was the input set of the the upper active cells top level the recharge values ranged from 8 10 10 m s 25 mm yr to 8 10 11 m s 2 5 mm yr and were zero for the northern basin part the groundwater abstraction rate upper aquifer is considered a local sink the amount was estimated at a yearly rate according to intended agriculture use i e agricultural management crop needs areal extension and local water withdrawal for drinking purposes water allocation according to the population www citypopulation de chad html united nations 2015 considering the scale of model abstraction was uniformly applied to the well fields extension and no individual wells were modeled 3 2 3 hydraulic parameters the initial values of the hydraulic parameters kh t s of aquifer formations assigned to layers and active cells were based on the field observations deriving from the collected hydraulic tests table 1 most observations corresponded to the q aquifer 54 tests and were located mainly in the komadougou yobé river basin chad and the chari baguirmi and hadjer lamis regions of chad near lake chad as data to support a spatially distributed hydraulic conductivity were scarce constant properties over large zones and throughout the hydrostratigraphic units were applied fig 7 the assigned values are summarized in table 2 for vertical hydraulic conductivity kz the kx 10 ratio was applied a high hydraulic conductivity value 0 05 m s was set for the model drain condition 3 2 4 model calibration and sensitivity analysis during calibration independently estimated natural recharge boundary conditions and hydraulic parameter values were adjusted to better match the simulated hydraulic heads to observations the final estimates of the hydraulic parameter values were obtained by model calibration based on the potential head datasets from wells potentiometric surface for the 2008 2011 period and qualitative criteria calibration by trial and error was carried out by modifying the hydraulic conductivity values to fit field observations the goodness of fit between the observed and simulated groundwater levels was measured using root mean square error rmse eq 1 and scaled rmse eq 2 which are good indicators to evaluate simulation performance the correlation between the observed and predicted values was calculated by coefficient of determination r2 eq 3 1 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n o m 2 rmse 100 i 1 n p i o i 2 n o m 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o m p i p m i 1 n o i o m 2 i 1 n p i p m 2 2 where o i is the measured head at n locations pi is the predicted value and o m is the observations mean the objective of the sensitivity analysis was to identify the input data and model parameters that most significantly affect the model s results a sensitivity analysis can increase the model s confidence and its predictions by providing an understanding of how the model output variables respond to changes in inputs the data used for calibration the model s structure among other factors i e model independent variables chen and chen 2003 recharge and abstraction were considered the most important drivers all simulations were based on running proposed changes in the calibrated numerical model for the defined conditions baseline a sensitivity analysis was performed by modifying the recharge water directly recharging the aquifer and water abstraction values by different amounts and comparing the obtained results groundwater level to the baseline data the strategy adopted for simulation involved applying a scaling factor of 10 the percentage definition was not based on the projections made by experts and stakeholders for future trends but is an indicator of the system response the model runs included i 10 recharge reduction ii 10 increase in water abstractions iii 10 recharge decrease and 10 increase in water abstraction 3 3 transboundary simulation transboundary flux simulation through the international borders of caf was performed after model calibration by running the regional numerical model with the zonebudget modflow postprocessor for a defined subregion of the modeled aquifer the zonebudget computed the groundwater balance and input output flow between adjacent areas to this end and following the areal extension of the member state countries sharing the chad aquifer formation five zones in the modeled area were defined for further model runs 4 results and discussion 4 1 regional model 4 1 1 model calibration as presented in the scatter plots of the observed and simulated groundwater levels fig 8a b the differences between the observed and computed groundwater levels gave a final rmse of 18 38 m and the scaled rmse was 4 75 which is lower than the recommended threshold value of 5 anderson and woessner 1992 giambastiani et al 2012 on average the calibrated values for the unconfined aquifer varied by up to 11 9 in relation to the initial values in depressions chari baguirmi and bornou with 0 13 for chari logone the east lake part the western part of the nigeria areas and along the guera impervious boundary the dispersion of the positive and negative residuals was also rather uniformly distributed in relation to 0 m rmse 18 38 m the best match was obtained in the chari logone area around lake fitri and the eastern lake chad part and in kano and the jigawa basin nigeria with residuals of 0 5 m which were higher in the bornou and chari baguirmi depressed areas 45 m the determination coefficient r2 was 0 9129 during calibration independently estimated natural recharge values were spatially lowered by different factors to better match the model s results river conductance q was modified according to the river bed s geological material characteristics to fit the groundwater level observations the initial hydraulic conductivity values and final calibration are reported in table 2 by considering the model s dimension the number of cells and the amount and quality of available data the calibration for the upper aquifer was considered to be reasonable satisfactory simulated groundwater level and flow pattern fig 9 with the calibrated hydraulic parameters showing reasonable agreement with field observations fig 4 no field observations north of lake chad 14ºn parallel impaired the piezometric level simulation recharge discharge areas and the northern sink are clearly identified the hydrogeological conditions in the depressed areas chari baguirmi and komadougou yobé and the eastern part with groundwater flooding in the guera zone were not accurately reproduced 4 1 2 water balance the modeling results indicated the major contribution of natural recharge together with existing surface water groundwater exchanges losing and gaining rivers mainly with the chari logone rivers fig 10 this contribution is especially important for the deep semiconfined aquifer where most of the river basin extends table 3 data are also supported by gonçalves et al 2020 the most important discharge is to rivers the water balance error from the 3d regional numerical model under simulated conditions accounted for 0 063 which is much lower than the recommended threshold value 1 the water balance error the difference between the total predicted and the inflow and total predicted outflow was only 0 13 106 m3 yr from the modflow results the water balance discrepancy for the two defined aquifers was 0 0064 and 0 0039 although considerable uncertainty exists for the lpli ct aquifer 4 1 3 sensitivity analysis the model shows the quaternary aquifer s clear response to net natural recharge variation where the impact of changes in water budget was very weak 0 0016 and not very sensitive to changes in water abstraction 0 0001 which take place locally and constitute a small part of the water budget fig 11 this is a reasonable behavior considering the basin wide scale of the work and mesh size the system appeared to be more sensitive to natural recharge than groundwater abstraction nevertheless the results indicated that the groundwater level was not very sensitive to either the 10 reduction drier than the baseline in the net recharge i or ii the 10 increase in water abstraction this finding indicated that the groundwater level was not strongly influenced by these changes with a lowering natural recharge i the groundwater level drawdown went up to 7 m as observed south of kanem and in the chari logone while several cells dried out in the ne area of lake fitri batha region the mean groundwater level lowered by around 1 5 m with an increase in only groundwater abstraction for irrigation and population supply simulations revealed a minimum impact on the groundwater level changes which were evident only in those areas only a few kilometers away from pumping areas as the highest withdrawal took place in the area near the western lake part due to irrigation a shallow groundwater drop in level was observed 0 6 m in the zones close to pumping areas when simultaneously considering net recharge and withdrawals 10 decrease in recharge plus 10 increased abstraction similar values were obtained with only a decrease in natural recharge this fact reflects that recharge is a key issue for the modeled area and also supports the model s robustness 4 2 fluxes to transboundary countries according to modeling aquifer flux exchange about 348 106 m3 yr took place along all the international borders of lcbc member states in the caf system transboundary fluxes input output x 106 m3 yr by considering the flow system hydrodynamics rather than aquifer boundaries as a quantitative analysis among the countries sharing common groundwater resources of the chad upper aquifer are found in fig 12 the chad aquifer system in chad shares international borders with six countries with regional groundwater flowing to lowlands and a wide areal extension which showed the greatest input flux table 4 following the defined regional transboundary hydrodynamics of the caf fig 4 the groundwater flux is toward the upper northern basin part according to the conceptual model output for the groundwater flow exchanges crossing the country s international borders all the sharing member states showed a positive flux input as regards output except for sudan and car for both country estimations may denote marked uncertainties due to limited information coverage lesser caf extension and their inclusion as buffer areas for modeling purposes nevertheless it is also noteworthy that the groundwater balance for the different sharing countries not the objective of this simulation which focuses on the caf system may show wide ranging results results from sensitivity analysis indicate that decrease of natural recharge would imply changes in the groundwater level average decrease less than 2 m mainly in chad south kanem lake fitri or the chari logone area with the highest drawdown as well as further implications for transboundary fluxes among countries in the bornu area nigeria the local groundwater level lowered due to withdrawn groundwater for agriculture at present most irrigation takes place using surface water which may affect the transboundary flux to chad observations and information prove too scanty to obtain more accurate results for the modeled area size 5 discussion 5 1 conceptual model the caf conceptual model relies on the previous model developed by schneider 1989 which was updated after extensively collecting and integrating all the available hydrogeological information to more accurately represent aquifer system behavior to date to this end the basin scale hydrostratigraphical framework was developed by integrating all the available geological information the basis for constructing a 3d conceptual model was the lithofacies analysis from boreholes however geological subsurface information coverage lithological logs was unevenly distributed water bearing formations hydrostratigraphical units q unconfined aquifer pli confining layer lpli confined aquifer ct semiconfined aquifer and the basement most accurate geometry less uncertainty lies in the central lake chad basin part the subsurface depth to bedrock cretaceous crystalline rocks is barely known sedimentary layers can show lithological variability and little continuity due to changes in sediment facies which result in heterogeneous hydrostratigraphical units of different aquifer properties water storage and water transmission in depth terms and also laterally the conceptual model consists of two multilayer aquifers the upper quaternary unconfined and the deeper lower pliocene and the continental terminal confined unconfined due to scale constraints minimum lpli unit thickness and data scarcity the lpli and ct hydrostratigraphic units were grouped into a single aquifer layer as no other natural surface outlets or natural sinks were identified the conceptual model definition considered that substantial groundwater loss could take place in the upper northern area lowlands bodelé however mechanisms still remain uncertain and data to estimate the magnitude of this process are lacking the natural recharge zones and rates defined by a distributed model are supported by the best available information the approach is based on a physically robust process for recharge estimations some associated uncertainty comes over owing to the time series of groundwater levels not being available for further calibration however other authors working in the area goni 2008 leblanc 2002 ngounou ngatcha and reynault 2007 have obtained similar recharge values to those obtained by modeling groundwater level observations are available mainly for the quaternary aquifer in the central and southern basin parts but are scarce and only exist in the southern part for the lower pliocene continental terminal the potentiometric surface defined for the 2008 2011 period is considered representative of a quasi steady state condition at the regional level by assuming that if groundwater levels appear more or less stable active recharge takes place and the amount of water withdrawn in most of the area is not large it presents similar characteristics to previous piezometric maps reported by other authors schneider 1989 leblanc 2002 and bgr lcbc 2010 including the presence of natural depressed areas to date several mechanisms overexploitation subsidence structurally conditioned deep drainage changes in seawater level and evapotranspiration loss have been suggested to explain the origins of depressed areas e g aranyossy and ndiaye 1993 dieng et al 1990 durand 1982 leblanc et al 2003 as provided by chemical and isotopic data abderamane 2012 recharge in depressed areas probably took place during the last pluvial period around 6000 yr nonetheless as the scientific community has reached no unanimous agreement its presence has been generally explained by exfiltration processes along with lack of recharge for saturated porous media when the groundwater level exceeds a depth of 10 m the water table is generally not subject to direct evapotranspiration except for the areas covered by acacias trees where the net recharge may be lower than the total et therefore the exfiltration mechanism is difficult to explain naturally with a groundwater depth of about 40 m leblanc et al 2007 in the conceptual model a deep drainage mechanism to the northern zone was adopted based on the paleostratigraphical data resulting from sedimentary depositions during ancient mega chad lake coastal migration drake and bristow 2006 griffin 2006 bristow et al 2009 maley 2010 5 1 1 modeling for transboundary issues flow model simulation involved developing a steady state 3d numerical model for the 2008 2011 period based on the improved conceptual model the model domain vertical discretization into four numerical layers included three aquifer layers q lpli ct one aquitard pli and the basement cretaceous and weathered granitic rocks which acted as a model buffer hydrogeological and hydrological features were simplified for model representation purposes lpli and ct were jointly taken as a unique aquifer layer for modeling purposes the defined model grid was quite coarse and could not be refined beyond 10 10 km per cell due to computational and data limitations in order to reproduce existing piezometric depressions under a steady state model condition at basin scale a mechanism capable of extracting groundwater from the system needs to be defined with exfiltration is the most widely accepted process by previous authors eberschweiler 1993 gaultier 2004 leblanc 2002 schneider 1989 for modeling purposes the solution adopted to simulate current hydraulic head conditions involved defining a subsurface drainage layer mechanism to remove groundwater input from lateral boundaries groundwater flow moves to the northern basin area however such singularity has not yet been fully validated conceptually or numerically and more research and data are needed to reach an agreement about interpreting this phenomenon model parametrization was based on data previously collected for the conceptual model definition for the regional model flow defining hydraulic conductivity zonation over large zones and throughout hydrostratigraphic units is a common approach modeling requires making predictions depending on large scale spatial averages rather than on local variability voss and soliman 2013 which also reduces computational efforts de caro et al 2020 for the aquifer river interaction the calculation of the flow between the river and aquifer was based mainly on streambed deposit properties dade and friend 1998 because it is assumed that all measurable aquifer river head losses are due to the streambed itself this approach is very useful for and applicable to regional studies when no information on streambed deposits is available calibration proved a complex task as data relating to the spatial scale were sparse mainly located in the central basin part basin and in wide areas and without any available data mostly in the northern basin half it is noteworthy that the local data calibration predicted responses only in these areas voss and soliman 2013 a worse match between simulations and field observations was achieved in bornou and chari baguirmi with higher and lower simulation results than the observations respectively the existence of drawdowns by pumping wells was not reproduced and wells field abstraction was appropriate for regional scale modeling but not for evaluating detailed drawdown patterns on the local scale being a steady state model model calibration was generally acceptable in the upper aquifer which was the main modeling objective however head calibration in the depressed areas was not very successful chari baguirmi komadougou yobé with a poorer match between simulated and observed heads the model was not very sensitive to water abstraction changes because they only took place locally the applied sensitivity analysis indicated that the obtained results were those expected for this large scale regional model changes in results were observed according to the perturbations applied to parameters with the largest differences found in the areas where no observation points were available however overabstraction by pumping for irrigation and supply may constitute a local groundwater issue for the basin if future developments take place the region has a 2 5 3 growing population rate www gwp org en wacdep implementation where lake chad which means that large amounts of groundwater may be required to support irrigation requirements during dry periods land cover changes resulting from economic development may also influence groundwater recharge rate which makes the aquifer particularly susceptible to impacts during low rainfall periods the objective of developing the model was to use it as a tool to study the system s different hydrologic conditions of them the assessment of aquifer regional transboundary hydrodynamics provided a quantitative understanding of the groundwater fluxes all over the sharing countries borderlines making up the lake chad transboundary aquifer rather than employing aquifer country boundaries this approach is a key issue for common groundwater resources management along borderlines rivera and candela 2018b as intrinsic uncertainties emerging from model development due to lack of observations or computing issues were translated to the obtained results the obtained quantitative values were estimations of the process taking place however the results of the aquifer exchanges from 14ºn parallel to further south can be considered more reliable data are scanty in the northern lake part the observed contributions from countries where bedrock outcrops sudan car nigeria should also be carefully considered in model outcomes as the simulated aquifer domain extended beyond the aquifer system formation boundaries buffer area 6 conclusions the basin wide perspective while integrating multiple available data sources provides a foundation to better understand and quantify basin wide hydrogeological dynamics to date the objectives included improving the understanding of lake chad formation transboundary aquifer system behavior and identifying possible groundwater hot spots by considering the whole spatial caf coverage the conceptual model proposed to support a numerical model was based on the best available preexisting hydrogeological data for the lake chad basin developing a model to evaluate regional behavior requires data on the regional scale but very few quantitative data are available for defining vertical and lateral boundaries and hydrogeologic properties significant data and knowledge gaps can influence any uncertainty in the hydrogeological conceptualization this work also characterized the contributing areas where recharge originates and where particular attention should be paid to water resources management water use and land use changes in these areas will directly influence aquifer recharge in the future this is especially relevant with climate change predictions which foresee rising temperatures evapotranspiration potentials and intensified hydrological cycles watershed conservation measures and nature based solutions are always a good no regrets approach for climate adaptation to mitigate the effects of floods and droughts while increasing infiltration and recharge moreover impacts on the recharge of surface water developments and irrigation investments like those in the komadougou yobe subbasin which led the northern basin of lake chad to dry up should be evaluated on a case by case basis from this basin wide perspective our modeling effort is the first basin wide perspective of water balance in the entire lake chad basin to integrate all currently available data given the data budget model complexity and computational limitations the established groundwater numerical model 3d steady state is a first step toward providing a support tool for managing aquifers on the basin scale water abstraction temporal variation changes in water recharge etc the modeling scale may limit its use as a predictive tool for groundwater local effects even though both the overall conceptual and numerical model needs to be further improved this basin wide modeling effort first provides estimates of transboundary groundwater fluxes across lcbc member states borders transboundary water management poses many special challenges ranging from common implementation strategy harmonization on information exchange to joint monitoring among other actions toward equitable distribution no standard approach exists for complex water resources distribution which is generally subject to negotiations between involved parties volume allocation according to aquifer extension or recharge fraction is a simple but not a good solution identifying sensitive zones of transboundary impacts may help to determine those areas that are likely to undergo quantitative changes on groundwater level water quality or artesian conditions finally it is necessary to enhance international cooperation and shared management strategies to prevent and mitigate further cross border conflicts and to more efficiently allocate groundwater resources credit authorship contribution statement guillermo vaquero investigation numerical modelling

8090,study region africa the lake chad transboundary aquifer study focus to understand transboundary groundwater hydrodynamics and estimate quantitative groundwater fluxes values between aquifer sharing countries to enable estimations we developed an updated 3d quasi steady state regional groundwater flow model of the chad formation based on integrating extensive available information and reflecting the best current conceptual understanding to date the conceptual model was tentatively assessed by a steady state numerical model based on modflow new hydrological insights for the region this model simulates lateral groundwater flows between neighboring countries and also provides insights into the large scale flow pattern and flows among hydroestratigraphic units modeling indicated that groundwater fluxes through international borders exist between basin sharing countries except between central african republic and cameroon where a buffer area was considered for modeling purposes leading to more uncertain results from 14ºn parallel to further north data are scanty and outcomes should be carefully considered forecasting transboundary impacts indicated that changes in recharge rates were more sensitive that changes in groundwater abstraction to date abstraction represents a small part of the water balance but if it increases it can become a driving factor in the future land use change and water use in the source areas southern area will have the strongest impact on transboundary groundwater flows due to changes in recharge which will lead to quantitative changes in groundwater levels artesian conditions or even water quality key words lake chad basin numerical modeling groundwater transboundary flux 1 introduction the lake chad basin is an inland drainage system that includes lake chad and covers an area of about 2355 000 km2 in the eastern part of the sahel region africa it is shared by algeria cameroon central african republic chad libya niger nigeria and sudan to a greater or lesser extent the water resources in the lake chad basin are the source of livelihoods and economic development and the hydrologic dynamics of the lake and its basin are closely linked with economic productivity and food security as member states make efforts to develop water resources for economic growth the lake chad basin commission has the mandate to monitor and understand water resources and their use in order to ensure sustainable transboundary water resources management several aquifers have been identified in the basin where the sedimentary chad aquifer formation caf is of primary use and is one of the largest aquifer systems in the world because it extends along the entire basin igrac 2012 igrac unesco ihp 2015 in the present day while water availability is not a limiting factor in the southern tropical part of the basin it constitutes the main water resource in the northern area there is concern about increasing abstractions possibly causing significant impacts on the basin s ecosystems water level and the lake chad extent and groundwater level drawdown in individual countries and local areas which have led the water charter to be adopted www cblt org en themes lake chad water charter vehicle sub regional integration and security the aim is to promote sustainable development through the integrated equitable and coordinated management of natural resources particularly the basin s water resources at the basin level one key issue involves water availability in sharing countries and further transboundary management rivera and candela 2018a thus an updated groundwater model that includes all the available information to date is a useful representation to understand the current groundwater dynamics system numerical modeling is a key tool used to represent current understanding by putting existing data to good use informing about new data collection efforts and forecasting behavior the efforts herein indicated to better understand groundwater dynamics contribute to this goal modeling groundwater resources is no new undertaking in the chad basin for the chad aquifer formation quaternary lower pliocene and continental terminal aquifers fig 1 and since the pioneering modeling works of schneider 1989 and eberschweiler 1993 with the gardenia code based on data from 1960 some hydrogeological models have been developed to date only a few of them are on a regional scale but they do not cover the entire hydrogeological basin and hydro stratigraphical units of the chad formation up to date information and concerns about transboundary issues have not been investigated regionally leblanc 2002 mainly focused on the recharge and discharge areas definition for the quaternary aquifer by combining satellite imaginary data gis methods and modflow 96 based on a single layer of variable grid transient mode based on noaa avhrr and grace remote sensing data boronina and ramillien 2008 used feflow to simulate the quaternary aquifer piezometric map including domes and depressions with a single unconfined layer with this regional transient modeling the system extension coverage of the quaternary aquifer covered about 500 000 km2 which correspond to the basin central region lake chad and its surroundings and the chari baguirmi area their outcomes pointed out data sparseness the weak aquifer impact of groundwater abstraction and natural recharge spatial variability both models reproduced existing piezometric depressions by taking exfiltration to be a discharge mechanism locally and based mainly on modflow with different hydrological objectives and after considering diverse areal extension ranges modeling efforts that focus on the unconfined quaternary aquifer have been made in certain areas of interest the result of the steady state modeling done of the chari baguirmi quaternary aquifer depression by massuel 2001 and abderamane 2012 indicate lake chad s limited contribution major seasonal inputs from the chari river and the long residence time of the deep groundwater in depressions as provided by chemical and isotopic data abderamane 2012 to reproduce the kazdell plain niger piezometric depression fig 2 gaultier 2004 jointly simulated a change in precipitation in the last 30 years with exfiltration to evaluate the past and present hydrogeochemical processes of the kazdell niger and bornu nigeria areas zaïri 2008 defined a monolayer transient model in the chari logone area candela et al 2014 developed a flow model for the upper aquifer q and ct that focused on forcing climate parameters to assess groundwater recharge in the present study the hydrogeological conceptual model of aquifer system development in the chad formation hydrogeological system s natural extent is defined by linking hydrogeological and geochemical data with the 3d geological model of the lake chad basin here conceptualization involves identifying and describing physical processes heads and flows of the groundwater controlling groundwater movement and storage in the hydrogeological system it includes data collection reviews and analyses while critical data are reviewed to ensure that errors are lacking for further modeling this is a prerequisite for designing the numerical model the aim of developing a numerical groundwater quasi steady state 3d regional flow model is to provide a quantitative tool that assesses land and water use impacts on the environment and groundwater systems model development was based on the conceptual model defined for the 2004 2011 period the main objectives at the global and transboundary levels were understanding groundwater flow processes developing relations between aquifer units groundwater recharge and extraction locations and rates 2 study area the lake chad transboundary aquifer the lake chad hydrologic basin lies between 6 n and 24 n latitude and between 8 e and 24 e

cover most of the surface area geology average thickness is 40 m and ranges from 2 m to 185 m the aquifer considered to be continuous on the lcb scale is heterogeneous with considerable lateral variability sediment type and facies distribution the lower pliocene confined aquifer consists of lacustrine clay with some alternating alluvial sand layers at the bottom of the formation red sand it extends over most of the chad area toward niger manga with boundaries on crystalline rocks w the termit basin nw and the agadem basin ne it is found only in boreholes deeper than 100 m at around 300 m

groundwater level data for the deep confined aquifer lpli ct only allow groundwater contours to be displayed in the southern part the regional groundwater flow is toward the central and northern basin zones bodelé north of kanem fig 1 the highest measured groundwater level is 370 m a s l in the southern basin part where the main natural recharge takes place the groundwater level generally lowers

intermediate aquifer by an aquitard of pliocene clays the deep ct aquifer is mainly confined and only outcrops in the northern and southern basin parts fig 1 tertiary where it is hydraulically connected to the q aquifer fig 5 depicts the chad formation hydrostratigraphical units schema which shows the areas of active recharge and discharge flow system and the dominant input output processes

were assigned according to the existing hydrostratigraphical units of each layer in order to simulate the hydraulic head condition in the chari baguirmi and bornou depressions a 40 meter deep drain covering the chari baguirmi and bornou areas was defined drain discharges input groundwater from the lateral boundaries to the northern basin part bodelé depression fig 1 the assumption of this geological draining layer is founded on the paleostratigraphical data that result from sedimentary deposition during ancient mega chad lake coastal migration 3 2 2 the initial and boundary conditions the initial condition groundwater hydraulic state at the start of the model run corresponds to the head levels from the potentiometric map fig 4 with 240 m and 270 m in the chari baguirmi depression and the bornou depression respectively three types of flow boundary conditions were defined head dependent flux specified flux and constant head the boundary conditions are presented in fig 6 the boundaries of the model domain were considered impervious due to the nature of the geological materials limiting the unit which shaped the zero flux boundary condition and no flow was simulated for the subsurface lower boundary model domain aquifer bottom head dependent flux conditions were considered at the chari logone komadougou yobé rivers and tributaries and the major chad and fitri lakes for the river boundary conditions riverbed conductance values used in modflow were based on river bed sedimentary deposit properties riverbed bottom and head of the river were obtained from dem lakes and dams were simulated by a constant head condition on the northern basin boundary lowlands the bodelé depression was simulated using a constant head boundary given the uncertainty of the bedrock top location this deep boundary was not included in the model the recharge and abstraction rates from wells were the specified flux conditions the spatially distributed recharge 2008 2011 independently

rate according to intended agriculture use i e agricultural management crop needs areal extension and local water withdrawal for drinking purposes water allocation according to the population www citypopulation de chad html united nations 2015 considering the scale of model abstraction was uniformly applied to the well fields extension and no individual wells were modeled 3 2 3 hydraulic parameters the initial values of the hydraulic parameters kh t s of aquifer formations assigned to layers and active cells were based on the field observations deriving from the collected hydraulic tests table 1 most observations corresponded to the q aquifer 54 tests and were located mainly in the komadougou yobé river basin chad and the chari baguirmi and hadjer lamis regions of chad near lake chad as data to support a spatially distributed hydraulic conductivity were scarce constant properties over large zones and throughout the hydrostratigraphic units were applied fig 7 the assigned values are summarized in table 2 for vertical hydraulic conductivity kz the kx 10 ratio was applied a high hydraulic conductivity value 0 05 m s was set for the model drain condition 3 2 4 model calibration and sensitivity analysis during calibration independently estimated natural recharge boundary conditions and hydraulic parameter values were adjusted to better match the simulated hydraulic heads to observations the final estimates of the hydraulic parameter values were obtained by model calibration based on the potential head datasets from wells potentiometric surface for the 2008 2011 period and qualitative criteria calibration by trial and error was carried out by modifying the hydraulic conductivity values to fit field observations the goodness of fit between the observed and simulated groundwater levels was measured using root mean square error rmse eq 1 and scaled rmse eq 2 which are good indicators to evaluate simulation performance the correlation between the observed and predicted values was calculated by coefficient of determination r2 eq 3 1 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n o m 2 rmse 100 i 1 n p i o i 2 n o m 3 r 2 i 1 n o i o m p i p m i 1 n o i o m 2 i 1 n p i p m 2 2 where o i is the measured head at n locations pi is the predicted value and o m is the observations mean the objective of the sensitivity analysis was to identify the input data and model parameters that most significantly affect the model s results a sensitivity analysis can increase the model s confidence and its predictions by providing an understanding of how the model output variables respond to changes in inputs the data used for calibration the model s structure among other factors i e model independent variables chen and chen 2003 recharge and abstraction were considered the most important drivers all simulations were based on running proposed changes in the calibrated numerical model for the defined conditions baseline a sensitivity analysis was performed by modifying the recharge water directly recharging the aquifer and water abstraction values by different amounts and comparing the obtained results groundwater level to the baseline data the strategy adopted for simulation involved applying a scaling factor of 10 the percentage definition was not based on the projections made by experts and stakeholders for future trends but is an indicator of the system response the model runs included i 10 recharge reduction ii 10 increase in water abstractions iii 10 recharge decrease and 10 increase in water abstraction 3 3 transboundary simulation transboundary flux simulation through the international borders of caf was performed after model calibration by running the regional numerical model with the zonebudget modflow postprocessor for a defined subregion of the modeled aquifer the zonebudget computed the groundwater balance and input output flow between adjacent areas to this end and following the areal extension of the member state countries sharing the chad aquifer formation five zones in the modeled area were defined for further model runs 4 results and discussion 4 1 regional model 4 1 1 model calibration as presented in the scatter plots of the observed and simulated groundwater levels fig 8a b the differences between the observed and computed groundwater levels gave a final rmse of 18 38 m and the scaled rmse was 4 75 which is lower than the recommended threshold value of 5 anderson and woessner 1992 giambastiani et al 2012 on average the calibrated values for the unconfined aquifer varied by up to 11 9 in relation to the initial values in depressions chari baguirmi and bornou with 0 13 for chari logone the east lake part the western part of the nigeria areas and along the guera impervious boundary the dispersion of the positive and negative residuals was also rather uniformly distributed in relation to 0 m rmse 18 38 m the best match was obtained in the chari logone area around lake fitri and the eastern lake chad part and in kano and the jigawa basin nigeria with residuals of 0 5 m which were higher in the bornou and chari baguirmi depressed areas 45 m the determination coefficient r2 was 0 9129 during calibration independently estimated natural recharge values were spatially lowered by different factors to better match the model s results river conductance q was modified according to the river bed s geological material characteristics to fit the groundwater level observations the initial hydraulic conductivity values and final calibration are reported in table 2 by considering the model s dimension the number of cells and the amount and quality of available data the calibration for the upper aquifer was considered to be reasonable satisfactory simulated groundwater level and flow pattern fig 9 with the calibrated hydraulic parameters showing reasonable agreement with field observations fig 4 no field observations north of lake chad 14ºn parallel impaired the piezometric level simulation recharge discharge areas and the northern sink are clearly identified the hydrogeological conditions in the depressed areas chari baguirmi and komadougou yobé and the eastern part with groundwater flooding in the guera zone were not accurately reproduced 4 1 2 water balance the modeling results indicated the major contribution of natural recharge together with existing surface water groundwater exchanges losing and gaining rivers mainly with the chari logone rivers fig 10 this contribution is especially important for the deep semiconfined aquifer where most of the river basin extends table 3 data are also supported by gonçalves et al 2020 the most important discharge is to rivers the water balance error from the 3d regional numerical model under simulated conditions accounted for 0 063 which is much lower than the recommended threshold value 1 the water balance error the difference between the total predicted and the inflow and total predicted outflow was only 0 13 106 m3 yr from the modflow results the water balance discrepancy for the two defined aquifers was 0 0064 and 0 0039 although considerable uncertainty exists for the lpli ct aquifer 4 1 3 sensitivity analysis the model shows the quaternary aquifer s clear response to net natural recharge variation where the impact of changes in water budget was very weak 0 0016 and not very sensitive to changes in water abstraction 0 0001 which take place locally and constitute a small part of the water budget fig 11 this is a reasonable behavior considering the basin wide scale of the work and mesh size the system appeared to be more sensitive to natural recharge than groundwater abstraction nevertheless the results indicated that the groundwater level was not very sensitive to either the 10 reduction drier than the baseline in the net recharge i or ii the 10 increase in water abstraction this finding indicated that the groundwater level was not strongly influenced by these changes with a lowering natural recharge i the groundwater level drawdown went up to 7 m as observed south of kanem and in the chari logone while several cells dried out in the ne area of lake fitri batha region the mean groundwater level lowered by around 1 5 m with an increase in only groundwater abstraction for irrigation and population supply simulations revealed a minimum impact on the groundwater level changes which were evident only in those areas only a few kilometers away from pumping areas as the highest withdrawal took place in the area near the western lake part due to irrigation a shallow groundwater drop in level was observed 0 6 m in the zones close to pumping areas when simultaneously considering net recharge and withdrawals 10 decrease in recharge plus 10 increased abstraction similar values were obtained with only a decrease in natural recharge this fact reflects that recharge is a key issue for the modeled area and also supports the model s robustness 4 2 fluxes to transboundary countries according to modeling aquifer flux exchange about 348 106 m3 yr took place along all the international borders of lcbc member states in the caf system transboundary fluxes input output x 106 m3 yr by considering the flow system hydrodynamics rather than aquifer boundaries as a quantitative analysis among the countries sharing common groundwater resources of the chad upper aquifer are found in fig 12 the chad aquifer system in chad shares international borders with six countries with regional groundwater flowing to lowlands and a wide areal extension which showed the greatest input flux table 4 following the defined regional transboundary hydrodynamics of the caf fig 4 the groundwater flux is toward the upper northern basin part according to the conceptual model output for the groundwater flow exchanges crossing the country s international borders all the sharing member states showed a positive flux input as regards output except for sudan and car for both country estimations may denote marked uncertainties due to limited information coverage lesser caf extension and their inclusion as buffer areas for modeling purposes nevertheless it is also noteworthy that the groundwater balance for the different sharing countries not the objective of this simulation which focuses on the caf system may show wide ranging results results from sensitivity analysis indicate that decrease of natural recharge would imply changes in the groundwater level average decrease less than 2 m mainly in chad south kanem lake fitri or the chari logone area with the highest drawdown as well as further implications for transboundary fluxes among countries in the bornu area nigeria the local groundwater level lowered due to withdrawn groundwater for agriculture at present most irrigation takes place using surface water which may affect the transboundary flux to chad observations and information prove too scanty to obtain more accurate results for the modeled area size 5 discussion 5 1 conceptual model the caf conceptual model relies on the previous model developed by schneider 1989 which was updated after extensively collecting and integrating all the available hydrogeological information to more accurately represent aquifer system behavior to date to this end the basin scale hydrostratigraphical framework was developed by integrating all the available geological information the basis for constructing a 3d conceptual model was the lithofacies analysis from boreholes however geological subsurface information coverage lithological logs was unevenly distributed water bearing formations hydrostratigraphical units q unconfined aquifer pli confining layer lpli confined aquifer ct semiconfined aquifer and the basement most accurate geometry less uncertainty lies in the central lake chad basin part the subsurface depth to bedrock cretaceous crystalline rocks is barely known sedimentary layers can show lithological variability and little continuity due to changes in sediment facies which result in heterogeneous hydrostratigraphical units of different aquifer properties water storage and water transmission in depth terms and also laterally the conceptual model consists of two multilayer aquifers the upper quaternary unconfined and the deeper lower pliocene and the continental terminal confined unconfined due to scale constraints minimum lpli unit thickness and data scarcity the lpli and ct hydrostratigraphic units were grouped into a single aquifer layer as no other natural surface outlets or natural sinks were identified the conceptual model definition considered that substantial groundwater loss could take place in the upper northern area lowlands bodelé however mechanisms still remain uncertain and data to estimate the magnitude of this process are lacking the natural recharge zones and rates defined by a distributed model are supported by the best available information the approach is based on a physically robust process for recharge estimations some associated uncertainty comes over owing to the time series of groundwater levels not being available for further calibration however other authors working in the area goni 2008 leblanc 2002 ngounou ngatcha and reynault 2007 have obtained similar recharge values to those obtained by modeling groundwater level observations are available mainly for the quaternary aquifer in the central and southern basin parts but are scarce and only exist in the southern part for the lower pliocene continental terminal the potentiometric surface defined for the 2008 2011 period is considered representative of a quasi steady state condition at the regional level by assuming that if groundwater levels appear more or less stable active recharge takes place and the amount of water withdrawn in most of the area is not large it presents similar characteristics to previous piezometric maps reported by other authors schneider 1989 leblanc 2002 and bgr lcbc 2010 including the presence of natural depressed areas to date several mechanisms overexploitation subsidence structurally conditioned deep drainage changes in seawater level and evapotranspiration loss have been suggested to explain the origins of depressed areas e g aranyossy and ndiaye 1993 dieng et al 1990 durand 1982 leblanc et al 2003 as provided by chemical and isotopic data abderamane 2012 recharge in depressed areas probably took place during the last pluvial period around 6000 yr nonetheless as the scientific community has reached no unanimous agreement its presence has been generally explained by exfiltration processes along with lack of recharge for saturated porous media when the groundwater level exceeds a depth of 10 m the water table is generally not subject to direct evapotranspiration except for the areas covered by acacias trees where the net recharge may be lower than the total et therefore the exfiltration mechanism is difficult to explain naturally with a groundwater depth of about 40 m leblanc et al 2007 in the conceptual model a deep drainage mechanism to the northern zone was adopted based on the paleostratigraphical data resulting from sedimentary depositions during ancient mega chad lake coastal migration drake and bristow 2006 griffin 2006 bristow et al 2009 maley 2010 5 1 1 modeling for transboundary issues flow model simulation involved developing a steady state 3d numerical model for the 2008 2011 period based on the improved conceptual model the model domain vertical discretization into four numerical layers included three aquifer layers q lpli ct one aquitard pli and the basement cretaceous and weathered granitic rocks which acted as a model buffer hydrogeological and hydrological features were simplified for model representation purposes lpli and ct were jointly taken as a unique aquifer layer for modeling purposes the defined model grid was quite coarse and could not be refined beyond 10 10 km per cell due to computational and data limitations in order to reproduce existing piezometric depressions under a steady state model condition at basin scale a mechanism capable of extracting groundwater from the system needs to be defined with exfiltration is the most widely accepted process by previous authors eberschweiler 1993 gaultier 2004 leblanc 2002 schneider 1989 for modeling purposes the solution adopted to simulate current hydraulic head conditions involved defining a subsurface drainage layer mechanism to remove groundwater input from lateral boundaries groundwater flow moves to the northern basin area however such singularity has not yet been fully validated conceptually or numerically and more research and data are needed to reach an agreement about interpreting this phenomenon model parametrization was based on data previously collected for the conceptual model definition for the regional model flow defining hydraulic conductivity zonation over large zones and throughout hydrostratigraphic units is a common approach modeling requires making predictions depending on large scale spatial averages rather than on local variability voss and soliman 2013 which also reduces computational efforts de caro et al 2020 for the aquifer river interaction the calculation of the flow between the river and aquifer was based mainly on streambed deposit properties dade and friend 1998 because it is assumed that all measurable aquifer river head losses are due to the streambed itself this approach is very useful for and applicable to regional studies when no information on streambed deposits is available calibration proved a complex task as data relating to the spatial scale were sparse mainly located in the central basin part basin and in wide areas and without any available data mostly in the northern basin half it is noteworthy that the local data calibration predicted responses only in these areas voss and soliman 2013 a worse match between simulations and field observations was achieved in bornou and chari baguirmi with higher and lower simulation results than the observations respectively the existence of drawdowns by pumping wells was not reproduced and wells field abstraction was appropriate for regional scale modeling but not for evaluating detailed drawdown patterns on the local scale being a steady state model model calibration was generally acceptable in the upper aquifer which was the main modeling objective however head calibration in the depressed areas was not very successful chari baguirmi komadougou yobé with a poorer match between simulated and observed heads the model was not very sensitive to water abstraction changes because they only took place locally the applied sensitivity analysis indicated that the obtained results were those expected for this large scale regional model changes in results were observed according to the perturbations applied to parameters with the largest differences found in the areas where no observation points were available however overabstraction by pumping for irrigation and supply may constitute a local groundwater issue for the basin if future developments take place the region has a 2 5 3 growing population rate www gwp org en wacdep implementation where lake chad which means that large amounts of groundwater may be required to support irrigation requirements during dry periods land cover changes resulting from economic development may also influence groundwater recharge rate which makes the aquifer particularly susceptible to impacts during low rainfall periods the objective of developing the model was to use it as a tool to study the system s different hydrologic conditions of them the assessment of aquifer regional transboundary hydrodynamics provided a quantitative understanding of the groundwater fluxes all over the sharing countries borderlines making up the lake chad transboundary aquifer rather than employing aquifer country boundaries this approach is a key issue for common groundwater resources management along borderlines rivera and candela 2018b as intrinsic uncertainties emerging from model development due to lack of observations or computing issues were translated to the obtained results the obtained quantitative values were estimations of the process taking place however the results of the aquifer exchanges from 14ºn parallel to further south can be considered more reliable data are scanty in the northern lake part the observed contributions from countries where bedrock outcrops sudan car nigeria should also be carefully considered in model outcomes as the simulated aquifer domain extended beyond the aquifer system formation boundaries buffer area 6 conclusions the basin wide perspective while integrating multiple available data sources provides a foundation to better understand and quantify basin wide hydrogeological dynamics to date the objectives included improving the understanding of lake chad formation transboundary aquifer system behavior and identifying possible groundwater hot spots by considering the whole spatial caf coverage the conceptual model proposed to support a numerical model was based on the best available preexisting hydrogeological data for the lake chad basin developing a model to evaluate regional behavior requires data on the regional scale but very few quantitative data are available for defining vertical and lateral boundaries and hydrogeologic properties significant data and knowledge gaps can influence any uncertainty in the hydrogeological conceptualization this work also characterized the contributing areas where recharge originates and where particular attention should be paid to water resources management water use and land use changes in these areas will directly influence aquifer recharge in the future this is especially relevant with climate change predictions which foresee rising temperatures evapotranspiration potentials and intensified hydrological cycles watershed conservation measures and nature based solutions are always a good no regrets approach for climate adaptation to mitigate the effects of floods and droughts while increasing infiltration and recharge moreover impacts on the recharge of surface water developments and irrigation investments like those in the komadougou yobe subbasin which led the northern basin of lake chad to dry up should be evaluated on a case by case basis from this basin wide perspective our modeling effort is the first basin wide perspective of water balance in the entire lake chad basin to integrate all currently available data given the data budget model complexity and computational limitations the established groundwater numerical model 3d steady state is a first step toward providing a support tool for managing aquifers on the basin scale water abstraction temporal variation changes in water recharge etc the modeling scale may limit its use as a predictive tool for groundwater local effects even though both the overall conceptual and numerical model needs to be further improved this basin wide modeling effort first provides estimates of transboundary groundwater fluxes across lcbc member states borders transboundary water management poses many special challenges ranging from common implementation strategy harmonization on information exchange to joint monitoring among other actions toward equitable distribution no standard approach exists for complex water resources distribution which is generally subject to negotiations between involved parties volume allocation according to aquifer extension or recharge fraction is a simple but not a good solution identifying sensitive zones of transboundary impacts may help to determine those areas that are likely to undergo quantitative changes on groundwater level water quality or artesian conditions finally it is necessary to enhance international cooperation and shared management strategies to prevent and mitigate further cross border conflicts and to more efficiently allocate groundwater resources credit authorship contribution statement guillermo vaquero investigation numerical modelling

8091,study region metropolitan taipei city taiwan study focus the severity of climate change in taiwan is increasing and the average temperature in taiwan has increased by 1 0 1 4 c over the last century which is higher than the global average a state of the art hybrid of multi dimensional complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition mceemd and radial basis function neural network rbfnn is developed for the analysis simulation and forecasting of extreme temperature events the mceemd is first introduced to process non stationary nonlinear gridded climate data from 1960 to 2017 the rbfnn model is then coupled with the mceemd algorithm to forecast the 7 day daily maximum temperatures in taipei new hydrological insights for the region long term time series data such as temperature exhibit non stationarity and non linearity thus making it more challenging to assessing the future trend and variability it is shown that for daily maximum temperatures in taipei changes in extremes are more pronounced and impactful than changes in the mean values in response to global warming the newly developed hybrid mceemd rbfnn model is capable of analyzing the nonstationary and nonlinear daily maximum temperature data and then forecasting the daily maximum temperature over the next 7 days short term trends and variability of daily maximum temperature in taipei can thus be identified

average global temperature alters the climate on earth the global mean surface temperature increased by 0 85 0 21 c between 1880 and 2012 ipcc 2013 due to increased global mean surface temperature the warm extremes increase and the cold extremes decrease moreover the land is warming faster than the oceans and the arctic region is warming faster than any region on earth thorne 2021 the first use of the term global warming to describe the gradual rise in global temperature was proposed by broecker 1975 broecker 1975 predicted that the exponential increase in the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere would become an important factor for global warming foster and rahmstorf 2011 analyzed five prominent time series of global temperature derived from nasa giss noaa nchc hadcru rss and uah and respectively used linear regression to calculate warming rates for adjusted data they also found the estimated impact of known factors el nin o southern oscillation volcanic aerosols and solar variability on temperature pietrafesa et al 2019 decomposed the non linear time series of global ocean surface temperature and global air temperatures by using the eemd to confirm patterns of frequency and found periods of warming and cooling from 1850 to 2018 owing to the impact of global warming the snow cover at the mid to high latitudes has decreased which has weakened the asian winter monsoon leading to a temperature increase along the east asian coast misra et al 2020 used the temperature data snow and ice cover data and other meteorological information to analyze the melt runoff from ungauged himalayan basins in india duan et al 2021 suspected that asia would suffer from significant increasing trends in mean surface temperature i e 0 25 0 34 c per decade under rcp4 5 and 0 42 0 6 c per decade under rcp8 5 taiwan is one of the most sensitive areas to global warming and it has recorded an average temperature increase of 1 0 1 4 c over the past 100 years which is higher than the global average hsu and chen 2002 taipei is the political economic and cultural center as well as the capital of taiwan according to the taiwan ministry of interior taipei has a population density of 9 723 persons km2 in year 2020 which is the highest in taiwan as a result of the severe urban heat island effect caused by the over exploitation of this city a lack of green areas and high population density the temperature of taipei is considerably higher than that of other surrounding cities taipei might account for 92 of the total number of natural disasters especially heatwaves that occurred in taiwan and showed an increasing annual trend lee et al 2020 the increasing incidence of heat related diseases as a consequence has led to financial and human losses in taipei for the aforementioned reasons temperature prediction is important for the administrators of taipei city to further analyze and interpret hydro meteorological data for assessing the climate change impact an effective quantitative analysis for extracting useful information and physical features from data would be desirable fourier transform is the earliest data analysis method titchmarsh 1948 whether fourier transform or a fourier based transform i e wavelet transform is used two constraints must be applied to ensure that the results are physically meaningful first the data must be stationary second the system must be linear however data on natural systems are most likely to be both nonlinear and nonstationary to overcome these limitations the hilbert huang transform is used to process nonlinear and nonstationary signal data this approach involves using empirical mode decomposition emd and hilbert spectral analysis hsa emd is an empirical intuitive direct and adaptive process without an a priori basis function this process can decompose the original data into several intrinsic mode functions imfs and derive trends for the entire duration of data collection huang et al 1998 1999 wu et al 2009 on the other hand data driven approaches such as the artificial neural network ann model are a massively parallel distributed information processing technique that can be used to forecast recognize and classify many types of climate events asce 2000 ustaoglu et al 2008 neural networks have many advantages including the ability to implicitly detect complex nonlinear relationships between dependent and independent variables the ability to test and detect all possible interactions between predictor variables and the ability to use a variety of training algorithms tu 1996 however most of the neural networks have the issue of encountering both the local minima i e the networks are trapped by the local error minima and high computational demand rbfnn has been shown to have none of these problems and is well suited for predicting daily mean maximum and minimum temperature time series ustaoglu et al 2008 with respect to the previous work of temperature and precipitation forecasting by ann approaches to name a few jang et al 2004 employed multilayer feed forward mlf neural networks based on a backpropagation bp algorithm to predict air temperature ustaoglu et al 2008 adopted three different ann methods including the feed forward back propagation ffbp radial basis function rbf and a generalized regression neural network grnn to forecast daily mean maximum and minimum temperature time series dombaycı and gölcü 2009 applied the ann model using levenberg marquardt lm feed forward backpropagation algorithms to predict daily mean ambient temperatures tran et al 2021 conducted a comprehensive review of 26 neural network studies that predict air temperature in the past 16 years 2005 2020 air temperature could be successfully predicted by various types of artificial neural networks anns in addition several studies demonstrated that the performance of ann approaches often provides more accurate predictions than other machine learning methods the radial basis function rbf neural network is a powerful nonlinear mapping technique moreover the radial basis function neural network rbfnn has a simple network structure fast convergence rate and strong approximation ability the rbfnn can be adopted for function approximation classification and time series predictions as well as to solve nonlinear problems ustaoglu et al 2008 wu et al 2013 di et al 2014 ustaoglu et al 2008 found that the rbfnn performs well on the daily maximum temperature forecasting liu et al 2009 proposed the empirical mode decomposition radial basis function

victoria nastos et al 2014 predicted the maximum daily precipitation for analyzing extreme daily precipitation events using the ann nourani et al 2020 used the observed temperature and precipitation time series to train the anns for the base period 1951 2000 and forecasting the future monthly temperature and precipitation between 2020 and 2060 by the trained anns kamel et al 2021 used temperature wind speed humidity and water depth as the model s input variables in the rbfnn and grnn model to forecast the surface evaporation rate wang et al 2015 proposed the ann approach based on the eemd algorithm their method is mainly used to decompose the input data into imf components and each imf component is used by the ann model for prediction tasks the ensemble technique is applied to the prediction results of all the imfs to obtain the final forecast data pre processing can improve the accuracy of time series forecasting yu et al 2008 wang et al 2015 tan et al 2018 used the eemd ann hybrid approach to forecast the streamflow one month ahead and the results show that the eemd ann hybrid approach can improve the forecast accuracy in flood seasons the application of the eemd algorithm to the processing of data significantly contributed to the accuracy of predictions of ann however the principle of eemd is to add noise in the decomposition process and after the ensemble of the imfs the noise is offset but the decomposed components might continue to have the noise residue that may possibly limit their improvement in accuracy therefore the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd is introduced to replace the eemd for temperature data processing which can effectively eliminate the noise residue in imfs yeh et al 2010 the objective of this paper is to propose a hybrid model multi dimensional complementary empirical mode decomposition radial basis function neural network mceemd rbfnn to forecast the future 7 day temperature on the basis of the concepts of decomposition and ensemble a state of the art model composed of an ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm that decomposes the spatiotemporal data and the rbfnn for our prediction is proposed in this study the mceemd is introduced to process the gridded daily maximum temperature data the rbfnn model is then coupled with the mceemd algorithm to forecast the 7 day daily maximum temperatures after that the forecasting results are calculated using three different criteria for the accuracy the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape finally the accuracy of prediction of the rbfnn mceemd is compared with the that of the rbfnn the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief description to the study area data and algorithms of eemd ceemd mceemd rbfnn and the hybrid mceemd rbfnn model the model evaluation criteria of the forecasting performance are presented in the latter part of section 2 the forecasting results of the proposed model are demonstrated in section 3 the discussions and conclusions are described in section 4 and section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area and data taiwan is a highly populated island located in the eastern part of asia at the intersection of northeast asia and southeast asia its area is approximately 36 000 k m 2 fig 1 displays the location of taiwan and its representative urban areas in consideration of the population economy culture and metropolitan area development of the region the ministry of the interior has established six municipalities in taiwan namely taipei new taipei taoyuan taichung tainan and kaohsiung city because the tropic of cancer at latitude 23 5 north crosses through taiwan the region has tropical and subtropical climate zones and it also has a monsoon climate the climate of taiwan is affected by two main factors monsoons and the unique mountainous topography of the region the southwest monsoon prevails in summer and the northeast monsoon dominates in winter and as a result different parts of the region experience different climates in terms of temperature because the climate in southern taiwan is closer to a tropical one the temperature changes in the north during winter and summer are greater than those in the south according to central weather bureau in taiwan https www cwb gov tw eng taipei is the smallest city among the six municipalities which has an area of 271 8 km2 and has a population of approximately 2 6 million people therefore taipei is the most densely populated city in taiwan as the capital of taiwan and the political economic and cultural center of the area taipei is a highly developed city due to topography development and climate effects taipei has the severe urban heat island effect and the temperature is considerably higher than that of other surrounding cities the gridded daily maximum temperature data used to predict the next 7 day daily maximum temperatures were obtained from the taiwan climate change projection information platform tccip for the period from january 1960 to december 2017 the resolution of these data was 0 05 0 05 in latitude and longitude and the area range was in taipei city in northern taiwan the aforementioned project collected all of its observation data from various organizations including the central weather bureau cwb water resources agency irrigation association taiwan power company and civil aeronautics administration caa as summarized in table 1 the stations of the irrigation association and the taiwan power company are collectively called the agricultural station the data are prepared through both supplementing the missing observation data and gridding the data through statistical interpolation weng and yang 2012 2018 the gridded observed daily maximum data in taipei city from july to september in summer were used in the rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn model and there were 22 grids in total the daily maximum data were collected from 1960 to 2017 the statistical data of the daily maximum data in taipei city are presented in table 2 in the prediction stage of these two forecasting models the time series of each grid contained a total of 7 179 records of which the records of 5 828 days 80 were used for training the network and those of the remaining 1 351 days 20 were used for testing the network table 3

nonstationary and stochastic processes is suitable for analyzing climate data economic data and geologic data the hht algorithm consists of two parts the first part is emd which decomposes a signal into multiple sinusoid like components called imfs and a trend the second part is the hilbert spectral analysis hsa where the hilbert transform is applied to each imf and the instantaneous frequency and amplitude are displayed huang et al 1998 to obtain meaningful instantaneous frequency as described previously huang et al 1998 defined an imf satisfying the following two conditions to apply the hilbert transform 1 in the whole dataset the number of extrema i e the number of maxima and minima and the number of zeros crossing differs at most by one 2 at any point the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope defined by the local minima is near to zero these two conditions not only limit the imf function to a narrow band but also modify traditional global changes to local changes therefore an imf whose amplitude and frequency can vary with time has a considerably simple and generalized oscillatory mode huang et al 1998 flandrin et al 2004 most of the signals in nature are not in the imf form as a result a method for decomposing both nonstationary and nonlinear signals into imfs was proposed the emd method adaptively separates an original multicomponent signal into zero mean amplitude modulation and frequency modulation components huang et al 1998 the emd algorithm uses an iterative sifting process that successfully breaks down complex functions into imfs of various scales the sifting process proposed by huang et al 1998 has two main purposes eliminate riding waves and increase the symmetry of the wave profiles therefore an original time series can be decomposed into a finite set of imfs and a residue as follows x t i 1 n c i t r t where n is the number of imfs c i t is a finite set of imfs and r t is the associated trend a flowchart of the aforementioned sifting process with all the critical steps is depicted in fig 2 2 2 2 complementary eemd in the emd process described in the preceding section the mode mixing or scale mixing problem which is defined as a single imf containing multiple oscillatory modes or a single mode of a similar scale residing in different imfs is encountered this effect may obscure the physical meaning of each imf li et al 2005 wu et al 2009 wu and huang 2009 proposed a noise assisted method termed the eemd algorithm to overcome the mode mixing problem it is recommended that the magnitude of the added noise does not exceed 20 of the magnitude of the input signal yeh et al 2010 and the total number of imfs should be fewer than l o g 2 n 1 where n is the length of the signal determined through eemd although the eemd approach can effectively solve the mode mixing problem the added noise contaminates the imfs in the result when the number of ensemble trials conducted to cancel the white noise is low yeh et al 2010 proposed the complementary eemd i e ceemd algorithm to fully eliminate the noise of the residuals in the signal reconstruction process the ceemd algorithm generates a pair of gaussian white noises one of which is positive and the other negative and adds these two noises to the original signal after a pair of imfs is obtained using the eemd algorithm the residual noise can be canceled using these ensembles the original data and the pair of added white noise can be expressed through the following equation m 1 m 2 1 1 1 1 s n where s is the original data n the added white noise m 1 is the sum of the original data with positive noises and m 2 is the sum of the original data with negative noises 2 2 3 multidimensional ceemd the multidimensional eemd i e meemd algorithm is an extension of the eemd algorithm from one dimensional to multidimensional data analysis the eemd approach was introduced in the preceding section the spatial locality and temporal locality of a signal can be obtained using this noise assisted and multidimensional data analysis method the meemd algorithm can be applied to two types of data namely spatial data i e image data and temporal spatial data i e gridded climate data herein the decomposition of these two types of data is described using the meemd algorithm the temporal spatial data such as gridded climate data the time series can be decomposed into components by using the meemd algorithm in each spatial grid and the components can be projected onto their individual spatiotemporal locations the different characteristic timescales of the modes obtained using the eemd algorithm varied marginally between neighboring grids therefore the components of all spatial locations have almost identical time scales not only the temporal locality but also the spatial locality can be extracted using the eemd meemd algorithm which makes it a powerful tool for managing climate variations wu et al 2009 feng et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 because the meemd algorithm is based on the eemd algorithm the components obtained after decomposition can be contaminated by added white noises in this study to overcome this drawback we replaced the eemd algorithm with the ceemd algorithm to decompose the time series in any spatial grid through this approach the extracted residue of the added white noises can be effectively eliminated 2 2 4 rbfnn broomhead and lowe 1988 first proposed the rbf a technique for solving multivariable interpolation problems in which a network is constructed through function approximations the rbfnn is a feedforward ann that uses rbfs as activations the learning process involves finding a suitable surface in a multidimensional space and this surface can be optimally adjusted through training by using statistical principles to minimize errors between the training data and the surface as illustrated in fig 3 the rbfnn is a three layer feedforward neural network that has two parts the nonlinear transformation from the input layer to the hidden layer and the linear transformation from the hidden layer to the output layer wu et al 2013 di et al 2014 the most important parts of the rbfnn architecture are the decision on the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the selection of the center point although a larger number of neurons in the hidden layer increases the complexity of the rbfnn architecture it can improve the accuracy of the estimated value moreover selection of the appropriate center point of the hidden layer considerably affects the convergence rate and stability of the network during training the center point can be selected using three types of methods random selection clustering selection i e k means fuzzy c means and orthogonal least squares ols selection in this study we used the trial and error method to set the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the ols method to select the node center according to chen et al 1992 when selecting the node center the ols method regards all training inputs as potential center points when a new center point is added the network output error value is decreased the stop criterion for increasing the number of center points in the hidden layer is that an acceptable error value is reached 2 2 5 mceemd rbfnn model the principle of the proposed forecasting model which aims to improve the prediction accuracy is based on the decomposition and ensemble techniques di et al 2014 wang et al 2015 that is when the nonstationary and nonlinear time series of each grid are decomposed into components by using the emd based algorithm these components are predicted by an ann finally the components are reconstructed as the final prediction result accordingly in this study we proposed a state of the art model in which the mceemd algorithm was combined with the rbfnn the mceemd rbfnn model has three processing stages namely decomposition component prediction and ensemble and they are briefly described as follows 1 normalize and rescale the original time series into the range 0 1 by using min max scaling to improve model training efficiency ustaoglu et al 2008 di et al 2014 x x m i n x max x m i n x where x denotes the original data and x denotes the normalized data 2 use the ceemd algorithm to decompose the normalized time series x t into n t h imf components c i t i 1 2 n and one residual component in each spatial grid 3 apply the rbfnn approach to forecast each imf component and the residual component 4 denormalize the forecasting results 5 combine the denormalized forecasting results from all imfs by executing step 2 to obtain the aggregated forecasting output of the original data fig 4 displays the framework of the proposed three stage forecasting model decomposition ceemd component prediction rbfnn ensemble 2 2 6 evaluation criteria to evaluate the accuracy of the forecast value the following criteria were used in this study the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape the correlation coefficient was used to measure the degree of correlation between the forecast values and the observed values the closer the correlation coefficient is to 1 the stronger the positive correlation is between the two variables r e a t μ a f t μ f σ a σ f the rmse is defined as the quadratic mean of the differences between the forecast values and the observed values r m s e 1 n t 1 n a t f t 2 where a t is the real value f t is the forecast value and n is the number of fitted points the mape is used to estimate the quality of predictions made using the model the mape function can be expressed as follows m a p e 1 n t 1 n a t f t a t 100 3 forecasting results in the input layer on the basis of the definition of heat waves ctx90pct the climatic characteristics of a day do not occur on the same date across years and may appear several days earlier in different years accordingly the daily maximum temperatures of the previous 7 days were selected as the input nodes in the forecasting models rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn to predict the daily maximum temperatures in the following week a t t 1 t 6 in the output layer due to heat wave conditions which must persist for at least 3 days however in the prediction process it is important to determine the optimal number of added neural nodes in the hidden layer to achieve the best forecast value with the lowest testing error in the network in this research the trial and error method was used to determine the number of nodes in the hidden layer for predicting the temperature of the following 7 days in addition due to the increase in the number of nodes the computational effort increases rapidly in this study the minimum number of nodes that would not cause drastic changes in prediction errors was selected fig 5 displays the testing error mape obtained with different numbers of nodes added which ranged from 2 to 30 for the rbfnn model at three neighboring grid points as illustrated in fig 5 a c when the number of nodes added in the hidden layer was five the testing error exhibited the least variation over the 7 day forecast period accordingly we added five neural nodes in the hidden layer of the rbfnn model to minimize errors in the case of the mceemd rbfnn model the time series of daily maximum temperature in each grid in taipei city was decomposed into 11 imfs and 1 trend by using the mceemd algorithm then to forecast the maximum temperature in the following 7 days we applied the rbfnn model to all components of the temperature time series for prediction these forecasting results were ensembled from all imfs and compared with the test data of every grid the testing errors obtained with different numbers of nodes added ranging from 2 to 30 for the mceemd rbfnn model at three neighboring grid points are depicted in fig 6 the testing errors at the remaining grid points in this case are presented in the appendix a table a1 according to fig 6 a c as well as table a1 we can reasonably infer that the addition of 10 neural nodes to the hidden layer minimized errors after determining the number of nodes to be added to the hidden layers of the rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn models we forecast the temperatures of the following 7 days by using the daily maximum temperature data of the past 7 days for each daily temperature forecast obtained using these two ann models the evaluation criteria of testing errors namely r rmse and mape were measured using the testing data and they are summarized in tables a2 and a3 in all of the grids in taipei city higher r 0 75 0 94 lower mape 2 4 5 and lower rmse 0 9 1 7 values were obtained when we applied the mceemd rbfnn model over the test period the mean evaluation criteria of two ann models are summarized in fig 7 a b the accuracy of the predictions of both models decreases with the number of days as the predicted number of days progressed mape increased r increased and rmse decreased in addition the mean value of mape and r at each day in the rbfnn model is larger than that of the mceemd rbfnn model for the first few days the rmse is smaller in the rbfnn model than that in the mceemd rbfnn model accordingly the mceemd rbfnn provided superior forecasts according to the given performance criteria than the rbfnn model figs 8 and 9 display the daily maximum temperatures forecast using the rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn model for the testing period 2007 2017 in a given grid 121 5 e 25 1 n in taipei city because the heatwave events are strongly associated with maximum temperatures it is necessary to accurately forecast the extreme values of the maximum temperature figs 8 and 9 display the forecasting plots obtained using the two aforementioned forecasting models the black and red lines represent the observed and forecast values as can be observed in fig 8 when the rbfnn model was used at the start of the second day of prediction the subsequent predictions over the testing period were not accurate by contrast the mceemd rbfnn model yielded more accurate extreme data values fig 9 the results indicate that the mceemd rbfnn model with emd data preprocessing before prediction is a more suitable model for predicting the short term daily maximum temperature for comparison with the predictions made using the data of the previous 7 days as the input values we made predictions using the data of the previous 14 days as the input values to determine whether the predictions would be more accurate for forecasting the daily maximum temperatures of the following 7 days fig 10 displays the testing error mape obtained by adding 2 30 nodes in the case of 14 days of input values when the mceemd rbfnn model is used at three neighboring grid points the testing errors at the remaining grid points in taipei city are presented in the appendix a table a4 as illustrated in fig 10 a c and table a4 the optimal number of neural nodes added in the hidden layer to obtain the minimum error is 15 for the case of 14 day input values table a5 displays the evaluation criteria for testing errors in this case the testing errors show that the forecasts for the first 3 days t t 1 and t 2 have higher r lower mape and lower rmse values however with the progression of days t 3 t 6 the magnitudes of the testing errors increased the mean evaluation criteria of mceemd rbfnn models using the previous 14 days are summarized in fig 7 c the accuracy of the predictions decreases with the number of days as the predicted number of days progressed mape increased r increased and rmse decreased in addition all of the testing errors of each forecasting day were not different from the case of the 7 day input scenario when the mceemd rbfnn model was used implying that the model performs similarly under the two input scenarios but in the 14 day input scenario the computation time was longer fig 7 b c and tables a3 a5 fig 11 displays the forecasting plots obtained for the case of 14 input values when the mceemd rbfnn model was used in comparison with the original data the extreme values of daily maximum temperature can be better captured for a 3 day forecast than for a longer prediction window i e 4 7 days according to these results heat wave events in which the the extreme high temperature persists for at least 3 days can be accurately predicted by using the proposed mceemd rbfnn model 4 discussions short term prediction of the daily maximum temperature by using a newly developed forecasting model that combines the decomposition mceemd and prediction ann processes in taipei city was comprehensively demonstrated we applied the rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn models to forecast the daily maximum temperature over the next 7 days in taipei city by using the data of the preceding 7 days as the input values the numbers of nodes in the hidden layer that yielded the minimum testing error were determined using the trial and error method 5 for the rbfnn and 10 for the mceemd rbfnn results from this study show that for daily maximum temperatures in highly developed metropolitan cities like taipei taiwan changes in extremes are more pronounced and impactful than changes in the mean values in response to global warming a comparison of all the prediction results indicated that the forecasting precision was higher when the mceemd rbfnn model was used than that when the rbfnn model was used the curve graph of three evaluation criteria for the next 7 day prediction is demonstrated in fig 7 the accuracy of the forecast gradually decreases as the number of days increases it can be expected that the accuracy of the forecast will be the highest for the next adjacent days the more distant the future prediction days are away from the present day the less accurate the forecast will be with the increment of time the percentage of mape increases the value of r increases and the value of rmse decreases for both the rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn models in the rbfnn model the percentage values of mape are higher than those of the mceemd rbfnn model and so are the values of rmse the r values in the rbfnn model are higher than those in the mceemd rbfnn for the first few days with the increasing number of days in the prediction the r values in the two models are closer it can be shown from all three evaluation criteria that the prediction results of the mceemd rbfnn are significantly superior to those of the rbfnn moreover the performance achieved when the 14 day data were used as the input values to predict the daily maximum temperatures of the following 7 days was similar to that when the 7 day data were used as the input values but in the case of the 14 day data as input values the computation time was longer fig 7 b c the testing errors in terms of mape in the forecast data of the following 7 days were lower than 5 indicating that the forecasts were reasonable in the plot of forecast values the extreme values of the daily maximum temperature were well captured for the first 3 days accordingly a short term heat wave event for 3 days or more in the following week can be predicted using the mceemd rbfnn model and the daily maximum temperature data of the past 7 and 14 days in taipei city 5 conclusions and recommendations to avoid heat related incidents caused by extreme high temperature events that last for several consecutive days it is necessary to predict the daily maximum temperature accurately the proposed forecasting model that couples the emd based algorithm and the ann method can forecast short term time series the combination of mceemd and ann was used to predict the daily maximum temperature in taipei city where a substantial increase in heat wave event occurrences has been observed the mceemd rbfnn model outperformed the rbfnn model in predicting the maximum daily temperatures of the following 7 days in the testing period with high correlation coefficient r and low mape and rmse values consequently these results can be used by local authorities to prevent heat related injuries and incidents caused by extreme heat based on the outcomes the accuracy of the following 7 day maximum temperature prediction of the hybrid mceemd rbfnn model has been significantly improved compared with the rbfnn model and the accuracy of the prediction is also quantified the practical implications of this study are twofold first by applying the hybrid mceemd rbfnn model only the previous 7 days of temperature data are needed to promptly predict the future 7 day daily maximum temperature with a minimal error a temperature prediction system for high temperature events can be established to alert the public for avoiding exposure to high temperatures outdoors thus reducing diseases resulting from high temperature events additionally a better understanding of the future 7 day high temperature could facilitate the government authorities to issue an early warning to the community and vulnerable population groups in case of heat waves or forest fires caused by high temperature and to develop long term and sustainable emergency preparedness to minimize the impacts of heat waves on health and wellness this paper primarily focuses on improving the temperature prediction capability of rbfnn by processing the temperature data with mceemd it is noticed that for short term predictions the model occasionally has some discrepancies to capture the peak values beyond a 3 day forecast another rbfnn parameter that can be adjusted is the spread constants to obtain higher accuracy in prediction windows longer than 3 days one can test different values of the spread constants and numbers of hidden layer neurons in the rbfnn model additionally other evaluation criteria such as the index of agreement can be used to quantify and better present the testing errors in the extreme values between the predicted and actual values for future work the prediction of cold spell events low temperature events can be attempted different pairs of the adoption window for the input data other than 7 days and 14 days and the prediction window for the forecast days should be further

8091,study region metropolitan taipei city taiwan study focus the severity of climate change in taiwan is increasing and the average temperature in taiwan has increased by 1 0 1 4 c over the last century which is higher than the global average a state of the art hybrid of multi dimensional complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition mceemd and radial basis function neural network rbfnn is developed for the analysis simulation and forecasting of extreme temperature events the mceemd is first introduced to process non stationary nonlinear gridded climate data from 1960 to 2017 the rbfnn model is then coupled with the mceemd algorithm to forecast the 7 day daily maximum temperatures in taipei new hydrological insights for the region long term time series data such as temperature exhibit non stationarity and non linearity thus making it more challenging to assessing the future trend and variability it is shown that for daily maximum temperatures in taipei changes in extremes are more pronounced and impactful than changes in the mean values in response to global warming the newly developed hybrid mceemd rbfnn model is capable of analyzing the nonstationary and nonlinear daily maximum temperature data and then forecasting the daily maximum temperature over the next 7 days short term trends and variability of daily maximum temperature in taipei can thus be identified

mode decomposition neural network global climate change 1 introduction over the past century the global climate has warmed in an unprecedented manner global warming which refers to an increase in the average global temperature alters the climate on earth the global mean surface temperature increased by 0 85 0 21 c between 1880 and 2012 ipcc 2013 due to increased global mean surface temperature the warm extremes increase and the cold extremes decrease moreover the land is warming faster than the oceans and the arctic region is warming faster than any region on earth thorne 2021 the first use of the term global warming to describe the gradual rise in global temperature was proposed by broecker 1975 broecker 1975 predicted that the exponential increase in the carbon dioxide content in the atmosphere would become an important factor for global warming foster and rahmstorf 2011 analyzed five prominent time series of global temperature derived from nasa giss noaa nchc hadcru rss and uah and respectively used linear regression to calculate warming rates for adjusted data they also found the estimated impact of known factors el nin o southern oscillation volcanic aerosols and solar variability on temperature pietrafesa et al 2019 decomposed the non linear time series of global ocean surface temperature and global air temperatures by using the eemd to confirm patterns of frequency and found periods of warming and cooling from 1850 to 2018 owing to the impact of global warming the snow cover at the mid to high latitudes has decreased which has weakened the asian winter monsoon leading to a temperature increase along the east asian coast misra et al 2020 used the temperature data snow and ice cover data and other meteorological information to analyze the melt runoff from ungauged himalayan basins in india duan et al 2021 suspected that asia would suffer from significant increasing trends in mean surface temperature i e 0 25 0 34 c per decade under rcp4 5 and 0 42 0 6 c per decade under rcp8 5 taiwan is one of the most sensitive areas to global warming and it has recorded an average temperature increase of 1 0 1 4 c over the past 100 years which is higher than the global average hsu and chen 2002 taipei is the political economic and cultural center as well as the capital of taiwan according to the taiwan ministry of interior taipei has a population density of 9 723 persons km2 in year 2020 which is the highest in taiwan as a result of the severe urban heat island effect caused by the over exploitation of this city a lack of green areas and high population density the temperature of taipei is considerably higher than that of other surrounding cities taipei might account for 92 of the total number of natural disasters especially heatwaves that occurred in taiwan and showed an increasing annual trend lee et al 2020 the increasing incidence of heat related diseases as a consequence has led to financial and human losses in taipei for the aforementioned reasons temperature prediction is important for the administrators of taipei city to further analyze and interpret hydro meteorological data for assessing the climate change impact an effective quantitative analysis for extracting useful information and physical features from data would be desirable fourier transform is the earliest data analysis method titchmarsh 1948 whether fourier transform or a fourier based transform i e wavelet transform is used two constraints must be applied to ensure that the results are physically meaningful first the data must be stationary second the system must be linear however data on natural systems are most likely to be both nonlinear and nonstationary to overcome these limitations the hilbert huang transform is used to process nonlinear and nonstationary signal data this approach involves using empirical mode decomposition emd and hilbert spectral analysis hsa emd is an empirical intuitive direct and adaptive process without an a priori basis function this process can decompose the original data into several intrinsic mode functions imfs and derive trends for the entire duration of data collection huang et al 1998 1999 wu et al 2009 on the other hand data driven approaches such as the artificial neural network ann model are a massively parallel distributed information processing technique that can be used to forecast recognize and classify many types of climate events asce 2000 ustaoglu et al 2008 neural networks have many advantages including the ability to implicitly detect complex nonlinear relationships between dependent and independent variables the ability to test and detect all possible interactions between predictor variables and the ability to use a variety of training algorithms tu 1996 however most of the neural networks have the issue of encountering both the local minima i e the networks are trapped by the local error minima and high computational demand rbfnn has been shown to have none of these problems and is well suited for predicting daily mean maximum and minimum temperature time series ustaoglu et al 2008 with respect to the previous work of temperature and precipitation forecasting by ann approaches to name a few jang et al 2004 employed multilayer feed forward mlf neural networks based on a backpropagation bp algorithm to predict air temperature ustaoglu et al 2008 adopted three different ann methods including the feed forward back propagation ffbp radial basis function rbf and a generalized regression neural network grnn to forecast daily mean maximum and minimum temperature time series dombaycı and gölcü 2009 applied the ann model using levenberg marquardt lm feed forward backpropagation algorithms to predict daily mean ambient temperatures tran et al 2021 conducted a comprehensive review of 26 neural network studies that predict air temperature in the past 16 years 2005 2020 air temperature could be successfully predicted by various types of artificial neural networks anns in addition several studies demonstrated that the performance of ann approaches often provides more accurate predictions than other machine learning methods the radial basis function rbf neural network is a powerful nonlinear mapping technique moreover the radial basis function neural network rbfnn has a simple network structure fast convergence rate and strong approximation ability the rbfnn can be adopted for function approximation classification and time series predictions as well as to solve nonlinear problems ustaoglu et al 2008 wu et al 2013 di et al 2014 ustaoglu et al 2008 found that the rbfnn performs well on the daily maximum temperature forecasting liu et al 2009 proposed the empirical mode decomposition radial basis function neural network emd rbfnn model to analyze monthly rainfall data mekanik et al 2013 applied the ann approach and multiple regression analysis mr to forecast the long term seasonal spring rainfall in victoria nastos et al 2014 predicted the maximum daily precipitation for analyzing extreme daily precipitation events using the ann nourani et al 2020 used the observed temperature and precipitation time series to train the anns for the base period 1951 2000 and forecasting the future monthly temperature and precipitation between 2020 and 2060 by the trained anns kamel et al 2021 used temperature wind speed humidity and water depth as the model s input variables in the rbfnn and grnn model to forecast the surface evaporation rate wang et al 2015 proposed the ann approach based on the eemd algorithm their method is mainly used to decompose the input data into imf components and each imf component is used by the ann model for prediction tasks the ensemble technique is applied to the prediction results of all the imfs to obtain the final forecast data pre processing can improve the accuracy of time series forecasting yu et al 2008 wang et al 2015 tan et al 2018 used the eemd ann hybrid approach to forecast the streamflow one month ahead and the results show that the eemd ann hybrid approach can improve the forecast accuracy in flood seasons the application of the eemd algorithm to the processing of data significantly contributed to the accuracy of predictions of ann however the principle of eemd is to add noise in the decomposition process and after the ensemble of the imfs the noise is offset but the decomposed components might continue to have the noise residue that may possibly limit their improvement in accuracy therefore the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition ceemd is introduced to replace the eemd for temperature data processing which can effectively eliminate the noise residue in imfs yeh et al 2010 the objective of this paper is to propose a hybrid model multi dimensional complementary empirical mode decomposition radial basis function neural network mceemd rbfnn to forecast the future 7 day temperature on the basis of the concepts of decomposition and ensemble a state of the art model composed of an ensemble empirical mode decomposition algorithm that decomposes the spatiotemporal data and the rbfnn for our prediction is proposed in this study the mceemd is introduced to process the gridded daily maximum temperature data the rbfnn model is then coupled with the mceemd algorithm to forecast the 7 day daily maximum temperatures after that the forecasting results are calculated using three different criteria for the accuracy the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape finally the accuracy of prediction of the rbfnn mceemd is compared with the that of the rbfnn the rest of the paper is organized as follows section 2 gives a brief description to the study area data and algorithms of eemd ceemd mceemd rbfnn and the hybrid mceemd rbfnn model the model evaluation criteria of the forecasting performance are presented in the latter part of section 2 the forecasting results of the proposed model are demonstrated in section 3 the discussions and conclusions are described in section 4 and section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of study area and data taiwan is a highly populated island located in the eastern part of asia at the intersection of northeast asia and southeast asia its area is approximately 36 000 k m 2 fig 1 displays the location of taiwan and its representative urban areas in consideration of the population economy culture and metropolitan area development of the region the ministry of the interior has established six municipalities in taiwan namely taipei new taipei taoyuan taichung tainan and kaohsiung city because the tropic of cancer at latitude 23 5 north crosses through taiwan the region has tropical and subtropical climate zones and it also has a monsoon climate the climate of taiwan is affected by two main factors monsoons and the unique mountainous topography of the region the southwest monsoon prevails in summer and the northeast monsoon dominates in winter and as a result different parts of the region experience different climates in terms of temperature because the climate in southern taiwan is closer to a tropical one the temperature changes in the north during winter and summer are greater than those in the south according to central weather bureau in taiwan https www cwb gov tw eng taipei is the smallest city among the six municipalities which has an area of 271 8 km2 and has a population of approximately 2 6 million people therefore taipei is the most densely populated city in taiwan as the capital of taiwan and the political economic and cultural center of the area taipei is a highly developed city due to topography development and climate effects taipei has the severe urban heat island effect and the temperature is considerably higher than that of other surrounding cities the gridded daily maximum temperature data used to predict the next 7 day daily maximum temperatures were obtained from the taiwan climate change projection information platform tccip for the period from january 1960 to december 2017 the resolution of these data was 0 05 0 05 in latitude and longitude and the area range was in taipei city in northern taiwan the aforementioned project collected all of its observation data from various organizations including the central weather bureau cwb water resources agency irrigation association taiwan power company and civil aeronautics administration caa as summarized in table 1 the stations of the irrigation association and the taiwan power company are collectively called the agricultural station the data are prepared through both supplementing the missing observation data and gridding the data through statistical interpolation weng and yang 2012 2018 the gridded observed daily maximum data in taipei city from july to september in summer were used in the rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn model and there were 22 grids in total the daily maximum data were collected from 1960 to 2017 the statistical data of the daily maximum data in taipei city are presented in table 2 in the prediction stage of these two forecasting models the time series of each grid contained a total of 7 179 records of which the records of 5 828 days 80 were used for training the network and those of the remaining 1 351 days 20 were used for testing the network table 3 2 2 methods 2 2 1 hilbert huang transform time frequency analysis a powerful tool for investigating the characteristic scale and energy distribution of the input data can facilitate observation of the time and frequency domain information of a signal the hilbert huang transform hht without an a priori basis the development of which was motivated by a need to examine data from real world nonlinear nonstationary and stochastic processes is suitable for analyzing climate data economic data and geologic data the hht algorithm consists of two parts the first part is emd which decomposes a signal into multiple sinusoid like components called imfs and a trend the second part is the hilbert spectral analysis hsa where the hilbert transform is applied to each imf and the instantaneous frequency and amplitude are displayed huang et al 1998 to obtain meaningful instantaneous frequency as described previously huang et al 1998 defined an imf satisfying the following two conditions to apply the hilbert transform 1 in the whole dataset the number of extrema i e the number of maxima and minima and the number of zeros crossing differs at most by one 2 at any point the mean value of the envelope defined by the local maxima and the envelope defined by the local minima is near to zero these two conditions not only limit the imf function to a narrow band but also modify traditional global changes to local changes therefore an imf whose amplitude and frequency can vary with time has a considerably simple and generalized oscillatory mode huang et al 1998 flandrin et al 2004 most of the signals in nature are not in the imf form as a result a method for decomposing both nonstationary and nonlinear signals into imfs was proposed the emd method adaptively separates an original multicomponent signal into zero mean amplitude modulation and frequency modulation components huang et al 1998 the emd algorithm uses an iterative sifting process that successfully breaks down complex functions into imfs of various scales the sifting process proposed by huang et al 1998 has two main purposes eliminate riding waves and increase the symmetry of the wave profiles therefore an original time series can be decomposed into a finite set of imfs and a residue as follows x t i 1 n c i t r t where n is the number of imfs c i t is a finite set of imfs and r t is the associated trend a flowchart of the aforementioned sifting process with all the critical steps is depicted in fig 2 2 2 2 complementary eemd in the emd process described in the preceding section the mode mixing or scale mixing problem which is defined as a single imf containing multiple oscillatory modes or a single mode of a similar scale residing in different imfs is encountered this effect may obscure the physical meaning of each imf li et al 2005 wu et al 2009 wu and huang 2009 proposed a noise assisted method termed the eemd algorithm to overcome the mode mixing problem it is recommended that the magnitude of the added noise does not exceed 20 of the magnitude of the input signal yeh et al 2010 and the total number of imfs should be fewer than l o g 2 n 1 where n is the length of the signal determined through eemd although the eemd approach can effectively solve the mode mixing problem the added noise contaminates the imfs in the result when the number of ensemble trials conducted to cancel the white noise is low yeh et al 2010 proposed the complementary eemd i e ceemd algorithm to fully eliminate the noise of the residuals in the signal reconstruction process the ceemd algorithm generates a pair of gaussian white noises one of which is positive and the other negative and adds these two noises to the original signal after a pair of imfs is obtained using the eemd algorithm the residual noise can be canceled using these ensembles the original data and the pair of added white noise can be expressed through the following equation m 1 m 2 1 1 1 1 s n where s is the original data n the added white noise m 1 is the sum of the original data with positive noises and m 2 is the sum of the original data with negative noises 2 2 3 multidimensional ceemd the multidimensional eemd i e meemd algorithm is an extension of the eemd algorithm from one dimensional to multidimensional data analysis the eemd approach was introduced in the preceding section the spatial locality and temporal locality of a signal can be obtained using this noise assisted and multidimensional data analysis method the meemd algorithm can be applied to two types of data namely spatial data i e image data and temporal spatial data i e gridded climate data herein the decomposition of these two types of data is described using the meemd algorithm the temporal spatial data such as gridded climate data the time series can be decomposed into components by using the meemd algorithm in each spatial grid and the components can be projected onto their individual spatiotemporal locations the different characteristic timescales of the modes obtained using the eemd algorithm varied marginally between neighboring grids therefore the components of all spatial locations have almost identical time scales not only the temporal locality but also the spatial locality can be extracted using the eemd meemd algorithm which makes it a powerful tool for managing climate variations wu et al 2009 feng et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 because the meemd algorithm is based on the eemd algorithm the components obtained after decomposition can be contaminated by added white noises in this study to overcome this drawback we replaced the eemd algorithm with the ceemd algorithm to decompose the time series in any spatial grid through this approach the extracted residue of the added white noises can be effectively eliminated 2 2 4 rbfnn broomhead and lowe 1988 first proposed the rbf a technique for solving multivariable interpolation problems in which a network is constructed through function approximations the rbfnn is a feedforward ann that uses rbfs as activations the learning process involves finding a suitable surface in a multidimensional space and this surface can be optimally adjusted through training by using statistical principles to minimize errors between the training data and the surface as illustrated in fig 3 the rbfnn is a three layer feedforward neural network that has two parts the nonlinear transformation from the input layer to the hidden layer and the linear transformation from the hidden layer to the output layer wu et al 2013 di et al 2014 the most important parts of the rbfnn architecture are the decision on the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the selection of the center point although a larger number of neurons in the hidden layer increases the complexity of the rbfnn architecture it can improve the accuracy of the estimated value moreover selection of the appropriate center point of the hidden layer considerably affects the convergence rate and stability of the network during training the center point can be selected using three types of methods random selection clustering selection i e k means fuzzy c means and orthogonal least squares ols selection in this study we used the trial and error method to set the number of neurons in the hidden layer and the ols method to select the node center according to chen et al 1992 when selecting the node center the ols method regards all training inputs as potential center points when a new center point is added the network output error value is decreased the stop criterion for increasing the number of center points in the hidden layer is that an acceptable error value is reached 2 2 5 mceemd rbfnn model the principle of the proposed forecasting model which aims to improve the prediction accuracy is based on the decomposition and ensemble techniques di et al 2014 wang et al 2015 that is when the nonstationary and nonlinear time series of each grid are decomposed into components by using the emd based algorithm these components are predicted by an ann finally the components are reconstructed as the final prediction result accordingly in this study we proposed a state of the art model in which the mceemd algorithm was combined with the rbfnn the mceemd rbfnn model has three processing stages namely decomposition component prediction and ensemble and they are briefly described as follows 1 normalize and rescale the original time series into the range 0 1 by using min max scaling to improve model training efficiency ustaoglu et al 2008 di et al 2014 x x m i n x max x m i n x where x denotes the original data and x denotes the normalized data 2 use the ceemd algorithm to decompose the normalized time series x t into n t h imf components c i t i 1 2 n and one residual component in each spatial grid 3 apply the rbfnn approach to forecast each imf component and the residual component 4 denormalize the forecasting results 5 combine the denormalized forecasting results from all imfs by executing step 2 to obtain the aggregated forecasting output of the original data fig 4 displays the framework of the proposed three stage forecasting model decomposition ceemd component prediction rbfnn ensemble 2 2 6 evaluation criteria to evaluate the accuracy of the forecast value the following criteria were used in this study the correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse and mean absolute percentage error mape the correlation coefficient was used to measure the degree of correlation between the forecast values and the observed values the closer the correlation coefficient is to 1 the stronger the positive correlation is between the two variables r e a t μ a f t μ f σ a σ f the rmse is defined as the quadratic mean of the differences between the forecast values and the observed values r m s e 1 n t 1 n a t f t 2 where a t is the real value f t is the forecast value and n is the number of fitted points the mape is used to estimate the quality of predictions made using the model the mape function can be expressed as follows m a p e 1 n t 1 n a t f t a t 100 3 forecasting results in the input layer on the basis of the definition of heat waves ctx90pct the climatic characteristics of a day do not occur on the same date across years and may appear several days earlier in different years accordingly the daily maximum temperatures of the previous 7 days were selected as the input nodes in the forecasting models rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn to predict the daily maximum temperatures in the following week a t t 1 t 6 in the output layer due to heat wave conditions which must persist for at least 3 days however in the prediction process it is important to determine the optimal number of added neural nodes in the hidden layer to achieve the best forecast value with the lowest testing error in the network in this research the trial and error method was used to determine the number of nodes in the hidden layer for predicting the temperature of the following 7 days in addition due to the increase in the number of nodes the computational effort increases rapidly in this study the minimum number of nodes that would not cause drastic changes in prediction errors was selected fig 5 displays the testing error mape obtained with different numbers of nodes added which ranged from 2 to 30 for the rbfnn model at three neighboring grid points as illustrated in fig 5 a c when the number of nodes added in the hidden layer was five the testing error exhibited the least variation over the 7 day forecast period accordingly we added five neural nodes in the hidden layer of the rbfnn model to minimize errors in the case of the mceemd rbfnn model the time series of daily maximum temperature in each grid in taipei city was decomposed into 11 imfs and 1 trend by using the mceemd algorithm then to forecast the maximum temperature in the following 7 days we applied the rbfnn model to all components of the temperature time series for prediction these forecasting results were ensembled from all imfs and compared with the test data of every grid the testing errors obtained with different numbers of nodes added ranging from 2 to 30 for the mceemd rbfnn model at three neighboring grid points are depicted in fig 6 the testing errors at the remaining grid points in this case are presented in the appendix a table a1 according to fig 6 a c as well as table a1 we can reasonably infer that the addition of 10 neural nodes to the hidden layer minimized errors after determining the number of nodes to be added to the hidden layers of the rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn models we forecast the temperatures of the following 7 days by using the daily maximum temperature data of the past 7 days for each daily temperature forecast obtained using these two ann models the evaluation criteria of testing errors namely r rmse and mape were measured using the testing data and they are summarized in tables a2 and a3 in all of the grids in taipei city higher r 0 75 0 94 lower mape 2 4 5 and lower rmse 0 9 1 7 values were obtained when we applied the mceemd rbfnn model over the test period the mean evaluation criteria of two ann models are summarized in fig 7 a b the accuracy of the predictions of both models decreases with the number of days as the predicted number of days progressed mape increased r increased and rmse decreased in addition the mean value of mape and r at each day in the rbfnn model is larger than that of the mceemd rbfnn model for the first few days the rmse is smaller in the rbfnn model than that in the mceemd rbfnn model accordingly the mceemd rbfnn provided superior forecasts according to the given performance criteria than the rbfnn model figs 8 and 9 display the daily maximum temperatures forecast using the rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn model for the testing period 2007 2017 in a given grid 121 5 e 25 1 n in taipei city because the heatwave events are strongly associated with maximum temperatures it is necessary to accurately forecast the extreme values of the maximum temperature figs 8 and 9 display the forecasting plots obtained using the two aforementioned forecasting models the black and red lines represent the observed and forecast values as can be observed in fig 8 when the rbfnn model was used at the start of the second day of prediction the subsequent predictions over the testing period were not accurate by contrast the mceemd rbfnn model yielded more accurate extreme data values fig 9 the results indicate that the mceemd rbfnn model with emd data preprocessing before prediction is a more suitable model for predicting the short term daily maximum temperature for comparison with the predictions made using the data of the previous 7 days as the input values we made predictions using the data of the previous 14 days as the input values to determine whether the predictions would be more accurate for forecasting the daily maximum temperatures of the following 7 days fig 10 displays the testing error mape obtained by adding 2 30 nodes in the case of 14 days of input values when the mceemd rbfnn model is used at three neighboring grid points the testing errors at the remaining grid points in taipei city are presented in the appendix a table a4 as illustrated in fig 10 a c and table a4 the optimal number of neural nodes added in the hidden layer to obtain the minimum error is 15 for the case of 14 day input values table a5 displays the evaluation criteria for testing errors in this case the testing errors show that the forecasts for the first 3 days t t 1 and t 2 have higher r lower mape and lower rmse values however with the progression of days t 3 t 6 the magnitudes of the testing errors increased the mean evaluation criteria of mceemd rbfnn models using the previous 14 days are summarized in fig 7 c the accuracy of the predictions decreases with the number of days as the predicted number of days progressed mape increased r increased and rmse decreased in addition all of the testing errors of each forecasting day were not different from the case of the 7 day input scenario when the mceemd rbfnn model was used implying that the model performs similarly under the two input scenarios but in the 14 day input scenario the computation time was longer fig 7 b c and tables a3 a5 fig 11 displays the forecasting plots obtained for the case of 14 input values when the mceemd rbfnn model was used in comparison with the original data the extreme values of daily maximum temperature can be better captured for a 3 day forecast than for a longer prediction window i e 4 7 days according to these results heat wave events in which the the extreme high temperature persists for at least 3 days can be accurately predicted by using the proposed mceemd rbfnn model 4 discussions short term prediction of the daily maximum temperature by using a newly developed forecasting model that combines the decomposition mceemd and prediction ann processes in taipei city was comprehensively demonstrated we applied the rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn models to forecast the daily maximum temperature over the next 7 days in taipei city by using the data of the preceding 7 days as the input values the numbers of nodes in the hidden layer that yielded the minimum testing error were determined using the trial and error method 5 for the rbfnn and 10 for the mceemd rbfnn results from this study show that for daily maximum temperatures in highly developed metropolitan cities like taipei taiwan changes in extremes are more pronounced and impactful than changes in the mean values in response to global warming a comparison of all the prediction results indicated that the forecasting precision was higher when the mceemd rbfnn model was used than that when the rbfnn model was used the curve graph of three evaluation criteria for the next 7 day prediction is demonstrated in fig 7 the accuracy of the forecast gradually decreases as the number of days increases it can be expected that the accuracy of the forecast will be the highest for the next adjacent days the more distant the future prediction days are away from the present day the less accurate the forecast will be with the increment of time the percentage of mape increases the value of r increases and the value of rmse decreases for both the rbfnn and mceemd rbfnn models in the rbfnn model the percentage values of mape are higher than those of the mceemd rbfnn model and so are the values of rmse the r values in the rbfnn model are higher than those in the mceemd rbfnn for the first few days with the increasing number of days in the prediction the r values in the two models are closer it can be shown from all three evaluation criteria that the prediction results of the mceemd rbfnn are significantly superior to those of the rbfnn moreover the performance achieved when the 14 day data were used as the input values to predict the daily maximum temperatures of the following 7 days was similar to that when the 7 day data were used as the input values but in the case of the 14 day data as input values the computation time was longer fig 7 b c the testing errors in terms of mape in the forecast data of the following 7 days were lower than 5 indicating that the forecasts were reasonable in the plot of forecast values the extreme values of the daily maximum temperature were well captured for the first 3 days accordingly a short term heat wave event for 3 days or more in the following week can be predicted using the mceemd rbfnn model and the daily maximum temperature data of the past 7 and 14 days in taipei city 5 conclusions and recommendations to avoid heat related incidents caused by extreme high temperature events that last for several consecutive days it is necessary to predict the daily maximum temperature accurately the proposed forecasting model that couples the emd based algorithm and the ann method can forecast short term time series the combination of mceemd and ann was used to predict the daily maximum temperature in taipei city where a substantial increase in heat wave event occurrences has been observed the mceemd rbfnn model outperformed the rbfnn model in predicting the maximum daily temperatures of the following 7 days in the testing period with high correlation coefficient r and low mape and rmse values consequently these results can be used by local authorities to prevent heat related injuries and incidents caused by extreme heat based on the outcomes the accuracy of the following 7 day maximum temperature prediction of the hybrid mceemd rbfnn model has been significantly improved compared with the rbfnn model and the accuracy of the prediction is also quantified the practical implications of this study are twofold first by applying the hybrid mceemd rbfnn model only the previous 7 days of temperature data are needed to promptly predict the future 7 day daily maximum temperature with a minimal error a temperature prediction system for high temperature events can be established to alert the public for avoiding exposure to high temperatures outdoors thus reducing diseases resulting from high temperature events additionally a better understanding of the future 7 day high temperature could facilitate the government authorities to issue an early warning to the community and vulnerable population groups in case of heat waves or forest fires caused by high temperature and to develop long term and sustainable emergency preparedness to minimize the impacts of heat waves on health and wellness this paper primarily focuses on improving the temperature prediction capability of rbfnn by processing the temperature data with mceemd it is noticed that for short term predictions the model occasionally has some discrepancies to capture the peak values beyond a 3 day forecast another rbfnn parameter that can be adjusted is the spread constants to obtain higher accuracy in prediction windows longer than 3 days one can test different values of the spread constants and numbers of hidden layer neurons in the rbfnn model additionally other evaluation criteria such as the index of agreement can be used to quantify and better present the testing errors in the extreme values between the predicted and actual values for future work the prediction of cold spell events low temperature events can be attempted different pairs of the adoption window for the input data other than 7 days and 14 days and the prediction window for the forecast days should be further

this region societies face low water quality poor distribution and unsustainable available water tramblay et al 2019 also climate change during the last years has intensified and added new concerns about water and the environment in this region abbaspour et al 2009 khazaei et al 2019 additionally in this region numerous technical problems such as lack of observed hydrological data off line data and non homogeneous distributions of measuring data stations have an adverse effect on the management of basins for the scientists in order to solve the water scarcity problems eini et al 2019 as one of the mena countries with diverse climates numerous deserts and mountain ranges iran is faced with several water management problems because of a lack of reliable data ashraf et al 2018 eini et al

products is that its accuracy still unknown in some parts of the world is sm2rain ascat brocca et al 2019 this product applies surface soil moisture observations derived from satellite advanced scatterometer ascat for calculating precipitation through the sm2rain process the sm2rain ascat s quality is evaluated on a local scale by comparing measured networks in europe the usa and australia results indicate that this dataset supplies superior performance than gpm and gpcc in africa and south america brocca et al 2019 chiaravalloti et al 2018 another version of sm2rain is sm2rain cci that

chirps and sm2rain cci were compared with measured data across india results demonstrated that the chirps could be applied for long span rainfall assessments with relatively superior confidence prakash 2019 in another study assessing global precipitation measurement gpm and sm2rain ascat in southern italy indicated that combining these two products could have better accuracy chiaravalloti et al 2018 also across italy ciabatta et al 2016 used sm2rain derived for rainfall runoff modeling during the four years 2010 2013 results showed that discharge simulations improve when ground rainfall observations and sm2rain products are integrated a study in pakistan showed that sm2rain ascat outperforms sm2rain cci through different climate areas with better statistical indices rahman et al 2019 another use of the sm2rain algorithm is the quantification of irrigation water jalilvand et al 2019 according to some recent researches sm2rain ascat has low accuracy in asia and acceptable estimates across europe camici et al 2020 gupta et al 2020 mazzoleni et al 2019 muhammad et al 2020 however other satellite products have been assessed on global and regional scales and the tmpa and cmorph have been found with better performances in many parts of the world ferreira et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 khan et al 2014 yan cong et al 2014 chen et al 2021 ma et al 2021 evaluation of four global satellite precipitation for hydrological simulations in china presented that the gauge modification significantly moderates the bias in the investigation grade tmpa 3b42v7 still this dataset is not continually better than other datasets specifically cmorph at daily steps jiang et al 2016 li et al 2015 a study in africa showed that cmorph could identify the cyclic and spatial forms of rainfall and reasonably well in wet and dry conditions over some parts of the basin still it meaningfully overestimated those over a water body and its shore haile et al 2015 as noted above in recent years using reanalyses and satellite datasets over iran is increased darand et al 2017 eini et al 2019 jajarmizadeh et al 2016 darand and siavashi 2021 ghozat et al 2021 koohi et al 2021 taghizadeh et al

2020 mosaffa et al 2020 shayeghi et al 2020 shirmohammadi aliakbarkhani and akbari 2020 darand et al 2015 these studies showed different results for instance in daily time steps darand et al 2017 showed that tmpa had good quality in the west of iran regarding observed precipitation another research over iran showed that tmpa 3b42v7 has superior estimations of daily rainfall than tmpa 3b42rt and persiann furthermore persiann shows improved results related to the likelihood of detecting rainfall moazami et al 2013 also katiraie boroujerdy et al 2013 assessed four satellite precipitation estimates persiann climate data record cdr persiann cloud classification system ccs trmm 3b4 and cmorph accuracy over iran in monthly and daily time scales comparing these databases showed that persiann and trmm 3b42 have higher approximates and cmorph has low accuracy mainly over the mountains table 1 indicates a summary of recent studies conducted with gridded precipitation datasets over iran according to table 1 in general gauge interpolated datasets have fairly better performance over iran and the lowest accuracy belongs to satellite products also gridded datasets are a good source for drought assessments to summarize table 1 comparing gauge interpolated reanalysis modeled or bias adjusted reanalysis with non gauge corrected satellite products will not lead to a reliable conclusion and each of these bases should be considered in a separate category also the asfezari precipitation database has not been used as reference data in comparisons so far also according to table 1 it can be seen that many studies have performed product comparisons with a small number of stations in the current study this drawback is tried to be rectified by using asfezari product the current research aims to evaluate three non gauge corrected satellite products validity at a daily monthly and seasonal resolution current research compares the satellite products with a national gridded dataset asfezari over iran for the first time the accuracy of the asfezari dataset has been tested in some studies summarized in table 2 as noted above in this region gridded precipitation datasets are most needed because of the sparse rain gauge network over most parts of the area hence we used a gridded dataset as a reference and sm2rain ascat compared with cmorph and persiann ccs this study s outcomes will contribute to the future development of these products in iran and other mena parts 2 methods and data 2 1 case study iran has about 1 648 million km2 is placed in the southwest of the mena between 44 64 e and 25 40 n fig 1 it is characterized by a challenging rainfall gradient with an average annual rainfall of 250 mm focusing mainly during the wet period january to april the seasonal and temporal distribution of rainfall is controlled by the contact of the tropical air mass from the red sea the siberian high pressure and the mediterranean low pressures darand et al 2017 darand and daneshvar 2014 the two high mountain ranges in the west and north significantly change the spatial forms of rainfall and stop much of the available moisture into the deserts darand et al 2017 the caspian sea s sw part receives extreme rainfall above on average 1800 mm year while the central parts receive less than 100 mm year this country characterizes a remarkable zone to validate gridded precipitation data for its specific mixture of environmental situations the spatial pattern of rainfall and complex geography darand et al 2017 2 2 data 2 2 1 reference data asfezari was first produced by masoodian 2006 has been built by interpolating measured data from 1437 climatological stations the earliest time range for asfezari was 1962 2004 with a spatial resolution of 15 15 km asfezari was revised to include 2005 2013 using additional 4420 climatological stations fig 2 shows the grid structure and rain gauge stations used to analyze the asfezari grid indicating very dense station network in the west and north but a relatively poor network in iran s central and southern parts developing this dataset has been done using an ordinary kriging technique

alternative source of the observed dataset mean annual precipitation mm year over iran is shown in fig 3 mesgaran et al 2016 2 2 2 satellite products in this study three satellite products were used first our main aim is on the sm2rain ascat product and then assessing cmorph and persiann ccs datasets sm2rain is a process built on methods provided by pellarin et al 2013 and crow et al 2011 and additional improved brocca et al 2019 which can be applied for direct rainfall evaluation from in situ and satellite based sm measurements rahman et al 2019 the technique delivers daily precipitation estimates globally and has been efficiently used to satellite sm data rahman et al 2019 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann offers three datasets persiann persiann cdr and persiann ccs persiann ccs illustrates cloud patch based processes where the structures are obtained from the cloud coverage under identified temperature levels hong

metrics four statistical indicators were applied to evaluate the accuracy of sm2rain ascat persiann ccs and cmorph versus the asfezari these indicators were computed based on an inter comparison of rainfall estimations from each dataset with rainfall records from asfezari the r2 coefficient of determination nse nash sutcliff efficiency rmse root mean square error mm and bias bias indicator mm are considered in this research table 4 r2 is used to estimate the correlation between the estimated data and asfezari nse can vary from to 1 an efficiency of 1 shows a perfect match of satellite datasets to asfezari nse is sensitive to extreme values unsatisfactory outcomes when the product includes significant outliers mccuen et al 2006 rmse mm indicates the mean error between the satellite product and asfezari data by emphasizing more significant errors bias mm evaluates the absolute daily difference between asfezari and satellite datasets where positive values show overestimation and

eini et al 2019 rahman et al 2019 3 results and analyses accuracy of daily rainfall estimations of the sm2rain ascat persiann ccs and cmorph was evaluated against the asfezari database as a reference over iran during 2007 2013 the continuous metrics values r2 nse rmse and bias are statistical quantification of differences in rainfall quantity from satellite products from the asfezari data at the 15 15 km scale for comparison the nearest point of the satellite products to asfezari was found by using the distance between two points equation and then each metric was calculated the ordinary kriging technique was employed to interpolate the statistical metrics over iran to visualize and understand the spatial distribution trend of error characteristics in this section first daily analysis for all months is shown 3 1 overall assessments average continuous indices showed that sm2rain ascat has better performance than other products followed by cmorph and persiann ccs however none of the statistical indexes shows satisfactory performance except detection abilities persiann ccs by the lowest correlation average 0 07 had the worst performance among other datasets in terms of the nse sm2rain ascat average 0 06 performed better overall than other products followed by cmorph 0 51 and persiann ccs 3 53 also sm2rain ascat average 2 4 mm tended to show the least rmse mm compared to other products analyzing the bias mm showed that sm2rain ascat average 0 07 mm was more consistent with the asfezari than other products however it depicts that sm2rain ascat median 0 1 mm and cmorph median 7 23 mm underestimated the precipitation and persiann ccs median 0 6 mm overestimated table 5 as shown in fig 4 sm2rain ascat has a better correlation in the southern parts r2 0 66 of iran similarly persiann ccs has better performance over the persian gulf s northern shores in the south of iran and the zagros mountains r2 0 32 the median and average of r2 for the cmorph dataset table 5 and fig 4 illustrate that this product has reasonable estimates average 0 6 0 7 in the southeast near the border of pakistan and over mountains area average 0 4 0 5 analyzing each datasets systematic errors showed that sm2rain ascat has a better performance in southern parts nse 0 62 however the median and average are 0 12 and 0 06 over iran other datasets yield negative average values for nse 3 35 for pesiann ccs and 0 51 for cmorph rmse values ranged from 0 7 to 8 mm for sm2rain ascat which had better performance in iran s central and northeast in most of iran s eastern parts the sm2rain ascat dataset underestimated the precipitation values approximately 1 mm it overestimated the precipitation in the caspian seashores with an average of 750 mm average precipitation around 2 5 mm persiann ccs had a better bias performance fluctuating from 0 58 to 1 9 mm with underestimation in the south of iran fig 4 depicts the spatial map of continuous indices for all datasets the precipitation detection abilities are given in fig 5 the pod and far indicators explained the nature of the errors by satellite datasets pod demonstrates the sm2rain ascat satellite product has a higher performance in detecting rainfall events in the northern and northern west parts of iran where the mean rainfall magnitude is high in these areas persiann ccs and cmorph products are detected precipitation in the hyper arid region in the center of iran while the sm2rain ascat product had low quality in these areas in contrast persiann ccs and cmorph datasets had low accuracy in detecting precipitation in wet and humid areas in northern parts of the country pod 0 36 0 50 according to far sm2rain ascat product had low quality in zagros and alborz mountains in the west and north of iran and better accuracy in iran s middle lands covered by deserts far s spatial distribution represents that the cmorph dataset has better performance in the mountains or deserts far 0 0 13 however it has low accuracy in western parts of the zagros mountains far 0 33 0 48 cmorph dataset showed better performance far 0 0 27 than other datasets while its accuracy is higher in the north shores of the persian gulf than in other parts of iran csi maps illustrate that none of these products have good quality in the mountains especially in iran s northern parts persiann ccs and cmorph datasets had a similar csi performance 0 43 0 7 and the sm2rain ascat product had better accuracy in arid areas in the south of the alborz mountains 3 2 seasonal assessments each product is divided into four seasons table 6 shows that the sm2rain ascat dataset has better performance in the fall october to december rainy season r2 0 23 and nse 0 13 similarly in the fall the persiann ccs showed better accuracy against other seasons the cmorph dataset in the summer july to september demonstrated better performance r2 0 22 according to bias mm and rmse mm indices all datasets had satisfactory accuracy in the summer july to september table 6 represents the average and median of each index for four seasons of all satellite products in this table bold numbers are the best values in each statistic of each season in general in seasonal assessment sm2rain ascat outperforms other products followed by cmorph and persiann ccs seasonal analyses of detection statistics showed that the sm2rain ascat dataset had the lowest far among datasets especially in the fall cmorph dataset had the lowest accuracy of detecting rainfall in winter january to march the highest pod among all seasons is in fall wet season in iran in all datasets it is clear that the detections of precipitation by satellite products are reliable in wet months the average and median seasonal amounts of pod far and csi for satellite products are shown in table 7 a graphical view of the average values of pod far and csi is presented in fig 6 3 3 merged dataset to merge satellite databases eq 1 was applied between different permutations the best weights were extracted the best performance in all metrics versus individual non gauge corrected satellite products was selected as criteria the best weights were w1 0 711 w2 0 0907 and w3 0 1983 so eq 2 was extracted as the best linear equation for combination 2 spc 0 7110 sm 2 rain ascat 0 0907 persia nn ccs 0 1983 cmorph according to table 8 the combined database slightly improved the result however average continuous indices are not satisfactory precipitation detection abilities in overall assessment and seasonal assessment were in an acceptable range this dataset has a better correlation in fall versus asfezari average r2 0 26 in the northern shores of the persian gulf the northeast and the southeast spc showed a better spatial correlation like r2 nse had better performance in fall average nse 0 17 in regions like the northern parts the northwest and alborz mountains that the maximum precipitation occurs nse has the lowest estimates fig 7 rmse mm and bias mm metrics have shown better performance in the dry season summer than in other seasons also in wet areas these metrics have the lowest accuracy fig 7 in contrast precipitation detection abilities have demonstrated acceptable performance in wet seasons and wet regions with an accuracy of about 0 85 in winter and 0 78 on average pod has the highest accuracy among detection metrics table 8 spc dataset detected precipitation in wet areas better than dry regions fig 8 4 discussion the performance of sm2rain ascat persiann ccs cmorph and a linear combination of these satellite datasets versus asfezari iran national reanalysis dataset was evaluated using four statistical and three categorical indicators these satellite products were assessed over the complex geography and diverse weather of iran from 2007 to 2013 our analyses showed that non gauge corrected satellite products could not provide reliable precipitations over iran however they detected the precipitation events well besides our analysis revealed that these datasets could not offer accurate precipitation during dry months in addition the uncertainty of the asfezari dataset should be taken into account too other studies have used the measured data and their result has relied on an ununiform network and sometimes with a lack of data in time series but our result is based on a gridded dataset gauge interpolated with a complete dataset that uniformly covered the area the low accuracy during dry months may be due to satellite based rainfall evaluation methods agreement to detect warm precipitation and screen out no rain thin cirrus clouds that are generally very cold darand et al 2017 results showed that these products had a low correlation in highlands this may be due to the weak detection of orographic precipitation events darand et al 2017 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 milewski et al 2015 sm2rain ascat satellite products in pakistan in the southeast of iran have been evaluated in a study by rahman et al 2019 this study revealed that precipitation was underestimated in the mountains in glacial and humid regions similar to our research in contrast they stated that sm2rain ascat offered a better accuracy in modest to low rainfall seasons besides the pod far and csi were ranged in the same values as our study in another study in pakistan muhammad et al 2020 have an agreement about sm2rain ascat with our result however darand et al 2017 reported pod far and csi values better than our study for tpma over iran a study on persiann ccs shows that persiann ccs has poor performance in representing the precipitation rates and patterns in the northern part of iran this result agrees with the current result katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 taghizadeh et al 2021 demonstrated that sm2rain ascat has a poor performance in estimating precipitation in some iran regions that confirm our analyses in another study tmpa cmorph and sm2rain ascat were used as input into a lumped hydrologic model over 1318 basins belonging to 23 different countries and spread over the whole of europe camici et al 2020 similar to our result cmorph underestimates the daily precipitation data over the whole of europe in addition sm2rain scat was the best dataset for hydrological simulation across europe camici et al 2020 in india sm2rain ascat compared with trmm and chirps datasets gupta et al 2020 the result showed that trmm and chirps performed well across india but the sm2rain ascat performed poorly especially for extreme precipitation events gupta et al 2020 the accuracy of 18 various rainfall datasets has been analyzed in different scale river basins in various continents and including different climatic zones by mazzoleni et al 2019 their report confirms our result that sm2rain ascat has the best accuracy within the non gauge corrected satellite products 5 conclusion this study explored the accuracy of three precipitation satellite based products a sm2rain ascat b persiann ccs c cmorph and d a linear combination of these databases over iran the reference dataset was the asfezari dataset this dataset is assessed in several studies and has high accuracy some assessment and comparison statistical indicators were employed to investigate the accuracy and define different satellite based rainfall products characteristics our analyses showed that these products need enhancement and modifications before their implementation into hydrological applications however they detected the precipitation events well so it is not recommended to use non gauge corrected satellite precipitation estimates in hydrological modeling without analyzing their accuracy overall the spc dataset had better accuracy than other datasets then sm2rain ascat showed better accuracy than persiann ccs and cmorph in both statistical accuracy and detection in addition these products estimated precipitation values during fall relatively wet months better than other seasons in mountainous areas over iran mostly wet areas these products could not show high accuracy however in southern parts of iran they had better performances in the persian gulf s north shores however it should be mentioned that by applying different correction methods the error rate and uncertainty of these products could be significantly reduced and used for purposes such as hydrological modeling

and north africa mena is one of the world s driest areas with vast deserts high evaporation and water scarcity for nearly 60 of the population tramblay et al 2019 besides to this in most countries in this region societies face low water quality poor distribution and unsustainable available water tramblay et al 2019 also climate change during the last years has intensified and added new concerns about water and the environment in this region abbaspour et al 2009 khazaei et al 2019 additionally in this region numerous technical problems such as lack of observed hydrological data off line data and non homogeneous distributions of measuring data stations have an adverse effect on the management of basins for the scientists in order to solve the water scarcity problems eini et al 2019 as one of the mena countries with diverse climates numerous deserts and mountain ranges iran is faced with several water management problems because of a lack of reliable data ashraf et al 2018 eini et al 2019 the foremost issue for scientists in iran and many other developing countries is off line rainfall data without near real time availability abbaspour et al 2009 darand et al 2017 eini et al 2018a for this reason in recent years scientists are using gauge interpolated satellite products and reanalyses precipitation databases such as the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information

gridded datasets leads to accurate hydrological simulation with a semi empirical model soil and water assessment tool swat with near real time data 2007 2021 12 5 km daily one of the latest satellite products is that its accuracy still unknown in some parts of the world is sm2rain ascat brocca et al 2019 this product applies surface soil moisture observations derived from satellite advanced scatterometer ascat for calculating precipitation through the sm2rain process the sm2rain ascat s quality is evaluated on a local scale by comparing measured networks in europe the usa and australia results indicate that this dataset supplies superior performance than gpm and gpcc in africa and south america brocca et al 2019 chiaravalloti et al 2018 another version of sm2rain is sm2rain cci that obtained from the inversion of the satellite soil moisture sm observations derived from the esa climate change initiative cci via sm2rain ciabatta et al 2018 comparisons of sm2rain datasets with other products indicate different outputs rmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa multi source weighted ensemble precipitation mswep climate hazards center infrared precipitation with station data chirps and sm2rain cci were compared with measured data across india results demonstrated that the chirps could be applied for long span rainfall assessments with relatively superior confidence prakash 2019 in another study assessing global precipitation measurement gpm and sm2rain ascat in southern italy indicated that combining these two products could have better accuracy chiaravalloti et al 2018 also across italy ciabatta et al 2016 used sm2rain derived for rainfall runoff modeling during the four years 2010 2013 results showed that discharge simulations improve when ground rainfall observations and sm2rain products are integrated a study in pakistan showed that sm2rain ascat outperforms sm2rain cci through different climate areas with better statistical indices rahman et al 2019 another use of the sm2rain algorithm is the quantification of irrigation water jalilvand et al 2019 according to some recent researches sm2rain ascat has low accuracy in asia and acceptable estimates across europe camici et al 2020 gupta et al 2020 mazzoleni et al 2019 muhammad et al 2020 however other satellite products have been assessed on global and regional scales and the tmpa and cmorph have been found with better performances in many parts of the world ferreira et al 2014 jiang et al 2016 khan et al 2014 yan cong et al 2014 chen et al 2021 ma et al 2021 evaluation of four global satellite precipitation for hydrological simulations in china presented that the gauge modification significantly moderates the bias in the investigation grade tmpa 3b42v7 still this dataset is not continually better than other datasets specifically cmorph at daily steps jiang et al 2016 li et al 2015 a study in africa showed that cmorph could identify the cyclic and spatial forms of rainfall and reasonably well in wet and dry conditions over some parts of the basin still it meaningfully overestimated those over a water body and its shore haile et al 2015 as noted above in recent years using reanalyses and satellite datasets over iran is increased darand et al 2017 eini et al 2019 jajarmizadeh et al 2016 darand and siavashi 2021 ghozat et al 2021 koohi et al 2021 taghizadeh et al

dehaghi and samani 2019 darand and khandu 2020 fallah et al 2020 hosseini moghari and tang 2020 jafari et al 2020 katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 khoshchehreh et al 2020 kiany et al 2020 maghsood et al 2020 mosaffa et al 2020 shayeghi et al 2020 shirmohammadi aliakbarkhani and akbari 2020 darand et al 2015 these studies showed different results for instance in daily time steps darand et al 2017 showed that tmpa had good quality in the west of iran regarding observed precipitation another research over iran showed that tmpa 3b42v7 has superior estimations of daily rainfall than tmpa 3b42rt and persiann furthermore persiann shows improved results related to the likelihood of detecting rainfall moazami et al 2013 also katiraie boroujerdy et al 2013 assessed four satellite precipitation estimates persiann climate data record cdr persiann cloud classification system ccs trmm 3b4 and cmorph accuracy over iran in monthly and daily time scales comparing these databases showed that persiann and trmm 3b42 have higher approximates and cmorph has low accuracy mainly over the mountains table 1 indicates a summary of recent studies conducted with gridded precipitation datasets over iran according to table 1 in general gauge interpolated datasets have fairly better performance over iran and the lowest accuracy belongs to satellite products also gridded datasets are a good source for drought assessments to summarize table 1 comparing gauge interpolated reanalysis modeled or bias adjusted reanalysis with non gauge corrected satellite products will not lead to a reliable conclusion and each of these bases should be considered in a separate category also the asfezari precipitation database has not been used as reference data in comparisons so far also according to table 1 it can be seen that many studies have performed product comparisons with a small number of stations in the current study this drawback is tried to be rectified by using asfezari product the current research aims to evaluate three non gauge corrected satellite products validity at a daily monthly and seasonal resolution current research compares the satellite products with a national gridded dataset asfezari over iran for the first time the accuracy of the asfezari dataset has been tested in some studies summarized in table 2 as noted above in this region gridded precipitation datasets are most needed because of the sparse rain gauge network over most parts of the area hence we used a gridded dataset as a reference and sm2rain ascat compared with cmorph and persiann ccs this study s outcomes will contribute to the future development of these products in iran and other mena parts 2 methods and data 2 1 case study iran has about 1 648 million km2 is placed in the southwest of the mena between 44 64 e and 25 40 n fig 1 it is characterized by a challenging rainfall gradient with an average annual rainfall of 250 mm focusing mainly during the wet period january to april the seasonal and temporal distribution of rainfall is controlled by the contact of the tropical air mass from the red sea the siberian high pressure and the mediterranean low pressures darand et al 2017 darand and daneshvar 2014 the two high mountain ranges in the west and north significantly change the spatial forms of rainfall and stop much of the available moisture into the deserts darand et al 2017 the caspian sea s sw part receives extreme rainfall above on average 1800 mm year while the central parts receive less than 100 mm year this country characterizes a remarkable zone to validate gridded precipitation data for its specific mixture of environmental situations the spatial pattern of rainfall and complex geography darand et al 2017 2 2 data 2 2 1 reference data asfezari was first produced by masoodian 2006 has been built by interpolating measured data from 1437 climatological stations the earliest time range for asfezari was 1962 2004 with a spatial resolution of 15 15 km asfezari was revised to include 2005 2013 using additional 4420 climatological stations fig 2 shows the grid structure and rain gauge stations used to analyze the asfezari grid indicating very dense station network in the west and north but a relatively poor network in iran s central and southern parts developing this dataset has been done using an ordinary kriging technique and can be categorized as a gauge interpolated dataset darand and khandu 2020 darand and zand karimi 2016 according to table 2 this dataset has good accuracy over iran and could be used as an alternative source of the observed dataset mean annual precipitation mm year over iran is shown in fig 3 mesgaran et al 2016 2 2 2 satellite products in this study three satellite products were used first our main aim is on the sm2rain ascat product and then assessing cmorph and persiann ccs datasets sm2rain is a process built on methods provided by pellarin et al 2013 and crow et al 2011 and additional improved brocca et al 2019 which can be applied for direct rainfall evaluation from in situ and satellite based sm measurements rahman et al 2019 the technique delivers daily precipitation estimates globally and has been efficiently used to satellite sm data rahman et al 2019 precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann offers three datasets persiann persiann cdr and persiann ccs persiann ccs illustrates cloud patch based processes where the structures are obtained from the cloud coverage under identified temperature levels hong

metrics four statistical indicators were applied to evaluate the accuracy of sm2rain ascat persiann ccs and cmorph versus the asfezari these indicators were computed based on an inter comparison of rainfall estimations from each dataset with rainfall records from asfezari the r2 coefficient of determination nse nash sutcliff efficiency rmse root mean square error mm and bias bias indicator mm are considered in this research table 4 r2 is used to estimate the correlation between the estimated data and asfezari nse can vary from to 1 an efficiency of 1 shows a perfect match of satellite

product and asfezari data by emphasizing more significant errors bias mm evaluates the absolute daily difference between asfezari and satellite datasets where positive values show overestimation and minus values underestimation rahman et al 2019 the rainfall detection abilities of pesriann ccs sm2rain ascat and cmorph are tested using three categorical measures table 4 containing the critical success index csi the probability of detection pod and false alarm ratio far pod demonstrates the ability of satellite datasets to identify rainfall events a threshold of 1 mm is demonstrated to discriminate rainfall from dry days no rainfall at any time scale rahman et al 2019 far depicts the fraction of satellite based rainfall events that did not happen pod and far range 0 1 with optimum

eini et al 2019 rahman et al 2019 3 results and analyses accuracy of daily rainfall estimations of the sm2rain ascat persiann ccs and cmorph was evaluated against the asfezari database as a reference over iran during 2007 2013 the continuous metrics values r2 nse rmse and bias are statistical quantification of differences in rainfall quantity from satellite products from the asfezari data at the 15 15 km scale for comparison the nearest point of the satellite products to asfezari was found by using the distance between two points equation and then each metric was calculated the ordinary kriging technique was employed to interpolate the statistical metrics over iran to visualize and understand the spatial distribution trend of error characteristics in this section first daily analysis for all months is shown 3 1 overall assessments average continuous indices showed that sm2rain ascat has better performance than other products followed by cmorph and persiann ccs however none of the statistical indexes shows satisfactory performance except detection abilities persiann ccs by the lowest correlation average 0 07 had the worst performance among other datasets in terms of the nse sm2rain ascat average 0 06 performed better overall than other products followed by cmorph 0 51 and persiann ccs 3 53 also sm2rain ascat average 2 4 mm tended to show the least rmse mm compared to other products analyzing the bias mm showed that sm2rain ascat average 0 07 mm was more consistent with the asfezari than other products however it depicts that sm2rain ascat median 0 1 mm and cmorph median 7 23 mm underestimated the precipitation and persiann ccs median 0 6 mm overestimated table 5 as shown in fig 4 sm2rain ascat has a better correlation in the southern parts r2 0 66 of iran similarly persiann ccs has better performance over the persian gulf s northern shores in the south of iran and the zagros mountains r2 0 32 the median and average of r2 for the cmorph dataset table 5 and fig 4 illustrate that this product has reasonable estimates average 0 6 0 7 in the southeast near the border of pakistan and over mountains area average 0 4 0 5 analyzing each datasets systematic errors showed that sm2rain ascat has a better performance in southern parts nse 0 62 however the median and average are 0 12 and 0 06 over iran other datasets yield negative average values for nse 3 35 for pesiann ccs and 0 51 for cmorph rmse values ranged from 0 7 to 8 mm for sm2rain ascat which had better performance in iran s central and northeast in most of iran s eastern parts the sm2rain ascat dataset underestimated the precipitation values approximately 1 mm it overestimated the precipitation in the caspian seashores with an average of 750 mm average precipitation around 2 5 mm persiann ccs had a better bias performance fluctuating from 0 58 to 1 9 mm with underestimation in the south of iran fig 4 depicts the spatial map of continuous indices for all datasets the precipitation detection abilities are given in fig 5 the pod and far indicators explained the nature of the errors by satellite datasets pod demonstrates the sm2rain ascat satellite product has a higher performance in detecting rainfall events in the northern and northern west parts of iran where the mean rainfall magnitude is high in these areas persiann ccs and cmorph products are detected precipitation in the hyper arid region in the center of iran while the sm2rain ascat product had low quality in these areas in contrast persiann ccs and cmorph datasets had low accuracy in detecting precipitation in wet and humid areas in northern parts of the country pod 0 36 0 50 according to far sm2rain ascat product had low quality in zagros and alborz mountains in the west and north of iran and better accuracy in iran s middle lands covered by deserts far s spatial distribution represents that the cmorph dataset has better performance in the mountains or deserts far 0 0 13 however it has low accuracy in western parts of the zagros mountains far 0 33 0 48 cmorph dataset showed better performance far 0 0 27 than other datasets while its accuracy is higher in the north shores of the persian gulf than in other parts of iran csi maps illustrate that none of these products have good quality in the mountains especially in iran s northern parts persiann ccs and cmorph datasets had a similar csi performance 0 43 0 7 and the sm2rain ascat product had better accuracy in arid areas in the south of the alborz mountains 3 2 seasonal assessments each product is divided into four seasons table 6 shows that the sm2rain ascat dataset has better performance in the fall october to december rainy season r2 0 23 and nse 0 13 similarly in the fall the persiann ccs showed better accuracy against other seasons the cmorph dataset in the summer july to september demonstrated better performance r2 0 22 according to bias mm and rmse mm indices all datasets had satisfactory accuracy in the summer july to september table 6 represents the average and median of each index for four seasons of all satellite products in this table bold numbers are the best values in each statistic of each season in general in seasonal assessment sm2rain ascat outperforms other products followed by cmorph and persiann ccs seasonal analyses of detection statistics showed that the sm2rain ascat dataset had the lowest far among datasets especially in the fall cmorph dataset had the lowest accuracy of detecting rainfall in winter january to march the highest pod among all seasons is in fall wet season in iran in all datasets it is clear that the detections of precipitation by satellite products are reliable in wet months the average and median seasonal amounts of pod far and csi for satellite products are shown in table 7 a graphical view of the average values of pod far and csi is presented in fig 6 3 3 merged dataset to merge satellite databases eq 1 was applied between different permutations the best weights were extracted the best performance in all metrics versus individual non gauge corrected satellite products was selected as criteria the best weights were w1 0 711 w2 0 0907 and w3 0 1983 so eq 2 was extracted as the best linear equation for combination 2 spc 0 7110 sm 2 rain ascat 0 0907 persia nn ccs 0 1983 cmorph according to table 8 the combined database slightly improved the result however average continuous indices are not satisfactory precipitation detection abilities in overall assessment and seasonal assessment were in an acceptable range this dataset has a better correlation in fall versus asfezari average r2 0 26 in the northern shores of the persian gulf the northeast and the southeast spc showed a better spatial correlation like r2 nse had better performance in fall average nse 0 17 in regions like the northern parts the northwest and alborz mountains that the maximum precipitation occurs nse has the lowest estimates fig 7 rmse mm and bias mm metrics have shown better performance in the dry season summer than in other seasons also in wet areas these metrics have the lowest accuracy fig 7 in contrast precipitation detection abilities have demonstrated acceptable performance in wet seasons and wet regions with an accuracy of about 0 85 in winter and 0 78 on average pod has the highest accuracy among detection metrics table 8 spc dataset detected precipitation in wet areas better than dry regions fig 8 4 discussion the performance of sm2rain ascat persiann ccs cmorph and a linear combination of these satellite datasets versus asfezari iran national reanalysis dataset was evaluated using four statistical and three categorical indicators these satellite products were assessed over the complex geography and diverse weather of iran from 2007 to 2013 our analyses showed that non gauge corrected satellite products could not provide reliable precipitations over iran however they detected the precipitation events well besides our analysis revealed that these datasets could not offer accurate precipitation during dry months in addition the uncertainty of the asfezari dataset should be taken into account too other studies have used the measured data and their result has relied on an ununiform network and sometimes with a lack of data in time series but our result is based on a gridded dataset gauge interpolated with a complete dataset that uniformly covered the area the low accuracy during dry months may be due to satellite based rainfall evaluation methods agreement to detect warm precipitation and screen out no rain thin cirrus clouds that are generally very cold darand et al 2017 results showed that these products had a low correlation in highlands this may be due to the weak detection of orographic precipitation events darand et al 2017 duan and bastiaanssen 2013 milewski et al 2015 sm2rain ascat satellite products in pakistan in the southeast of iran have been evaluated in a study by rahman et al 2019 this study revealed that precipitation was underestimated in the mountains in glacial and humid regions similar to our research in contrast they stated that sm2rain ascat offered a better accuracy in modest to low rainfall seasons besides the pod far and csi were ranged in the same values as our study in another study in pakistan muhammad et al 2020 have an agreement about sm2rain ascat with our result however darand et al 2017 reported pod far and csi values better than our study for tpma over iran a study on persiann ccs shows that persiann ccs has poor performance in representing the precipitation rates and patterns in the northern part of iran this result agrees with the current result katiraie boroujerdy et al 2020 taghizadeh et al 2021 demonstrated that sm2rain ascat has a poor performance in estimating precipitation in some iran regions that confirm our analyses in another study tmpa cmorph and sm2rain ascat were used as input into a lumped hydrologic model over 1318 basins belonging to 23 different countries and spread over the whole of europe camici et al 2020 similar to our result cmorph underestimates the daily precipitation data over the whole of europe in addition sm2rain scat was the best dataset for hydrological simulation across europe camici et al 2020 in india sm2rain ascat compared with trmm and chirps datasets gupta et al 2020 the result showed that trmm and chirps performed well across india but the sm2rain ascat performed poorly especially for extreme precipitation events gupta et al 2020 the accuracy of 18 various rainfall datasets has been analyzed in different scale river basins in various continents and including different climatic zones by mazzoleni et al 2019 their report confirms our result that sm2rain ascat has the best accuracy within the non gauge corrected satellite products 5 conclusion this study explored the accuracy of three precipitation satellite based products a sm2rain ascat b persiann ccs c cmorph and d a linear combination of these databases over iran the reference dataset was the asfezari dataset this dataset is assessed in several studies and has high accuracy some assessment and comparison statistical indicators were employed to investigate the accuracy and define different satellite based rainfall products characteristics our analyses showed that these products need enhancement and modifications before their implementation into hydrological applications however they detected the precipitation events well so it is not recommended to use non gauge corrected satellite precipitation estimates in hydrological modeling without analyzing their accuracy overall the spc dataset had better accuracy than other datasets then sm2rain ascat showed better accuracy than persiann ccs and cmorph in both statistical accuracy and detection in addition these products estimated precipitation values during fall relatively wet months better than other seasons in mountainous areas over iran mostly wet areas these products could not show high accuracy however in southern parts of iran they had better performances in the persian gulf s north shores however it should be mentioned that by applying different correction methods the error rate and uncertainty of these products could be significantly reduced and used for purposes such as hydrological modeling

8093,study region northeast china study focus northeast china is one of the largest agricultural regions in the world and a strategically important granary for china information on hydrological extremes is crucially important for water management yet comprehensive studies on hydrological extremes both extreme flood and drought events based on hydrological gauge comprehensive and large coverage observations are still lacking in northeast china this study investigated observed hydrological extremes with 124 hydrological gauges in the region ranging from the 1950s to present for the first time new hydrological insights for the region we find that flood extremes mean discharge and standardized discharge are decreasing in over 80 of the gauges and no gauges show significantly increasing flood extremes the findings suggest that sustainable water management strategies should be employed to meet increasing water demand for long term development in addition we find that flood peak discharge and flood volume are significantly correlated in all the gauges motivating flood risk studies considering multiple flood variables together further we quantify probability changes of severe and extreme hydrological droughts and find that the probability of drought events is decreasing in most of the gauges suggesting that the number of drought events is reducing data availability discharge data are from the hydrology bureau and can be found by contacting songliao river water resources commission ministry of water resources the people s republic of china http www mwr gov cn english keywords flood drought northeast china hydrological extreme liao river songhua river 1 introduction northeast china is one of the most important agricultural areas in the world and the northeast china plain is the largest plain in china piao et al 2010 ray et al 2015 deng et al 2019 rojas et al 2019 rosa et al 2020 due to socioeconomic development and intensification of agricultural production in the region the demand for water resources is increasing rapidly northeast china is also a region frequently suffered from extreme floods a large number of hydraulic infrastructures have been built in northeast china these infrastructures can prevent flooding in the rainy season and ameliorate water shortage in the dry season which have complicated variations of hydrological extremes wang et al 2015 sharma et al 2018 investigations of spatial and temporal changes of hydrological extremes in the entire northeast china are important for water management to sustain long term development of socioeconomics and agriculture production piao et al 2010 asseng et al 2015 ray et al 2015 anderson et al 2019 rojas et al 2019 discharge can reflect the overall influence of various factors in a river basin and is directly related to hydrological extremes zaitchik et al 2010 qi et al 2020 therefore hydrological extreme analysis using hydrological gauge observation is informative and comprehensive yet comprehensive studies on hydrological extremes both extreme flood and drought events based on hydrological gauge comprehensive and large coverage observations are still lacking in northeast china currently only four hydrological gauges located in northeast china are included in the global runoff data centre grdc https www bafg de grdc en home homepage node html the limited hydrological gauge data are the main challenge for hydrological extreme studies in the region therefore global studies based on the grdc data and or other global discharge databases may not be representative to northeast china e g do et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2018 gudmundsson et al 2019 ghiggi et al 2019 crochemore et al 2019 lin et al 2019 regional studies about northeast china have used only several hydrological gauge observations and or only cover a small fraction of the entire northeast china region for example zhang et al 2015 used seven hydrological gauge data to study changes of water resources in seven river basins only about 7 8 of the total area of northeast china wang et al 2015 studied discharge changes and drivers of the changes using three hydrological gauge data in the songhua river in the northeast china qi 2017 and qi and liu 2018 studied trends of extreme flood peak discharge and flood volume using two hydrological gauge data in northeast china there are many studies that have investigated hydrological extremes based on precipitation extremes however floods may not be proportionally increasing even precipitation is increasing sharma et al 2018 therefore studies based on precipitation extremes cannot be directly linked to changes in discharge extremes which underpins the need to investigate hydrological extremes based on rich hydrological gauge observations recently yang et al 2020 studied extreme flood peak changes caused by snow and rainfall in eastern monsoon area of china including 59 hydrological gauges in northeast china yang et al 2019 investigated flood peak distribution in china using hydrological gauge data in entire china including more than one hundred gauges in northeast china although these studies used relatively large numbers of hydrological gauge data they did not investigate other hydrological extremes such as hydrological drought flood volume and dependence between flood peak discharge and flood volume it is necessary to investigate the correlation between flood peak discharge and flood volume because a full hydrography characterising with flood peak discharge and flood volume is commonly considered in hydraulic infrastructure designs if the correlation is ignored when it should be considered estimated deign flood could be overestimated or underestimated callau poduje et al 2014 salvadori et al 2015 salvadori et al 2016 the overall objective of this study is to analyse observed hydrological extremes from 124 hydrological gauges in northeast china for extreme flood three aspects were studied i spatial and temporal trends of annual maximum flood peak discharge and flood volume ii dependence between flood peak discharge and flood volume and iii probability distribution of extreme floods for hydrological drought trends of mean discharge and standardized discharge and probability of severe and extreme droughts were investigated both flood and drought can impede socioeconomic development and therefore they were studied together in this research this study is unique in that for the first time it investigates various aspects of observed hydrological extremes including both flood and drought based on data of more than one hundred hydrological gauges in northeast china 2 study region and datasets northeast china has an area of about 1 22 million km2 and is a main agriculture region for maize soybean wheat and rice production in china two large river basins i e the songhua river 0 55 million km2 and liao river 0 22 million km2 are located in its northern and southern parts show in fig 1a the songhua river is the largest tributary of the heilongjiang amur river and located in the middle reach of the heilongjiang river which is the tenth longest river in the world the heilongjiang river forms the border between northeast china and russia fig 1b and 1c shows the distribution of hydrological gauges and the length of hydrological data time series the 124 hydrological gauges used in this study record monthly scale data of which 101 record the daily scale data 98 of the daily scale hydrological gauge data have at least 30 years of discharge data and this number is 98 4 for monthly scale data it is acceptable to use such data to do extreme hydrological event analysis seidou et al 2006 fig 1d and 1e show the start year and end year of the datasets the datasets cover a time period from 1951 to 2016 with a maximum length of 63 years most of the records start between 1951 and 1958 fig 1d and end after 2000 fig 1e there are only eight gauges with data that end before 2000 accounting for 6 of the total number of hydrological gauges more information on the data can be found in the supplementary information 3 methodology trends were represented using slope values of linear regressions negative slopes meant decreasing trends and positive slopes meant increasing trends the nonparametric mann kendall approach was used to analyse the significance of the trend at a significance level of 0 05 mann 1945 kendall 1975 in addition to the annual maximum flood peak discharge 3 day 7 day and 15 day annual maximum flood volume were also selected to characterise floods because many hydraulic infrastructures were designed on the basis of them the flood volume was calculated as the total discharge volume within 3 7 and 15 days and then the annual maximum flood volume was selected based on the 3 7 and 15 day flood volume within each calendar year the dependence between flood peaks and flood volumes was represented by correlation coefficient which was calculated as the kendall s tau kendall 1975 the dependence was estimated based on each 30 year moving time window hansen et al 2012 fischer et al 2013 then the trend of dependence was computed based on a time series of the dependence we used gauges with at least 40 years of data seidou et al 2006 there are 78 gauges with over 40 years of discharge data similarly this method was also used in analysing the changing trends of severe and extreme drought probability under 3 month 6 month 9 month and 12 month accumulation periods in investigation of the probability distributions of extreme flood time series the l moments method has been recognized as an efficient approach vogel et al 1993 onoz and bayazit 1995 di baldassarre et al 2006 xu et al 2009 qi et al 2016 many probability distributions can be characterized based on skewness and kurtosis hosking 1986 hosking 1990 hosking 2005 l moment plots show the skewness and kurtosis of different probability distributions and sample data the closer the skewness and kurtosis values of a sample time series to a probability distribution the more likely this sample time series follows this probability distribution the l moment method depends on visual inspections to find an appropriate probability distribution if the skewness and kurtosis values of a sample time series are located on the l moment plot of a probability distribution the sample time series would follow the probability distribution in this study the l moments method was used to analyze the probability distribution of extreme flood peak distribution we used the standardized runoff index sri to characteristic hydrological drought using standardized discharge in this study the non parametric sri was used farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 therefore the estimated hydrological drought severity was not influenced by any parameters changing with time shukla and wood 2008 hao et al 2014 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 to calculate sri first empirical probability of discharge was calculated based on empirical gringorten plotting position as follows 1 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where n is the sample size i is the rank of discharge data from the smallest x represents discharge p represents corresponding empirical probability second sri was calculated using the following equation 2 s r i f 1 p where f represents the standard normal distribution function the comparison of drought severity in different time was facilitated by the transformation of normal distribution sri in 3 month and 6 month can capture drought variations of short duration and 9 month and 12 month sri can capture drought variations of long duration the four accumulation time periods are commonly used in drought studies shukla and wood 2008 hao et al 2014 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 in this study severe drought referred to the situations that 1 59 sri 1 29 and extreme drought referred to the situations that sri 1 59 hao et al 2014 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 4 results and discussion 4 1 trends of extreme floods fig 2 shows slopes of linear trends of flood peak discharge 3 day 7 day and 15 day flood volumes in terms of flood peak discharge 81 19 of the gauges show decreasing trend and such decreasing trends are statistically significant in 33 66 of the gauges mainly located in the southern regions in contrast only 18 81 of the gauges show non significant increasing trend most of them are located in the songhua river basin and no gauges show significant increasing trends similarly about 80 of the gauges show decreasing trends in terms of 3 day 7 day and 15 day flood volumes and most of the significant decreasing trends are found in the southern parts of northeast china considering that at least one third 32 67 as shown in fig 2c of the observed flood extremes show significant decreasing trends using non stationary extreme flood estimation approaches could be more appropriate there are two steps to do this first the parameters of probability distribution functions are estimated using moving time windows second a function is estimated to represent the relationship between time and the parameters cheng and aghakouchak 2014 qi 2017 qi and liu 2018 gudmundsson et al 2019 found increasing trends in annual maximum flood peak discharge in east asia which is different from our results this difference may be because the study by gudmundsson et al 2019 used global discharge datasets that do not include hydrological gauges from northeast china and because most of gauges in east asia they used were from japan this difference implies that our study can be an important complement to the global studies based on incomplete global hydrological gauge databases 4 2 dependence of flood variables fig 3 shows dependence between flood peak discharge and flood volume in terms of the dependence between flood peak discharge and 3 day flood volume all the gauges show the flood peak discharge and 3 day flood volume are significantly correlated similar correlations are also found between flood peak discharge and 7 day and 15 day flood volumes fig 4 shows linear trends of the dependence between flood peak discharge and volume in terms of flood peak and 3 day flood volume 55 1 of the gauges show the dependence is increasing in terms of flood peak and 7 day flood volume 53 9 show the dependence is increasing for flood peak and 15 day flood volume the percentage is 53 8 overall over 53 of the gauges show the dependence is increasing 4 3 probability distribution of extreme floods fig 5 shows l moment plots of observed extreme flood data with colours of the dots indicating the length of the time series ten commonly used probability distributions are shown in the plots i e generalized logistic generalized extreme value generalized pareto three parameter lognormal 3p pearson type iii uniform two parameter exponential 2p gumbel logistic and normal in terms of flood peak discharge the skewness and kurtosis values of some extreme flood data are close to generalized pareto and lognormal 3p or located in the regions between the curves of generalized pareto and pearson type iii group 1 in fig 5a most of the data in group 2 have skewness and kurtosis values that are close to pearson type iii and the data in group 3 are close to generalized pareto probability distribution although the three groups are separated by our visual inspections the l moments plots clearly show that the officially recommended pearson type iii probability distribution in china may not be the best one for extreme flood analysis in the entire region studied similarly the results of 3 day 7 day and 15 day flood volumes also show pearson type iii probability distribution may not be the best one although the generalized pareto may be the best probability distribution for some hydrological gauges it is not appropriate for some other hydrological gauges 4 4 trends of mean discharge and hydrological drought index fig 6 shows trends of annual mean discharge a and sri b c d e mean discharge is decreasing in 88 71 41 13 47 58 of the gauges of which 47 58 are significantly decreasing most of the gauges in southern parts of the study region are significantly drying as shown in region a most of the gauges in the nenjiang shows non significant drying trends as shown in region b similarly most of the gauges in the upper part of the second songhua river also show non significant drying trends as shown in the region c as for 3 month sri 71 77 of the gauges show significant drying trends and 16 13 of the gauges show non significant drying trends in total 87 90 71 77 16 13 of the gauges show drying 3 month sri similarly in terms of 6 month 9 month and 12 month sri at least 91 94 84 68 7 26 shown in fig 6e of the gauges show drying sri and at least 79 03 fig 6c of the gauges show significant drying sri overall at least 87 90 of the gauges show drying trends and at least 47 58 show significant drying trends in terms of mean discharge 3 month 6 month 9 month and 12 month sri the songhua river is the largest tributary of the heilongjiang river we find that the discharge in the songhua river is decreasing generally which could be the combined effects of climate change and human activity influence wang et al 2015 the studies by alkama et al 2011 and gedney et al 2014 suggest that the observed discharge is increasing based on hydrological gauge data in the downstream of the heilongjiang river on the one hand this difference may be because the time period studied is different on the other hand the difference may be due to the location of the songhua river basin which is in the middle reach of the heilongjiang river basin compared to the studies by alkama et al 2011 and gedney et al 2014 we studied the much larger tributary of the heilongjiang river basin based on hundreds of hydrological gauge data and our results show a reversing changing trend therefore our study advances the knowledge on discharge trends in the region studied and provides new information on the hydrological changes in the heilongjiang amur river basin 4 5 trend of hydrological drought probability fig 7 shows trends of severe and extreme drought probability under 3 month 6 month 9 month and 12 month accumulation periods more hydrological gauges show decreasing trends than increasing trends i e more gauges show the number of drought events is reducing the percentage is at least 52 8 for severe drought fig 7c and at least 51 9 for extreme drought fig 7f currently there is no agricultural drought insurance in northeast china because discharge is a comprehensive indicator for water resources availability for agriculture production the spatial distribution of the trends of hydrological drought probability can provide useful information for developing drought insurance policies in this region in the future 4 6 discussion in hydraulic infrastructure design extreme flood peak discharge and volume are commonly considered together there are two methods to estimate design flood peak discharge and flood volume the first one is using traditional flood frequency analysis approach i e either flood peak discharge or flood volume is fitted to a probability distribution merz and blöschl 2008 qi et al 2016 specifically in china annual maximum flood peak discharge and flood volume are fitted to the pearson type iii probability distribution individually and then the fitted distributions are used to estimate a design flood value with a return period of interest the second one is considering the correlation between flood peak discharge and flood volume i e multi variable designs salvadori et al 2016 vahedifard et al 2017 qi and liu 2018 jiang et al 2019 copula functions are commonly used to represent the correlation salvadori et al 2011 salvadori et al 2016 according to the china s regulation for calculating design flood of water resources and hydropower projects 2006 the pearson type iii distribution is officially recommended and non stationarity is not considered the regulation does not include specific information on mutil variable design flood estimation considering the correlation between flood variables differently the results in our study suggest that multi variable probability distributions should be used to estimate design hydrograph when multiple design flood variables are of interest given that all the gauges show flood peak discharge and flood volume are significantly dependent in addition the results also suggest that non stationary multi variable probability distributions should be used in design flood variable estimation given that the correlation changes in many gauges currently there is no official regulation about the use of copula functions in hydraulic infrastructure design which is the main challenge to apply the multi variable approach motivating more studies combining hydrological extreme studies with policy making many frequency distribution models have been proposed in the past e g the gamma distribution the weibull distribution the generalized pareto distribution and the gumbel distribution in several countries national standardization of probability distribution is enforced in deign flood estimation for hydraulic infrastructure design in the usa the log pearson iii distribution is the official model since 1967 in the uk the generalized logistic distribution has been endorsed as the official distribution in china the pearson type iii distribution was officially selected since several decades ago the standardized use of a single model can be interesting from the administrative point of view however extreme flood data were not enough to clarify the theoretical basis due to limited number of hydrological gauges and limited length of observed discharge data at that time in this study we used hundreds of gauge observed flood data to test the fitness of the pearson type iii distribution in northeast china following the non stationarity method in the china s regulation for calculating design flood of water resources and hydropower projects 2006 the results show that the pearson type iii distribution is not the best probability distribution in many gauges this phenomenon may be caused by the complex mechanism of floods there are many factors that can influence floods such as snow melt storm land use management and human activities qi and liu 2019 yang et al 2020 the result highlights that there may be a need to shift the standardized use of a single model to the non rejectable idea qi et al 2016 the non rejectable idea recognizes that the best probability distribution may not exist because of imprecise incomplete and or imperfect information term as epistemic uncertainty fu et al 2011 fu and kapelan 2011 when considering the epistemic uncertainty probability distribution that cannot be rejected should be used fig 6 reveals the changes of hydrological drought severity and fig 7 shows the number variations of hydrological drought events given the results of figs 6 and 7 the results suggest that the number of drought events is decreasing but the severity of drought events is intensifying in most of the gauges i e less drought events but more severe one common holding belief is that drought would become more frequent and severe under climate change spinoni et al 2018 our finding is different from this belief the result may be the combined effects of climate change and human activities the changing trends of hydrological drought severity are generally consistent with climate change and human water use may also contribute to the changes gudmundsson et al 2021 in the past decades hundreds of reservoirs have been built in northeast china according to the water resources report of songliao river water resources commission ministry of water resources the people s republic of china www mwr gov cn english the numbers of large and moderate reservoirs are 38 and 179 in 1988 72 and 271 in 2008 81 and 298 in 2015 86 and 310 in 2017 the number of small reservoirs is 2019 in 1988 and the number is not available for other years but would increase with time one of the primary aims of the reservoirs is to ameliorate hydrological drought events the increasing reservoirs may lead to the decreasing number of severe and extreme drought events motivating more reservoir constructions to fight against hydrological droughts and then putting into question the largest potential of water resources management to ameliorate hydrological droughts under climate change the effects of reservoir amelioration on drought can only be captured by discharge and meteorological drought indexes cannot reflect the effects therefore meteorological drought studies would be misleading in regions with strong human activities influence this is not unique to northeast china and likely to be widespread elsewhere on the globe highlighting the importance of drought change studies based on comprehensive and large coverage hydrological gauge data we have presented three new findings in this study compared to previous studies in the region first we find that flood peak discharge flood volume mean discharge and standardized discharge are decreasing in most of the observations about 80 this finding is complementary to the study by gudmundsson et al 2021 in which 7250 hydrological gauges were used to study changes of hydrological extremes on the globe but no gauges are from northeast china second we find that correlation between flood peak discharge and flood volume is increasing in most of the gauges used over 53 this result suggests that the flood risk regime is changing and no similar results have been reported before in the region third we find that the severity of hydrological drought events is intensifying but the number of hydrological drought events is decreasing in most of the gauges over 51 although the study by gudmundsson et al 2021 found that hydrological drought severity is intensifying they did not investigate changes of drought probability similar results have not been reported before in the region both climate changes and human activity could influence changes of extreme floods and droughts currently a compressive database containing the dam construction time operational rules design details and location information is lacking in northeast china the dam operational rules could also be changed with time because dams are commonly designed with multiple working tasks such as flood control hydropower production and water supply the dam operational rules are commonly optimized to gain the maximum profile which further complicates the dam influence on extreme floods and droughts detailed information on the spatial and temporal changes of the operational rules is lacking these difficulties prevent us from a more detailed analysis on the changes in floods and droughts induced by climate change and human activity the dam issue is challenging not only for us but also for all of other studies in the region at the moment future studies are encouraged when the detailed information is available in this study we used hydrological gauge data with at least 27 years of observations a recent study used hydrological gauge data with at least 28 years of observations ranging from 1971 to 2010 gudmundsson et al 2021 the data used by gudmundsson et al 2021 cover different periods the method used in this study is similar to the study by gudmundsson et al 2021 as suggested by gudmundsson et al 2021 the different periods would have minor influence on the overall results the study by gudmundsson et al 2021 used an 80 gauge threshold to represent regional continental situations of hydrological extreme changes in this study we used 78 gauges which is similar to the methodology used by gudmundsson et al 2021 5 conclusions we studied several aspects of

8093,study region northeast china study focus northeast china is one of the largest agricultural regions in the world and a strategically important granary for china information on hydrological extremes is crucially important for water management yet comprehensive studies on hydrological extremes both extreme flood and drought events based on hydrological gauge comprehensive and large coverage observations are still lacking in northeast china this study investigated observed hydrological extremes with 124 hydrological gauges in the region ranging from the 1950s to present for the first time new hydrological insights for the region we find that flood extremes mean discharge and standardized discharge are decreasing in over 80 of the gauges and no gauges show significantly increasing flood extremes the findings suggest that sustainable water management strategies should be employed to meet increasing water demand for long term development in addition we find that flood peak discharge and flood volume are significantly correlated in all the gauges motivating flood risk studies considering multiple flood variables together further we quantify probability changes of severe and extreme hydrological droughts and find that the probability of drought events is decreasing in most of the gauges suggesting that the number of drought events is reducing data availability discharge data are from the hydrology bureau and can be found by contacting songliao river water resources commission ministry of water resources the people s republic of china http www mwr gov cn english keywords flood drought northeast china hydrological extreme liao river songhua river 1 introduction northeast china is one of the most important agricultural areas in the world and the northeast china plain is the largest plain in china piao et al 2010 ray et al 2015 deng et al 2019 rojas et al 2019 rosa et al 2020 due to socioeconomic development and intensification of agricultural production in the region the demand for water resources is increasing rapidly northeast china is also a region frequently suffered from extreme floods a large number of hydraulic infrastructures have been built in northeast china these infrastructures can prevent flooding in the rainy season and ameliorate water shortage in the dry season which have complicated variations of hydrological extremes wang et al 2015 sharma et al 2018 investigations of spatial and temporal changes of hydrological extremes in the entire northeast china are important for water management to sustain long term development of socioeconomics and agriculture production piao et al 2010 asseng et al 2015 ray et al 2015 anderson et al 2019 rojas et al 2019 discharge can reflect the overall influence of various factors in a river basin and is directly related to hydrological extremes zaitchik et al 2010 qi et al 2020 therefore hydrological extreme analysis using hydrological gauge observation is informative and comprehensive yet comprehensive studies on hydrological extremes both extreme flood and drought events based on hydrological gauge comprehensive and large coverage observations are still lacking in northeast china currently only four hydrological gauges located in northeast china are included in the global runoff data centre grdc https www bafg de grdc en home homepage node html the limited hydrological gauge data are the main challenge for hydrological extreme studies in the region therefore global studies based on the grdc data and or other global discharge databases may not be representative to northeast china e g do et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2018 gudmundsson et al 2019 ghiggi et al 2019 crochemore et al 2019 lin et al 2019 regional studies about northeast china have used only several hydrological gauge observations and or only cover a small fraction of the entire northeast china region for example zhang et al 2015 used seven hydrological gauge data to study changes of water resources in seven river basins only about 7 8 of the total area of northeast china wang et al 2015 studied discharge changes and drivers of the changes using three hydrological gauge data in the songhua river in the northeast china qi 2017 and qi and liu 2018 studied trends of extreme flood peak discharge and flood volume using two hydrological gauge data in northeast china there are many studies that have investigated hydrological extremes based on precipitation extremes however floods may not be proportionally increasing even precipitation is increasing sharma et al 2018 therefore studies based on precipitation extremes cannot be directly linked to changes in discharge extremes which underpins the need to investigate hydrological extremes based on rich hydrological gauge observations recently yang et al 2020 studied extreme flood peak changes caused by snow and rainfall in eastern monsoon area of china including 59 hydrological gauges in northeast china yang et al 2019 investigated flood peak distribution in china using hydrological gauge data in entire china including more than one hundred gauges in northeast china although these studies used relatively large numbers of hydrological gauge data they did not investigate other hydrological extremes such as hydrological drought flood volume and dependence between flood peak discharge and flood volume it is necessary to investigate the correlation between flood peak discharge and flood volume because a full hydrography characterising with flood peak discharge and flood volume is commonly considered in hydraulic infrastructure designs if the correlation is ignored when it should be considered estimated deign flood could be overestimated or underestimated callau poduje et al 2014 salvadori et al 2015 salvadori et al 2016 the overall objective of this study is to analyse observed hydrological extremes from 124 hydrological gauges in northeast china for extreme flood three aspects were studied i spatial and temporal trends of annual maximum flood peak discharge and flood volume ii dependence between flood peak discharge and flood volume and iii probability distribution of extreme floods for hydrological drought trends of mean discharge and standardized discharge and probability of severe and extreme droughts were investigated both flood and drought can impede socioeconomic development and therefore they were studied together in this research this study is unique in that for the first time it investigates various aspects of observed hydrological extremes including both flood and drought based on data of more than one hundred hydrological gauges in northeast china 2 study region and datasets northeast china has an area of about 1 22 million km2 and is a main agriculture region for maize soybean wheat and rice production in china two large river basins i e the songhua river 0 55 million km2 and liao river 0 22 million km2 are located in its northern and southern parts show in fig 1a the songhua river is the largest tributary of the heilongjiang amur river and located in the middle reach of the heilongjiang river which is the tenth longest river in the world the heilongjiang river forms the border between northeast china and russia fig 1b and 1c shows the distribution of hydrological gauges and the length of hydrological data time series the 124 hydrological gauges used in this study record monthly scale data of which 101 record the daily scale data 98 of the daily scale hydrological gauge data have at least 30 years of discharge data and this number is 98 4 for monthly scale data it is acceptable to use such data to do extreme hydrological event analysis seidou et al 2006 fig 1d and 1e show the start year and end year of the datasets the datasets cover a time period from 1951 to 2016 with a maximum length of 63 years most of the records start between 1951 and 1958 fig 1d and end after 2000 fig 1e there are only eight gauges with data that end before 2000 accounting for 6 of the total number of hydrological gauges more information on the data can be found in the supplementary information 3 methodology trends were represented using slope values of linear regressions negative slopes meant decreasing trends and positive slopes meant increasing trends the nonparametric mann kendall approach was used to analyse the significance of the trend at a significance level of 0 05 mann 1945 kendall 1975 in addition to the annual maximum flood peak discharge 3 day 7 day and 15 day annual maximum flood volume were also selected to characterise floods because many hydraulic infrastructures were designed on the basis of them the flood volume was calculated as the total discharge volume within 3 7 and 15 days and then the annual maximum flood volume was selected based on the 3 7 and 15 day flood volume within each calendar year the dependence between flood peaks and flood volumes was represented by correlation coefficient which was calculated as the kendall s tau kendall 1975 the dependence was estimated based on each 30 year moving time window hansen et al 2012 fischer et al 2013 then the trend of dependence was computed based on a time series of the dependence we used gauges with at least 40 years of data seidou et al 2006 there are 78 gauges with over 40 years of discharge data similarly this method was also used in analysing the changing trends of severe and extreme drought probability under 3 month 6 month 9 month and 12 month accumulation periods in investigation of the probability distributions of extreme flood time series the l moments method has been recognized as an efficient approach vogel et al 1993 onoz and bayazit 1995 di baldassarre et al 2006 xu et al 2009 qi et al 2016 many probability distributions can be characterized based on skewness and kurtosis hosking 1986 hosking 1990 hosking 2005 l moment plots show the skewness and kurtosis of different probability distributions and sample data the closer the skewness and kurtosis values of a sample time series to a probability distribution the more likely this sample time series follows this probability distribution the l moment method depends on visual inspections to find an appropriate probability distribution if the skewness and kurtosis values of a sample time series are located on the l moment plot of a probability distribution the sample time series would follow the probability distribution in this study the l moments method was used to analyze the probability distribution of extreme flood peak distribution we used the standardized runoff index sri to characteristic hydrological drought using standardized discharge in this study the non parametric sri was used farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 therefore the estimated hydrological drought severity was not influenced by any parameters changing with time shukla and wood 2008 hao et al 2014 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 to calculate sri first empirical probability of discharge was calculated based on empirical gringorten plotting position as follows 1 p x i i 0 44 n 0 12 where n is the sample size i is the rank of discharge data from the smallest x represents discharge p represents corresponding empirical probability second sri was calculated using the following equation 2 s r i f 1 p where f represents the standard normal distribution function the comparison of drought severity in different time was facilitated by the transformation of normal distribution sri in 3 month and 6 month can capture drought variations of short duration and 9 month and 12 month sri can capture drought variations of long duration the four accumulation time periods are commonly used in drought studies shukla and wood 2008 hao et al 2014 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 in this study severe drought referred to the situations that 1 59 sri 1 29 and extreme drought referred to the situations that sri 1 59 hao et al 2014 farahmand and aghakouchak 2015 4 results and discussion 4 1 trends of extreme floods fig 2 shows slopes of linear trends of flood peak discharge 3 day 7 day and 15 day flood volumes in terms of flood peak discharge 81 19 of the gauges show decreasing trend and such decreasing trends are statistically significant in 33 66 of the gauges mainly located in the southern regions in contrast only 18 81 of the gauges show non significant increasing trend most of them are located in the songhua river basin and no gauges show significant increasing trends similarly about 80 of the gauges show decreasing trends in terms of 3 day 7 day and 15 day flood volumes and most of the significant decreasing trends are found in the southern parts of northeast china considering that at least one third 32 67 as shown in fig 2c of the observed flood extremes show significant decreasing trends using non stationary extreme flood estimation approaches could be more appropriate there are two steps to do this first the parameters of probability distribution functions are estimated using moving time windows second a function is estimated to represent the relationship between time and the parameters cheng and aghakouchak 2014 qi 2017 qi and liu 2018 gudmundsson et al 2019 found increasing trends in annual maximum flood peak discharge in east asia which is different from our results this difference may be because the study by gudmundsson et al 2019 used global discharge datasets that do not include hydrological gauges from northeast china and because most of gauges in east asia they used were from japan this difference implies that our study can be an important complement to the global studies based on incomplete global hydrological gauge databases 4 2 dependence of flood variables fig 3 shows dependence between flood peak discharge and flood volume in terms of the dependence between flood peak discharge and 3 day flood volume all the gauges show the flood peak discharge and 3 day flood volume are significantly correlated similar correlations are also found between flood peak discharge and 7 day and 15 day flood volumes fig 4 shows linear trends of the dependence between flood peak discharge and volume in terms of flood peak and 3 day flood volume 55 1 of the gauges show the dependence is increasing in terms of flood peak and 7 day flood volume 53 9 show the dependence is increasing for flood peak and 15 day flood volume the percentage is 53 8 overall over 53 of the gauges show the dependence is increasing 4 3 probability distribution of extreme floods fig 5 shows l moment plots of observed extreme flood data with colours of the dots indicating the length of the time series ten commonly used probability distributions are shown in the plots i e generalized logistic generalized extreme value generalized pareto three parameter lognormal 3p pearson type iii uniform two parameter exponential 2p gumbel logistic and normal in terms of flood peak discharge the skewness and kurtosis values of some extreme flood data are close to generalized pareto and lognormal 3p or located in the regions between the curves of generalized pareto and pearson type iii group 1 in fig 5a most of the data in group 2 have skewness and kurtosis values that are close to pearson type iii and the data in group 3 are close to generalized pareto probability distribution although the three groups are separated by our visual inspections the l moments plots clearly show that the officially recommended pearson type iii probability distribution in china may not be the best one for extreme flood analysis in the entire region studied similarly the results of 3 day 7 day and 15 day flood volumes also show pearson type iii probability distribution may not be the best one although the generalized pareto may be the best probability distribution for some hydrological gauges it is not appropriate for some other hydrological gauges 4 4 trends of mean discharge and hydrological drought index fig 6 shows trends of annual mean discharge a and sri b c d e mean discharge is decreasing in 88 71 41 13 47 58 of the gauges of which 47 58 are significantly decreasing most of the gauges in southern parts of the study region are significantly drying as shown in region a most of the gauges in the nenjiang shows non significant drying trends as shown in region b similarly most of the gauges in the upper part of the second songhua river also show non significant drying trends as shown in the region c as for 3 month sri 71 77 of the gauges show significant drying trends and 16 13 of the gauges show non significant drying trends in total 87 90 71 77 16 13 of the gauges show drying 3 month sri similarly in terms of 6 month 9 month and 12 month sri at least 91 94 84 68 7 26 shown in fig 6e of the gauges show drying sri and at least 79 03 fig 6c of the gauges show significant drying sri overall at least 87 90 of the gauges show drying trends and at least 47 58 show significant drying trends in terms of mean discharge 3 month 6 month 9 month and 12 month sri the songhua river is the largest tributary of the heilongjiang river we find that the discharge in the songhua river is decreasing generally which could be the combined effects of climate change and human activity influence wang et al 2015 the studies by alkama et al 2011 and gedney et al 2014 suggest that the observed discharge is increasing based on hydrological gauge data in the downstream of the heilongjiang river on the one hand this difference may be because the time period studied is different on the other hand the difference may be due to the location of the songhua river basin which is in the middle reach of the heilongjiang river basin compared to the studies by alkama et al 2011 and gedney et al 2014 we studied the much larger tributary of the heilongjiang river basin based on hundreds of hydrological gauge data and our results show a reversing changing trend therefore our study advances the knowledge on discharge trends in the region studied and provides new information on the hydrological changes in the heilongjiang amur river basin 4 5 trend of hydrological drought probability fig 7 shows trends of severe and extreme drought probability under 3 month 6 month 9 month and 12 month accumulation periods more hydrological gauges show decreasing trends than increasing trends i e more gauges show the number of drought events is reducing the percentage is at least 52 8 for severe drought fig 7c and at least 51 9 for extreme drought fig 7f currently there is no agricultural drought insurance in northeast china because discharge is a comprehensive indicator for water resources availability for agriculture production the spatial distribution of the trends of hydrological drought probability can provide useful information for developing drought insurance policies in this region in the future 4 6 discussion in hydraulic infrastructure design extreme flood peak discharge and volume are commonly considered together there are two methods to estimate design flood peak discharge and flood volume the first one is using traditional flood frequency analysis approach i e either flood peak discharge or flood volume is fitted to a probability distribution merz and blöschl 2008 qi et al 2016 specifically in china annual maximum flood peak discharge and flood volume are fitted to the pearson type iii probability distribution individually and then the fitted distributions are used to estimate a design flood value with a return period of interest the second one is considering the correlation between flood peak discharge and flood volume i e multi variable designs salvadori et al 2016 vahedifard et al 2017 qi and liu 2018 jiang et al 2019 copula functions are commonly used to represent the correlation salvadori et al 2011 salvadori et al 2016 according to the china s regulation for calculating design flood of water resources and hydropower projects 2006 the pearson type iii distribution is officially recommended and non stationarity is not considered the regulation does not include specific information on mutil variable design flood estimation considering the correlation between flood variables differently the results in our study suggest that multi variable probability distributions should be used to estimate design hydrograph when multiple design flood variables are of interest given that all the gauges show flood peak discharge and flood volume are significantly dependent in addition the results also suggest that non stationary multi variable probability distributions should be used in design flood variable estimation given that the correlation changes in many gauges currently there is no official regulation about the use of copula functions in hydraulic infrastructure design which is the main challenge to apply the multi variable approach motivating more studies combining hydrological extreme studies with policy making many frequency distribution models have been proposed in the past e g the gamma distribution the weibull distribution the generalized pareto distribution and the gumbel distribution in several countries national standardization of probability distribution is enforced in deign flood estimation for hydraulic infrastructure design in the usa the log pearson iii distribution is the official model since 1967 in the uk the generalized logistic distribution has been endorsed as the official distribution in china the pearson type iii distribution was officially selected since several decades ago the standardized use of a single model can be interesting from the administrative point of view however extreme flood data were not enough to clarify the theoretical basis due to limited number of hydrological gauges and limited length of observed discharge data at that time in this study we used hundreds of gauge observed flood data to test the fitness of the pearson type iii distribution in northeast china following the non stationarity method in the china s regulation for calculating design flood of water resources and hydropower projects 2006 the results show that the pearson type iii distribution is not the best probability distribution in many gauges this phenomenon may be caused by the complex mechanism of floods there are many factors that can influence floods such as snow melt storm land use management and human activities qi and liu 2019 yang et al 2020 the result highlights that there may be a need to shift the standardized use of a single model to the non rejectable idea qi et al 2016 the non rejectable idea recognizes that the best probability distribution may not exist because of imprecise incomplete and or imperfect information term as epistemic uncertainty fu et al 2011 fu and kapelan 2011 when considering the epistemic uncertainty probability distribution that cannot be rejected should be used fig 6 reveals the changes of hydrological drought severity and fig 7 shows the number variations of hydrological drought events given the results of figs 6 and 7 the results suggest that the number of drought events is decreasing but the severity of drought events is intensifying in most of the gauges i e less drought events but more severe one common holding belief is that drought would become more frequent and severe under climate change spinoni et al 2018 our finding is different from this belief the result may be the combined effects of climate change and human activities the changing trends of hydrological drought severity are generally consistent with climate change and human water use may also contribute to the changes gudmundsson et al 2021 in the past decades hundreds of reservoirs have been built in northeast china according to the water resources report of songliao river water resources commission ministry of water resources the people s republic of china www mwr gov cn english the numbers of large and moderate reservoirs are 38 and 179 in 1988 72 and 271 in 2008 81 and 298 in 2015 86 and 310 in 2017 the number of small reservoirs is 2019 in 1988 and the number is not available for other years but would increase with time one of the primary aims of the reservoirs is to ameliorate hydrological drought events the increasing reservoirs may lead to the decreasing number of severe and extreme drought events motivating more reservoir constructions to fight against hydrological droughts and then putting into question the largest potential of water resources management to ameliorate hydrological droughts under climate change the effects of reservoir amelioration on drought can only be captured by discharge and meteorological drought indexes cannot reflect the effects therefore meteorological drought studies would be misleading in regions with strong human activities influence this is not unique to northeast china and likely to be widespread elsewhere on the globe highlighting the importance of drought change studies based on comprehensive and large coverage hydrological gauge data we have presented three new findings in this study compared to previous studies in the region first we find that flood peak discharge flood volume mean discharge and standardized discharge are decreasing in most of the observations about 80 this finding is complementary to the study by gudmundsson et al 2021 in which 7250 hydrological gauges were used to study changes of hydrological extremes on the globe but no gauges are from northeast china second we find that correlation between flood peak discharge and flood volume is increasing in most of the gauges used over 53 this result suggests that the flood risk regime is changing and no similar results have been reported before in the region third we find that the severity of hydrological drought events is intensifying but the number of hydrological drought events is decreasing in most of the gauges over 51 although the study by gudmundsson et al 2021 found that hydrological drought severity is intensifying they did not investigate changes of drought probability similar results have not been reported before in the region both climate changes and human activity could influence changes of extreme floods and droughts currently a compressive database containing the dam construction time operational rules design details and location information is lacking in northeast china the dam operational rules could also be changed with time because dams are commonly designed with multiple working tasks such as flood control hydropower production and water supply the dam operational rules are commonly optimized to gain the maximum profile which further complicates the dam influence on extreme floods and droughts detailed information on the spatial and temporal changes of the operational rules is lacking these difficulties prevent us from a more detailed analysis on the changes in floods and droughts induced by climate change and human activity the dam issue is challenging not only for us but also for all of other studies in the region at the moment future studies are encouraged when the detailed information is available in this study we used hydrological gauge data with at least 27 years of observations a recent study used hydrological gauge data with at least 28 years of observations ranging from 1971 to 2010 gudmundsson et al 2021 the data used by gudmundsson et al 2021 cover different periods the method used in this study is similar to the study by gudmundsson et al 2021 as suggested by gudmundsson et al 2021 the different periods would have minor influence on the overall results the study by gudmundsson et al 2021 used an 80 gauge threshold to represent regional continental situations of hydrological extreme changes in this study we used 78 gauges which is similar to the methodology used by gudmundsson et al 2021 5 conclusions we studied several aspects of observed hydrological extremes including both flood and drought events based on hydrological gauge comprehensive and large coverage observations in northeast china for the first time this study represents a significant progress in hydrological extreme studies in the region and provides information that the previous studies cannot present following main conclusions are presented on the basis of this study first flood peak discharge flood volume mean discharge and standardized discharge are decreasing in most of the hydrological gauges about 80 second all the gauges show flood peak discharge and flood volume are significantly correlated and the correlation is increasing in most of the gauges used over 53 third the severity of hydrological drought events is intensifying in most of the gauges over 87 but the number of hydrological drought events is decreasing in most of the gauges over 51 less drought events but more severe credit authorship contribution statement wei qi

8094,study region selenga river delta srd russia study focus how is water occurrence changing in the srd and what are the hydroclimatic drivers behind these changes the presence of water on the surface in river deltas is governed by land use geomorphology and the flux of water to and from the delta we trained an accurate image classification of the landsat satellite imagery during the last 33 years to quantify surface water occurrence and its changes in the srd after comparing our estimations with global scale datasets we determined the hydrological drivers of these changes new hydrological insights for the region we find mild decreases in water occurrence in 51 of the srd s surface area from 1987 2002 to 2003 2020 water occurrence in the most affected areas decreased by 20 and in the most water gaining areas increased by 10 we find a significant relationship between water occurrence and runoff r2 0 56 that does not exist between water occurrence and suspended sediment concentration ssc lake baikal s water level and potential evapotranspiration the time series of water occurrence follows the peaks in the runoff but not its long term trend however the extremes in ssc do not influence surface water occurrence r2 0 1 although their long term trends are similar contrary to expected we find that the delta has a relatively stable long term water availability for the

freshwater storage pollutant retention and attenuation recreational activities flood control and fishing day et al 2019 they also help to achieve sustainable development jaramillo et al 2019 despite their importance in providing these services they are under pressure from human activities and the effects of human induced climate change day et al 2019 lin et al 2017 wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 upstream water impoundment and regulation decrease sediment discharge and flatten runoff peaks necessary for hydraulic flushing and wetland sheet flow syvitski et al 2009 wu et al 2020 water extraction excessive groundwater use and methane extraction have led to decreased incoming water flows sediment compaction and subsidence in deltas throughout the world giosan et al 2014 giesen 2020 and nienhuis et al 2020 emphasize that local focus on deltas with a large set of ecosystem services is necessary to understand and manage deltas hydrological and morphological changes change in surface water occurrence can be the response of anthropogenic and climatic drivers in deltas surface water occurrence is defined as the presence of water at a specific location on the surface and at a particular time for the particular case of deltas water occurrence can be permanent in open water areas such as main river channels streams and in stream wetlands or temporary such as sandbanks flooded wetlands and floodplains apart from the direct effects of human activities water occurrence changes are also driven by in stream hydraulics fluvial geomorphologic processes and sediment transport therefore understanding changes in hydrological connectivity and patchiness resulting from the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water occurrence is relevant for the conservation of deltaic ecosystems cui et al 2020 the change in surface water occurrence is spatially heterogeneous and its direction of change loss or gain is case specific borja et al 2020 while global scale studies are very relevant for assessing changes in surface water resources at large scales e g donchyts et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 they may miss a detailed understanding of local and case specific changes in water occurrence furthermore most studies of changes in water occurrence do not focus on identifying the most relevant hydrological drivers of change for instance water occurrence changes in a delta may be related to the main river s incoming water and sediment discharge evapotranspiration from the surface water or changing tides we here perform an analysis of change in water occurrence between 1987 2002 and 2003 2020 in the selenga river delta srd a lacustrine delta covering 540 km2 the delta plays a vital hydrological role for lake baikal for example the srd acts as an active sink of various metals reducing 77 99 concentrations during moderate and high flow conditions chalov et al 2017b shinkareva et al 2019 also showed that seasonally flooded regions control the total metal concentrations flowing into lake baikal hence assessing changes in water occurrence in the delta serves as a diagnostic of these hydrological functions severe droughts during the last two decades in mongolia and transbaikalia have decreased the discharge of the selenga river antokhina et al 2019 frolova et al 2017 with potential changes in water occurrence within the delta our primary research question is how is water occurrence changing in the selenga river delta and what are the hydroclimatic drivers behind these changes we aim to determine the magnitude of change in water occurrence in the delta over more than 30 years and relate these changes with the hydroclimatic fluxes and processes that regulate water availability in the delta including the runoff and sediment concentration in selenga river hydrological basin evapotranspiration and water level changes in the lake baikal satellite observations are valuable sources to understand changes in water occurrence allen and pavelsky 2018 borja et al 2020 chini et al 2017 donchyts et al 2016 guo et al 2017 pekel et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 with more than 35 years of medium resolution acquisitions the landsat project is a convenient source of optical imagery to monitor water occurrence changes with even several images available per month for specific deltas in addition advanced computational algorithms and cloud based platforms enable processing large amounts of data in relatively short periods providing a high spatial resolution of changes to answer the research question we specifically train the landsat data to detect a more case specific representation of water occurrence within the delta generate a time series of change in water occurrence and compare our results against already available global datasets of water occurrence that do not train the data the two hypotheses driving the study are 1 changes in water occurrence in the selenga river delta follow runoff oscillations occurring during the last 30 years as in other deltas worldwide 2 a direct relationship between water occurrence in the delta and runoff and suspended sediment concentration is more evident than with evapotranspiration and lake baikal water level as the lake water level is regulated by irkutsk dam on the main outflow of lake baikal angara river since 1959 and evapotranspiration from the delta is low 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the selenga river delta is located in eastern russia fig 1 along lake baikal s southern shore out of around 365 other rivers the selenga river is the main river flowing into lake baikal it is responsible for almost 50 of the runoff water and 60 of the transported sediments into the lake system and its hydrological basin covers more than 82 of the lake s basin potemkina 2004 the srd s unique habitats and ecosystem services have made this delta a ramsar wetland of international importance berhane et al 2018 lane et al 2015 the delta covers 540 km2 and receives 315 mm of annual precipitation concentrated from april to october causing floods and freshets in the main channel and tributaries the continental climate is described by temperature variations between 14 on average in july and 19 in january with a growing season of around 150 days starts in mid may fig s1 berhane et al 2018 lane et al 2015 precipitation and runoff in the selenga river basin have decreased from the highest reported peak in 1992 to its lowest between 2004 and 2008 fig 2a air temperature in the srd increased to the highest mean annual values in 2016 and 2017 fig 2b being a lacustrine river delta changes in water occurrence in this delta are not related to rising sea levels instead changes in the selenga river discharge and lake baikal water level are related to hydroclimatic data antokhina et al 2019 and fluvial geomorphological processes pietroń et al 2018 dong et al 2019 shinkareva et al 2019 the selenga river faces several socioeconomic and environmental impacts influencing lake baikal borisova 2019 the anthropogenic impact on ecosystems in the selenga river basin has increased in the recent decades e g by the extraction of minerals primarily gold urbanization and agricultural development especially in the upper mongolian part of the basin jarsjö et al 2017 garmaev et al 2019 the long term low water period observed in the region gelfan and millionshchikova 2018 has a significant impact on delta processes and wetland dominated areas of the srd also posing drastic changes in sediment transport and water quality chalov et al 2017b shinkareva et al 2019 2 2 satellite data and classification unsupervised classification methodologies can determine long term global water occurrence changes mostly without training data borja et al 2020 donchyts et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 however for local studies training data or pre existing knowledge in the spatial distribution of water occurrence can improve prediction and avoid misclassifications misclassifications occur when land cover classes do not correspond to the spectral clusters from unsupervised classification lane et al 2015 for example in deltas with complex structures and diverse vegetation types surface water is likely misclassified as surrounding vegetation or vice versa to develop a time series of water occurrence training large datasets of historical satellite images is unfeasible and undesirable due to the forced coarseness of the data granularity however for the case studies of single deltas time series analysis has fewer requirements and more fine grained spatial and temporal resolutions providing information on the drivers and extent of changes in water occurrence in the deltas we mapped the surface water occurrence in the srd in a time series of 30 m pixel size landsat imagery from 1987 to 2020 the entire spatial extent of images covers 1256 km2 of the area the delta and a section of the lake the classification data analyses were done using envi version 5 5 exelis visual information solutions boulder colorado we used landsat level 2 surface reflectance data from the united states geological survey which provides atmospherically corrected scenes of landsat 4 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli upon request masek et al 2006 vermote et al 2016 in total we obtained 195 images between 1987 and 2020 with less than 10 cloud cover over the scenes of the srd but discarded more than half of the images due to scan line corrector slc errors stripes on the landsat 7 images due to instrument deficiency cloud contamination and geometrical errors other images in winter were also discarded since frozen water generates inaccurate classifications of water surfaces for the 87 remaining images the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference water index ndwi were calculated by applying eq 1 and eq 2 mcfeeters 1996 and stacking with the near infrared nir shortwave infrared swir2 and the blue band for each scene 1 ndvi nir red nir red 2 ndwi green nir green nir the red and green bands represent reflectance in the visible red and the spectrum s visible green bands since the highest reflectance difference between water and vegetation occurs in these bands and indices using their combination in the classifier makes it possible to distinguish open water from the surrounding vegetation and land for example water bodies have 0 5 ndwi 1 and ndvi 1 whereas vegetation has 0 ndwi 0 2 and 0 2 ndvi 1 zhou et al 2017 assessed different indices performance for differentiation of water surfaces and concluded that the ndwi based algorithms such as the one we used here outperform other algorithms therefore the information in the mentioned band index combinations is considered to fulfill our goal of mapping the delta we used the supervised maximum likelihood classification approach to assess the habitats of the srd before the supervised maximum likelihood classifier was applied on the stacked bands we selected the training data of water surface recognition in each image by the visual inspection of the google earth s historical view on the corresponding date and the true color composites of each scene visible red green and blue bands the binary classification for all available images results in class images containing two classes of pixels water equals 1 and non water equals 0 the training dataset used for each classification process has 245 000 pixels 220 km2 which corresponds to 18 of the whole image extent therefore we prepared two sets of the land water dataset one for training the classifier and the other for calculating the confusion matrix and the classification accuracy we chose the land water data sets in similar areas for all images to avoid misinterpretation as long as the delineation borders fitted the water bodies exact true color locations as a result the overall accuracy of classification is higher than 98 table s1 the maximum likelihood supervised classifier is widely applied to satellite imagery for land cover mapping and it provides satisfactory classification accuracy and processing speeds e g bao and ren 2011 guo et al 2017 this algorithm assumes that the pixel classes usually are distributed in the spectral space based on the training data it calculates the probability of a pixel belonging to a specific landcover class c m when the probability p of a pixel with a given value d of belonging to c m is higher than of belonging to another class c n richards 1999 eq 3 3 d c m if p c m d p c n d for all n m 2 3 surface water occurrence and its changes we classified each pixel binarily for each image and date based on the supervised maximum likelihood classifier results either 0 water or 1 not water since the non vegetation dry lands might be misclassified with the pixels identified as water we included the sand bars and other non vegetation dry areas in the training data to avoid this problem we introduce five parameters of water occurrence and explain their calculation in this section 1 the spatial mean of water occurrence over each image scene w s 2 the monthly mean of water occurrence at each pixel w m 3 the mean water occurrence at each pixel for the whole period w 4 the monthly change in water occurrence at each pixel between the two periods 1987 2002 and 2003 2020 δ w and 5 the mean magnitude of change in water occurrence at each pixel between the two periods δ w for the change in water occurrence during the last 33 years we choose equally long periods 16 5 years to portray the long term hydroclimatic changes within the study period and even so this study does not aim to capture interannual changes from year to year as an example zamora et al 2020 and piemontese et al 2019 showed that equal long term periods could be used to understand long term hydroclimatic changes in water resources such as the selenga river and its delta to compare the water occurrence time series with the potential hydrological drivers of change we needed a single value of water occurrence for each image to get that value we spatially averaged the water occurrence of all pixels of each image to obtain the mean water occurrence w s subscript s represents the spatial mean and multiplied by 100 to get the values in percentage 4 w s i 1 r v i j r 100 where v i j is the water occurrence of the i th pixel in the class image j with the total number of pixels r we followed pekel et al 2016 to estimate water occurrence on a given land surface in the srd during the 33 years of 1987 2019 we calculated each pixel s mean of the binary values of all images for that specific pixel leading to a final value between zero and one since not all months had the same number of images available our interpretation of water occurrence is more biased towards the summer and autumn periods that contain more images due to their favorable meteorological conditions for an unbiased analysis we calculated a mean value of water occurrence for each month in each pixel during the same period w m 5 w m j 1 n v i j n where m is the month j is a class image from the total class images available for that specific month n from january 1987 to december 2019 while images taken in the summer and autumn periods have a higher quality and lower presence of clouds images taken during december january february and march were discarded as lake baikal and some parts of delta are covered by ice and snow the mean water occurrence at each pixel and for the whole period w is calculated by averaging the water occurrence of 8 months w m and multiplying by 100 to have the values in percentage as 6 w m 1 n 8 w m n 100 to understand the temporal change in water occurrence for each month of the year δ w m we subtracted the mean w m of the period 1987 2002 w m 1 from that of the period 2003 2020 w m 2 as 7 δ w m w m 2 w m 1 finally the mean magnitude of change in water occurrence δ w per pixel was calculated by averaging the monthly changes of water occurrence δ w m as 8 δ w m 1 n 8 δ w m n as w m ranges from zero to one δ w m and δ w do from 1 to 1 where a value of 1 means no water in any class image in the second period and water in all class images in the first period and vice versa therefore δ w provides information about the expansion and shrinkage of the water surface area and negative and positive values correspond to decreasing and increasing water occurrence respectively 2 4 validation and comparison with previous studies berhane et al 2018 performed three supervised classification methods decision tree rule based and random forest in the srd based on high resolution multispectral imagery of the worldview 2 sensor with 2 meter pixel size in june 2011 they trained and validated their results with 228 field data points to obtain a class image of 22 wetland classes fig 1b and s2 we extracted the water bodies without vegetation or very sparse floating vascular vegetation and made a binary class image of water non water classes we compared this image with the corresponding class image in the same period june 2011 and calculated six accuracy assessment parameters in an area of approximately 140 km2 for 10 000 equally distributed random points i e user s accuracy ua producer s accuracy pa overall accuracy oa f score kappa and matthews correlation coefficient mcc table s2 to emphasize the importance of the training data in binary classification in wetlands with different vegetation types we compare the accuracy of our study with the global study by pekel et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 applied unsupervised expert systems classifiers on historical landsat images on a global scale to obtain water occurrence and its changes during the lifetime of landsat imagery worldwide we downloaded the mean class image of their product in june 2011 via the google earth engine platform and calculated the accuracy assessment measures of their results with respect to the reference class image of berhane et al 2018 finally we compare the change from permanent land to permanent water and vice versa obtained in this study with pekel et al 2016 and donchyts et al 2016 the latter is also based on landsat images long term availability and performs an unsupervised classification based on thresholding ndwi and ndvi with the final product of change from land to water accessible through google earth engine on the users preferences 2 5 hydroclimatic data and landcover map we analyzed four hydrological variables the selenga river s surface runoff the water level in lake baikal suspended sediment concentration ssc in the absence of bedload discharge data and potential evapotranspiration we used daily river discharge 1987 2017 and 10 day ssc 1990 2017 from the russian federal service for hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring roshydromet in the gauging stations closest to the delta mostovoi discharge and ssc and kabansk discharge mostovoi and kabansk stations are located 127 km and 43 km upstream of the delta we also extracted temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data for the region of the srd between 1982 and 2020 from the 0 5 by 0 5 gridded data sets of the cru of the climatic research unit harris et al 2020 for the case of precipitation we used the mean monthly precipitation values of all cells falling in the selenga river hydrological basin upstream of each of the two discharge stations basin area 445 000 km2 to make surface water occurrence and runoff data comparable we calculated the 10 and 5 day averages of runoff data before after and on the images acquisition date and time for lake baikal s water level we used two gauge stations of the international data centre on hydrology of lakes and reservoirs hydrolare from 1963 to 2015 one roughly 60 km southwest of the delta coastal babushkin station and another one 200 km northeast of the delta ushkanij station on the ushkan islands the archipelago on lake baikal together with the processed satellite altimetric data of water level from the hydroweb service available since 1992 and continuously updated crétaux et al 2011 the altimeters used in this dataset are topex poseidon jason jason 2 jason 3 and sentinel 3a and the point of observation is in the middle of the lake and near the ushkanij gauge station which is roughly 200 km away from the delta before 2014 the temporal resolution of this dataset was over 10 days and since 2014 new altimetric satellites provide 1 day resolution water level data we divided the delta into three different regions of analysis d1 river bifurcation d2 central portion and d3 lake ward respectively fig 3 to isolate the effects on water occurrence in the delta of upstream runoff of the selenga river delta and the fluctuations of water level in lake baikal we hypothesize that changes in water occurrence in the lake affect more water occurrence in the outer region d3 and the main channel of the selenga river on the upstream region d1 to analyze the spatial variability of water occurrence we compared water occurrence and its changes between the different land cover ecosystems in the delta i e permanent water bodies seasonally inundated areas wetlands and forests fig 3 we preliminarily assigned a landcover category to each pixel based on their w values pixels with w 80 falling into the permanent water category pixels with w 10 into dry lands and 10 w 80 as seasonal water bodies finally we merged this preliminary water occurrence categorization with the dynamic land cover map of the copernicus global land service at 100 m resolution cgls lc100 buchhorn et al 2019 fig 3 this product obtained via google earth engine has global coverage and its reference year is 2015 3 results 3 1 surface water occurrence and its changes the map of mean water occurrence w fig 4 visualizes the stream network and the areas susceptible to seasonal flooding as expected areas along the coast of lake baikal have a higher water occurrence than inland the change in water occurrence between the two periods δ w fig 5 shows the expansion and shrinkage of the surface water areas attributed to river planform migration newly formed or dried out streams and lakes and the flooding of flood prone areas table s3 and fig s3 show the number of images per month and year used to produce the water occurrence map and its changes in general negative values of δ w orange in fig 5 dominate 51 of the delta s area and are concentrated in the southwest and eastern sections where surface water has decreased mostly however the changes in water occurrence from 1987 2002 to 2003 2020 δ w are within the range 0 2 and 0 1 indicating a slight change in surface water occurrence a first look into the spatial distribution of δ w highlights a decreased water occurrence in the outer sediment banks in lake baikal possibly due to the accumulation of sediments fig 5 decreasing δ w in close vicinity of the main channel and streams bends represents river planform migration visualized in the zoomed panels of figs 4 and 5 m1 and m2 in m1 the change δ w shows the old north eastern direction and new north western direction paths of a river branch due to changes in water occurrence the availability of the images does not allow to determine the day when the change took place however the class images available between 1999 and 2001 show the traces of the newly formed paths m1 instead in panel m2 w is high but still less than that of permanent water bodies signaling the presence of river bends and seasonal water bodies also locations where the magnitude δ w is high in the river network close to 1 or 1 can represent meandering processes leading to oxbow lake formation based on the cgls lc100 landcover map shown in fig 3 we summarized the distribution of w and δ w by landcover fig 6a b the decrease in surface water occurrence is more recurrent and intense in seasonally flooded areas than in permanent water bodies fig 6c table s4 surface water occurrence has changed in 20 and 90 of the pixels of permanent and seasonally flooded areas respectively and 51 over the total extent of the srd in the river channel s permanent water bodies the increasing surface water occurrence near the river bends suggests regular geomorphic channel processes fig 4 green although w in the outer bank of the srd the sand bar near the lake is larger than 60 the negative values of δ w show how sand bars have become wider during the last three decades according to fig 6b the largest decreases in water occurrence can be seen on the sand bar near the lake 0 4 δ w 0 1 water occurrence in closed and open forests with needle leaf trees cfdnl and ofdnl and perennial woody vegetation is less than 10 and relatively constant fig 6a however due to the canopy coverage in these regions and landsat products limitations it is impossible to monitor the surface water below the canopy for the case of the open and closed forest with unknown vegetation types ofn and cfn not matched with any other classes water occurrence is high during the leaf off season and it drops in leaf on months the largest values of w are found in areas covered by herbaceous vegetation herb and shrubs the plants that are less than five meters tall such as the wetland dominated areas close to river banks as they are more susceptible to river overflow fig 6b however farther from river branches the wetland dominated areas are less exposed to the river overflow and thus lower water occurrence is observed due to dense vegetation cover fig 6a although shrub areas see water in more than 60 of the images there are small decreases in the majority of the pixels in these land covers fig 6b therefore we cannot rule out the increase in vegetation as the cause of decreasing water occurrence 3 2 accuracy assessment and comparison between datasets of water occurrence we compared the results of water occurrence from the training data method used here with the data of pekel et al 2016 by six accuracy assessment measures by using the reference class image in june 2011 by berhane et al 2018 the confusion matrices derived from these comparisons are shown in table 1 except for ua table 1 and fig s4 the accuracy assessment indicators show higher accuracy values for this study than pekel et al 2016 overall accuracy kappa f score and mcc of this study are 0 81 0 61 0 79 and 0 62 larger than those of pekel et al 2016 i e 0 73 0 46 0 67 and 0 50 respectively based on the reference image of berhane et al 2018 the number of misclassified pixels in our study covers 6 of the comparison area and in pekel et al 2016 11 in the latter many misclassified pixels occur along the stream branches and their banks affecting the whole period s average water occurrence we downloaded the monthly historical data of pekel et al 2016 in the srd region via google earth engine 418 products between mar 1984 and jan 2020 and high cloud coverage and scan line corrector slc errors of landsat 7 imagery affected 340 images result in many pixels having a no data value in large areas of the delta fig s5 possibly contributing to spatially biased water occurrence in the final averaged map in that study now regarding the long term comparison of water occurrence with the pekel et al 2016 between 1985 1999 and 2000 2015 and donchyts et al 2016 between 1987 2002 and 2003 2020 products pekel et al 2016 show more pronounced changes from water to land fig 7 however the changes from land to water along the river bends and the newly formed river branches with donchyts et al 2016 are less evident in both m1 and m2 than in the other two studies fig 8 therefore the differences between our study and donchyts et al 2016 are negligible furthermore pekel et al 2016 show a smaller difference between the areas where pixels change to permanent land water and those without change fig 7 3 3 relation of water occurrence to hydrological drivers the distributions of mean change in monthly water occurrence δ w m between the periods 1987 2002 and 2003 2020 for all pixels with a change in water occurrence δ w m 0 within the total area of the srd i e d1 d2 d3 are shown in fig 9 judging by the median of the pixels for each month green line in fig 9 w has decreased in all months but october agreeing with a general decrease in the runoff october sees the most significant number of pixels increasing water occurrence when surface runoff is steadily increasing however the increase in water occurrence in october can be partly due to the starting of the leaf off season that the water below vegetation appears in optical images regarding the main hydrological driver of changes in surface water occurrence w s in the srd we find a positive and significant p 0 05 pearson linear relationship between runoff and water occurrence in all three regions and the highest coefficient of determination r 2 0 58 in the mid region d2 fig 10a fig s6 and table 2 the lower r2 in d1 is then since the river is not yet divided into distributaries therefore the streams in d1 are permanent water bodies with high flow rates and consequently the water occurrence irrespective of changes in river discharge does not change much in this region specific extreme changes in water occurrence in the d2 region seem to replicate those in the runoff such as 1995 1998 and 2014 furthermore runoff shows a more pronounced long term decreasing trend than water occurrence regardless of the discharge station selected and different temporal moving windows of r i e instantaneous and 5 day and 10 day averages of r before and after the images acquisition dates regarding sediment the long term decrease in ssc has the same mildly decreasing trend as surface water occurrence fig 10b trend 0 0003 nevertheless the relationship of extremes in ssc to extremes in water occurrence is weak since bedload rather than the suspended load is generally responsible for planform migration as submerged bank areas are characterized by a considerable proportion of well sorted bed material sediment i e sand with a dominant fraction up to 125 µm pietroń et al 2018 this is also supported by the data showing the termination of gravel and sands in delta s bed sediments downstream dong et al 2019 whereas suspended sediment load is changed within 20 30 of the total inflow chalov et al 2017b furthermore the lake water level does not influence surface water occurrence even in region d3 where its effect should be most evident signaling a low influence of the lake s backwater effect fig 10c and fig s7 finally potential evapotranspiration pet appears to have a low influence compared to incoming runoff although pet has had an increasing trend during the last three decades fig 10d the short summer and low solar insolation in the area of the srd weaken the effect of the pet on water occurrence compared to the effect of incoming runoff 4 discussion we found a mild decrease in surface water occurrence in 51 of the srd s surface area between 1987 and 2020 however water occurrence in the delta varies spatially from 1987 2002 to 2003 2020 in the most affected areas decreasing by 20 and in the most water gaining areas increasing by 10 the decrease happened across all regions of the delta d1 d2 and d3 this finding agrees with the general decrease in water occurrence reported for northern siberia during the same period borja et al 2020 where permanent and seasonally flooded areas were also considered borja et al 2020 attributed the decrease in surface water area to decreasing river discharge furthermore the changes in surface water occurrence are not heterogeneous throughout the delta for example the percentage of pixels in the d2 region with decreasing water occurrence in the left sw right ne and central portions of the delta are 44 51 and 52 respectively these results are consistent with chalov et al 2017a who show that maximum sediment aggregation before 1998 occurs in the ne and the central portion of the delta with some water bodies filled recently with sediment and contributing to the expansion of the delta chalov et al 2017a also show higher relative suspended sediment retention in the central portion and the ne of the delta and although the sediment discharge is decreasing in the area the surface of the delta is rising by a velocity of 75 cm year chalov et al 2017a in terms of the longitudinal change of the water occurrence the percentage of the area showing a decrease in water occurrence in regions d1 river bifurcation d2 wetland dominated area and d3 closer to the lake are 41 49 and 45 respectively indicating that water occurrence in wetland dominated areas with low elevations is more influenced by river discharge although our study shows a clear relationship between water occurrence and runoff the relationship should be higher as the selenga river is the only freshwater input into the delta more water discharge brings more sediment loads that lead to a gain in dry surfaces when accumulated it is known that the delta retains 3000 tons day of suspended sediments an amount that outweighs the total flux of sediments to the entire lake chalov et al 2015 however this may not be the case for the srd under the period of study chalov et al 2015 found that during 1983 2011 the correlation factor between the surface runoff and the suspended sediment concentration was only 0 16 chalov et al 2015 moragoda and cohen 2020 furthermore no significant overbank flow has been observed in the flood season after 2011 chalov et al 2015 leading to no flooding from bank overflow reducing an even stronger relationship between the runoff and water occurrence the weak relationship between water occurrence and water level in lake baikal can relate to the regulation of the lake by the irkutsk dam on the main outflow of lake baikal angara river since the irkutsk dam was created in 1959 lake water levels are more homogeneous than before during the last three decades are within half a meter and such changes may not imply considerable changes in water occurrence in the delta our results of water occurrence are also important to understand the biogeochemistry of the delta according to chalov et al 2017b the delta reduces heavy metals concentrations by 77 99 during moderate and high flow conditions furthermore according to the observed 51 decrease of water occurrence seasonally flooded regions have a crucial control on total metal concentrations change due to disconnectivity of smaller wetland dominated channels shinkareva et al 2019 in addition wetlands act as active sinks for various metals depending on the ambient geochemical conditions such as the water ph sediment mineralogy organic matter and oxygen availability pietroń et al 2018 finally in agreement with nienhuis et al 2020 our results show that runoff may be the most important driver controlling water occurrence for coastal deltas with microtidal environments and experiencing minor variations of sea level change however anthropogenic activities such as deforestation and damming may also affect runoff so the real contribution to water occurrence changes in deltas is still subject to climatic and anthropogenic factors 5 conclusions 1 we find a mild decrease in surface water occurrence across 51 of the selenga river delta s extent between 1987 and 2020 however surface water occurrence varies spatially from 1987 2002 to 2003 2020 it decreases by 20 in the most affected areas and increases by 10 in the most water gaining areas the decreasing water occurrence occurs mostly in seasonally flooded regions and the increasing one on the outer bank of the delta on the lake probably land gain by sediment accumulation the most considerable changes in water occurrence are found along the mainstream bends due to planform migration resulting in a change in river course directions in the east of the delta 2 we have improved the standard methodology of determining the change in water occurrence by providing the training data for all available historical images in the maximum likelihood supervised classification on a local scale the training datasets in deltas with complex structures lead to an accurate map of surface water occurrence and its change 3 there is a significant relationship between surface water occurrence and surface runoff r2 0 56 the best fit between these two parameters was observed for the delta s inner zone due to the synchronized peaks in extreme precipitation and runoff in 1987 2020 although the long term trend of surface water occurrence is similar to that of suspended sediment concentration the peaks are not synchronized furthermore surface water occurrence does not correlate with the lake water level and potential evapotranspiration the change in water occurrence between 1987 2002 and 2003 2020 shows channel platforms and stream network change the bend migration and avulsion identified here illustrate in channel processes happening at the local scale channel bends due to the evolution of the delta structure partitioning of water between sectors however the srd has shown a relatively stable long term surface water occurrence under decreasing precipitation and runoff and increasing temperature during the last four decades we expect that any modification of the river flow through upstream damming and water diversion compounded by climate change will impact water occurrence in the future funding the swedish national

8094,study region selenga river delta srd russia study focus how is water occurrence changing in the srd and what are the hydroclimatic drivers behind these changes the presence of water on the surface in river deltas is governed by land use geomorphology and the flux of water to and from the delta we trained an accurate image classification of the landsat satellite imagery during the last 33 years to quantify surface water occurrence and its changes in the srd after comparing our estimations with global scale datasets we determined the hydrological drivers of these changes new hydrological insights for the region we find mild decreases in water occurrence in 51 of the srd s surface area from 1987 2002 to 2003 2020 water occurrence in the most affected areas decreased by 20 and in the most water gaining areas increased by 10 we find a significant relationship between water occurrence and runoff r2 0 56 that does not exist between water occurrence and suspended sediment concentration ssc lake baikal s water level and potential evapotranspiration the time series of water occurrence follows the peaks in the runoff but not its long term trend however the extremes in ssc do not influence surface water occurrence r2 0 1 although their long term trends are similar contrary to expected we find that the delta has a relatively stable long term water availability for the

freshwater storage pollutant retention and attenuation recreational activities flood control and fishing day et al 2019 they also help to achieve sustainable development jaramillo et al 2019 despite their importance in providing these services they are under pressure from human activities and the effects of human induced climate change day et al 2019 lin et al 2017 wu et al 2020 zhou et al 2018 upstream water impoundment and regulation decrease sediment discharge and flatten runoff peaks necessary for hydraulic flushing and wetland sheet flow syvitski et al 2009 wu et al 2020 water extraction excessive groundwater use and methane extraction have led to decreased incoming water flows sediment compaction and subsidence in deltas throughout the world giosan et al 2014 giesen 2020 and nienhuis et al 2020 emphasize that local focus on deltas with a large set of ecosystem services is necessary to understand and manage deltas hydrological and morphological changes change in surface water occurrence can be the response of anthropogenic and climatic drivers in deltas surface water occurrence is defined as the presence of water at a specific location on the surface and at a particular time for the particular case of deltas water occurrence can be permanent in open water areas such as main river channels streams and in stream wetlands or temporary such as sandbanks flooded wetlands and floodplains apart from the direct effects of human activities water occurrence changes are also driven by in stream hydraulics fluvial geomorphologic processes and sediment transport therefore understanding changes in hydrological connectivity and patchiness resulting from the spatial and temporal distribution of surface water occurrence is relevant for the conservation of deltaic ecosystems cui et al 2020 the change in surface water occurrence is spatially heterogeneous and its direction of change loss or gain is case specific borja et al 2020 while global scale studies are very relevant for assessing changes in surface water resources at large scales e g donchyts et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 they may miss a detailed understanding of local and case specific changes in water occurrence furthermore most studies of changes in water occurrence do not focus on identifying the most relevant hydrological drivers of change for instance water occurrence changes in a delta may be related to the main river s incoming water and sediment discharge evapotranspiration from the surface water or changing tides we here perform an analysis of change in water occurrence between 1987 2002 and 2003 2020 in the selenga river delta srd a lacustrine delta covering 540 km2 the delta plays a vital hydrological role for lake baikal for example the srd acts as an active sink of various metals reducing 77 99 concentrations during moderate and high flow conditions chalov et al 2017b shinkareva et al 2019 also showed that seasonally flooded regions control the total metal concentrations flowing into lake baikal hence assessing changes in water occurrence in the delta serves as a diagnostic of these hydrological functions severe droughts during the last two decades in mongolia and transbaikalia have decreased the discharge of the selenga river antokhina et al 2019 frolova et al 2017 with potential changes in water occurrence within the delta our primary research question is how is water occurrence changing in the selenga river delta and what are the hydroclimatic drivers behind these changes we aim to determine the magnitude of change in water occurrence in the delta over more than 30 years and relate these changes with the hydroclimatic fluxes and processes that regulate water availability in the delta including the runoff and sediment concentration in selenga river hydrological basin evapotranspiration and water level changes in the lake baikal satellite observations are valuable sources to understand changes in water occurrence allen and pavelsky 2018 borja et al 2020 chini et al 2017 donchyts et al 2016 guo et al 2017 pekel et al 2016 zhang et al 2017 with more than 35 years of medium resolution acquisitions the landsat project is a convenient source of optical imagery to monitor water occurrence changes with even several images available per month for specific deltas in addition advanced computational algorithms and cloud based platforms enable processing large amounts of data in relatively short periods providing a high spatial resolution of changes to answer the research question we specifically train the landsat data to detect a more case specific representation of water occurrence within the delta generate a time series of change in water occurrence and compare our results against already available global datasets of water occurrence that do not train the data the two hypotheses driving the study are 1 changes in water occurrence in the selenga river delta follow runoff oscillations occurring during the last 30 years as in other deltas worldwide 2 a direct relationship between water occurrence in the delta and runoff and suspended sediment concentration is more evident than with evapotranspiration and lake baikal water level as the lake water level is regulated by irkutsk dam on the main outflow of lake baikal angara river since 1959 and evapotranspiration from the delta is low 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the selenga river delta is located in eastern russia fig 1 along lake baikal s southern shore out of around 365 other rivers the selenga river is the main river flowing into lake baikal it is responsible for almost 50 of the runoff water and 60 of the transported sediments into the lake system and its hydrological basin covers more than 82 of the lake s basin potemkina 2004 the srd s unique habitats and ecosystem services have made this delta a ramsar wetland of international importance berhane et al 2018 lane et al 2015 the delta covers 540 km2 and receives 315 mm of annual precipitation concentrated from april to october causing floods and freshets in the main channel and tributaries the continental climate is described by temperature variations between 14 on average in july and 19 in january with a growing season of around 150 days starts in mid may fig s1 berhane et al 2018 lane et al 2015 precipitation and runoff in the selenga river basin have decreased from the highest reported peak in 1992 to its lowest between 2004 and 2008 fig 2a air temperature in the srd increased to the highest mean annual values in 2016 and 2017 fig 2b being a lacustrine river delta changes in water occurrence in this delta are not related to rising sea levels instead changes in the selenga river discharge and lake baikal water level are related to hydroclimatic data antokhina et al 2019 and fluvial geomorphological processes pietroń et al 2018 dong et al 2019 shinkareva et al 2019 the selenga river faces several socioeconomic and environmental impacts influencing lake baikal borisova 2019 the anthropogenic impact on ecosystems in the selenga river basin has increased in the recent decades e g by the extraction of minerals primarily gold urbanization and agricultural development especially in the upper mongolian part of the basin jarsjö et al 2017 garmaev et al 2019 the long term low water period observed in the region gelfan and millionshchikova 2018 has a significant impact on delta processes and wetland dominated areas of the srd also posing drastic changes in sediment transport and water quality chalov et al 2017b shinkareva et al 2019 2 2 satellite data and classification unsupervised classification methodologies can determine long term global water occurrence changes mostly without training data borja et al 2020 donchyts et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 however for local studies training data or pre existing knowledge in the spatial distribution of water occurrence can improve prediction and avoid misclassifications misclassifications occur when land cover classes do not correspond to the spectral clusters from unsupervised classification lane et al 2015 for example in deltas with complex structures and diverse vegetation types surface water is likely misclassified as surrounding vegetation or vice versa to develop a time series of water occurrence training large datasets of historical satellite images is unfeasible and undesirable due to the forced coarseness of the data granularity however for the case studies of single deltas time series analysis has fewer requirements and more fine grained spatial and temporal resolutions providing information on the drivers and extent of changes in water occurrence in the deltas we mapped the surface water occurrence in the srd in a time series of 30 m pixel size landsat imagery from 1987 to 2020 the entire spatial extent of images covers 1256 km2 of the area the delta and a section of the lake the classification data analyses were done using envi version 5 5 exelis visual information solutions boulder colorado we used landsat level 2 surface reflectance data from the united states geological survey which provides atmospherically corrected scenes of landsat 4 5 tm 7 etm and 8 oli upon request masek et al 2006 vermote et al 2016 in total we obtained 195 images between 1987 and 2020 with less than 10 cloud cover over the scenes of the srd but discarded more than half of the images due to scan line corrector slc errors stripes on the landsat 7 images due to instrument deficiency cloud contamination and geometrical errors other images in winter were also discarded since frozen water generates inaccurate classifications of water surfaces for the 87 remaining images the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and normalized difference water index ndwi were calculated by applying eq 1 and eq 2 mcfeeters 1996 and stacking with the near infrared nir shortwave infrared swir2 and the blue band for each scene 1 ndvi nir red nir red 2 ndwi green nir green nir the red and green bands represent reflectance in the visible red and the spectrum s visible green bands since the highest reflectance difference between water and vegetation occurs in these bands and indices using their combination in the classifier makes it possible to distinguish open water from the surrounding vegetation and land for example water bodies have 0 5 ndwi 1 and ndvi 1 whereas vegetation has 0 ndwi 0 2 and 0 2 ndvi 1 zhou et al 2017 assessed different indices performance for differentiation of water surfaces and concluded that the ndwi based algorithms such as the one we used here outperform other algorithms therefore the information in the mentioned band index combinations is considered to fulfill our goal of mapping the delta we used the supervised maximum likelihood classification approach to assess the habitats of the srd before the supervised maximum likelihood classifier was applied on the stacked bands we selected the training data of water surface recognition in each image by the visual inspection of the google earth s historical view on the corresponding date and the true color composites of each scene visible red green and blue bands the binary classification for all available images results in class images containing two classes of pixels water equals 1 and non water equals 0 the training dataset used for each classification process has 245 000 pixels 220 km2 which corresponds to 18 of the whole image extent therefore we prepared two sets of the land water dataset one for training the classifier and the other for calculating the confusion matrix and the classification accuracy we chose the land water data sets in similar areas for all images to avoid misinterpretation as long as the delineation borders fitted the water bodies exact true color locations as a result the overall accuracy of classification is higher than 98 table s1 the maximum likelihood supervised classifier is widely applied to satellite imagery for land cover mapping and it provides satisfactory classification accuracy and processing speeds e g bao and ren 2011 guo et al 2017 this algorithm assumes that the pixel classes usually are distributed in the spectral space based on the training data it calculates the probability of a pixel belonging to a specific landcover class c m when the probability p of a pixel with a given value d of belonging to c m is higher than of belonging to another class c n richards 1999 eq 3 3 d c m if p c m d p c n d for all n m 2 3 surface water occurrence and its changes we classified each pixel binarily for each image and date based on the supervised maximum likelihood classifier results either 0 water or 1 not water since the non vegetation dry lands might be misclassified with the pixels identified as water we included the sand bars and other non vegetation dry areas in the training data to avoid this problem we introduce five parameters of water occurrence and explain their calculation in this section 1 the spatial mean of water occurrence over each image scene w s 2 the monthly mean of water occurrence at each pixel w m 3 the mean water occurrence at each pixel for the whole period w 4 the monthly change in water occurrence at each pixel between the two periods 1987 2002 and 2003 2020 δ w and 5 the mean magnitude of change in water occurrence at each pixel between the two periods δ w for the change in water occurrence during the last 33 years we choose equally long periods 16 5 years to portray the long term hydroclimatic changes within the study period and even so this study does not aim to capture interannual changes from year to year as an example zamora et al 2020 and piemontese et al 2019 showed that equal long term periods could be used to understand long term hydroclimatic changes in water resources such as the selenga river and its delta to compare the water occurrence time series with the potential hydrological drivers of change we needed a single value of water occurrence for each image to get that value we spatially averaged the water occurrence of all pixels of each image to obtain the mean water occurrence w s subscript s represents the spatial mean and multiplied by 100 to get the values in percentage 4 w s i 1 r v i j r 100 where v i j is the water occurrence of the i th pixel in the class image j with the total number of pixels r we followed pekel et al 2016 to estimate water occurrence on a given land surface in the srd during the 33 years of 1987 2019 we calculated each pixel s mean of the binary values of all images for that specific pixel leading to a final value between zero and one since not all months had the same number of images available our interpretation of water occurrence is more biased towards the summer and autumn periods that contain more images due to their favorable meteorological conditions for an unbiased analysis we calculated a mean value of water occurrence for each month in each pixel during the same period w m 5 w m j 1 n v i j n where m is the month j is a class image from the total class images available for that specific month n from january 1987 to december 2019 while images taken in the summer and autumn periods have a higher quality and lower presence of clouds images taken during december january february and march were discarded as lake baikal and some parts of delta are covered by ice and snow the mean water occurrence at each pixel and for the whole period w is calculated by averaging the water occurrence of 8 months w m and multiplying by 100 to have the values in percentage as 6 w m 1 n 8 w m n 100 to understand the temporal change in water occurrence for each month of the year δ w m we subtracted the mean w m of the period 1987 2002 w m 1 from that of the period 2003 2020 w m 2 as 7 δ w m w m 2 w m 1 finally the mean magnitude of change in water occurrence δ w per pixel was calculated by averaging the monthly changes of water occurrence δ w m as 8 δ w m 1 n 8 δ w m n as w m ranges from zero to one δ w m and δ w do from 1 to 1 where a value of 1 means no water in any class image in the second period and water in all class images in the first period and vice versa therefore δ w provides information about the expansion and shrinkage of the water surface area and negative and positive values correspond to decreasing and increasing water occurrence respectively 2 4 validation and comparison with previous studies berhane et al 2018 performed three supervised classification methods decision tree rule based and random forest in the srd based on high resolution multispectral imagery of the worldview 2 sensor with 2 meter pixel size in june 2011 they trained and validated their results with 228 field data points to obtain a class image of 22 wetland classes fig 1b and s2 we extracted the water bodies without vegetation or very sparse floating vascular vegetation and made a binary class image of water non water classes we compared this image with the corresponding class image in the same period june 2011 and calculated six accuracy assessment parameters in an area of approximately 140 km2 for 10 000 equally distributed random points i e user s accuracy ua producer s accuracy pa overall accuracy oa f score kappa and matthews correlation coefficient mcc table s2 to emphasize the importance of the training data in binary classification in wetlands with different vegetation types we compare the accuracy of our study with the global study by pekel et al 2016 pekel et al 2016 applied unsupervised expert systems classifiers on historical landsat images on a global scale to obtain water occurrence and its changes during the lifetime of landsat imagery worldwide we downloaded the mean class image of their product in june 2011 via the google earth engine platform and calculated the accuracy assessment measures of their results with respect to the reference class image of berhane et al 2018 finally we compare the change from permanent land to permanent water and vice versa obtained in this study with pekel et al 2016 and donchyts et al 2016 the latter is also based on landsat images long term availability and performs an unsupervised classification based on thresholding ndwi and ndvi with the final product of change from land to water accessible through google earth engine on the users preferences 2 5 hydroclimatic data and landcover map we analyzed four hydrological variables the selenga river s surface runoff the water level in lake baikal suspended sediment concentration ssc in the absence of bedload discharge data and potential evapotranspiration we used daily river discharge 1987 2017 and 10 day ssc 1990 2017 from the russian federal service for hydrometeorology and environmental monitoring roshydromet in the gauging stations closest to the delta mostovoi discharge and ssc and kabansk discharge mostovoi and kabansk stations are located 127 km and 43 km upstream of the delta we also extracted temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data for the region of the srd between 1982 and 2020 from the 0 5 by 0 5 gridded data sets of the cru of the climatic research unit harris et al 2020 for the case of precipitation we used the mean monthly precipitation values of all cells falling in the selenga river hydrological basin upstream of each of the two discharge stations basin area 445 000 km2 to make surface water occurrence and runoff data comparable we calculated the 10 and 5 day averages of runoff data before after and on the images acquisition date and time for lake baikal s water level we used two gauge stations of the international data centre on hydrology of lakes and reservoirs hydrolare from 1963 to 2015 one roughly 60 km southwest of the delta coastal babushkin station and another one 200 km northeast of the delta ushkanij station on the ushkan islands the archipelago on lake baikal together with the processed satellite altimetric data of water level from the hydroweb service available since 1992 and continuously updated crétaux et al 2011 the altimeters used in this dataset are topex poseidon jason jason 2 jason 3 and sentinel 3a and the point of observation is in the middle of the lake and near the ushkanij gauge station which is roughly 200 km away from the delta before 2014 the temporal resolution of this dataset was over 10 days and since 2014 new altimetric satellites provide 1 day resolution water level data we divided the delta into three different regions of analysis d1 river bifurcation d2 central portion and d3 lake ward respectively fig 3 to isolate the effects on water occurrence in the delta of upstream runoff of the selenga river delta and the fluctuations of water level in lake baikal we hypothesize that changes in water occurrence in the lake affect more water occurrence in the outer region d3 and the main channel of the selenga river on the upstream region d1 to analyze the spatial variability of water occurrence we compared water occurrence and its changes between the different land cover ecosystems in the delta i e permanent water bodies seasonally inundated areas wetlands and forests fig 3 we preliminarily assigned a landcover category to each pixel based on their w values pixels with w 80 falling into the permanent water category pixels with w 10 into dry lands and 10 w 80 as seasonal water bodies finally we merged this preliminary water occurrence categorization with the dynamic land cover map of the copernicus global land service at 100 m resolution cgls lc100 buchhorn et al 2019 fig 3 this product obtained via google earth engine has global coverage and its reference year is 2015 3 results 3 1 surface water occurrence and its changes the map of mean water occurrence w fig 4 visualizes the stream network and the areas susceptible to seasonal flooding as expected areas along the coast of lake baikal have a higher water occurrence than inland the change in water occurrence between the two periods δ w fig 5 shows the expansion and shrinkage of the surface water areas attributed to river planform migration newly formed or dried out streams and lakes and the flooding of flood prone areas table s3 and fig s3 show the number of images per month and year used to produce the water occurrence map and its changes in general negative values of δ w orange in fig 5 dominate 51 of the delta s area and are concentrated in the southwest and eastern sections where surface water has decreased mostly however the changes in water occurrence from 1987 2002 to 2003 2020 δ w are within the range 0 2 and 0 1 indicating a slight change in surface water occurrence a first look into the spatial distribution of δ w highlights a decreased water occurrence in the outer sediment banks in lake baikal possibly due to the accumulation of sediments fig 5 decreasing δ w in close vicinity of the main channel and streams bends represents river planform migration visualized in the zoomed panels of figs 4 and 5 m1 and m2 in m1 the change δ w shows the old north eastern direction and new north western direction paths of a river branch due to changes in water occurrence the availability of the images does not allow to determine the day when the change took place however the class images available between 1999 and 2001 show the traces of the newly formed paths m1 instead in panel m2 w is high but still less than that of permanent water bodies signaling the presence of river bends and seasonal water bodies also locations where the magnitude δ w is high in the river network close to 1 or 1 can represent meandering processes leading to oxbow lake formation based on the cgls lc100 landcover map shown in fig 3 we summarized the distribution of w and δ w by landcover fig 6a b the decrease in surface water occurrence is more recurrent and intense in seasonally flooded areas than in permanent water bodies fig 6c table s4 surface water occurrence has changed in 20 and 90 of the pixels of permanent and seasonally flooded areas respectively and 51 over the total extent of the srd in the river channel s permanent water bodies the increasing surface water occurrence near the river bends suggests regular geomorphic channel processes fig 4 green although w in the outer bank of the srd the sand bar near the lake is larger than 60 the negative values of δ w show how sand bars have become wider during the last three decades according to fig 6b the largest decreases in water occurrence can be seen on the sand bar near the lake 0 4 δ w 0 1 water occurrence in closed and open forests with needle leaf trees cfdnl and ofdnl and perennial woody vegetation is less than 10 and relatively constant fig 6a however due to the canopy coverage in these regions and landsat products limitations it is impossible to monitor the surface water below the canopy for the case of the open and closed forest with unknown vegetation types ofn and cfn not matched with any other classes water occurrence is high during the leaf off season and it drops in leaf on months the largest values of w are found in areas covered by herbaceous vegetation herb and shrubs the plants that are less than five meters tall such as the wetland dominated areas close to river banks as they are more susceptible to river overflow fig 6b however farther from river branches the wetland dominated areas are less exposed to the river overflow and thus lower water occurrence is observed due to dense vegetation cover fig 6a although shrub areas see water in more than 60 of the images there are small decreases in the majority of the pixels in these land covers fig 6b therefore we cannot rule out the increase in vegetation as the cause of decreasing water occurrence 3 2 accuracy assessment and comparison between datasets of water occurrence we compared the results of water occurrence from the training data method used here with the data of pekel et al 2016 by six accuracy assessment measures by using the reference class image in june 2011 by berhane et al 2018 the confusion matrices derived from these comparisons are shown in table 1 except for ua table 1 and fig s4 the accuracy assessment indicators show higher accuracy values for this study than pekel et al 2016 overall accuracy kappa f score and mcc of this study are 0 81 0 61 0 79 and 0 62 larger than those of pekel et al 2016 i e 0 73 0 46 0 67 and 0 50 respectively based on the reference image of berhane et al 2018 the number of misclassified pixels in our study covers 6 of the comparison area and in pekel et al 2016 11 in the latter many misclassified pixels occur along the stream branches and their banks affecting the whole period s average water occurrence we downloaded the monthly historical data of pekel et al 2016 in the srd region via google earth engine 418 products between mar 1984 and jan 2020 and high cloud coverage and scan line corrector slc errors of landsat 7 imagery affected 340 images result in many pixels having a no data value in large areas of the delta fig s5 possibly contributing to spatially biased water occurrence in the final averaged map in that study now regarding the long term comparison of water occurrence with the pekel et al 2016 between 1985 1999 and 2000 2015 and donchyts et al 2016 between 1987 2002 and 2003 2020 products pekel et al 2016 show more pronounced changes from water to land fig 7 however the changes from land to water along the river bends and the newly formed river branches with donchyts et al 2016 are less evident in both m1 and m2 than in the other two studies fig 8 therefore the differences between our study and donchyts et al 2016 are negligible furthermore pekel et al 2016 show a smaller difference between the areas where pixels change to permanent land water and those without change fig 7 3 3 relation of water occurrence to hydrological drivers the distributions of mean change in monthly water occurrence δ w m between the periods 1987 2002 and 2003 2020 for all pixels with a change in water occurrence δ w m 0 within the total area of the srd i e d1 d2 d3 are shown in fig 9 judging by the median of the pixels for each month green line in fig 9 w has decreased in all months but october agreeing with a general decrease in the runoff october sees the most significant number of pixels increasing water occurrence when surface runoff is steadily increasing however the increase in water occurrence in october can be partly due to the starting of the leaf off season that the water below vegetation appears in optical images regarding the main hydrological driver of changes in surface water occurrence w s in the srd we find a positive and significant p 0 05 pearson linear relationship between runoff and water occurrence in all three regions and the highest coefficient of determination r 2 0 58 in the mid region d2 fig 10a fig s6 and table 2 the lower r2 in d1 is then since the river is not yet divided into distributaries therefore the streams in d1 are permanent water bodies with high flow rates and consequently the water occurrence irrespective of changes in river discharge does not change much in this region specific extreme changes in water occurrence in the d2 region seem to replicate those in the runoff such as 1995 1998 and 2014 furthermore runoff shows a more pronounced long term decreasing trend than water occurrence regardless of the discharge station selected and different temporal moving windows of r i e instantaneous and 5 day and 10 day averages of r before and after the images acquisition dates regarding sediment the long term decrease in ssc has the same mildly decreasing trend as surface water occurrence fig 10b trend 0 0003 nevertheless the relationship of extremes in ssc to extremes in water occurrence is weak since bedload rather than the suspended load is generally responsible for planform migration as submerged bank areas are characterized by a considerable proportion of well sorted bed material sediment i e sand with a dominant fraction up to 125 µm pietroń et al 2018 this is also supported by the data showing the termination of gravel and sands in delta s bed sediments downstream dong et al 2019 whereas suspended sediment load is changed within 20 30 of the total inflow chalov et al 2017b furthermore the lake water level does not influence surface water occurrence even in region d3 where its effect should be most evident signaling a low influence of the lake s backwater effect fig 10c and fig s7 finally potential evapotranspiration pet appears to have a low influence compared to incoming runoff although pet has had an increasing trend during the last three decades fig 10d the short summer and low solar insolation in the area of the srd weaken the effect of the pet on water occurrence compared to the effect of incoming runoff 4 discussion we found a mild decrease in surface water occurrence in 51 of the srd s surface area between 1987 and 2020 however water occurrence in the delta varies spatially from 1987 2002 to 2003 2020 in the most affected areas decreasing by 20 and in the most water gaining areas increasing by 10 the decrease happened across all regions of the delta d1 d2 and d3 this finding agrees with the general decrease in water occurrence reported for northern siberia during the same period borja et al 2020 where permanent and seasonally flooded areas were also considered borja et al 2020 attributed the decrease in surface water area to decreasing river discharge furthermore the changes in surface water occurrence are not heterogeneous throughout the delta for example the percentage of pixels in the d2 region with decreasing water occurrence in the left sw right ne and central portions of the delta are 44 51 and 52 respectively these results are consistent with chalov et al 2017a who show that maximum sediment aggregation before 1998 occurs in the ne and the central portion of the delta with some water bodies filled recently with sediment and contributing to the expansion of the delta chalov et al 2017a also show higher relative suspended sediment retention in the central portion and the ne of the delta and although the sediment discharge is decreasing in the area the surface of the delta is rising by a velocity of 75 cm year chalov et al 2017a in terms of the longitudinal change of the water occurrence the percentage of the area showing a decrease in water occurrence in regions d1 river bifurcation d2 wetland dominated area and d3 closer to the lake are 41 49 and 45 respectively indicating that water occurrence in wetland dominated areas with low elevations is more influenced by river discharge although our study shows a clear relationship between water occurrence and runoff the relationship should be higher as the selenga river is the only freshwater input into the delta more water discharge brings more sediment loads that lead to a gain in dry surfaces when accumulated it is known that the delta retains 3000 tons day of suspended sediments an amount that outweighs the total flux of sediments to the entire lake chalov et al 2015 however this may not be the case for the srd under the period of study chalov et al 2015 found that during 1983 2011 the correlation factor between the surface runoff and the suspended sediment concentration was only 0 16 chalov et al 2015 moragoda and cohen 2020 furthermore no significant overbank flow has been observed in the flood season after 2011 chalov et al 2015 leading to no flooding from bank overflow reducing an even stronger relationship between the runoff and water occurrence the weak relationship between water occurrence and water level in lake baikal can relate to the regulation of the lake by the irkutsk dam on the main outflow of lake baikal angara river since the irkutsk dam was created in 1959 lake water levels are more homogeneous than before during the last three decades are within half a meter and such changes may not imply considerable changes in water occurrence in the delta our results of water occurrence are also important to understand the biogeochemistry of the delta according to chalov et al 2017b the delta reduces heavy metals concentrations by 77 99 during moderate and high flow conditions furthermore according to the observed 51 decrease of water occurrence seasonally flooded regions have a crucial control on total metal concentrations change due to disconnectivity of smaller wetland dominated channels shinkareva et al 2019 in addition wetlands act as active sinks for various metals depending on the ambient geochemical conditions such as the water ph sediment mineralogy organic matter and oxygen availability pietroń et al 2018 finally in agreement with nienhuis et al 2020 our results show that runoff may be the most important driver controlling water occurrence for coastal deltas with microtidal environments and experiencing minor variations of sea level change however anthropogenic activities such as deforestation and damming may also affect runoff so the real contribution to water occurrence changes in deltas is still subject to climatic and anthropogenic factors 5 conclusions 1 we find a mild decrease in surface water occurrence across 51 of the selenga river delta s extent between 1987 and 2020 however surface water occurrence varies spatially from 1987 2002 to 2003 2020 it decreases by 20 in the most affected areas and increases by 10 in the most water gaining areas the decreasing water occurrence occurs mostly in seasonally flooded regions and the increasing one on the outer bank of the delta on the lake probably land gain by sediment accumulation the most considerable changes in water occurrence are found along the mainstream bends due to planform migration resulting in a change in river course directions in the east of the delta 2 we have improved the standard methodology of determining the change in water occurrence by providing the training data for all available historical images in the maximum likelihood supervised classification on a local scale the training datasets in deltas with complex structures lead to an accurate map of surface water occurrence and its change 3 there is a significant relationship between surface water occurrence and surface runoff r2 0 56 the best fit between these two parameters was observed for the delta s inner zone due to the synchronized peaks in extreme precipitation and runoff in 1987 2020 although the long term trend of surface water occurrence is similar to that of suspended sediment concentration the peaks are not synchronized furthermore surface water occurrence does not correlate with the lake water level and potential evapotranspiration the change in water occurrence between 1987 2002 and 2003 2020 shows channel platforms and stream network change the bend migration and avulsion identified here illustrate in channel processes happening at the local scale channel bends due to the evolution of the delta structure partitioning of water between sectors however the srd has shown a relatively stable long term surface water occurrence under decreasing precipitation and runoff and increasing temperature during the last four decades we expect that any modification of the river flow through upstream damming and water diversion compounded by climate change will impact water occurrence in the future funding the swedish national
