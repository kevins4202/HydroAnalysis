23220,ship turning motion is an important part of ship maneuverability and is directly related to the safety of the ship sailing at sea ships experience a certain amount of rolling and heeling during turning the rolling and heeling caused by turning and waves can be large enough to affect the ability of ships to perform their missions fin stabilizers are currently added to ship designs for the primary purpose of producing roll canceling moments during ordinary operation the present work aims to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on ship roll reduction control during turning motion the 6 dof mathematical model of a multipurpose navy vessel as well as the models of forces and moments caused by hydrodynamic propeller rudder fins and waves are established in matlab based on the simulation analysis of ship turning motion with and without fin stabilizers a miga based improved pid controller is developed the simulation results of ship roll control during turns using the miga pid controller are compared with the results of zn pid and lqr controllers simulation results show that fin stabilizers are also effective for roll reduction control during ship turns with an appropriate controller and the present developed miga pid controller can be a practical choice keywords fin stabilizer roll stabilization ship turning pid miga 1 introduction when ship sails across the sea it always tries to keep straight sailing at a certain speed to reduce the time it takes to reach the destination and the fuel it consumes perez 2005 jin and yao 2013 however when there are obstacles or other ships in its original course the ship must change its course to avoid the incoming threats the vast majority of ships rely upon one or more vertically oriented rudders to accomplish all maneuvers martin 2003 to turn a ship a rudder need only produce forces and moments large enough to generate rotation about the ship s vertical axis in the intended direction however water flowing across an angled rudder also generates roll or rotation about the ship s longitudinal axis as the location of rudders are always below the horizontal plane the center of gravity located taggart 1970 carley and duberley 1972 motivated by this phenomenon various schemes for taking advantage of the roll moment generated by an angled rudder have been proposed and implemented such as the rudder roll reduction van amerongen et al 1990 roberts et al 1999 fang and luo 2007 and the fin rudder roll stabilization whyte 1979 sharif and roberts 2005 jerrold and michael 1999 hiroyuki and takashi 2004 roberts et al 2006 in some situations the ship has to conduct emergency turn to avoid incoming threats to turn the ship in time the rudder is usually set to a large angle and remains constant during the turn jin and yao 2013 the ship initially heels inwards and then rolls around its longitudinal axis before attaining a steady outward heel angle as it enters the turn son and nomoto 1981 increasing either the rudder deflection angle or ship s surge velocity tends to increase the magnitude of roll produced lewis 1989 large roll angles lead to motion sickness cargo damage operation interruption and even ship capsizing liang et al 2017 in warships the motions may be serious enough to curtail helicopter excursions from the deck and degrade performance of weapons systems and radars martin 2003 therefore it is necessary to reduce the roll motion during ship turns fin stabilizers are the world most effective active anti rolling device their anti rolling effect at high speeds can be up to 90 in theory sellars and martin 1992 fin stabilizers are mounted in pairs on both sides of the hull at fixed angles with respect to the transverse plane of the ship and rotated through angles of equal magnitude and opposite directions about their spanwise axis the primary goal of designing and optimizing fin stabilizers is to obtain the maximum anti rolling moment during ordinary operation so far almost all the papers related to fin stabilizers focus on the primary goal of designing optimizing and controlling fin stabilizers to obtain the maximum anti rolling moment to reduce ship roll motion during normal straight navigation few papers have been published to research the effect of fin stabilizers on ship s turning performance martin 2003 wang 2013 the purpose of this paper is to

roberts et al 1999 cao and lee 2003 sliding mode control mcgookin et al 2000 fang and luo 2007 and robust model predictive control ghaemi et al 2009 have been developed and applied to the controller design of fin stabilizers among them the pid controller may be the most extensively applied one in practical application for its high reliability and strong robustness in this paper an improved pid controller is developed to control the fin stabilizers to reduce ship roll motion during turns however the control parameters of pid controller are usually determined based on the experience of operators trial and error method or experiments which might not be the optimal fang et al 2010 genetic algorithm ga recently has received some attention for these problems and can be used to promote the efficiency of the controller fang and luo 2007 gupta et al 2018 genetic algorithm reflects many advantages such as simple currency strong robustness and suitable for parallel processing goldberg 1989 hu et al 2014 but there are still some practical issues such as poor local search premature convergence slow convergence rate chen and lin 2004 thus it is necessary to make an improvement and the multi island genetic algorithm miga is adopted in this paper to optimize the control parameters for the improved pid controller the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 establishes the mathematical models of 6 dof ship motion and the forces and moments of hydrodynamic propeller rudder fin stabilizer and disturbance section 3 simulates and analyzes ship s turning motion in calm water with and without fin stabilizers and verifies the established mathematical model section 4 gives the controller design and miga based control parameter optimization section 5 is the results and discussion finally the conclusion is given 2 ship modeling a ship in a seaway moves in six degrees of freedom as shown in fig 1 two type of reference frames the inertial frames and body fixed frames are used to describe its motion in the modeling of ship motion the ship is usually considered as a rigid body and the ship motion model can be obtained according to newton law abkowitz 1964 the 6 dof ship motions are mutually coupled with different coupling strength the mathematical model of ship motion can be simplified according to the coupling strength and specific research purpose this paper aims to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on ship roll reduction control during ship turning therefore the mathematical model of ship motion in surge sway roll and yaw is needed the pitch and heave are also considered as the effect of pitch attitude in damping and the high coupling between pitch and heave therefore the 6 dof mathematical model of ship motion is established as follows perez

forces and moments acting on the ship can be decomposed as follows 2 f e f e h f e p f e r f e f f e e m t m t h m t p m t r m t f m t e where subscripts h p r f e represent forces and moments caused by the hydrodynamic propeller rudder fin stabilizer and environment disturbance respectively 2 1 hydrodynamic forces and moments the hydrodynamic forces and moments are related to the characteristics and movement state of the hull as well as the characteristics of the fluid in the area of the sailing using the method of abkowitz 1969 the hydrodynamic forces and moments in six degrees of freedom can be expressed as unknown nonlinear functions of position velocity and acceleration perform the taylor series expansion at the equilibrium point and ignore the higher order hydrodynamic coefficients norrbin 1970 perez and blanke 2002 fang et al 2010 we can get 3 x h x u u x u u u u x v r v r y h y v v y p p y r r y u v u v y u r u r y v v v v y v r v r y r v r v y φ u v φ u v y φ u r φ u r y φ u

naval vessel is selected as the research object and the detailed hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to surge sway roll and yaw obtained from rpmm model test can be found in perez and blanke 2002 the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to pitch and heave can be calculated according to the strip theory suggested by salvesen et al 1970 2 2 propeller forces and moments propeller is the propulsion device of the ship the complex structure and hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller make it difficult to be modeled accurately take into account that the turning motion is always performed at a certain sailing speed it can be considered that the propulsive force t p r o p generated by the propeller before the turning motion is equal to the ship resistance x r e s i s t i v e assuming that the propulsive force generated by the propeller during the turn remains constant the following equation can be got if we ignore the effects of propeller on other five degrees of freedom martin 2003 4 x r e s i s t i v e t p r o p 0 perez 2005 suggests that x u u u 0 2 can be set equal to x r e s i s t i v e as a first approximation therefore the propulsive force t p r o p can be expressed as follows 5 t p r o p x u u u 0 2 to simplify the analysis the resistance x r e s i s t i v e is taken to include the added resistance of all underwater appendages including rudders and fin stabilizers when in their neutral positions thus the propelling forces and moments can be expressed as follows 6 x p x u u u 0 2 y p 0 z p 0 k p 0 m p 0 n p 0 2 3 control forces and moments rudders and fin stabilizers are the main control devices of the ship they are control hydrofoils with similar shapes but different locations control hydrofoils are driven by hydraulic machinery according to the action command from the controller the characteristics of this machinery are important since they can impose constraints on the control action the mathematical model of the hydraulic machinery most commonly used in marine applications is the simplified model presented by van amerongen et al 1990 as shown in fig 2 in which α c α m α max and α max are the control command mechanical angle maximum angle and maximum turning rate of the fin or rudder respectively when a hydrofoil moves in uniform flow with a certain angle of attack the forces generated on it are shown in fig 3 the resultant hydrodynamic force f generated on the hydrofoil can be divided into the drag force d along the incoming flow direction and the lift force l perpendicular to the flow direction or the tangential force t along the chord direction and the normal force n perpendicular to the chord direction the relationship between the resultant hydrodynamic force and relevant forces is as follows 7 f l 2 d 2 t 2 n 2 n d sin α l cos α t d cos α l sin α the lift force l and the drag force d generated on the hydrofoil can be calculated as follows perez 2005 8 l 0 5 ρ u 2 a c l α d 0 5 ρ u 2 a c d 0 c l 2 α 0 9 π λ 2 3 1 rudder forces and moments the rudder is installed below the stern line and mainly used to control the course of the ship the rudder forces and moments acting on the ship are shown in fig 4 and can be calculated as follows martin 2003 9 x r d r u d d e r δ r y r l r u d d e r δ r z r 0 k r r r l r u d d e r δ r m r 0 n r l c g l r u d d e r δ r where l r u d d e r and d r u d d e r are the rudder induced side force and drag force respectively δ r is the effective rudder angle considering the straightening effect and can be calculated by the following equation 10 δ r δ ε β tan 1 l c g r cos β u s l c g r sin β 2 3 2 fin forces and moments fin stabilizers are installed on both sides of the bilge of the ship to reduce the roll motion the forces and moments generated on the fin stabilizer are shown in fig 5 it should be noted that fin stabilizers are mounted in pairs therefore the forces and moments acting on the ship are twice as large as the forces and moments generated on a single fin and the fin induced forces and moments can be expressed as follows wang 2013 fang et al 2010 11 x f 2 t f i n α e y f 2 n f i n sin β f i n α e z f 2 n f i n cos β f i n α e k f 2 r f n f i n α e m f 2 n c g t f i n α e n f 2 f c g n f i n sin β f i n α e where t f i n and n f i n are the tangential and normal components of the hydrodynamic force generated on the fin α e is the effective angle of attack of the fin considering the roll induced vertical velocity and can be calculated as follows 12 α e α f arctan r f p u 2 4 environment forces and moments sea waves currents and winds are the main factors affecting the movement of ships compared with sea currents and winds sea waves have the largest effect on ship motion ships usually experience large roll angle during high speed turns and the possibility of capsizing is greatly increased if there is large sea waves disturbance martin 2003 therefore the research on ship turning motion shall take the sea waves disturbances into consideration the forces and moments caused by sea waves are complex and volatile random process which are hardly to be accurately modeled simplifications are usually made in modeling disturbance forces and moments of sea waves for ships sailing in the seaway the long crested sea waves are usually considered according to the wave theory the wave height can be simulated by the sum of regular waves that distributed properly on wave energy spectrum ochi 1998 the wave height of the nth regular wave can be expressed as 13 ζ n 2 s ξ ω n δ ω n where s ξ ω n is the wave height spectrum the p m spectrum is adopted here to simulate the wave disturbance and its spectral density function is expressed as follows 14 s ξ ω 8 1 10 3 g 2 ω 5 exp 3 11 h 1 3 2 ω 4 therefore the wave height can be expressed as follows 15 ζ t n 1 n n ζ n cos ω n t ε n the frequency observed from a sailing ship is different from the wave frequency and the frequency experienced by the ship is called the encounter frequency it depends on both the ship s speed and the angle the waves approach the encounter frequency can be expressed as follows 16 ω e n ω n ω n 2 u g cos χ the wave disturbance forces and moments acting on the ship can be obtained based on froude krylov hypthesis as follows falnes 2002 jin and yao 2013 17 x w n 1 n n ρ g ζ n l s a x e n x k 1 n c n x t d x y w n 1 n n 2 ρ g

turning motion 3 1 simulation parameters a multipurpose navy vessel with twin propellers twin rudders and a pair of fin stabilizers is selected as the simulation object the simulation model is established in matlab based on the modeling and analysis in section 2 the main parameters of the ship are shown in table 1 the principle parameters of the rudder and fin stabilizer are shown in table 2 and table 3 respectively the lift coefficients of the rudder and the fin are computed by employing the cfd method as shown in fig 6 although the stall angle of the fin stabilizer obtained from cfd simulation is up to 35 the maximum fin angle is limited to 25 for the consideration of practical application the rudder angle that turns the ship to port is defined as the positive rudder angle the positive fin angle is defined as the leading edge of the port side fin stabilizer upward and the starboard one downward 3 2 ship turning motion with rudder alone 3 2 1 turning motion in calm water 3 2 1 1 simulation analysis the simulation results of ship turning motion with rudder angle of 20 and different initial sailing speeds are shown in fig 7 and the corresponding numerical results are shown in table 4 it should be noted that the total simulation time is set to 300 s the results of the first 80 s of the roll angle and roll rate are given here to have a clear presentation of the transition process of the turning it can be seen from fig 7 and table 4 that the steady turning diameter maximum inward heel angle steady outward heel angle speed drop on turning yaw rate and roll rate during transition process increase with the increase of the initial sailing speed when the ship turns at the initial speed of 15 m s the maximum inward and outward heel angle can be up to 7 45 and 10 69 respectively the simulation results of ship turning motion with initial sailing speed of 15 m s and different rudder angles are shown in fig 8 and the corresponding numerical results are shown in table 5 it can be seen from fig 8 and table 5 that the turning diameter decreases while the initial inward heel angle yaw rate and speed drop on turning increases as the rudder angle increases for the turning with rudder alone the amplitude of roll motion and the turning diameter are contradictory quantities within a certain range of rudder angle the steady outward heel angle increases less and less with the increase of rudder angle the steady outward heel angle increases by 2 22 when the rudder angle increases from 10 to 20 however the steady outward heel angles during ship turns with rudder angle of 20 and 30 are almost the same in order to explore the reason the roll moments acting on the hull during ship turning are analyzed it should be noted that the propeller and fin stabilizer with angle of attack of 0 do not generate roll moment during the turns in calm water therefore the roll moments acting on the ship during turns in calm water are mainly caused by the hydrodynamic and the angled rudders the rudder and hydrodynamic induced roll moments and the total roll moment acting on the ship during turns are shown in fig 9 the first 15 figures in fig 9 are the roll moments caused by the hydrodynamic components in eq 3 the last 3 figures in fig 9 are the total hydrodynamic induced roll moment k h the rudder induced roll moment k r and the total roll moment k t o t a l respectively it can be seen from fig 9 that the roll moment induced by each hydrodynamic component considered in eq 3 increases substantially as the rudder angle increases but the increase range is not the same it can be seen from the bottom three figures in fig 9 that both the rudder and the total hydrodynamic induced roll moments increase with the increase of the rudder angle the hydrodynamic induced roll moment increases rapidly after the steering phase and is much larger than the rudder induced roll moment therefore the steady outward heel is mainly caused by the hydrodynamic induced roll moment it is found that the trend of change in the total roll moment acting on the hull during ship turning is approximately the same as the change in the hydrodynamic component related to the restoring moment the steady roll moments acting on the ship during turns are shown in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that the increase of the hydrodynamic induced roll moment decreases as the rudder angle increases and the change is more severely for large rudder angles when the rudder angle increases from 20 to 30 the steady hydrodynamic induced roll moment increases by 1 5 10 5 n m while the steady rudder induced roll moment increases by 1 84 10 5 n m the changes of the roll moments caused by the rudder and hydrodynamic cause the total roll moment at 20 rudder angle turning to be substantially the same as that at 30 rudder angle turning which accounts for the slight difference in steady state roll for large rudder angles it can be seen from fig 6 that the lift coefficient at the rudder angle of attack 20 is not much different from that at the rudder deflections of 30 moreover the roll responses of ship turns with rudder angle of 20 and 30 are almost the same therefore the turning motion of the ship at rudder angle of 20 is mainly investigated and discussed in the following sections 3 2 1 2 model verification the mathematical model of a multipurpose naval vessel is established in this paper due to the lack of data from ship model tests and full scale trials the accuracy of the established mathematical model is verified and confirmed by comparing the simulation results with the calculation results using the empirical formulas obtained through a large number of model tests and full scale trials the ship resistance increases and the ship sailing speed decreases due to the drift angle during ship turns the speed loss increases and the relative steady turning diameter decreases as the drift angle increases the ratio of ship speed during steady turning period and the initial speed is called the coefficient of speed drop on turning after summarizing the results of a large number of full scale trials and model tests davidson 1944 obtained the relationship between the coefficient of speed drop on turning and the relative steady turning radius the following formula is suggested to describe it 19 u 0 u s 3 sin π 2 u s u 0 5 9 r 0 l s 2 1 the steady outward heel angle during ship turning in calm water can be estimated using the following formula jia and yang 1999 20 φ 0 u s 2 v c g d 2 g h r 0 in order to verified the accuracy of the established mathematical model the comparison between the results of simulations and calculations is shown in table 7 the negative sign in table 7 indicates that the simulation value is less than the calculated value it can be seen from table 7 that the simulation results of the steady turning diameter and the steady outward heel are basically the same as the theoretical calculation results the errors of the steady turning diameter between simulations and calculation are small and below 7 however due to the small value base of the steady outward heel angle the corresponding errors between simulations and calculations are relatively large take the simplification in the process of establishing the model into consideration the above errors are all within a reasonable range therefore the mathematical model established in this paper has a certain degree of accuracy and the obtained simulation results also have a certain degree of credibility 3 2 2 turning motion under wave disturbance it should be noted that the above simulations are carried out without environment disturbance therefore the analysis results may not be suitable for ship turning motion under wave disturbance the simulation results of ship turning motion with sailing speed of 15 m s and rudder angle of 20 with and without wave disturbance are shown in fig 10 the initial encounter angle is 90 and the significant wave height is 2 5 m wd in the legends of fig 10 is the abbreviation of wave disturbance it can be seen from fig 10 that the turning performance is greatly affected by wave disturbance the initial inward heel disappears and is replaced by a small rolling the trajectory of turning circle drifts a lot under the disturbance of sea waves the maximum roll angle can be up to 18 5 which is large enough to threat the normal navigation of the ship the ship experiences a low frequency roll response around the steady heel angle without wave disturbance and the heeling becomes more intense about every 40 s to explore the reason the roll moments acting on the ship during turning under wave disturbance are analyzed as analysis above the propeller and fin stabilizers with angle of attack of 0 do not generate roll moment therefore the roll motion is mainly caused by the angled rudder hydrodynamic and wave disturbance and the corresponding roll moments induced by them are given in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that the initial wave induced roll moment is larger than the roll moments induced by the rudder and hydrodynamic while the rudder and hydrodynamic induced roll moment increase rapidly after that which accounts for the reason why the initial inward heeling is replaced by a rolling the roll moments caused by the rudder and hydrodynamic are greatly affected by the wave disturbance compared with those in calm water shown in fig 9 the hydrodynamic induced roll moment during turns under wave disturbance changes slowly and drastically around the steady hydrodynamic induced roll moment in calm water as the rolling and heeling during steady turning period mainly depends on the hydrodynamic induced roll moment therefore the change of the hydrodynamic induced roll moment accounts for the low frequency roll response which varies substantially around the steady outward heel angle without wave disturbance in the process of ship turning the encounter angle the ship experienced keeps periodically changing it is known that the ship rolls more severely when the encounter angle is near 90 as the ship experiences larger wave excited roll moment near this encounter angle range the roll motion of the ship at other encounter angles is relatively small the ship experiences twice beam seas in one turning period it can be seen from fig 10 that the turning period of the ship is about 80 s therefore the heeling during the corresponding steady turning process becomes more severely about every 40 s 3 3 ship turning motion with rudder and fin stabilizer to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on ship s turning performance the simulations of the turning motion with rudder angle of 20 and sailing speed of 15 m s in different fin angles are conducted and shown in fig 12 the total simulation times is 150 s and the first 50 s of the roll rate curves are given for a clear presentation of the transient process of the turning motion it can be seen from fig 12 that the movement of fin stabilizer has great impact on ship turning motion the effect of positive fin angle on ship turning motion with the same rudder angle is opposite to that of the negative fin angle for the turning motion under the action of positive rudder angle the positive fin angle increases the turning diameter and initial inward heel angle while decreases and even eliminates the steady outward heel angle at the same time the effect increases with the increase of fin angle the simulation results demonstrate that the fin stabilizers are also effective for roll reduction during ship turns 4 control strategy it can be known from the analysis in section 3 that fin stabilizers can be used to reduce ship roll motion during turns the diagram of roll reduction control using fin stabilizers during turns is shown in fig 13 the principle of roll reduction control during turns is similar to that in normal straight navigation the difference is that the rudder angle remains at a certain value during the turn while keeps changing during the straight navigation in this paper an improved pid controller based on miga optimization is developed to control the fin stabilizers 4 1 improved pid controller pid controllers are the most widely used controllers in the world as they are easy to maintain and tune and have higher reliability and strong robustness liu 2013 they are extensively used in ship industry such as the control of fin stabilizers crossland 2003 fang et al 2010 anti rolling tanks liang et al 2012 magnus rotating roll stabilizers liang et al 2017 etc the mathematical model of pid controller is described as follows 21 g p i d s k p k i 1 s k d s where k p k i and k d are the gains of proportional integral and derivative respectively the control law for a control system in practice has to be stable and reliable for a long period to improve the reliability the integral is replaced by a first order inertial element to avoid the integral drift caused by the integrator and the derivative is substituted by a second order oscillating element to avoid high frequency noise in the working frequency range of fin stabilizer of 0 4 1 6 r a d s therefore the transfer function of the improved pid controller used in practice is presented as follows 22 g p i d s k p k i k 1 t 1 s 1 k d k 2 s t 2 s 1 t 3 s 1 where k 1 t 1 25 k 2 1 52 t 2 0 064 and t 3 0 0127 4 2 control parameters optimization to make the control optimal the three control parameters k p k i and k d of the improved pid controller must be well tuned however the parameter tuning is usually difficult and time consuming therefore multi island genetic algorithm liang et al 2013 hu et al 2014 is adopted here to facilitate this task miga is developed based on traditional genetic algorithm tga the main feature of miga is the fact that each population of individuals i e set of probable solutions is divided into several sub populations called island all traditional genetic operations such as selection crossover and mutation are performed separately on each island some individuals are selected from each island and migrated to different islands periodically employing the selection method of roulette chen et al 2008 the evolution procedure of miga is shown in fig 14 in which m i is the migration interval and k is an integer it can be seen from fig 14 that two parameters control the migration process migration interval and migration rate meng et al 2010 migration interval determines the number of generations between each migration and migration rate specifies the percentage of individuals migrated from each island miga can avoid the local optimal solution and restrain the premature convergence chance the optimization parameters adopted in miga are shown in table 8 as the paper aims to reduce the roll motion using fin stabilizers during ship turns and the goal of optimization is to find a set of k p k i and k d that minimize the roll during turning therefore the cost function j used for the judgment while doing the optimization process by miga is as follows 23 j φ s s a 2 m φ where m φ is the variance of the roll angle and φ s s a is the single significant amplitude ssa of the roll angle perez 2005 the multidisciplinary optimization software isight is adopted to integrate the miga and dynamic simulation analysis fig 15 shows the optimization procedure integrating of isight and matlab the ship motion program in matlab simulates ship turning motion records motion history calculates and sends the cost value to isight the optimization algorithm in isight evaluates the cost and selects appropriate pid parameters to send to matlab to automatically realize the data exchange between the optimization program and ship motion program eventually the optimal control parameters are obtained 5 results and discussion in this section the rudder angle is set as 20 and the initial ship speed is set as 15 m s the p m spectrum with the significant wave height of 2 5 m and the initial encounter angle of 90 is adopted here to simulate the wave disturbance and used to calculate the wave disturbance forces and moments the optimal pid parameters obtained using miga based on isight and matalb joint simulation are k p 6 75 k i 7 7167 and k d 4 4167 as a comparison the pid parameters obtained from the ziegler nichols method are also given first let k i k d 0 and increase k p from 0 until there is a steady state oscillation the steady state oscillation appears when k p increases to 1 95 as shown in fig 16 therefore the critical coefficient k p c r i t is 1 95 and the corresponding critical oscillation period t c r i t is 3 1 s the control parameters of the improved pid controller can be calculated using the formulas proposed by ziegler and nichols 1943 as follows the obtained pid parameters using ziegler nichols approach are k p 1 17 k i 0 7548 and k d 0 4352 24 k p 0 6 k p c r i t k i 2 k p t c r i t k d 0 12 k p t c r i t for comparison purpose the simulation results of the improved pid controller with control parameters obtained from miga and ziegler nichols method are compared with the results of lqr controller the design of lqr controller can refer to lee et al 2011 and yuan 2014 the weighting matrices of lqr controller are selected as q d i a g 10 1 and r 1 and the obtained optimal control gain of lqr controller under the above simulation conditions is k l q r 3 0744 2 3947 in this study the effect of fin stabilizers on roll reduction control during ship turning under the developed controllers are investigated and the simulation results are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively fig 17 shows the comparison of simulation results of ship turning motion with and without roll reduction control in calm water in order to accurately evaluate the roll reduction effect during ship turns the analysis of roll reduction is divided into two parts that is the rolling reduction effect before the ship enters the steady turning process and the heeling reduction analysis during the steady turning process it can be seen from fig 17 that the rolling reduction effects of the miga pid and lqr controllers are almost the same and better than that of zn pid controller as to the heeling reduction effect both the heeling angles of the zn pid and miga pid controllers almost reduce to zero while the heeling angle under lqr control reduces to a constant value of about 2 52 fig 18 shows the comparison of simulation results of ship turning motion with and without roll reduction control under wave disturbance it can be seen from fig 18 that the roll reduction effects of the three controllers under wave disturbance are similar with those in calm water the miga pid and lqr controllers have better rolling reduction effect than the zn pid controller while the lqr controller has relatively poor heeling reduction effect compared with the miga pid and zn pid controllers the relatively poor heeling reduction capacity of the lqr controller leads to the roll response of the ship during the corresponding steady turning process varies around a constant heeling angle about 2 34 which is close to the steady outward heel angle of 2 52 during ship turning in calm water under lqr control to further compare the roll reduction effects of the three controllers the following evaluation formula suggested by jerrold and michael 1999 is adopted 25 r e d u c t i o n r b r a r b 100 where r a and r b are the single significant amplitude ssa of the roll angle with and without roll reduction control rrc respectively the performance of fin stabilizer during turning motion of the three controllers is shown in table 9 it can be seen from table 9 that all the three controllers are effective in reducing ship roll motion during turns the developed miga pid has the best roll reduction effect among the three controllers with the overall anti rolling effect of about 80 the lqr controller performs better in rolling reduction with the rolling reduction effect of about 75 however it has a poorer heeling reduction effect than the other two controllers the zn pid controller has better heeling reduction effect than the lqr controller but relatively worse rolling reduction effect compared with the miga pid and lqr controllers therefore it can be concluded that fin stabilizers are also promising and effective in ship roll reduction control during turning motion with an appropriate controller in the light of conducted simulations 6 conclusion in this paper the effect of fin stabilizers on ship s turning performance is investigated the 6 dof mathematical model of a multipurpose naval vessel is established the forces and moments caused by hydrodynamic propeller rudder fin stabilizer and wave disturbance are also modeled the accuracy and credibility of the established mathematical model are verified by comparing the simulation results with the calculation results of empirical formulas based on the analysis of ship turning motion in calm water with and without the act of fin stabilizers an improved pid controller based on miga optimization is proposed for comparison purpose the pid controller with control parameters obtained through ziegler nichols method and the lqr controller are also given the simulations of ship turning with and without wave disturbance at high speed and large rudder angle using the designed controllers are carried out in matlab the simulation results show that all the three controllers are effective to control the fin stabilizers to reduce ship roll motion during turning among these three controllers the developed miga based pid controller has the best performance in reducing ship roll motion during turning the lqr controller has better rolling reduction capacity but relative poor heeling reduction ability while the zn pid controller performs better in heeling reduction therefore fin stabilizers are also effective for ship roll reduction during turning motion with an appropriately designed controller and the developed miga pid controller can be a practical choice acknowledgment this work is

23220,ship turning motion is an important part of ship maneuverability and is directly related to the safety of the ship sailing at sea ships experience a certain amount of rolling and heeling during turning the rolling and heeling caused by turning and waves can be large enough to affect the ability of ships to perform their missions fin stabilizers are currently added to ship designs for the primary purpose of producing roll canceling moments during ordinary operation the present work aims to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on ship roll reduction control during turning motion the 6 dof mathematical model of a multipurpose navy vessel as well as the models of forces and moments caused by hydrodynamic propeller rudder fins and waves are established in matlab based on the simulation analysis of ship turning motion with and without fin stabilizers a miga based improved pid controller is developed the simulation results of ship roll control during turns using the miga pid controller are compared with the results of zn pid and lqr controllers simulation results show that fin stabilizers are also effective for roll reduction control during ship turns with an appropriate controller and the present developed miga pid controller can be a practical choice keywords fin stabilizer roll stabilization ship turning pid miga 1 introduction when ship sails across the sea it always tries to keep straight sailing at a certain speed to reduce the time it takes to reach the destination and the fuel it consumes perez 2005 jin and yao 2013 however when there are obstacles or other ships in its original course the ship must change its course to avoid the incoming threats the vast majority of ships rely upon one or more vertically oriented rudders to accomplish all maneuvers martin 2003 to turn a ship a rudder need only produce forces and moments large enough to generate rotation about the ship s vertical axis in the intended direction however water flowing across an angled rudder also generates roll or rotation about the ship s longitudinal axis as the location of rudders are always below the horizontal plane the center of gravity located taggart 1970 carley and duberley 1972 motivated by this phenomenon various schemes for taking advantage of the roll moment generated by an angled rudder have been proposed and implemented such as the rudder roll reduction van amerongen et al 1990 roberts et al 1999 fang and luo 2007 and the fin rudder roll stabilization whyte 1979 sharif and roberts 2005 jerrold and michael 1999 hiroyuki and takashi 2004 roberts et al 2006 in some situations the ship has to conduct emergency turn to avoid incoming threats to turn the ship in time the rudder is usually set to a large angle and remains constant during the turn jin and yao 2013 the ship initially heels inwards and then rolls around its longitudinal axis before attaining a steady outward heel angle as it enters the turn son and nomoto 1981 increasing either the rudder deflection angle or ship s surge velocity tends to increase the magnitude of roll produced lewis 1989 large roll angles lead to motion sickness cargo damage operation interruption and even ship capsizing liang et al 2017 in warships the motions may be serious enough to curtail helicopter excursions from the deck and degrade performance of weapons systems and radars martin 2003 therefore it is necessary to reduce the roll motion during ship turns fin stabilizers are the world most effective active anti rolling device their anti rolling effect at high speeds can be up to 90 in theory sellars and martin 1992 fin stabilizers are mounted in pairs on both sides of the hull at fixed angles with respect to the transverse plane of the ship and rotated through angles of equal magnitude and opposite directions about their spanwise axis the primary goal of designing and optimizing fin stabilizers is to obtain the maximum anti rolling moment during ordinary operation so far almost all the papers related to fin stabilizers focus on the primary goal of designing optimizing and controlling fin stabilizers to obtain the maximum anti rolling moment to reduce ship roll motion during normal straight navigation few papers have been published to research the effect of fin stabilizers on ship s turning performance martin 2003 wang 2013 the purpose of this paper is to

roberts et al 1999 cao and lee 2003 sliding mode control mcgookin et al 2000 fang and luo 2007 and robust model predictive control ghaemi et al 2009 have been developed and applied to the controller design of fin stabilizers among them the pid controller may be the most extensively applied one in practical application for its high reliability and strong robustness in this paper an improved pid controller is developed to control the fin stabilizers to reduce ship roll motion during turns however the control parameters of pid controller are usually determined based on the experience of operators trial and error method or experiments which might not be the optimal fang et al 2010 genetic algorithm ga recently has received some attention for these problems and can be used to promote the efficiency of the controller fang and luo 2007 gupta et al 2018 genetic algorithm reflects many advantages such as simple currency strong robustness and suitable for parallel processing goldberg 1989 hu et al 2014 but there are still some practical issues such as poor local search premature convergence slow convergence rate chen and lin 2004 thus it is necessary to make an improvement and the multi island genetic algorithm miga is adopted in this paper to optimize the control parameters for the improved pid controller the structure of the paper is as follows section 2 establishes the mathematical models of 6 dof ship motion and the forces and moments of hydrodynamic propeller rudder fin stabilizer and disturbance section 3 simulates and analyzes ship s turning motion in calm water with and without fin stabilizers and verifies the established mathematical model section 4 gives the controller design and miga based control parameter optimization section 5 is the results and discussion finally the conclusion is given 2 ship modeling a ship in a seaway moves in six degrees of freedom as shown in fig 1 two type of reference frames the inertial frames and body fixed frames are used to describe its motion in the modeling of ship motion the ship is usually considered as a rigid body and the ship motion model can be obtained according to newton law abkowitz 1964 the 6 dof ship motions are mutually coupled with different coupling strength the mathematical model of ship motion can be simplified according to the coupling strength and specific research purpose this paper aims to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on ship roll reduction control during ship turning therefore the mathematical model of ship motion in surge sway roll and yaw is needed the pitch and heave are also considered as the effect of pitch attitude in damping and the high coupling between pitch and heave therefore the 6 dof mathematical model of ship motion is established as follows perez

forces and moments acting on the ship can be decomposed as follows 2 f e f e h f e p f e r f e f f e e m t m t h m t p m t r m t f m t e where subscripts h p r f e represent forces and moments caused by the hydrodynamic propeller rudder fin stabilizer and environment disturbance respectively 2 1 hydrodynamic forces and moments the hydrodynamic forces and moments are related to the characteristics and movement state of the hull as well as the characteristics of the fluid in the area of the sailing using the method of abkowitz 1969 the hydrodynamic forces and moments in six degrees of freedom can be expressed as unknown nonlinear functions of position velocity and acceleration perform the taylor series expansion at the equilibrium point and ignore the higher order hydrodynamic coefficients norrbin 1970 perez and blanke 2002 fang et al 2010 we can get 3 x h x u u x u u u u x v r v r y h y v v y p p y r r y u v u v y u r u r y v v v v y v r v r y r v r v y φ u v φ u v y φ u r φ u r y φ u

naval vessel is selected as the research object and the detailed hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to surge sway roll and yaw obtained from rpmm model test can be found in perez and blanke 2002 the corresponding hydrodynamic coefficients with respect to pitch and heave can be calculated according to the strip theory suggested by salvesen et al 1970 2 2 propeller forces and moments propeller is the propulsion device of the ship the complex structure and hydrodynamic characteristics of the propeller make it difficult to be modeled accurately take into account that the turning motion is always performed at a certain sailing speed it can be considered that the propulsive force t p r o p generated by the propeller before the turning motion is equal to the ship resistance x r e s i s t i v e assuming that the propulsive force generated by the propeller during the turn remains constant the following equation can be got if we ignore the effects of propeller on other five degrees of freedom martin 2003 4 x r e s i s t i v e t p r o p 0 perez 2005 suggests that x u u u 0 2 can be set equal to x r e s i s t i v e as a first approximation therefore the propulsive force t p r o p can be expressed as follows 5 t p r o p x u u u 0 2 to simplify the analysis the resistance x r e s i s t i v e is taken to include the added resistance of all underwater appendages including rudders and fin stabilizers when in their neutral positions thus the propelling forces and moments can be expressed as follows 6 x p x u u u 0 2 y p 0 z p 0 k p 0 m p 0 n p 0 2 3 control forces and moments rudders and fin stabilizers are the main control devices of the ship they are control hydrofoils with similar shapes but different locations control hydrofoils are driven by hydraulic machinery according to the action command from the controller the characteristics of this machinery are important since they can impose constraints on the control action the mathematical model of the hydraulic machinery most commonly used in marine applications is the simplified model presented by van amerongen et al 1990 as shown in fig 2 in which α c α m α max and α max are the control command mechanical angle maximum angle and maximum turning rate of the fin or rudder respectively when a hydrofoil moves in uniform flow with a certain angle of attack the forces generated on it are shown in fig 3 the resultant hydrodynamic force f generated on the hydrofoil can be divided into the drag force d along the incoming flow direction and the lift force l perpendicular to the flow direction or the tangential force t along the chord direction and the normal force n perpendicular to the chord direction the relationship between the resultant hydrodynamic force and relevant forces is as follows 7 f l 2 d 2 t 2 n 2 n d sin α l cos α t d cos α l sin α the lift force l and the drag force d generated on the hydrofoil can be calculated as follows perez 2005 8 l 0 5 ρ u 2 a c l α d 0 5 ρ u 2 a c d 0 c l 2 α 0 9 π λ 2 3 1 rudder forces and moments the rudder is installed below the stern line and mainly used to control the course of the ship the rudder forces and moments acting on the ship are shown in fig 4 and can be calculated as follows martin 2003 9 x r d r u d d e r δ r y r l r u d d e r δ r z r 0 k r r r l r u d d e r δ r m r 0 n r l c g l r u d d e r δ r where l r u d d e r and d r u d d e r are the rudder induced side force and drag force respectively δ r is the effective rudder angle considering the straightening effect and can be calculated by the following equation 10 δ r δ ε β tan 1 l c g r cos β u s l c g r sin β 2 3 2 fin forces and moments fin stabilizers are installed on both sides of the bilge of the ship to reduce the roll motion the forces and moments generated on the fin stabilizer are shown in fig 5 it should be noted that fin stabilizers are mounted in pairs therefore the forces and moments acting on the ship are twice as large as the forces and moments generated on a single fin and the fin induced forces and moments can be expressed as follows wang 2013 fang et al 2010 11 x f 2 t f i n α e y f 2 n f i n sin β f i n α e z f 2 n f i n cos β f i n α e k f 2 r f n f i n α e m f 2 n c g t f i n α e n f 2 f c g n f i n sin β f i n α e where t f i n and n f i n are the tangential and normal components of the hydrodynamic force generated on the fin α e is the effective angle of attack of the fin considering the roll induced vertical velocity and can be calculated as follows 12 α e α f arctan r f p u 2 4 environment forces and moments sea waves currents and winds are the main factors affecting the movement of ships compared with sea currents and winds sea waves have the largest effect on ship motion ships usually experience large roll angle during high speed turns and the possibility of capsizing is greatly increased if there is large sea waves disturbance martin 2003 therefore the research on ship turning motion shall take the sea waves disturbances into consideration the forces and moments caused by sea waves are complex and volatile random process which are hardly to be accurately modeled simplifications are usually made in modeling disturbance forces and moments of sea waves for ships sailing in the seaway the long crested sea waves are usually considered according to the wave theory the wave height can be simulated by the sum of regular waves that distributed properly on wave energy spectrum ochi 1998 the wave height of the nth regular wave can be expressed as 13 ζ n 2 s ξ ω n δ ω n where s ξ ω n is the wave height spectrum the p m spectrum is adopted here to simulate the wave disturbance and its spectral density function is expressed as follows 14 s ξ ω 8 1 10 3 g 2 ω 5 exp 3 11 h 1 3 2 ω 4 therefore the wave height can be expressed as follows 15 ζ t n 1 n n ζ n cos ω n t ε n the frequency observed from a sailing ship is different from the wave frequency and the frequency experienced by the ship is called the encounter frequency it depends on both the ship s speed and the angle the waves approach the encounter frequency can be expressed as follows 16 ω e n ω n ω n 2 u g cos χ the wave disturbance forces and moments acting on the ship can be obtained based on froude krylov hypthesis as follows falnes 2002 jin and yao 2013 17 x w n 1 n n ρ g ζ n l s a x e n x k 1 n c n x t d x y w n 1 n n 2 ρ g

turning motion 3 1 simulation parameters a multipurpose navy vessel with twin propellers twin rudders and a pair of fin stabilizers is selected as the simulation object the simulation model is established in matlab based on the modeling and analysis in section 2 the main parameters of the ship are shown in table 1 the principle parameters of the rudder and fin stabilizer are shown in table 2 and table 3 respectively the lift coefficients of the rudder and the fin are computed by employing the cfd method as shown in fig 6 although the stall angle of the fin stabilizer obtained from cfd simulation is up to 35 the maximum fin angle is limited to 25 for the consideration of practical application the rudder angle that turns the ship to port is defined as the positive rudder angle the positive fin angle is defined as the leading edge of the port side fin stabilizer upward and the starboard one downward 3 2 ship turning motion with rudder alone 3 2 1 turning motion in calm water 3 2 1 1 simulation analysis the simulation results of ship turning motion with rudder angle of 20 and different initial sailing speeds are shown in fig 7 and the corresponding numerical results are shown in table 4 it should be noted that the total simulation time is set to 300 s the results of the first 80 s of the roll angle and roll rate are given here to have a clear presentation of the transition process of the turning it can be seen from fig 7 and table 4 that the steady turning diameter maximum inward heel angle steady outward heel angle speed drop on turning yaw rate and roll rate during transition process increase with the increase of the initial sailing speed when the ship turns at the initial speed of 15 m s the maximum inward and outward heel angle can be up to 7 45 and 10 69 respectively the simulation results of ship turning motion with initial sailing speed of 15 m s and different rudder angles are shown in fig 8 and the corresponding numerical results are shown in table 5 it can be seen from fig 8 and table 5 that the turning diameter decreases while the initial inward heel angle yaw rate and speed drop on turning increases as the rudder angle increases for the turning with rudder alone the amplitude of roll motion and the turning diameter are contradictory quantities within a certain range of rudder angle the steady outward heel angle increases less and less with the increase of rudder angle the steady outward heel angle increases by 2 22 when the rudder angle increases from 10 to 20 however the steady outward heel angles during ship turns with rudder angle of 20 and 30 are almost the same in order to explore the reason the roll moments acting on the hull during ship turning are analyzed it should be noted that the propeller and fin stabilizer with angle of attack of 0 do not generate roll moment during the turns in calm water therefore the roll moments acting on the ship during turns in calm water are mainly caused by the hydrodynamic and the angled rudders the rudder and hydrodynamic induced roll moments and the total roll moment acting on the ship during turns are shown in fig 9 the first 15 figures in fig 9 are the roll moments caused by the hydrodynamic components in eq 3 the last 3 figures in fig 9 are the total hydrodynamic induced roll moment k h the rudder induced roll moment k r and the total roll moment k t o t a l respectively it can be seen from fig 9 that the roll moment induced by each hydrodynamic component considered in eq 3 increases substantially as the rudder angle increases but the increase range is not the same it can be seen from the bottom three figures in fig 9 that both the rudder and the total hydrodynamic induced roll moments increase with the increase of the rudder angle the hydrodynamic induced roll moment increases rapidly after the steering phase and is much larger than the rudder induced roll moment therefore the steady outward heel is mainly caused by the hydrodynamic induced roll moment it is found that the trend of change in the total roll moment acting on the hull during ship turning is approximately the same as the change in the hydrodynamic component related to the restoring moment the steady roll moments acting on the ship during turns are shown in table 6 it can be seen from table 6 that the increase of the hydrodynamic induced roll moment decreases as the rudder angle increases and the change is more severely for large rudder angles when the rudder angle increases from 20 to 30 the steady hydrodynamic induced roll moment increases by 1 5 10 5 n m while the steady rudder induced roll moment increases by 1 84 10 5 n m the changes of the roll moments caused by the rudder and hydrodynamic cause the total roll moment at 20 rudder angle turning to be substantially the same as that at 30 rudder angle turning which accounts for the slight difference in steady state roll for large rudder angles it can be seen from fig 6 that the lift coefficient at the rudder angle of attack 20 is not much different from that at the rudder deflections of 30 moreover the roll responses of ship turns with rudder angle of 20 and 30 are almost the same therefore the turning motion of the ship at rudder angle of 20 is mainly investigated and discussed in the following sections 3 2 1 2 model verification the mathematical model of a multipurpose naval vessel is established in this paper due to the lack of data from ship model tests and full scale trials the accuracy of the established mathematical model is verified and confirmed by comparing the simulation results with the calculation results using the empirical formulas obtained through a large number of model tests and full scale trials the ship resistance increases and the ship sailing speed decreases due to the drift angle during ship turns the speed loss increases and the relative steady turning diameter decreases as the drift angle increases the ratio of ship speed during steady turning period and the initial speed is called the coefficient of speed drop on turning after summarizing the results of a large number of full scale trials and model tests davidson 1944 obtained the relationship between the coefficient of speed drop on turning and the relative steady turning radius the following formula is suggested to describe it 19 u 0 u s 3 sin π 2 u s u 0 5 9 r 0 l s 2 1 the steady outward heel angle during ship turning in calm water can be estimated using the following formula jia and yang 1999 20 φ 0 u s 2 v c g d 2 g h r 0 in order to verified the accuracy of the established mathematical model the comparison between the results of simulations and calculations is shown in table 7 the negative sign in table 7 indicates that the simulation value is less than the calculated value it can be seen from table 7 that the simulation results of the steady turning diameter and the steady outward heel are basically the same as the theoretical calculation results the errors of the steady turning diameter between simulations and calculation are small and below 7 however due to the small value base of the steady outward heel angle the corresponding errors between simulations and calculations are relatively large take the simplification in the process of establishing the model into consideration the above errors are all within a reasonable range therefore the mathematical model established in this paper has a certain degree of accuracy and the obtained simulation results also have a certain degree of credibility 3 2 2 turning motion under wave disturbance it should be noted that the above simulations are carried out without environment disturbance therefore the analysis results may not be suitable for ship turning motion under wave disturbance the simulation results of ship turning motion with sailing speed of 15 m s and rudder angle of 20 with and without wave disturbance are shown in fig 10 the initial encounter angle is 90 and the significant wave height is 2 5 m wd in the legends of fig 10 is the abbreviation of wave disturbance it can be seen from fig 10 that the turning performance is greatly affected by wave disturbance the initial inward heel disappears and is replaced by a small rolling the trajectory of turning circle drifts a lot under the disturbance of sea waves the maximum roll angle can be up to 18 5 which is large enough to threat the normal navigation of the ship the ship experiences a low frequency roll response around the steady heel angle without wave disturbance and the heeling becomes more intense about every 40 s to explore the reason the roll moments acting on the ship during turning under wave disturbance are analyzed as analysis above the propeller and fin stabilizers with angle of attack of 0 do not generate roll moment therefore the roll motion is mainly caused by the angled rudder hydrodynamic and wave disturbance and the corresponding roll moments induced by them are given in fig 11 it can be seen from fig 11 that the initial wave induced roll moment is larger than the roll moments induced by the rudder and hydrodynamic while the rudder and hydrodynamic induced roll moment increase rapidly after that which accounts for the reason why the initial inward heeling is replaced by a rolling the roll moments caused by the rudder and hydrodynamic are greatly affected by the wave disturbance compared with those in calm water shown in fig 9 the hydrodynamic induced roll moment during turns under wave disturbance changes slowly and drastically around the steady hydrodynamic induced roll moment in calm water as the rolling and heeling during steady turning period mainly depends on the hydrodynamic induced roll moment therefore the change of the hydrodynamic induced roll moment accounts for the low frequency roll response which varies substantially around the steady outward heel angle without wave disturbance in the process of ship turning the encounter angle the ship experienced keeps periodically changing it is known that the ship rolls more severely when the encounter angle is near 90 as the ship experiences larger wave excited roll moment near this encounter angle range the roll motion of the ship at other encounter angles is relatively small the ship experiences twice beam seas in one turning period it can be seen from fig 10 that the turning period of the ship is about 80 s therefore the heeling during the corresponding steady turning process becomes more severely about every 40 s 3 3 ship turning motion with rudder and fin stabilizer to investigate the effect of fin stabilizers on ship s turning performance the simulations of the turning motion with rudder angle of 20 and sailing speed of 15 m s in different fin angles are conducted and shown in fig 12 the total simulation times is 150 s and the first 50 s of the roll rate curves are given for a clear presentation of the transient process of the turning motion it can be seen from fig 12 that the movement of fin stabilizer has great impact on ship turning motion the effect of positive fin angle on ship turning motion with the same rudder angle is opposite to that of the negative fin angle for the turning motion under the action of positive rudder angle the positive fin angle increases the turning diameter and initial inward heel angle while decreases and even eliminates the steady outward heel angle at the same time the effect increases with the increase of fin angle the simulation results demonstrate that the fin stabilizers are also effective for roll reduction during ship turns 4 control strategy it can be known from the analysis in section 3 that fin stabilizers can be used to reduce ship roll motion during turns the diagram of roll reduction control using fin stabilizers during turns is shown in fig 13 the principle of roll reduction control during turns is similar to that in normal straight navigation the difference is that the rudder angle remains at a certain value during the turn while keeps changing during the straight navigation in this paper an improved pid controller based on miga optimization is developed to control the fin stabilizers 4 1 improved pid controller pid controllers are the most widely used controllers in the world as they are easy to maintain and tune and have higher reliability and strong robustness liu 2013 they are extensively used in ship industry such as the control of fin stabilizers crossland 2003 fang et al 2010 anti rolling tanks liang et al 2012 magnus rotating roll stabilizers liang et al 2017 etc the mathematical model of pid controller is described as follows 21 g p i d s k p k i 1 s k d s where k p k i and k d are the gains of proportional integral and derivative respectively the control law for a control system in practice has to be stable and reliable for a long period to improve the reliability the integral is replaced by a first order inertial element to avoid the integral drift caused by the integrator and the derivative is substituted by a second order oscillating element to avoid high frequency noise in the working frequency range of fin stabilizer of 0 4 1 6 r a d s therefore the transfer function of the improved pid controller used in practice is presented as follows 22 g p i d s k p k i k 1 t 1 s 1 k d k 2 s t 2 s 1 t 3 s 1 where k 1 t 1 25 k 2 1 52 t 2 0 064 and t 3 0 0127 4 2 control parameters optimization to make the control optimal the three control parameters k p k i and k d of the improved pid controller must be well tuned however the parameter tuning is usually difficult and time consuming therefore multi island genetic algorithm liang et al 2013 hu et al 2014 is adopted here to facilitate this task miga is developed based on traditional genetic algorithm tga the main feature of miga is the fact that each population of individuals i e set of probable solutions is divided into several sub populations called island all traditional genetic operations such as selection crossover and mutation are performed separately on each island some individuals are selected from each island and migrated to different islands periodically employing the selection method of roulette chen et al 2008 the evolution procedure of miga is shown in fig 14 in which m i is the migration interval and k is an integer it can be seen from fig 14 that two parameters control the migration process migration interval and migration rate meng et al 2010 migration interval determines the number of generations between each migration and migration rate specifies the percentage of individuals migrated from each island miga can avoid the local optimal solution and restrain the premature convergence chance the optimization parameters adopted in miga are shown in table 8 as the paper aims to reduce the roll motion using fin stabilizers during ship turns and the goal of optimization is to find a set of k p k i and k d that minimize the roll during turning therefore the cost function j used for the judgment while doing the optimization process by miga is as follows 23 j φ s s a 2 m φ where m φ is the variance of the roll angle and φ s s a is the single significant amplitude ssa of the roll angle perez 2005 the multidisciplinary optimization software isight is adopted to integrate the miga and dynamic simulation analysis fig 15 shows the optimization procedure integrating of isight and matlab the ship motion program in matlab simulates ship turning motion records motion history calculates and sends the cost value to isight the optimization algorithm in isight evaluates the cost and selects appropriate pid parameters to send to matlab to automatically realize the data exchange between the optimization program and ship motion program eventually the optimal control parameters are obtained 5 results and discussion in this section the rudder angle is set as 20 and the initial ship speed is set as 15 m s the p m spectrum with the significant wave height of 2 5 m and the initial encounter angle of 90 is adopted here to simulate the wave disturbance and used to calculate the wave disturbance forces and moments the optimal pid parameters obtained using miga based on isight and matalb joint simulation are k p 6 75 k i 7 7167 and k d 4 4167 as a comparison the pid parameters obtained from the ziegler nichols method are also given first let k i k d 0 and increase k p from 0 until there is a steady state oscillation the steady state oscillation appears when k p increases to 1 95 as shown in fig 16 therefore the critical coefficient k p c r i t is 1 95 and the corresponding critical oscillation period t c r i t is 3 1 s the control parameters of the improved pid controller can be calculated using the formulas proposed by ziegler and nichols 1943 as follows the obtained pid parameters using ziegler nichols approach are k p 1 17 k i 0 7548 and k d 0 4352 24 k p 0 6 k p c r i t k i 2 k p t c r i t k d 0 12 k p t c r i t for comparison purpose the simulation results of the improved pid controller with control parameters obtained from miga and ziegler nichols method are compared with the results of lqr controller the design of lqr controller can refer to lee et al 2011 and yuan 2014 the weighting matrices of lqr controller are selected as q d i a g 10 1 and r 1 and the obtained optimal control gain of lqr controller under the above simulation conditions is k l q r 3 0744 2 3947 in this study the effect of fin stabilizers on roll reduction control during ship turning under the developed controllers are investigated and the simulation results are shown in figs 17 and 18 respectively fig 17 shows the comparison of simulation results of ship turning motion with and without roll reduction control in calm water in order to accurately evaluate the roll reduction effect during ship turns the analysis of roll reduction is divided into two parts that is the rolling reduction effect before the ship enters the steady turning process and the heeling reduction analysis during the steady turning process it can be seen from fig 17 that the rolling reduction effects of the miga pid and lqr controllers are almost the same and better than that of zn pid controller as to the heeling reduction effect both the heeling angles of the zn pid and miga pid controllers almost reduce to zero while the heeling angle under lqr control reduces to a constant value of about 2 52 fig 18 shows the comparison of simulation results of ship turning motion with and without roll reduction control under wave disturbance it can be seen from fig 18 that the roll reduction effects of the three controllers under wave disturbance are similar with those in calm water the miga pid and lqr controllers have better rolling reduction effect than the zn pid controller while the lqr controller has relatively poor heeling reduction effect compared with the miga pid and zn pid controllers the relatively poor heeling reduction capacity of the lqr controller leads to the roll response of the ship during the corresponding steady turning process varies around a constant heeling angle about 2 34 which is close to the steady outward heel angle of 2 52 during ship turning in calm water under lqr control to further compare the roll reduction effects of the three controllers the following evaluation formula suggested by jerrold and michael 1999 is adopted 25 r e d u c t i o n r b r a r b 100 where r a and r b are the single significant amplitude ssa of the roll angle with and without roll reduction control rrc respectively the performance of fin stabilizer during turning motion of the three controllers is shown in table 9 it can be seen from table 9 that all the three controllers are effective in reducing ship roll motion during turns the developed miga pid has the best roll reduction effect among the three controllers with the overall anti rolling effect of about 80 the lqr controller performs better in rolling reduction with the rolling reduction effect of about 75 however it has a poorer heeling reduction effect than the other two controllers the zn pid controller has better heeling reduction effect than the lqr controller but relatively worse rolling reduction effect compared with the miga pid and lqr controllers therefore it can be concluded that fin stabilizers are also promising and effective in ship roll reduction control during turning motion with an appropriate controller in the light of conducted simulations 6 conclusion in this paper the effect of fin stabilizers on ship s turning performance is investigated the 6 dof mathematical model of a multipurpose naval vessel is established the forces and moments caused by hydrodynamic propeller rudder fin stabilizer and wave disturbance are also modeled the accuracy and credibility of the established mathematical model are verified by comparing the simulation results with the calculation results of empirical formulas based on the analysis of ship turning motion in calm water with and without the act of fin stabilizers an improved pid controller based on miga optimization is proposed for comparison purpose the pid controller with control parameters obtained through ziegler nichols method and the lqr controller are also given the simulations of ship turning with and without wave disturbance at high speed and large rudder angle using the designed controllers are carried out in matlab the simulation results show that all the three controllers are effective to control the fin stabilizers to reduce ship roll motion during turning among these three controllers the developed miga based pid controller has the best performance in reducing ship roll motion during turning the lqr controller has better rolling reduction capacity but relative poor heeling reduction ability while the zn pid controller performs better in heeling reduction therefore fin stabilizers are also effective for ship roll reduction during turning motion with an appropriately designed controller and the developed miga pid controller can be a practical choice acknowledgment this work is

23221,this discussion is based on the paper by saviano and pisanò 2017 hereafter identified as the original authors or the original paper the original authors employed a three dimensional finite element analysis to investigate the effects of misalignment on the undrained capacity of suction anchors subjected to horizontal h and vertical loadings v in the original paper various parametric studies including the misalignment angle the anchor aspect ratio the soil strength profile and the interface adhesion factor on the hv failure envelope of suction anchors were comprehensively carried out the discussion addresses the issues of the three dimensional modelling approach for suction anchors using the model of the single anchor plug rigid body employed in the original paper and questions the validity of the model if it corresponds to the most accurate representation of the numerical model for this type of offshore foundation keywords suction anchor undrained capacity misalignment failure mechanism mesh refinement finite element analysis 1 introduction in the original paper the original authors saviano and pisanò 2017 presented an interesting research topic of an offshore foundation that is a suction anchor misaligned by an imperfect suction installation the influence of misaligned suction anchors in clays on the undrained horizontal h and vertical v capacities is the main novel result in the original paper the commercial finite element software plaxis3d brinkgreve et al 2015 was employed by the original authors to conduct a comprehensive study on misaligned suction anchors in soft clays the extensive numerical study included the effect of misalignment angle β the anchor aspect ratio l d the soil strength profile s u z and the adhesion factor α at the soil anchor interface on the undrained capacity diagram or the failure hv envelope of misaligned suction anchors the original authors reported that the effect of misalignment angle generated an induced torsion that reduced the lateral capacity due to torsional shear stresses mobilized at the anchor base the reduction in the lateral capacity of 10 was observed for a usual low misalignment β 10 while that of 50 80 was observed for severe misalignment β 30 the discussion addresses the issues of the three dimensional modelling approach for suction anchors using the model of the single anchor plug rigid body employed in the original paper and questions the validity of the model if it corresponds to the most accurate representation of the numerical model for this type of offshore foundation 2 discussions in recent years the finite element fe technology and the developments of graphical user interface have evolved significantly as a result finite element software offers various powerful capabilities of the modelling and simulations in order to obtain an accurate representation of complex geometry for its application to geotechnical engineering the main advantage of finite element method is its ability to model various aspects of sophistication of a physical problem including complicated problem geometry different materials and soil layers material behaviors loadings and boundary conditions regarding the presented topic of an offshore foundation in the original paper a suction anchor commonly known as a bucket foundation usually consists of a cylindrical steel shell with a skirt and a cap on top of it however the original authors employed a model simplification of suction anchor by modelling it with the single anchor plug rigid body in which the soil plug was assumed to be always rigid the discussers believe that the rigid body simplification employed in the original paper is unnecessary since a more complete and realistic modelling of the anchor can be performed using the approach of the plate element as suggested in the discussion particularly the suggested approach has no assumption associated with the rigid body of the soil plug thus the model with less assumption always represents conditions more correctly the following explains how to numerically model the suction anchor using the approach of the plate element in the pre processing step of a three dimensional model plaxis3d offers a feature of structural element known as plate element brinkgreve et al 2015 that allows the cylindrical steel shell of suction anchors to be modelled realistically in the three dimension space figs 1 and 2 show the entire fe meshes of suction anchors and their components modelled by using the plate element in this modelling approach the top cap and skirt of suction anchor are modelled using the plate element see fig 2a b unlike the modelling approach of the single anchor plug rigid body employed in the original paper the model of plate element permits the soil plug inside the anchor to be modelled as a separate fe entity see fig 2c in particular the soil inside the anchor is not assumed to be rigid but retains the same material property including undrained shear behavior of the soil outside the anchor regarding fe components of skirt and cap the plate element is based on mindlin s plate theory bathe 1982 and consists of 6 noded triangular plate element with six degrees of freedom per node including three translational degrees of freedom and three rotational degrees of freedom thus this plate formulation allows for the complete structural consideration of plate deflections due to bending as well as shearing the connections between the top cap and the cylindrical skirt are automatically taken care by the software in which the displacement and rotation at the nodal points along the cap skirt connection are fully coupled both with the displacement and rotation of the plate element brinkgreve et al 2015 an interaction between the plate element suction anchor and the surrounding soil is achieved through interface elements that are specified under the top cap and around anchor skirt see fig 2d interfaces are composed of 12 noded interface elements with pairs of nodes that are compatible with the 6 noded triangular side of a 10 noded tetrahedral element soil or 6 noded plate element anchor note that interface elements have a zero thickness while their undrained behavior is controlled by the adhesion factor α that is the same as the one used in the original paper the rigid behavior of suction anchor modelled by the approach of plate element can be simply achieved by inputting a large equivalent thickness together with large young s moduli the first and second axial directions and shear moduli in plane and out of plane directions in order to produce an actual rigid behavior if the effect of anchor installation is neglected in the fe simulation the concept of wish in place anchor can be done straightforwardly for the model of plate element consequently the discussers believe that the modelling of suction anchor should be done by using the plate element rather than the single anchor plug rigid body in the original paper the plate elements allow a more realistic modelling of the suction anchor consisting of the cylindrical skirt and the top cap without the presumption of rigid body for the soil plug inside the anchor there seems to be neither theoretical and numerical reasons nor computational advantages provided in the original paper for the simplified model of suction anchor using the single anchor plug rigid body one advantage in using the model of plate element is that the shear and normal tractions along the internal and external skirts and underneath the top cap can be recovered after the analysis these information are useful in understanding of the capacity component of anchor lateral vs vertical capacities but are not recovered from the model of the single anchor plug rigid body in the original paper another important limitation of the model of the single anchor plug rigid body is its inherent assumption of rigid body of the soil plug inside the suction anchor because this is not always true for a certain case of shallow suction anchors in which a failure may happen inside the soil plug of anchor previous studies of suction anchor and or shallow foundations employing the model of plate element or volume element for anchors included supachawarote 2006 bransby and yun 2009 gourvenec and barnett 2011 mana et al 2012 barari and ibsen 2012 hung and kim 2012 and 2014 mehravar et al 2016 wang and cheng 2016 keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2016a ukritchon and keawsawasvong 2016 and ukritchon et al 2018 the reasons to adopt the approach of the single anchor plug rigid body are not given in the original paper it is expected that this approach is adopted to avoid a numerical problem in the fe analysis associated with inputting an arbitrary stiffness of the anchor that is sufficiently large compared to the stiffness of the soil it is possible that employing an arbitrarily large stiffness of the structure may numerically deteriorate the condition of the global stiffness matrix during an iterative elasto plastic fe simulation thereby leading to a non convergence problem however it deems appropriate for the original authors to clarify this technical hypothesis in the reply in order to demonstrate that there are significant differences in the predicted failure mechanism of the anchor between the approaches of the plate element and the single anchor plug rigid body the finite element upper bound ub and lower bound lb limit analysis under axisymmetric condition with the model and computation developed through the computer program optumg2 krabbenhoft et al 2015 are employed to simulate the pullout capacity of suction anchors this computational limit analysis is selected in this simulation since the failure analysis can be efficiently simulated with higher degree of accuracy while a predicted failure mechanism can be clearly visualized and developed from ub results note that this method was successfully applied to study various stability problems in geotechnical engineering such as shallow and offshore foundations mana et al 2012 wang and cheng 2016 keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2016a ukritchon and keawsawasvong 2016 and 2017a lateral capacity of rectangular and i shaped piles keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2016b 2017 ukritchon and keawsawasvong 2017b this numerical approach is based on the plastic bound theorem drucker et al 1952 that provides ub and lb limit loads to bracket the exact solution of the stability problem from above and below fig 3 shows the two models of suction anchors modelled by the approaches of the plate element and the single anchor plug rigid body for the problem with l d 0 2 due to the problem symmetry along the axis of anchor only one half of domain is considered in the axisymmetric analysis for both models the undrained failure of the clay is modelled as tresca s material with the associated flow rule which is a pressure insensitive failure criterion governed by cohesion or undrained shear strength note that the clay properties and its strength parameters correspond to the same as shown in tables 1 and a 8 in the original paper for example the undrained shear strength profile of clay corresponds to a linearly increasing strength with s u z 1 25z the rigid plate with weightless material is modelled for the case of plate element while the single anchor plug rigid body is modelled by the undrained material with a high cohesion to ensure the rigid behavior note that the unit weight of the rigid body is the same as that used for the clay in the original paper for the model of plate element clay plate interfaces are defined around all contacted perimeters of the anchor including internal and external skirts and the top cap the adhesion factor α of 0 65 similar to the same value in the original paper is also adopted for the model of the single anchor plug rigid body the clay rigid body contact is modelled as interface elements in which α 0 65 and 1 0 are used along the anchor skirt and the anchor base respectively these input values are summarized in table 1 of this discussion the boundary conditions of both models are defined exactly identical to each other the top soil boundary extending from the anchor is defined as a free surface with zero of both shear and normal tractions the symmetrical and right boundaries of the problem are allowed to move only in a vertical direction while the bottom boundary of the model is fixed both horizontally and vertically the dimensions of the domains are chosen to be so large enough that there is no intersection of failure zone to the bottom and right boundaries hence the ub and lb limit loads are unaffected by these boundaries a feature of automatically adaptive mesh refinement with five iterations increasing number of elements from 5000 to 10000 is also employed for both ub and lb simulations in order to determine accurate ub and lb solutions for both ub and lb analyses the uniform tensile traction applied at the top cap of anchor is optimized and solved by employing the technique of second order cone programming e g krabbenhoft et al 2007 it should be noted that there are significant differences in the predicted failure mechanism of suction anchors between the two approaches see fig 4 in which there is a failure inside the soil plug when employing the model of the plate element this substantiates that the simplified assumption of the single anchor plug rigid body is not valid fig 4 shows the comparison of the failure mechanisms between the model of the plate element and that of the single anchor plug rigid body the upper bound ub results include the final adaptive meshes fig 4a the scaled deformed meshes fig 4b the incremental velocity field fig 4c and the incremental deviatoric shear strain γ s fig 4d the latter shows the relative magnitude of the contour in the soil mass ranging from 0 100 thus the zone with γ s 0 corresponds to no plastic yielding or no failure while that with γ s 0 indicates plastic yielding or failure it can be observed that the kinematic failure mechanisms among the two models are completely different the failure inside the soil plug of the anchor can be clearly seen in the case of the plate element model thereby indicating an occurrence of the plastic yielding zone for the case of the plate element model the shear band predicted by the incremental shear strain and the adaptive mesh starts from the ground surface propagates through the underlying clay and the soil plug and ends at the anchor top cap on the other hand there is no failure in that zone for the case of the single anchor plug rigid body because of the assumption of the rigid body for anchor soil plug it can be observed that the anchor soil plug moves vertically as a rigid body as the anchor is pulled out by the tensile traction the above example clearly demonstrates the fact that the modelling approach of the suction anchor using the single anchor plug rigid body in the original paper does not correspond to the most accurate representation for suction anchors since the soil plug inside the anchor may not behave as the rigid body specified a priori for the case of vertical tensile load the obtained results fig 4 in the discussion also confirm the similar finding by keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2016a and ukritchon and keawsawasvong 2016 who reported that the plastic yielding zone extended inside suction caisson for the case of shallow one for the case of anchors subjected to lateral loading bransby and yun 2009 employed finite element analysis using the same approach as the discussion the model of plate element for anchor and reported that there were the other two possible failure mechanisms found for a failure of soil plug inside suction anchors 1 an inverted scoop mechanism also known as an internal rotational hansen s mechanism and 2 the internal double scoop mechanism in addition similar finding of suction anchors with lateral loading was reported by mana et al 2012 wang and cheng 2016 and barari and ibsen 2012 they found that a failure of the soil plug was observed and the assumption of rigid soil plug inside anchor was not valid even though there were some previous studies of fe analyses e g gourvenec 2008 supachawarote 2006 bransby and yun 2007 or analytical limit analysis e g bransby and randolph 1999 supachawarote 2006 using the same approach of the original authors rigid block anchor their reasons to adopt that approach were related to unavailability of the plate element model in the selected fe software and or simplification of the numerical model or the analytical method in the original paper there was no attempt to evaluate an influence of the modelling approach of the single anchor plug rigid body on the undrained capacity of hv envelope of misaligned anchors as compared to the modelling approach of the plate element table 1 compares the results of the pullout load capacity of three suction anchors between the modellings of plate element and single anchor plug rigid body note that the material properties employed in the simulation of fela as summarized in table 1 are identical to these of the original paper the diameters of the anchors are varied from d 5 20 m while other parameters are unchanged the results are obtained from both lb and ub fela that employ the same boundary conditions as well as the methods of modelling as described earlier it can be observed that the rigid body model can lead to a significant overestimation of the pullout capacity of suction caissons as compared to the plate model the percentage of difference in the pullout capacity between two models can be as much as 33 when the suction anchor becomes relatively shallow at d 20 m from a practical point of view the results clearly indicate that the rigid body model yields an unsafe estimate of the pullout capacity and should not be used in a practical design of a suction anchor especially for an extremely shallow one i e very small l d ratio the modelling of the suction anchor using the plate element as suggested in the discussion is definitely essential for such condition in order to obtain the most accurate and safe prediction of its capacity in practice minor comments of the discussion are related to the presented results of shear stresses τ zx and τ zy at the base of the anchor as shown in fig 8 in the original paper such presented results are difficult to be interpreted and appreciated if the full mobilization of shear stress is developed or not in other words it is not clear how much percentage of the total resultant shear stress is developed as compared to the shear strength of the clay at the base in order to get a clearer representation of such results the original authors should have computed the relative shear stress ratio τ rel that is defined as the ratio of the total resultant shear stress i e τ t o t τ z x 2 τ z y 2 between the two ones τ zx and τ zy to the available undrained shear strength at the base of the clay as a result the full shear mobilization at the base of the clay can be clearly illustrated by this ratio that is equal to or very close to unity however it is not possible for the original paper to provide any further investigation of the relative shear stress ratio inside the soil plug because of the inherent assumption of the model of the single anchor plug rigid body 3 conclusions this discussion addresses the importance of numerical modelling of suction anchors and proposes that they should have been modelled by the plate element instead of the single anchor plug rigid body employed in the original paper in order to demonstrate that the proposed plate element model in the discussion is a more suitable approach the finite element limit analysis with axisymmetric condition is employed to compute the pullout capacity of suction anchors in clays with the same properties as in the original paper it is found that completely different failure mechanisms are observed among the two models for the case of the plate element model the soil plug does not behave as a rigid body but is failed by the action of tensile traction applied at the top of anchor this behavior cannot be realistically simulated by the model of the single anchor plug rigid body in fact the original authors should have modelled suction anchors by employing the proposed approach of the plate element model that is also available in plaxis3d consequently this modelling approach represents the most realistic model for an offshore foundation however the effect of the model of the single anchor plug rigid body is not investigated thoroughly in the original paper in order for the reported numerical results in the original paper to be widely accepted the aforementioned issues should be addressed properly in addition since the presented results in the discussion are based on purely numerical methods additional lab or field data are highly desirable to clarify the modelling issues raised here

10 while that of 50 80 was observed for severe misalignment β 30 the discussion addresses the issues of the three dimensional modelling approach for suction anchors using the model of the single anchor plug rigid body employed in the original paper and questions the validity of the model if it corresponds to the most accurate representation of the numerical model for this type of offshore foundation 2 discussions in recent years the finite element fe technology and the developments of graphical user interface have evolved significantly as a result finite element software offers various powerful capabilities of the modelling and simulations in order to obtain an accurate representation of complex geometry for its application to geotechnical engineering the main advantage of finite element method is its ability to model various aspects of sophistication of a physical problem including complicated problem geometry different materials and soil layers material behaviors loadings and boundary conditions regarding the presented topic of an offshore foundation in the original paper a suction anchor commonly known as a bucket foundation usually consists of a cylindrical steel shell with a skirt and a cap on top of it however the original authors employed a model simplification of suction anchor by modelling it with the single anchor plug rigid body in which the soil plug was assumed to be always rigid the discussers believe that the rigid body simplification employed in the original paper is unnecessary since a more complete and realistic modelling of the anchor can be performed using the approach of the plate element as suggested in the discussion particularly the suggested approach has no assumption associated with the rigid body of the soil plug thus the model with less assumption always represents conditions more correctly the following explains how to numerically model the suction anchor using the approach of the plate element in the pre processing step of a three dimensional model plaxis3d offers a feature of structural element known as plate element brinkgreve et al 2015 that allows the cylindrical steel shell of suction anchors to be modelled realistically in the three dimension space figs 1 and 2 show the entire fe meshes of suction anchors and their components modelled by using the plate element in this modelling approach the top cap and skirt of suction anchor are modelled using the plate element see fig 2a b unlike the modelling approach of the single anchor plug rigid body employed in the original paper the model of plate element permits the soil plug inside the anchor to be modelled as a separate fe entity see fig 2c in particular the soil inside the anchor is not assumed to be rigid but retains the same material property including undrained shear behavior of the soil outside the anchor regarding fe components of skirt and cap the plate element is based on mindlin s plate theory bathe 1982 and consists of 6 noded triangular plate element with six degrees of freedom per node including three translational degrees of freedom and three rotational degrees of freedom thus this plate formulation allows for the complete structural consideration of plate deflections due to bending as well as shearing the connections between the top cap and the cylindrical skirt are automatically taken care by the software in which the displacement and rotation at the nodal points along the cap skirt connection are fully coupled both with the displacement and rotation of the plate element brinkgreve et al 2015 an interaction between the plate element suction anchor and the surrounding soil is achieved through interface elements that are specified under the top cap and around anchor skirt see fig 2d interfaces are composed of 12 noded interface elements with pairs of nodes that are compatible with the 6 noded triangular side of a 10 noded tetrahedral element soil or 6 noded plate element anchor note that interface elements have a zero thickness while their undrained behavior is controlled by the adhesion factor α that is the same as the one used in the original paper the rigid behavior of suction anchor modelled by the approach of plate element can be simply achieved by inputting a large equivalent thickness together with large young s moduli the first and second axial directions and shear moduli in plane and out of plane directions in order to produce an actual rigid behavior if the effect of anchor installation is neglected in the fe simulation the concept of wish in place anchor can be done straightforwardly for the model of plate element consequently the discussers believe that the modelling of suction anchor should be done by using the plate element rather than the single anchor plug rigid body in the original paper the plate elements allow a more realistic modelling of the suction anchor consisting of the cylindrical skirt and the top cap without the presumption of rigid body for the soil plug inside the anchor there seems to be neither theoretical and numerical reasons nor computational advantages provided in the original paper for the simplified model of suction anchor using the single anchor plug rigid body one advantage in using the model of plate element is that the shear and normal tractions along the internal and external skirts and underneath the top cap can be recovered after the analysis these information are useful in understanding of the capacity component of anchor lateral vs vertical capacities but are not recovered from the model of the single anchor plug rigid body in the original paper another important limitation of the model of the single anchor plug rigid body is its inherent assumption of rigid body of the soil plug inside the suction anchor because this is not always true for a certain case of shallow suction anchors in which a failure may happen inside the soil plug of anchor previous studies of suction anchor and or shallow foundations employing the model of plate element or volume element for anchors included supachawarote 2006 bransby and yun 2009 gourvenec and barnett 2011 mana et al 2012 barari and ibsen 2012 hung and kim 2012 and 2014 mehravar et al 2016 wang and cheng 2016 keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2016a ukritchon and keawsawasvong 2016 and ukritchon et al 2018 the reasons to adopt the approach of the single anchor plug rigid body are not given in the original paper it is expected that this approach is adopted to avoid a numerical problem in the fe analysis associated with inputting an arbitrary stiffness of the anchor that is sufficiently large compared to the stiffness of the soil it is possible that employing an arbitrarily large stiffness of the structure may numerically deteriorate the condition of the global stiffness matrix during an iterative elasto plastic fe simulation thereby leading to a non convergence problem however it deems appropriate for the original authors to clarify this technical hypothesis in the reply in order to demonstrate that there are significant differences in the predicted failure mechanism of the anchor between the approaches of the plate element and the single anchor plug rigid body the finite element upper bound ub and lower bound lb limit analysis under axisymmetric condition with the model and computation developed through the computer program optumg2 krabbenhoft et al 2015 are employed to simulate the pullout capacity of suction anchors this computational limit analysis is selected in this simulation since the failure analysis can be efficiently simulated with higher degree of accuracy while a predicted failure mechanism can be clearly visualized and developed from ub results note that this method was successfully applied to study various stability problems in geotechnical engineering such as shallow and offshore foundations mana et al 2012 wang and cheng 2016 keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2016a ukritchon and keawsawasvong 2016 and 2017a lateral capacity of rectangular and i shaped piles keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2016b 2017 ukritchon and keawsawasvong 2017b this numerical approach is based on the plastic bound theorem drucker et al 1952 that provides ub and lb limit loads to bracket the exact solution of the stability problem from above and below fig 3 shows the two models of suction anchors modelled by the approaches of the plate element and the single anchor plug rigid body for the problem with l d 0 2 due to the problem symmetry along the axis of anchor only one half of domain is considered in the axisymmetric analysis for both models the undrained failure of the clay is modelled as tresca s material with the associated flow rule which is a pressure insensitive failure criterion governed by cohesion or undrained shear strength note that the clay properties and its strength parameters correspond to the same as shown in tables 1 and a 8 in the original paper for example the undrained shear strength profile of clay corresponds to a linearly increasing strength with s u z 1 25z the rigid plate with weightless material is modelled for the case of plate element while the single anchor plug rigid body is modelled by the undrained material with a high cohesion to ensure the rigid behavior note that the unit weight of the rigid body is the same as that used for the clay in the original paper for the model of plate element clay plate interfaces are defined around all contacted perimeters of the anchor including internal and external skirts and the top cap the adhesion factor α of 0 65 similar to the same value in the original paper is also adopted for the model of the single anchor plug rigid body the clay rigid body contact is modelled as interface elements in which α 0 65 and 1 0 are used along the anchor skirt and the anchor base respectively these input values are summarized in table 1 of this discussion the boundary conditions of both models are defined exactly identical to each other the top soil boundary extending from the anchor is defined as a free surface with zero of both shear and normal tractions the symmetrical and right boundaries of the problem are allowed to move only in a vertical direction while the bottom boundary of the model is fixed both horizontally and vertically the dimensions of the domains are chosen to be so large enough that there is no intersection of failure zone to the bottom and right boundaries hence the ub and lb limit loads are unaffected by these boundaries a feature of automatically adaptive mesh refinement with five iterations increasing number of elements from 5000 to 10000 is also employed for both ub and lb simulations in order to determine accurate ub and lb solutions for both ub and lb analyses the uniform tensile traction applied at the top cap of anchor is optimized and solved by employing the technique of second order cone programming e g krabbenhoft et al 2007 it should be noted that there are significant differences in the predicted failure mechanism of suction anchors between the two approaches see fig 4 in which there is a failure inside the soil plug when employing the model of the plate element this substantiates that the simplified assumption of the single anchor plug rigid body is not valid fig 4 shows the comparison of the failure mechanisms between the model of the plate element and that of the single anchor plug rigid body the upper bound ub results include the final adaptive meshes fig 4a the scaled deformed meshes fig 4b the incremental velocity field fig 4c and the incremental deviatoric shear strain γ s fig 4d the latter shows the relative magnitude of the contour in the soil mass ranging from 0 100 thus the zone with γ s 0 corresponds to no plastic yielding or no failure while that with γ s 0 indicates plastic yielding or failure it can be observed that the kinematic failure mechanisms among the two models are completely different the failure inside the soil plug of the anchor can be clearly seen in the case of the plate element model thereby indicating an occurrence of the plastic yielding zone for the case of the plate element model the shear band predicted by the incremental shear strain and the adaptive mesh starts from the ground surface propagates through the underlying clay and the soil plug and ends at the anchor top cap on the other hand there is no failure in that zone for the case of the single anchor plug rigid body because of the assumption of the rigid body for anchor soil plug it can be observed that the anchor soil plug moves vertically as a rigid body as the anchor is pulled out by the tensile traction the above example clearly demonstrates the fact that the modelling approach of the suction anchor using the single anchor plug rigid body in the original paper does not correspond to the most accurate representation for suction anchors since the soil plug inside the anchor may not behave as the rigid body specified a priori for the case of vertical tensile load the obtained results fig 4 in the discussion also confirm the similar finding by keawsawasvong and ukritchon 2016a and ukritchon and keawsawasvong 2016 who reported that the plastic yielding zone extended inside suction caisson for the case of shallow one for the case of anchors subjected to lateral loading bransby and yun 2009 employed finite element analysis using the same approach as the discussion the model of plate element for anchor and reported that there were the other two possible failure mechanisms found for a failure of soil plug inside suction anchors 1 an inverted scoop mechanism also known as an internal rotational hansen s mechanism and 2 the internal double scoop mechanism in addition similar finding of suction anchors with lateral loading was reported by mana et al 2012 wang and cheng 2016 and barari and ibsen 2012 they found that a failure of the soil plug was observed and the assumption of rigid soil plug inside anchor was not valid even though there were some previous studies of fe analyses e g gourvenec 2008 supachawarote 2006 bransby and yun 2007 or analytical limit analysis e g bransby and randolph 1999 supachawarote 2006 using the same approach of the original authors rigid block anchor their reasons to adopt that approach were related to unavailability of the plate element model in the selected fe software and or simplification of the numerical model or the analytical method in the original paper there was no attempt to evaluate an influence of the modelling approach of the single anchor plug rigid body on the undrained capacity of hv envelope of misaligned anchors as compared to the modelling approach of the plate element table 1 compares the results of the pullout load capacity of three suction anchors between the modellings of plate element and single anchor plug rigid body note that the material properties employed in the simulation of fela as summarized in table 1 are identical to these of the original paper the diameters of the anchors are varied from d 5 20 m while other parameters are unchanged the results are obtained from both lb and ub fela that employ the same boundary conditions as well as the methods of modelling as described earlier it can be observed that the rigid body model can lead to a significant overestimation of the pullout capacity of suction caissons as compared to the plate model the percentage of difference in the pullout capacity between two models can be as much as 33 when the suction anchor becomes relatively shallow at d 20 m from a practical point of view the results clearly indicate that the rigid body model yields an unsafe estimate of the pullout capacity and should not be used in a practical design of a suction anchor especially for an extremely shallow one i e very small l d ratio the modelling of the suction anchor using the plate element as suggested in the discussion is definitely essential for such condition in order to obtain the most accurate and safe prediction of its capacity in practice minor comments of the discussion are related to the presented results of shear stresses τ zx and τ zy at the base of the anchor as shown in fig 8 in the original paper such presented results are difficult to be interpreted and appreciated if the full mobilization of shear stress is developed or not in other words it is not clear how much percentage of the total resultant shear stress is developed as compared to the shear strength of the clay at the base in order to get a clearer representation of such results the original authors should have computed the relative shear stress ratio τ rel that is defined as the ratio of the total resultant shear stress i e τ t o t τ z x 2 τ z y 2 between the two ones τ zx and τ zy to the available undrained shear strength at the base of the clay as a result the full shear mobilization at the base of the clay can be clearly illustrated by this ratio that is equal to or very close to unity however it is not possible for the original paper to provide any further investigation of the relative shear stress ratio inside the soil plug because of the inherent assumption of the model of the single anchor plug rigid body 3 conclusions this discussion addresses the importance of numerical modelling of suction anchors and proposes that they should have been modelled by the plate element instead of the single anchor plug rigid body employed in the original paper in order to demonstrate that the proposed plate element model in the discussion is a more suitable approach the finite element limit analysis with axisymmetric condition is employed to compute the pullout capacity of suction anchors in clays with the same properties as in the original paper it is found that completely different failure mechanisms are observed among the two models for the case of the plate element model the soil plug does not behave as a rigid body but is failed by the action of tensile traction applied at the top of anchor this behavior cannot be realistically simulated by the model of the single anchor plug rigid body in fact the original authors should have modelled suction anchors by employing the proposed approach of the plate element model that is also available in plaxis3d consequently this modelling approach represents the most realistic model for an offshore foundation however the effect of the model of the single anchor plug rigid body is not investigated thoroughly in the original paper in order for the reported numerical results in the original paper to be widely accepted the aforementioned issues should be addressed properly in addition since the presented results in the discussion are based on purely numerical methods additional lab or field data are highly desirable to clarify the modelling issues raised here

conventional case study is proposed to be used as a benchmark for numerical analyses experimental tests were carried out to provide targets for comparisons in particular the study regarded the estimate of the deformed configuration flying shape in the sailing field of a square sail under a uniform flow regime in a wind tunnel facility several tests have been carried out at different wind velocities the sailcloth has been characterized by means of mono axial tensile tests obtaining young s and shear moduli as well as poisson s coefficients which have then been used as input parameters for numerical analyses test results are considered a benchmark target deserving challenging aspects for numerical simulations in spite of the selected simple test geometry and conditions numerical tests have been carried out by means of a commercial software adina analyses used a strongly coupled partitioned approach between a finite volume method fvm based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations whereas a finite element method fem has been adopted for the structural field a comparison has been eventually carried out assessing different numerical models a good overall agreement between experimental and numerical results has been obtained by suitably setting fsi simulation algorithms keywords fluid structure interaction fsi sail cfd fea wind tunnel benchmark 1 introduction and state of the art sails are a clear example of a fluid structure interaction fsi issue from a structural point of view they can be considered as very thin and flexible pretensioned membranes undergoing large displacements because of the pressure field induced by the wind this charming research field has been growing in the last 50 years exploiting experimental and numerical techniques of investigation a rather extensive literature can nowadays be found on this topic nevertheless only a few important works will be reported in the following for the sake of briefness early studies were conducted considering separately the fluid dynamic field and the structural one from the experimental point of view such early works were conducted in wind tunnel environments because of the impossibility of scaling the thickness of a sail by keeping the same mechanical properties of the real scale structure sail models are much stiffer than corresponding prototypes and sometimes they are directly built on purpose with even stiffer materials in order to avoid any structural deformation thus only the flow regime around the rigid or quasi rigid sail plan is studied interesting results can be found in wilkinson 1984 in this work the author studied the interaction effects of a mast on a rigid sail in a bi dimensional case by varying some parameters such as mast s dimensions sail s camber ratio and wind angle of attack aoa he also identified typical flow regions around a mainsail a further important study is reported in flay 1996 where a three dimensional model was tested for the first time in a wind tunnel under twisted flow conditions thus taking advantage of the real wind velocity profile and the variation of aoa along the sails height more recently in fossati and muggiasca 2013 the aerodynamic behaviour of a 3d scaled model was characterized by means of wind tunnel tests the study allowed the characterization of aerodynamic forces using a forced motion technique to assess the aeroelastic response of the sail plan a representation of the aeroelastic effects was proposed showing a hysteretical loop behaviour of the aerodynamic coefficients finally in querad and wilson 2007 the authors carried out a study on a mainsail comparing wind tunnel tests with numerical results obtained by using a commercial rans solver ansys cfx further numerical analyses showed that including the hull shape significantly improves the predictions an increasing number of full scale experimental tests have been published in recent years stackpole 1985 described the tests carried out on a dynamometer boat built at the massachusetts institute of technology already decades ago the 10 7 m boat with an internal frame connected to the hull by six load cells configured to measure forces and moments acting on rigging and sails additional sensors provided data about wind angles and speed at various height from sea level heel and pitch angles and boat speed a more recent work was presented by motta et al 2013 where aerodynamic forces and sail shape measurements using high resolution cameras hrc were simultaneously collected on a mainsail and a spinnaker concurrently used it is also worth mentioning a new 10 m dynamometer boat recently built by the politecnico di milano endowed of sensors on mast rigging and sails and of cameras for sail shapes measurements in fossati et al 2015 the concept design and the building process of the boat are described it is pointed out by fossati s group that sails flying shapes can be investigated using pressure taps positioned on the sails and cameras in addition the boat has been equipped with load cells to measure the overall forces and moments transmitted by sails and rig to the hull some preliminary results are also reported rizzo et al 2009 designed and installed a mast and rigging monitoring system on a very large sail ship to collect data during service while sea trials measured data are more difficult to be obtained analysed and interpreted the information gathered during service life is extremely valuable to calibrate design methods using data from actual loading scenarios as regards numerical simulations applicable to sail design many different approaches both where the fsi coupling is considered or not have been adopted in the last decades early studies made use of non viscous fluid dynamic software subsequently because of the increasingly available computational power further studies have been developed using viscous rans solvers able to predict more complex types of flow one of the first numerical fsi analyses is reported in boote and caponnetto 1991 where the authors wrote a complete procedure for the design of sailing yacht masts and rig for the calculation of the aerodynamic forces a software was realised by the authors based on the lifting surface theory for the stress analysis another dedicated program was developed starting from a multi purpose finite element fe code operating in the non linear domain trimarchi and rizzo 2009 presented a matlab fem code specifically developed for deformation analysis of sails modelled with constant strain triangles cst membrane elements a weakly coupled fsi analysis of a mainsail was carried out coupling the fe code with an aerodynamic panel code among more recent works employing rans codes the study presented in trimarchi et al 2010 is worth mentioning in this work the authors showed the importance of using structural shell elements in fe analysis to capture the wrinkling phenomena in sails simulations indeed its influence on aerodynamic performances especially in downwind sails is significant a strongly coupled partitioned approach was used to solve fsi renzsch and graf 2011 described the implementation of a numerical procedure to couple a commercial ranse software ansys cfx with a structural code developed to study the behaviour of spinnakers the structural code is based on the use of membrane elements adopting wrinkling models a comparison with experimental tests developed in a wind tunnel was also carried out recently sacher et al 2015 proposed an optimization procedure of the trimming of the mainsail of an imoca yacht international monohull open classes association in upwind conditions they tested their procedure both carrying out experimental tests as well as using numerical simulations coupling rans and fem codes a general good agreement was found despite inherent errors in the numerical model and uncertainties of measurements in this paper a simplified case study has been developed on a square woven sailcloth in a wind tunnel the sail undergoes large displacements to validate the prediction performances of the numerical computations for this kind of problems despite its simplicity the proposed test case includes several challenging aspects and allows adjusting the simulation set up and the modelling strategies in full detail the selection of a simple geometry is also mandatory when new approaches or solvers are investigated on complex problem like the definition of the sail flying shape anyhow further cases could be developed in the future studying more realistic and complex sail geometries by considering the rig as well it is believed that the proposed test case is suitable to validate numerical models used in this work and providing benchmark targets for further research activities 2 sailcloth s mechanical properties even if a rather wide literature is available regarding fluid dynamic and fsi experiments very few works regarding sails mechanical properties can be found at least in open literature the work presented in satchwell 1984 can be considered a milestone in this field the primary intent of that study was to carry out a procedure to assess mechanical characteristics of sailclothes standard uniaxial tensile tests on non specified popular types of woven sailcloth specimens most probably dacron have been carried out to assess young s and shear moduli poisson s coefficient as well as tensile strength of the fabric mcmillan 2009 published a work on the effects of uv light and moisture on the strength of sail materials specimens were subjected to an intense treatment exposing them to uv rays and air with 100 of relative humidity tensile tests were performed on the treated specimens and compared with results obtained from new specimens results were reported in terms of loss of strength but no data were provided in terms of elastic moduli a study on a new sailcloth called dilon organza since engineered from dilon spinnaker fabric and organza a dressmaking fabric sewn together in the warp and fill directions was published by dewalt 2014 cloth specimens were tested for stretch resistance along warp and fill directions damage from flutter testing and tensile strength after exposure to uv light different results were reported in this work yet no data were provided in terms of elastic moduli of the material to the best of the authors knowledge no other systematic studies except commercial information of fabric makers are available so far in open literature about sailclothes characterization because of the difficulty in finding adequate mechanical properties of sailclothes to be used as input parameters in fe structural calculations some preliminary experimental tests have been carried out at the engineering materials laboratory of the department of civil environmental and architectural engineering of the university of genoa it should be outlined that complete and accurate figures of mechanical properties of the clothes material is of primary importance to accurately predict the structural response north sails italia company provided specimens used for the mechanical characterization and for the wind tunnel test in the following a brief description of the tensile tests is reported further details can be found in ghelardi 2017 2 1 tensile tests description north sails italia company provided a woven sailcloth manufactured in dacron having a density of 235 g m2 for woven sailclothes it is reasonable to assume an orthotropic nature of the material therefore the fabric was tested with fibres oriented at 0 90 and 45 i e along fill warp and bias directions for a total of three specimens in order to obtain the complete mechanical characterization of the material such hypotheses are particularly valid in the present work because the geometry and the loading conditions adopted in the fsi test are rather simple in case of actual sails more complex anisotropic models may be more representative of the structural behaviour namely measurements provided elastic moduli in warp fill directions ew and ef the corresponding poisson coefficients νwf and νfw specimens dimensions are reported in fig 1 mono axial tensile tests up to the breaking point were carried out using a zwick roell z020 testing machine machine measurements might be subjected to an error of 1 according to its calibration certificate data have been acquired and conditioned providing as a result force strain plots afterwards young s moduli have been estimated using actual geometries of each specimen measured on purpose to evaluate the poisson s coefficients νwf and νfw a contactless photographic technique has been used to measure the transversal deformation of the specimens with respect to the acting direction of the load a mono axial load has been applied with the same test machine used for tension tests on new specimens transversal deformation has been captured with a dino lite digital microscope having a 1280 1024 pixel resolution poisson coefficient estimates have been eventually obtained through imagej a software for digital image processing released into the public domain national institute of health 1987 the measurements have been carried out applying an axial load ranging between 30 n and 150 n thus being within the elastic limit of the material showing satisfactory repeatability and accuracy of measurements the accuracy of the measurements has been estimated as low as 10 μm taking into account the resolution of the digital microscope which was deemed sufficient to precisely attain the poisson ratios 2 2 tensile tests results results have been reported in terms of stress strain curves until specimen rupture fig 2 it can be noted that warp fibers present the highest breaking load as well as for equal load value the lowest strain value furthermore as expected bias specimen showed the highest deformation focusing on the initial part of the curves it can be noted that different linear limit response can be found for each specimen depending on the loading direction fig 2 the highlighted linear limit reported in figure shows the linearity limit of the curves such limit shows the threshold for which a linear response can be assumed for tensile loading condition along fill s fibers direction a linear behaviour has been estimated to fit the initial part of the curve the linear limit has been identified as the point where the discrepancy between the experimental curve and the linear regression becomes larger than the linear regression deviation once the linear trend limits have been identified for the different curves young s moduli have been computed poisson s ratios have been detected as described in previous section thus allowing the calculation of the shear modulus g as well table 1 reports the results for the tested material 3 experimental wind tunnel tests the present experimental test has been designed as a benchmark in simulating fsi problems related to sails experimental tests have been carried out in the wind tunnel of the department of civil chemical and environmental engineering dicca of the polytechnic school of the university of genoa the wind tunnel is a closed loop subsonic circuit the flow velocity in the working section is limited by about 34 m s the working section is 8 8 m long with a cross section of about 1 70 1 35 width x height meters the tunnel presents two test sections as far as the present work concerns tests have been carried out in the former one where the velocity is uniform within 1 at every wind speed and the wall boundary layer has a thickness of the order of 2 cm within such a test section the level of longitudinal turbulence intensity is less than 0 25 but it can be increased up to 10 inserting suitable grids 3 1 wind tunnel test description the study is focused on the behaviour of a square specimen sailcloth immersed in the airflow at a constant velocity the model was clamped on one edge and free to oscillate on the opposite one however to avoid the sail waving like a flag two thin steel flat bars have been applied on the lowest free edge on both upwind and downwind faces having a total mass of 0 508 kg 5 n self weight approximately the thickness of each bar was 5 mm the airflow comes from the intake inflating the sail and generating a detached flow downstream of the sail it represents a typical stream condition in dead downwind points of sailing a schematic representation of the experimental arrangement is reported in fig 3 a fig 3 b and c report main dimensions of the test setup the overall dimensions of the sail were limited by the need to maintain a blockage area ratio in the wind tunnel below 5 the upper edge was clamped on a fixed stiff aluminium beam spanning from one sidewall to the opposite one in the wind tunnel orthogonally to the flow as shown in fig 4 orthogonal lines equally spaced by 40 mm have been drawn on the sail in order to detect its flying shape by post processing recorded videos a series of stationary tests have been performed at several wind speeds no data have been collected in the transitory except for the initial run up from zero to the first velocity value about 3 7 m s tested wind speeds were in the range 3 7 10 4 m s table 2 the range has been chosen in order to generate the largest possible displacements without the occurrence of complex aeroelastic phenomena e g fluttering flying shapes were detected using a high resolution camera namely a full frame nikon d800 having 36 mpx resolution with a nikkor af s 70 200 vrii f 2 8 lens set at 135 mm of focal length the camera was positioned on one side of the tunnel aligned with the test section and perpendicular to the airflow videos were recorder in hd resolution at a frame rate of 60 hz furthermore pictures at full resolution have been collected at 5 frames per second fps images have been post processed through imagej software national institute of health 1987 3 2 wind tunnel test results tests have been carried out in smooth flow conditions at air temperature of 24 5 c with 65 of relative humidity and a longitudinal turbulence intensity of about 0 25 as expected a growing inflation of the sail has been observed during the trials when increasing the flow speed an almost stationary behaviour with moderate oscillations has been detected at each wind speed due to progressive vortex shedding the oscillations arose in the longitudinal plane especially at the lowest speeds oscillations became more severe increasing the wind speed in particular at the highest wind speed 10 4 m s the specimen was excited in a more complex way with a higher oscillation frequency showing the insurgence of aeroelastic phenomena and behaving similarly to a flag in an airflow out of plane oscillations have been noticed no particular edge effects have been detected on the free vertical edges of the sails this is mainly due to the geometry of the specimen to the fixities on the horizontal edges the rectangular beam and the flat bar weight and due to boundary conditions in general for this reason it has been assumed reasonable to show data in terms of displacements of the vertical section at mid span sail flying shapes were extrapolated from pictures taking advantage of the pattern drawn on the sail and of the pattern suitably placed on the other side of the tunnel with respect to the camera fig 5 the pattern behind the sail is composed by squares having sides of 40 mm sectional flying shapes are reported in terms of maxima and minima oscillations detected fig 5 also shows minima and maxima oscillations detected at different wind speeds as mentioned the sail oscillated in way of its equilibrium position under a certain wind speed flow oscillation amplitudes were obtained by analysing the video images and taking lowest and highest positions no results were reported at the highest wind speed because of the fluttering behaviour of the sail fig 6 reports all detected maxima flying shapes at different airflow speeds in table 3 oscillations frequencies are reported an increasing trend can be observed however cases 4 and 8 show lower frequencies with respect to the previous case indicating a slightly more stable behaviour 4 numerical analyses in this section the description of the experimental wind tunnel test simulated in adina s environment will be presented a short introduction on the theoretical basis of the fsi numerical analyses is provided in the following encouraging the interested reader to deepen the topic on other specific publications e g donea et al 2004 förster et al 2007 4 1 fluid structure interaction theory and methodology the present fsi approach is based on a arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale continuum description a detailed description of this well known approach can be found in donea et al 2004 baiges and codina 2010 two way fsi problems with large deformations can be solved numerically via two different methods the monolithic approach also called direct or simultaneous and the partitioned one also called segregated or iterative the first one consists in solving a large non linear system including both fluid and solid equations the partitioned approach consists in solving the fluid and solid equations separately using different solvers the more appropriate method solves its own field and data are transferred through the interface to the other domain fluid and solid hence in this case a coupling algorithm must be used to take into account the interaction between the fluid and structural domains further considerations and analyses on these different solution methods can be found in michler et al 2004 and degroote et al 2009 a comparison between these two different approaches was carried out in adina environment in a previous study on a similar subject by ghelardi et al 2017 hence a strongly coupled partitioned approach has been used in the present study to solve the problem stress and displacements criteria between the fluid and solid solutions must be satisfied on the interface in order to reach iteration convergence in this case because of the complexity of the flow a viscous fvm solver has been used to solve the fluid domain whilst a fem has been employed to solve the structural equations further details about the fsi solution algorithms used in adina can be found in adina 2016 the mesh updating approach used by adina is based on a laplacian smoothing method where the nodal position in the fluid domain are updated starting from the updated position of the interface nodes which are taken as a boundary condition for the fluid domain in addition to guarantee a high quality mesh during the computation even when encountering large displacements a leader follower algorithm has been adopted in mesh updating where the displacements of a user defined leader point affect displacements of a follower point progressively deforming the rest of the mesh in a smooth way adina 2016 4 2 considerations on shell elements used in sails analyses when a boat is sailing in dead downwind conditions the sail generates no aerodynamic lift so that the boat is propelled by the drag generated by the wind which inflates the sail undergoing large displacements the same kind of flow condition can be assumed for the present test case structural shell elements are considered more reliable with respect to usually adopted membrane elements in downwind sails analyses trimarchi 2012 this conclusion comes from the fact that the stiffness operator of shell elements includes the bending stiffness whilst membrane elements the other type of elements commonly used in sail simulations are implemented considering membrane stiffness only therefore in the present paper shell elements adopting different material models have been used in order to avoid any locking phenomena locking free mixed interpolation of tensorial components mitc shell elements have been used chapelle bathe 2011 however when using shell elements in sails modelling some complications arise in the inversion of the stiffness matrix the small thickness of the sail generates diagonal terms close to zero making difficult to invert the stiffness operator in the present study the approach proposed in trimarchi 2012 has been adopted to overcome the problem the issue is solved by introducing in the structural system also the mass and damping matrices thus improving the conditioning of the global systems however it results in higher computational costs it should be noted that not being interested in solving the real structural dynamics in the present case a fictitious damping value close or equal to the critical one could be used hence the time integration step is no more representative of a physical quantity and it should be regarded just as a numerical integration step since the damping is non realistic the damping matrix has been implemented according to the rayleigh s approach as follows 1 c α m β k where α is a coefficient proportional to the total system mass matrix whilst β is proportional to the initial total system stiffness matrix i e the matrix at initial zero displacements bathe 1996 trimarchi 2012 suggested a method to estimate α and β constant values which multiply mass and stiffness operators respectively with the aim to minimize computational time mathematically derived in a linear framework but then adopted in a non linear analysis as well trimarchi s procedure let to define α and β such that critical damping is assumed for the first natural frequency whilst higher frequencies were overdamped constants have been defined as follows 2 α ω n β 1 ω n where ω n is the first natural frequency of the structure computed via a modal analysis in this work the same approach has been used to set up the damping constants 4 3 numerical test setup a virtual wind tunnel test has been created in adina 9 2 0 environment adina 2016 to reduce the computational effort a preliminary test adopting a bi dimensional approach has been explored unfortunately due to the aspect ratio of the tested sail specimen this simplification is inappropriate because the 2 d model systematically over predicts the pressure field and consequently the fluid forces acting to the sail generate unrealistic flying shapes this is mainly due to the boundary effects in span wise direction which occurs in the 3 d geometry but are neglected by the 2 d simplified analysis after some preliminary tests on the fluid domain size not reported here for the sake of shortness the final dimensions have been identified as reported in fig 7 in particular the transversal section has the same dimensions of the actual tunnel section fig 3 the transversal beam supporting the sail and the flat bars applied to the free side of the sail were not modelled in the fluid domain and preliminarily their influence was assumed negligible on sail s aerodynamics especially for steady state analyses regarding the structural modelling the weight applied to the specimen by the flat bars was modelled as a static force acting along the vertical z axis direction in fact since the intention was to reproduce the steady deformation of the sail there was no interest in modelling flat bars and their mass preliminary tests showed that no particular boundary effects occur at the corners of the lowest free edge a simply supported structural boundary condition was applied to the clamped edge of the sail thus allowing rotations around x axis concerning the fluid domain a free slip condition was set on tunnel s walls for sake of simplicity since it was assumed that the simulation of the boundary layer on the tunnel s walls had a limited impact on the sail deformation whilst a no slip condition was applied on the sail in order to solve the boundary layer physical input parameters of the simulations are summarized in table 4 and table 5 for both fluid and solid domain the study was aimed at assessing which structural model simulates in a more accurate way the experimental tests for this reason and because of the rather large computational efforts required the analysis was limited at few wind speeds so far the fsi problem was solved by using a strong partitioned approach and exploiting an algebraic multi grid iterative solver amg1 solver in adina it should be noted that the adopted numerical setup has been evaluated in previous analyses on a similar issue ghelardi et al 2017 here fsi convergence checks have been imposed for both forces and displacements as regards the fluid solution a euler 1st order time marching scheme has been adopted to solve the fluid problem a pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm was adopted for the pressure velocity coupling issa 1985 because of the large flow separation zone induced by the sail a k ω sst turbulence model menter 1993 has been considered the most suitable to simulate the physics of the problem in fact such turbulence model is generally recognised to provide accurate results in the prediction of downwind sails aerodynamics see e g collie et al 2001 querad and wilson 2007 a newmark implicit time integration scheme has been adopted to solve the structural dynamics equations as a first approximation a linear isotropic material model has been adopted using mitc 4 nodes shell elements young s modulus and poisson coefficient have been averaged with respect to the values reported in table 1 as far as the mesh updating is concerned a leader row of nodes has been identified on the sail s free edge whilst corresponding follower points were defined on the tunnel walls fig 8 structural rayleigh s damping constants have been obtained according to trimarchi s procedure trimarchi 2012 adopted α and β values are reported in table 6 first flexural and second torsional modal shapes are reported in fig 9 respectively on the left and on the right calculated frequencies have a value of 4 74 hz and 11 00 hz respectively 4 4 mesh sensitivity analysis structured meshes have been used in both fluid and structural domains in the first case hexahedral elements have been adopted fig 10 a whilst quadratic elements have been used in the latter one fig 10 b four different levels of refinements have been investigated to analyse the solution trends with respect to the mesh size table 7 analyses started using a 0 01s time step to overcome initial convergence difficulties growing then up to 0 25s during the simulation when the solution trend is converging the choice to increase the integration step may introduce a larger numerical error but it significantly reduces computational costs as regards the fluid solution a maximum and an average courant number of 300 and 90 was reached respectively for the most refined fluid grid even if these time steps may appear to be too large for a time accurate solution they have been considered acceptable in the light of the final steady solution required therefore the initial transition can be numerically smoothed to avoid excessive computational costs because only the final steady solution is of interest anyhow further cases should be considered in the future aiming to investigate the influence of the time integration step on the solution s accuracy it should be also outlined once again that since a fictitious critical damping has been adopted the numerical structural dynamic solution is not anymore representative of the real physical behaviour of the sail during the transient and at steady state therefore the time step should not be thought as a real physical quantity but it should be interpreted as a numerical integration step only fig 11 shows global forces trend during the simulations for different mesh refinements average y values at the final converged step for every deformed mesh of the sail s upwind and downwind faces are reported in table 8 to reduce the total computational effort it has been decided to impose a first cell wall function thanks to this numerical feature a high y 1 value can be set on the wall boundaries from a numerical point of view this choice is also supported by the consideration that most of the forces acting on the sail are due to the pressure action rather than to the shear stress consequently any shear error should have a small impact on the calculated final flying shape fig 12 reports force trend increasing the mesh density to assess the accuracy of the solution an evaluation of the discretization error has been carried out by using the richardson s extrapolation procedure asme 2008 which outlined an overestimation of the total force of about 0 55 between the case of mesh 4 and the ideal grid independent solution therefore the accuracy of the solution has been considered well acceptable for the purposes of the present work considering the required computational effort from a fsi perspective a comparison among the numerical results and the experimental ones in terms of sectional flying shape at midspan when varying the mesh size is reported in fig 13 it can be noted that the first two meshes show a flying shape closer to the minimum detected experimental oscillation in the highest part of the sail while they are in better agreement with the maximum experimental oscillation in the lowest part however the global shape is not fully in line with the real one on the other hand mesh 3 and especially mesh 4 simulate a flying shape in substantial agreement with the maximum limit of the experimental oscillation it should be outlined that in the experimental tests when the sail reached the maximum displacement configuration it was not in a stable configuration since immediately after reaching that condition one or more vortices detached causing a pressure drop on the whole sail which then deflated however this dynamic behaviour could not be captured in the present numerical analysis since as mentioned fictitious critical structural damping and too large time integration steps have been adopted resulting in a quasi static analysis in practice therefore in the simulation the sail reached the configuration at the maximum oscillation resulting fixed in that condition without showing any subsequent oscillation in time fig 14 shows velocity magnitude pressure and turbulent kinetic energy contour plots for the fluid dynamic part on a longitudinal section at mid span of the sail for mesh 4 flow is completely detached as expected streamlines depiction identified the presence of a double vortex on the leeward side fig 15 4 5 comparison among different structural models further investigations have been developed adopting a linear elastic orthotropic material assumption exploiting shell elements and a linear elastic isotropic material with membrane elements orthotropic material characteristics are reported in table 1 it should be noted that warp fibers were oriented along vertical z axis direction fig 10 for the sake of completeness a comparison with membrane elements has been carried out as well flying shapes are reported in fig 16 because of the high computational costs of the simulations the comparison has been performed adopting mesh 3 models using isotropic and orthotropic shell elements showed an almost matching shape shell isotr curve lies underneath the shell ortho one the same behaviour has been found for models adopting membrane elements it is worth noting that since the sailcloth is quite balanced in fill and warp directions the averaged young s modulus adopted in the isotropic model is quite similar to the one adopted in the orthotropic model furthermore the simplicity of the geometry of the structure and the symmetric flow conditions contributed to this result softer behaviour of membranes with respect to shell elements can be due to the absence of rotational degrees of freedom in the formulation of such kind of elements involving some deformation energy and resulting in a global lower bending stiffness of the model 4 6 comparison at high wind speeds two further tests have been carried out to simulate the problem at higher wind speeds where larger mesh deformation occurred namely cases 5 and 8 where wind speed was 6 1 m s and 9 2 m s respectively see table 2 a medium and a high speed where no particular dynamic phenomena where observed have been selected speed 9 showed more significant dynamic phenomena see section 3 2 as regards the structural model shell elements assuming an orthotropic material model have been adopted mesh 3 table 7 has been chosen for the following analyses to reduce computational time the same initial condition was imposed in all tests i e the sail was flat and perfectly vertical as shown in fig 8 at t0 fig 17 reports the analysed cases including the previous one at the lowest wind speed 3 7 m s for comparison purposes in all cases the software showed flying shapes close to the maxima experimental limit thus providing a trend for different wind speeds again the simulation is considered satisfactory in the case of the highest wind speed equal to 9 2 m s the computed flying shape shows a slightly higher inflation in the upper part of the sail with respect to the experimental test this could be due by the fact that the influence of the rigid transversal bar where the sail was constrained not modelled in the simulations had a higher influence on the aerodynamics of the sail at high wind speed beside the constraint effect of the structural model built up by shell elements the aerodynamic field is more influenced by the upper vortex of the wake moreover the fluid mesh needs to be more deformed because of the larger sail inflation possibly affecting the computation accuracy fig 18 shows a comparison among fluid meshes in the above mentioned three analysed cases in fact it can be noted in the latter case v8 a more relevant mesh distortion especially in the zone close to the sail constraint thus implying a lower cell quality particularly in the upper part of the sail fig 19 reports a detail of the mesh in the case v8 it can be noted that elements on the upwind side of the sail underwent a stretch whilst elements on the downwind side are compressed possible solutions to improve the mesh quality could be found in the adoption of mesh adaptive algorithms using remeshing indicators e g based on elements distortion which may improve the quality of the mesh in zones of the domain where it is necessary in adina a steered adaptive mesh sam algorithm can be used only for unstructured meshes adina 2016 therefore in the present study it has not been adopted 5 conclusions the present study is proposed as a benchmark test case to validate numerical results through experimental data which are also available for future comparisons authors decided in the early stage of the work to carry out tests to obtain the necessary material properties of suitable sailclothes materials since their characterization is very limited in the open literature in order to obtain mechanical properties of the material which are fundamental for numerical fsi analyses tensile tests have been carried out with highly accurate testing machines and a photographic non intrusive technique afterwards a series of experimental tests on a square sail free to oscillate have been accomplished in a wind tunnel flying shapes at midspan for several wind speeds have been investigated by means of a high resolution camera the tests have been reproduced in a numerical environment using adina software a strongly coupled partitioned approach has been adopted coupling a fvm rans to solve the fluid domain and a fem to solve the structural one according to a pseudo dynamic procedure the models adopting shell elements revealed to be the most accurate and cost effective in reproducing the experimental test on the other hand membrane elements over predict the final flying shape because of the absence of bending stiffness in their numerical implementation therefore shell elements are considered more suitable in simulating sails undergoing large displacement with highly separated flows and could be adopted for instance to simulate spinnakers or gennakers sails analyses at higher wind speed confirmed good agreement between experimental and numerical results in cases of large displacements and more pronounced mesh distortions as well furthermore since sailclothes are very soft structures it appears that an accurate mechanical characterization of the sail is very important to obtain consistent numerical fsi results new investigations are planned using more refined meshes and adopting smaller y values the modelling of the transversal beam above the sail might also be considered to simulate the flow field in a more realistic way since its influence could be non negligible especially at the highest wind speeds further considerations may also be obtained regarding turbulence models even though the sst one showed good results it is worth noting that in the present study transient numerical simulations have not been carried out since no data about the structural damping coefficient were available however authors are scheduling an experimental test campaign in the marine structures testing lab at university of genoa on sailclothes specimens with the aim to assess such parameter therefore a numerical study on the transient behaviour of the sail will be possible in the future new different experimental tests in the wind tunnel could also be carried out in the future by adding new terms of comparison such as sail force measurements full dynamic measurements of flying shapes by two or more cameras are also desirable real scale tests with actual sail geometries could be developed to evaluate more complex boundary conditions and structural deformations acknowledgments the authors are particularly grateful to professor marco capurro who allowed carrying out tension tests of sail fabric in his lab just before he tragically passed away in may 2017 authors would like to acknowledge the support of ing michele malandra north sails italia who provided sail fabrics for tests

conventional case study is proposed to be used as a benchmark for numerical analyses experimental tests were carried out to provide targets for comparisons in particular the study regarded the estimate of the deformed configuration flying shape in the sailing field of a square sail under a uniform flow regime in a wind tunnel facility several tests have been carried out at different wind velocities the sailcloth has been characterized by means of mono axial tensile tests obtaining young s and shear moduli as well as poisson s coefficients which have then been used as input parameters for numerical analyses test results are considered a benchmark target deserving challenging aspects for numerical simulations in spite of the selected simple test geometry and conditions numerical tests have been carried out by means of a commercial software adina analyses used a strongly coupled partitioned approach between a finite volume method fvm based on reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations whereas a finite element method fem has been adopted for the structural field a comparison has been eventually carried out assessing different numerical models a good overall agreement between experimental and numerical results has been obtained by suitably setting fsi simulation algorithms keywords fluid structure interaction fsi sail cfd fea wind tunnel benchmark 1 introduction and state of the art sails are a clear example of a fluid structure interaction fsi issue from a structural point of view they can be considered as very thin and flexible pretensioned membranes undergoing large displacements because of the pressure field induced by the wind this charming research field has been growing in the last 50 years exploiting experimental and numerical techniques of investigation a rather extensive literature can nowadays be found on this topic nevertheless only a few important works will be reported in the following for the sake of briefness early studies were conducted considering separately the fluid dynamic field and the structural one from the experimental point of view such early works were conducted in wind tunnel environments because of the impossibility of scaling the thickness of a sail by keeping the same mechanical properties of the real scale structure sail models are much stiffer than corresponding prototypes and sometimes they are directly built on purpose with even stiffer materials in order to avoid any structural deformation thus only the flow regime around the rigid or quasi rigid sail plan is studied interesting results can be found in wilkinson 1984 in this work the author studied the interaction effects of a mast on a rigid sail in a bi dimensional case by varying some parameters such as mast s dimensions sail s camber ratio and wind angle of attack aoa he also identified typical flow regions around a mainsail a further important study is reported in flay 1996 where a three dimensional model was tested for the first time in a wind tunnel under twisted flow conditions thus taking advantage of the real wind velocity profile and the variation of aoa along the sails height more recently in fossati and muggiasca 2013 the aerodynamic behaviour of a 3d scaled model was characterized by means of wind tunnel tests the study allowed the characterization of aerodynamic forces using a forced motion technique to assess the aeroelastic response of the sail plan a representation of the aeroelastic effects was proposed showing a hysteretical loop behaviour of the aerodynamic coefficients finally in querad and wilson 2007 the authors carried out a study on a mainsail comparing wind tunnel tests with numerical results obtained by using a commercial rans solver ansys cfx further numerical analyses showed that including the hull shape significantly improves the predictions an increasing number of full scale experimental tests have been published in recent years stackpole 1985 described the tests carried out on a dynamometer boat built at the massachusetts institute of technology already decades ago the 10 7 m boat with an internal frame connected to the hull by six load cells configured to measure forces and moments acting on rigging and sails additional sensors provided data about wind angles and speed at various height from sea level heel and pitch angles and boat speed a more recent work was presented by motta et al 2013 where aerodynamic forces and sail shape measurements using high resolution cameras hrc were simultaneously collected on a mainsail and a spinnaker concurrently used it is also worth mentioning a new 10 m dynamometer boat recently built by the politecnico di milano endowed of sensors on mast rigging and sails and of cameras for sail shapes measurements in fossati et al 2015 the concept design and the building process of the boat are described it is pointed out by fossati s group that sails flying shapes can be investigated using pressure taps positioned on the sails and cameras in addition the boat has been equipped with load cells to measure the overall forces and moments transmitted by sails and rig to the hull some preliminary results are also reported rizzo et al 2009 designed and installed a mast and rigging monitoring system on a very large sail ship to collect data during service while sea trials measured data are more difficult to be obtained analysed and interpreted the information gathered during service life is extremely valuable to calibrate design methods using data from actual loading scenarios as regards numerical simulations applicable to sail design many different approaches both where the fsi coupling is considered or not have been adopted in the last decades early studies made use of non viscous fluid dynamic software subsequently because of the increasingly available computational power further studies have been developed using viscous rans solvers able to predict more complex types of flow one of the first numerical fsi analyses is reported in boote and caponnetto 1991 where the authors wrote a complete procedure for the design of sailing yacht masts and rig for the calculation of the aerodynamic forces a software was realised by the authors based on the lifting surface theory for the stress analysis another dedicated program was developed starting from a multi purpose finite element fe code operating in the non linear domain trimarchi and rizzo 2009 presented a matlab fem code specifically developed for deformation analysis of sails modelled with constant strain triangles cst membrane elements a weakly coupled fsi analysis of a mainsail was carried out coupling the fe code with an aerodynamic panel code among more recent works employing rans codes the study presented in trimarchi et al 2010 is worth mentioning in this work the authors showed the importance of using structural shell elements in fe analysis to capture the wrinkling phenomena in sails simulations indeed its influence on aerodynamic performances especially in downwind sails is significant a strongly coupled partitioned approach was used to solve fsi renzsch and graf 2011 described the implementation of a numerical procedure to couple a commercial ranse software ansys cfx with a structural code developed to study the behaviour of spinnakers the structural code is based on the use of membrane elements adopting wrinkling models a comparison with experimental tests developed in a wind tunnel was also carried out recently sacher et al 2015 proposed an optimization procedure of the trimming of the mainsail of an imoca yacht international monohull open classes association in upwind conditions they tested their procedure both carrying out experimental tests as well as using numerical simulations coupling rans and fem codes a general good agreement was found despite inherent errors in the numerical model and uncertainties of measurements in this paper a simplified case study has been developed on a square woven sailcloth in a wind tunnel the sail undergoes large displacements to validate the prediction performances of the numerical computations for this kind of problems despite its simplicity the proposed test case includes several challenging aspects and allows adjusting the simulation set up and the modelling strategies in full detail the selection of a simple geometry is also mandatory when new approaches or solvers are investigated on complex problem like the definition of the sail flying shape anyhow further cases could be developed in the future studying more realistic and complex sail geometries by considering the rig as well it is believed that the proposed test case is suitable to validate numerical models used in this work and providing benchmark targets for further research activities 2 sailcloth s mechanical properties even if a rather wide literature is available regarding fluid dynamic and fsi experiments very few works regarding sails mechanical properties can be found at least in open literature the work presented in satchwell 1984 can be considered a milestone in this field the primary intent of that study was to carry out a procedure to assess mechanical characteristics of sailclothes standard uniaxial tensile tests on non specified popular types of woven sailcloth specimens most probably dacron have been carried out to assess young s and shear moduli poisson s coefficient as well as tensile strength of the fabric mcmillan 2009 published a work on the effects of uv light and moisture on the strength of sail materials specimens were subjected to an intense treatment exposing them to uv rays and air with 100 of relative humidity tensile tests were performed on the treated specimens and compared with results obtained from new specimens results were reported in terms of loss of strength but no data were provided in terms of elastic moduli a study on a new sailcloth called dilon organza since engineered from dilon spinnaker fabric and organza a dressmaking fabric sewn together in the warp and fill directions was published by dewalt 2014 cloth specimens were tested for stretch resistance along warp and fill directions damage from flutter testing and tensile strength after exposure to uv light different results were reported in this work yet no data were provided in terms of elastic moduli of the material to the best of the authors knowledge no other systematic studies except commercial information of fabric makers are available so far in open literature about sailclothes characterization because of the difficulty in finding adequate mechanical properties of sailclothes to be used as input parameters in fe structural calculations some preliminary experimental tests have been carried out at the engineering materials laboratory of the department of civil environmental and architectural engineering of the university of genoa it should be outlined that complete and accurate figures of mechanical properties of the clothes material is of primary importance to accurately predict the structural response north sails italia company provided specimens used for the mechanical characterization and for the wind tunnel test in the following a brief description of the tensile tests is reported further details can be found in ghelardi 2017 2 1 tensile tests description north sails italia company provided a woven sailcloth manufactured in dacron having a density of 235 g m2 for woven sailclothes it is reasonable to assume an orthotropic nature of the material therefore the fabric was tested with fibres oriented at 0 90 and 45 i e along fill warp and bias directions for a total of three specimens in order to obtain the complete mechanical characterization of the material such hypotheses are particularly valid in the present work because the geometry and the loading conditions adopted in the fsi test are rather simple in case of actual sails more complex anisotropic models may be more representative of the structural behaviour namely measurements provided elastic moduli in warp fill directions ew and ef the corresponding poisson coefficients νwf and νfw specimens dimensions are reported in fig 1 mono axial tensile tests up to the breaking point were carried out using a zwick roell z020 testing machine machine measurements might be subjected to an error of 1 according to its calibration certificate data have been acquired and conditioned providing as a result force strain plots afterwards young s moduli have been estimated using actual geometries of each specimen measured on purpose to evaluate the poisson s coefficients νwf and νfw a contactless photographic technique has been used to measure the transversal deformation of the specimens with respect to the acting direction of the load a mono axial load has been applied with the same test machine used for tension tests on new specimens transversal deformation has been captured with a dino lite digital microscope having a 1280 1024 pixel resolution poisson coefficient estimates have been eventually obtained through imagej a software for digital image processing released into the public domain national institute of health 1987 the measurements have been carried out applying an axial load ranging between 30 n and 150 n thus being within the elastic limit of the material showing satisfactory repeatability and accuracy of measurements the accuracy of the measurements has been estimated as low as 10 μm taking into account the resolution of the digital microscope which was deemed sufficient to precisely attain the poisson ratios 2 2 tensile tests results results have been reported in terms of stress strain curves until specimen rupture fig 2 it can be noted that warp fibers present the highest breaking load as well as for equal load value the lowest strain value furthermore as expected bias specimen showed the highest deformation focusing on the initial part of the curves it can be noted that different linear limit response can be found for each specimen depending on the loading direction fig 2 the highlighted linear limit reported in figure shows the linearity limit of the curves such limit shows the threshold for which a linear response can be assumed for tensile loading condition along fill s fibers direction a linear behaviour has been estimated to fit the initial part of the curve the linear limit has been identified as the point where the discrepancy between the experimental curve and the linear regression becomes larger than the linear regression deviation once the linear trend limits have been identified for the different curves young s moduli have been computed poisson s ratios have been detected as described in previous section thus allowing the calculation of the shear modulus g as well table 1 reports the results for the tested material 3 experimental wind tunnel tests the present experimental test has been designed as a benchmark in simulating fsi problems related to sails experimental tests have been carried out in the wind tunnel of the department of civil chemical and environmental engineering dicca of the polytechnic school of the university of genoa the wind tunnel is a closed loop subsonic circuit the flow velocity in the working section is limited by about 34 m s the working section is 8 8 m long with a cross section of about 1 70 1 35 width x height meters the tunnel presents two test sections as far as the present work concerns tests have been carried out in the former one where the velocity is uniform within 1 at every wind speed and the wall boundary layer has a thickness of the order of 2 cm within such a test section the level of longitudinal turbulence intensity is less than 0 25 but it can be increased up to 10 inserting suitable grids 3 1 wind tunnel test description the study is focused on the behaviour of a square specimen sailcloth immersed in the airflow at a constant velocity the model was clamped on one edge and free to oscillate on the opposite one however to avoid the sail waving like a flag two thin steel flat bars have been applied on the lowest free edge on both upwind and downwind faces having a total mass of 0 508 kg 5 n self weight approximately the thickness of each bar was 5 mm the airflow comes from the intake inflating the sail and generating a detached flow downstream of the sail it represents a typical stream condition in dead downwind points of sailing a schematic representation of the experimental arrangement is reported in fig 3 a fig 3 b and c report main dimensions of the test setup the overall dimensions of the sail were limited by the need to maintain a blockage area ratio in the wind tunnel below 5 the upper edge was clamped on a fixed stiff aluminium beam spanning from one sidewall to the opposite one in the wind tunnel orthogonally to the flow as shown in fig 4 orthogonal lines equally spaced by 40 mm have been drawn on the sail in order to detect its flying shape by post processing recorded videos a series of stationary tests have been performed at several wind speeds no data have been collected in the transitory except for the initial run up from zero to the first velocity value about 3 7 m s tested wind speeds were in the range 3 7 10 4 m s table 2 the range has been chosen in order to generate the largest possible displacements without the occurrence of complex aeroelastic phenomena e g fluttering flying shapes were detected using a high resolution camera namely a full frame nikon d800 having 36 mpx resolution with a nikkor af s 70 200 vrii f 2 8 lens set at 135 mm of focal length the camera was positioned on one side of the tunnel aligned with the test section and perpendicular to the airflow videos were recorder in hd resolution at a frame rate of 60 hz furthermore pictures at full resolution have been collected at 5 frames per second fps images have been post processed through imagej software national institute of health 1987 3 2 wind tunnel test results tests have been carried out in smooth flow conditions at air temperature of 24 5 c with 65 of relative humidity and a longitudinal turbulence intensity of about 0 25 as expected a growing inflation of the sail has been observed during the trials when increasing the flow speed an almost stationary behaviour with moderate oscillations has been detected at each wind speed due to progressive vortex shedding the oscillations arose in the longitudinal plane especially at the lowest speeds oscillations became more severe increasing the wind speed in particular at the highest wind speed 10 4 m s the specimen was excited in a more complex way with a higher oscillation frequency showing the insurgence of aeroelastic phenomena and behaving similarly to a flag in an airflow out of plane oscillations have been noticed no particular edge effects have been detected on the free vertical edges of the sails this is mainly due to the geometry of the specimen to the fixities on the horizontal edges the rectangular beam and the flat bar weight and due to boundary conditions in general for this reason it has been assumed reasonable to show data in terms of displacements of the vertical section at mid span sail flying shapes were extrapolated from pictures taking advantage of the pattern drawn on the sail and of the pattern suitably placed on the other side of the tunnel with respect to the camera fig 5 the pattern behind the sail is composed by squares having sides of 40 mm sectional flying shapes are reported in terms of maxima and minima oscillations detected fig 5 also shows minima and maxima oscillations detected at different wind speeds as mentioned the sail oscillated in way of its equilibrium position under a certain wind speed flow oscillation amplitudes were obtained by analysing the video images and taking lowest and highest positions no results were reported at the highest wind speed because of the fluttering behaviour of the sail fig 6 reports all detected maxima flying shapes at different airflow speeds in table 3 oscillations frequencies are reported an increasing trend can be observed however cases 4 and 8 show lower frequencies with respect to the previous case indicating a slightly more stable behaviour 4 numerical analyses in this section the description of the experimental wind tunnel test simulated in adina s environment will be presented a short introduction on the theoretical basis of the fsi numerical analyses is provided in the following encouraging the interested reader to deepen the topic on other specific publications e g donea et al 2004 förster et al 2007 4 1 fluid structure interaction theory and methodology the present fsi approach is based on a arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale continuum description a detailed description of this well known approach can be found in donea et al 2004 baiges and codina 2010 two way fsi problems with large deformations can be solved numerically via two different methods the monolithic approach also called direct or simultaneous and the partitioned one also called segregated or iterative the first one consists in solving a large non linear system including both fluid and solid equations the partitioned approach consists in solving the fluid and solid equations separately using different solvers the more appropriate method solves its own field and data are transferred through the interface to the other domain fluid and solid hence in this case a coupling algorithm must be used to take into account the interaction between the fluid and structural domains further considerations and analyses on these different solution methods can be found in michler et al 2004 and degroote et al 2009 a comparison between these two different approaches was carried out in adina environment in a previous study on a similar subject by ghelardi et al 2017 hence a strongly coupled partitioned approach has been used in the present study to solve the problem stress and displacements criteria between the fluid and solid solutions must be satisfied on the interface in order to reach iteration convergence in this case because of the complexity of the flow a viscous fvm solver has been used to solve the fluid domain whilst a fem has been employed to solve the structural equations further details about the fsi solution algorithms used in adina can be found in adina 2016 the mesh updating approach used by adina is based on a laplacian smoothing method where the nodal position in the fluid domain are updated starting from the updated position of the interface nodes which are taken as a boundary condition for the fluid domain in addition to guarantee a high quality mesh during the computation even when encountering large displacements a leader follower algorithm has been adopted in mesh updating where the displacements of a user defined leader point affect displacements of a follower point progressively deforming the rest of the mesh in a smooth way adina 2016 4 2 considerations on shell elements used in sails analyses when a boat is sailing in dead downwind conditions the sail generates no aerodynamic lift so that the boat is propelled by the drag generated by the wind which inflates the sail undergoing large displacements the same kind of flow condition can be assumed for the present test case structural shell elements are considered more reliable with respect to usually adopted membrane elements in downwind sails analyses trimarchi 2012 this conclusion comes from the fact that the stiffness operator of shell elements includes the bending stiffness whilst membrane elements the other type of elements commonly used in sail simulations are implemented considering membrane stiffness only therefore in the present paper shell elements adopting different material models have been used in order to avoid any locking phenomena locking free mixed interpolation of tensorial components mitc shell elements have been used chapelle bathe 2011 however when using shell elements in sails modelling some complications arise in the inversion of the stiffness matrix the small thickness of the sail generates diagonal terms close to zero making difficult to invert the stiffness operator in the present study the approach proposed in trimarchi 2012 has been adopted to overcome the problem the issue is solved by introducing in the structural system also the mass and damping matrices thus improving the conditioning of the global systems however it results in higher computational costs it should be noted that not being interested in solving the real structural dynamics in the present case a fictitious damping value close or equal to the critical one could be used hence the time integration step is no more representative of a physical quantity and it should be regarded just as a numerical integration step since the damping is non realistic the damping matrix has been implemented according to the rayleigh s approach as follows 1 c α m β k where α is a coefficient proportional to the total system mass matrix whilst β is proportional to the initial total system stiffness matrix i e the matrix at initial zero displacements bathe 1996 trimarchi 2012 suggested a method to estimate α and β constant values which multiply mass and stiffness operators respectively with the aim to minimize computational time mathematically derived in a linear framework but then adopted in a non linear analysis as well trimarchi s procedure let to define α and β such that critical damping is assumed for the first natural frequency whilst higher frequencies were overdamped constants have been defined as follows 2 α ω n β 1 ω n where ω n is the first natural frequency of the structure computed via a modal analysis in this work the same approach has been used to set up the damping constants 4 3 numerical test setup a virtual wind tunnel test has been created in adina 9 2 0 environment adina 2016 to reduce the computational effort a preliminary test adopting a bi dimensional approach has been explored unfortunately due to the aspect ratio of the tested sail specimen this simplification is inappropriate because the 2 d model systematically over predicts the pressure field and consequently the fluid forces acting to the sail generate unrealistic flying shapes this is mainly due to the boundary effects in span wise direction which occurs in the 3 d geometry but are neglected by the 2 d simplified analysis after some preliminary tests on the fluid domain size not reported here for the sake of shortness the final dimensions have been identified as reported in fig 7 in particular the transversal section has the same dimensions of the actual tunnel section fig 3 the transversal beam supporting the sail and the flat bars applied to the free side of the sail were not modelled in the fluid domain and preliminarily their influence was assumed negligible on sail s aerodynamics especially for steady state analyses regarding the structural modelling the weight applied to the specimen by the flat bars was modelled as a static force acting along the vertical z axis direction in fact since the intention was to reproduce the steady deformation of the sail there was no interest in modelling flat bars and their mass preliminary tests showed that no particular boundary effects occur at the corners of the lowest free edge a simply supported structural boundary condition was applied to the clamped edge of the sail thus allowing rotations around x axis concerning the fluid domain a free slip condition was set on tunnel s walls for sake of simplicity since it was assumed that the simulation of the boundary layer on the tunnel s walls had a limited impact on the sail deformation whilst a no slip condition was applied on the sail in order to solve the boundary layer physical input parameters of the simulations are summarized in table 4 and table 5 for both fluid and solid domain the study was aimed at assessing which structural model simulates in a more accurate way the experimental tests for this reason and because of the rather large computational efforts required the analysis was limited at few wind speeds so far the fsi problem was solved by using a strong partitioned approach and exploiting an algebraic multi grid iterative solver amg1 solver in adina it should be noted that the adopted numerical setup has been evaluated in previous analyses on a similar issue ghelardi et al 2017 here fsi convergence checks have been imposed for both forces and displacements as regards the fluid solution a euler 1st order time marching scheme has been adopted to solve the fluid problem a pressure implicit with splitting of operators piso algorithm was adopted for the pressure velocity coupling issa 1985 because of the large flow separation zone induced by the sail a k ω sst turbulence model menter 1993 has been considered the most suitable to simulate the physics of the problem in fact such turbulence model is generally recognised to provide accurate results in the prediction of downwind sails aerodynamics see e g collie et al 2001 querad and wilson 2007 a newmark implicit time integration scheme has been adopted to solve the structural dynamics equations as a first approximation a linear isotropic material model has been adopted using mitc 4 nodes shell elements young s modulus and poisson coefficient have been averaged with respect to the values reported in table 1 as far as the mesh updating is concerned a leader row of nodes has been identified on the sail s free edge whilst corresponding follower points were defined on the tunnel walls fig 8 structural rayleigh s damping constants have been obtained according to trimarchi s procedure trimarchi 2012 adopted α and β values are reported in table 6 first flexural and second torsional modal shapes are reported in fig 9 respectively on the left and on the right calculated frequencies have a value of 4 74 hz and 11 00 hz respectively 4 4 mesh sensitivity analysis structured meshes have been used in both fluid and structural domains in the first case hexahedral elements have been adopted fig 10 a whilst quadratic elements have been used in the latter one fig 10 b four different levels of refinements have been investigated to analyse the solution trends with respect to the mesh size table 7 analyses started using a 0 01s time step to overcome initial convergence difficulties growing then up to 0 25s during the simulation when the solution trend is converging the choice to increase the integration step may introduce a larger numerical error but it significantly reduces computational costs as regards the fluid solution a maximum and an average courant number of 300 and 90 was reached respectively for the most refined fluid grid even if these time steps may appear to be too large for a time accurate solution they have been considered acceptable in the light of the final steady solution required therefore the initial transition can be numerically smoothed to avoid excessive computational costs because only the final steady solution is of interest anyhow further cases should be considered in the future aiming to investigate the influence of the time integration step on the solution s accuracy it should be also outlined once again that since a fictitious critical damping has been adopted the numerical structural dynamic solution is not anymore representative of the real physical behaviour of the sail during the transient and at steady state therefore the time step should not be thought as a real physical quantity but it should be interpreted as a numerical integration step only fig 11 shows global forces trend during the simulations for different mesh refinements average y values at the final converged step for every deformed mesh of the sail s upwind and downwind faces are reported in table 8 to reduce the total computational effort it has been decided to impose a first cell wall function thanks to this numerical feature a high y 1 value can be set on the wall boundaries from a numerical point of view this choice is also supported by the consideration that most of the forces acting on the sail are due to the pressure action rather than to the shear stress consequently any shear error should have a small impact on the calculated final flying shape fig 12 reports force trend increasing the mesh density to assess the accuracy of the solution an evaluation of the discretization error has been carried out by using the richardson s extrapolation procedure asme 2008 which outlined an overestimation of the total force of about 0 55 between the case of mesh 4 and the ideal grid independent solution therefore the accuracy of the solution has been considered well acceptable for the purposes of the present work considering the required computational effort from a fsi perspective a comparison among the numerical results and the experimental ones in terms of sectional flying shape at midspan when varying the mesh size is reported in fig 13 it can be noted that the first two meshes show a flying shape closer to the minimum detected experimental oscillation in the highest part of the sail while they are in better agreement with the maximum experimental oscillation in the lowest part however the global shape is not fully in line with the real one on the other hand mesh 3 and especially mesh 4 simulate a flying shape in substantial agreement with the maximum limit of the experimental oscillation it should be outlined that in the experimental tests when the sail reached the maximum displacement configuration it was not in a stable configuration since immediately after reaching that condition one or more vortices detached causing a pressure drop on the whole sail which then deflated however this dynamic behaviour could not be captured in the present numerical analysis since as mentioned fictitious critical structural damping and too large time integration steps have been adopted resulting in a quasi static analysis in practice therefore in the simulation the sail reached the configuration at the maximum oscillation resulting fixed in that condition without showing any subsequent oscillation in time fig 14 shows velocity magnitude pressure and turbulent kinetic energy contour plots for the fluid dynamic part on a longitudinal section at mid span of the sail for mesh 4 flow is completely detached as expected streamlines depiction identified the presence of a double vortex on the leeward side fig 15 4 5 comparison among different structural models further investigations have been developed adopting a linear elastic orthotropic material assumption exploiting shell elements and a linear elastic isotropic material with membrane elements orthotropic material characteristics are reported in table 1 it should be noted that warp fibers were oriented along vertical z axis direction fig 10 for the sake of completeness a comparison with membrane elements has been carried out as well flying shapes are reported in fig 16 because of the high computational costs of the simulations the comparison has been performed adopting mesh 3 models using isotropic and orthotropic shell elements showed an almost matching shape shell isotr curve lies underneath the shell ortho one the same behaviour has been found for models adopting membrane elements it is worth noting that since the sailcloth is quite balanced in fill and warp directions the averaged young s modulus adopted in the isotropic model is quite similar to the one adopted in the orthotropic model furthermore the simplicity of the geometry of the structure and the symmetric flow conditions contributed to this result softer behaviour of membranes with respect to shell elements can be due to the absence of rotational degrees of freedom in the formulation of such kind of elements involving some deformation energy and resulting in a global lower bending stiffness of the model 4 6 comparison at high wind speeds two further tests have been carried out to simulate the problem at higher wind speeds where larger mesh deformation occurred namely cases 5 and 8 where wind speed was 6 1 m s and 9 2 m s respectively see table 2 a medium and a high speed where no particular dynamic phenomena where observed have been selected speed 9 showed more significant dynamic phenomena see section 3 2 as regards the structural model shell elements assuming an orthotropic material model have been adopted mesh 3 table 7 has been chosen for the following analyses to reduce computational time the same initial condition was imposed in all tests i e the sail was flat and perfectly vertical as shown in fig 8 at t0 fig 17 reports the analysed cases including the previous one at the lowest wind speed 3 7 m s for comparison purposes in all cases the software showed flying shapes close to the maxima experimental limit thus providing a trend for different wind speeds again the simulation is considered satisfactory in the case of the highest wind speed equal to 9 2 m s the computed flying shape shows a slightly higher inflation in the upper part of the sail with respect to the experimental test this could be due by the fact that the influence of the rigid transversal bar where the sail was constrained not modelled in the simulations had a higher influence on the aerodynamics of the sail at high wind speed beside the constraint effect of the structural model built up by shell elements the aerodynamic field is more influenced by the upper vortex of the wake moreover the fluid mesh needs to be more deformed because of the larger sail inflation possibly affecting the computation accuracy fig 18 shows a comparison among fluid meshes in the above mentioned three analysed cases in fact it can be noted in the latter case v8 a more relevant mesh distortion especially in the zone close to the sail constraint thus implying a lower cell quality particularly in the upper part of the sail fig 19 reports a detail of the mesh in the case v8 it can be noted that elements on the upwind side of the sail underwent a stretch whilst elements on the downwind side are compressed possible solutions to improve the mesh quality could be found in the adoption of mesh adaptive algorithms using remeshing indicators e g based on elements distortion which may improve the quality of the mesh in zones of the domain where it is necessary in adina a steered adaptive mesh sam algorithm can be used only for unstructured meshes adina 2016 therefore in the present study it has not been adopted 5 conclusions the present study is proposed as a benchmark test case to validate numerical results through experimental data which are also available for future comparisons authors decided in the early stage of the work to carry out tests to obtain the necessary material properties of suitable sailclothes materials since their characterization is very limited in the open literature in order to obtain mechanical properties of the material which are fundamental for numerical fsi analyses tensile tests have been carried out with highly accurate testing machines and a photographic non intrusive technique afterwards a series of experimental tests on a square sail free to oscillate have been accomplished in a wind tunnel flying shapes at midspan for several wind speeds have been investigated by means of a high resolution camera the tests have been reproduced in a numerical environment using adina software a strongly coupled partitioned approach has been adopted coupling a fvm rans to solve the fluid domain and a fem to solve the structural one according to a pseudo dynamic procedure the models adopting shell elements revealed to be the most accurate and cost effective in reproducing the experimental test on the other hand membrane elements over predict the final flying shape because of the absence of bending stiffness in their numerical implementation therefore shell elements are considered more suitable in simulating sails undergoing large displacement with highly separated flows and could be adopted for instance to simulate spinnakers or gennakers sails analyses at higher wind speed confirmed good agreement between experimental and numerical results in cases of large displacements and more pronounced mesh distortions as well furthermore since sailclothes are very soft structures it appears that an accurate mechanical characterization of the sail is very important to obtain consistent numerical fsi results new investigations are planned using more refined meshes and adopting smaller y values the modelling of the transversal beam above the sail might also be considered to simulate the flow field in a more realistic way since its influence could be non negligible especially at the highest wind speeds further considerations may also be obtained regarding turbulence models even though the sst one showed good results it is worth noting that in the present study transient numerical simulations have not been carried out since no data about the structural damping coefficient were available however authors are scheduling an experimental test campaign in the marine structures testing lab at university of genoa on sailclothes specimens with the aim to assess such parameter therefore a numerical study on the transient behaviour of the sail will be possible in the future new different experimental tests in the wind tunnel could also be carried out in the future by adding new terms of comparison such as sail force measurements full dynamic measurements of flying shapes by two or more cameras are also desirable real scale tests with actual sail geometries could be developed to evaluate more complex boundary conditions and structural deformations acknowledgments the authors are particularly grateful to professor marco capurro who allowed carrying out tension tests of sail fabric in his lab just before he tragically passed away in may 2017 authors would like to acknowledge the support of ing michele malandra north sails italia who provided sail fabrics for tests

capabilities and merits and provides a detailed comparison this is followed by a thorough analysis of advantages and disadvantages of both electrically and hydraulically actuated manipulators

in addition an extensive bibliography covering research results in the field of control algorithms is presented including low level motion control high level kinematic control and motion planning schemes along with the implementation issues keywords underwater manipulation manipulator control robot arm marine robotics rov 1 introduction a manipulator robot arm is considered to be the most suitable tool for executing subsea intervention operations hence unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs such as remotely operated vehicles rovs and in some cases autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are equipped with one or more underwater manipulators uuvs with manipulators are often called underwater vehicle manipulator systems uvms the majority of existing underwater manipulators used on uuvs are anthropomorphic i e they are designed to resemble a human arm these manipulators are composed of a sequence of rigid bodies links interconnected by means of revolute joints with a suitable angular displacement between them and grippers or other interchangeable tools attached at the end effector for the observation of their surroundings they are usually accompanied with additional equipment comprising of one or more cameras and spotlights mounted on the base underwater vehicle and or on the manipulator itself underwater manipulators are used for a variety of subsea tasks in different applications within offshore oil and gas marine renewable energy mre and marine civil engineering industries as well as in marine science and military applications capocci et al 2017 as they are being used in a wide range of applications subsea manipulators are designed for different purposes e g there are manipulators with limited mobility equipped with grippers for lifting large heavy objects manipulators used for fixing a detachable gripper to a selected sunken object grabber manipulators equipped with grippers or vacuum cups used to fix an underwater vehicle to submerged structures or near flat walls during the operation manipulators equipped with inspection devices dexterous intervention manipulators with grippers that can carry different tools used for repair and maintenance operations on submerged structures etc usually work class rovs are equipped with two manipulators in most cases one simple powerful grabber to hold the rov near the hydro engineering structure or wreck while the other manipulator performs the actual intervention task some of the tasks underwater manipulators are designed to execute include pipe inspection christ and wernli 2014 salvage of sunken objects chang et al 2004 mine disposal fletcher 2000 cleaning surfaces davey et al 1999 opening and closing valves drilling rope cutting christ and wernli 2014 cable laying and repair clearing debris and fishing nets biological jones 2009 and geological sampling noé et al 2006 archaeological work coleman et al 2003 etc in general manipulators are located at the front side of the underwater vehicle but this is not always the case e g there are vehicles with a manipulator located at the bottom side ribas et al 2012 a brief overview on underwater manipulators can be found in the underwater robots review paper by yuh and west 2001 antonelli 2014 provided a good theoretical background for underwater manipulators from the modeling and control point of view however a complete article encapsulating relevant practical and theoretical knowledge state of the art technology as well as up to date research done in this area can not be found in the literature therefore the aim of this paper is to provide a review of underwater manipulators covering all the relevant aspects from an applied underwater research point of view fig 1 outlines the factors governing performance for underwater manipulation which are expanded upon in detail within this paper the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes mechanical design features and capabilities of existing underwater manipulators and gives their comparison section 3 analyses underwater manipulator actuation methods section 4 describes control systems of commercially available subsea manipulators sections 5 and 6 cover academic research achievements in the area of motion control for underwater manipulators and underwater vehicle manipulator systems respectively the state of the art in kinematics control and motion planning algorithms is covered in section 7 while section 8 focuses on force control algorithms finally section 9 presents conclusion 2 mechanical design in order to be able to operate in deep waters and cope with the harsh conditions of subsea environment specialised materials are used in the construction of underwater manipulators additionally depending on the task for which they are designed underwater manipulators have to meet relevant requirements regarding the size of the workspace in which they are to operate lifting capacity wrist torque etc table 1 lists specifications of existing commercial underwater manipulators the most common materials used in construction of underwater manipulators are metal alloys such as titanium ti 6 4 anodized aluminium alloys 5083 6082 t6 6061 t6 7075 t6 a356 stainless steel alloys 316 630 660 as well as some plastics polyethylene the properties of these materials are relatively high strength and corrosion resistance and good machinability to reduce the weight in the water and minimize the actuator burden some experiments have been done on using buoyant materials on underwater manipulators ishimi et al 1991 typically commercially available underwater manipulators are rated between 3000 and 6500 m of sea water msw however some manipulators can operate in depths up to 7000 msw e g schilling robotics titan 4 and a prototype manipulator developed by zhang et al 2014 additionaly there are a some systems designed for full ocean depth 11000 msw woods hole oceanographic institute in collaboration with kraft robotics designed one such manipulator for the purpose of mariana trench exploration mission bowen et al 2008 others include magnum 7 a product of ise ltd and the arm and mk 37 developed by the western space and marine inc the size of underwater manipulators is described by a parameter called reach which represents the length of the whole manipulator kinematic chain along with the range of motion of joints it determines the size of manipulator workspace a set of points that can be reached by its end effector cao et al 2011 reach of existing underwater manipulators ranges from 0 5 m for the grabber manipulators up to 2 4 m for heavy duty manipulators maximum wrist torque which underwater manipulators are capable of producing ranges from 8nm to 250nm according to iso 13628 8 2002 iso 13628 8 2002 rotary low torque rov interfaces on subsea production systems which are typically used on subsea tree needle valves are rated to maximum 75nm additionally lifting carrying payload capacity for underwater manipulators ranges from 5 kg up to 500 kg manufacturers often provide different parameters for manipulator lift capacity max nominal at full extension at rated speed through envelope etc which makes the comparison non trivial as the carrying capacity is not a fixed value but depends on the pose of the manipulator underwater manipulator weight in air is between 6 kg and 150 kg however their weight in water is more important as it determines the buoyancy needed on the base vehicle in order to compensate for the manipulator the weight and size are very important factors as they are directly responsible for the amount of dynamic coupling introduced between the manipulator and the underwater robot on which it is mounted and can thus influence the performance of the whole system in order to be able to fully exploit manipulator characteristics the manipulator weight should be a low enough percentage of the whole underwater robot weight so that the dynamic coupling can be neglected or at least taken into account as an external disturbance that can be dealt with by the dynamic positioning of underwater robot if this exists higher weight and bigger size bring about higher demands concerning the robustness of underwater robot thruster system to the disturbance caused by the dynamic coupling in future research this constraint might be relaxed table 2 presents relative manipulator to vehicle weight for the typical commercial heavy medium and light work class rovs it can be seen that this ratio is significantly low even for the light work class commercial vehicles underwater manipulators can be equipped with various types of grippers on the end effector the commercial ones come with different interchangeable grippers each of which has their own specific purpose a common gripper type is one with parallel acting jaws which includes a slot for a standard t bar handle iso 13628 8 2002 and its primary function is grasping different objects and tools in a variety of subsea operations tooling is generally designed with a t bar exactly for this purpose different grippers include three four finger intermeshing jaws two three finger floating jaws scissor jaws suction foots etc gripper actuators are usually hydraulic and the gripping force of commercially available grippers ranges from 35 kgf to 652 kgf depending on the nature of the task for which they are designed underwater manipulators come with different number of degrees of freedom dof both commercial and experimental underwater manipulators are usually designed with three to six dofs without taking gripper s mobility into account the reason for this is that three dofs are sufficient for achieving an arbitrary position and six dofs for both arbitrary position and orientation of the end effector tool in the workspace spong et al 2005 the term n function is often used in the literature to describe the number of actuators contained in a manipulator and this term includes the gripper s mobility as well so for example a seven function manipulator means that there are six actuators responsible for manipulator motion that provide six true dofs plus one actuator for gripper jaw mobility underwater manipulators with seven or more dofs without gripper mobility are not very common but they do exist true seven dof manipulators are said to be inherently redundant from the kinematic point of view siciliano et al 2009 this feature can play an important role in the automation of manipulators since the redundancy can be exploited for a secondary objective such as obstacle avoidance which will be discussed later some of the work with seven dof underwater manipulators has been reported by marani et al 2009 and ribas et al 2015 and with eight dof manipulator by greig and broome 1994 some authors proposed a multi stage manipulator a micro macro manipulator concept having large positioning manipulator carrying a smaller manipulator for fine precision work ishimi et al 1991 asokan et al 2003 any robotics application of underwater manipulators requires applying kinematics modeling planning and control algorithms underwater manipulators generally have serial chain mechanical structure similar to industrial robot arms there is much literature about robot kinematics that can be applied to underwater manipulators some of which can be found in spong et al 2005 siciliano et al 2009 corke 2011 additional literature about vehicle manipulator systems can be found in from et al 2014 and more specific literature related to underwater vehicle manipulator systems in antonelli 2014 3 actuation in the early 90 s a few authors proposed and experimented on seawater driven actuators for subsea manipulators ishimi et al 1991 yoshinada et al 1991 some of the benefits of water hydraulics are low viscosity high power density non flammable properties and zero environmental impact krutz and chua 2004 however this actuation approach was abandoned over the years due to its various disadvantages such as corrosive and abrasive properties lubrication and sealing issues unsuitable working temperature range etc today all the existing commercially available underwater manipulators and most of the experimental prototype underwater manipulators developed for research purposes run on either oil hydraulic or electric power both of which have their advantages and disadvantages denket 2006 proposed a hybrid power structure using both hydraulic and electric actuators for a single manipulator in order to have the benefit of both however this actuation method has not yet found use in the commercial sector biodegradable fluids have begun to be introduced to minimize the impact on the environment of fluid leaks 3 1 hydraulic manipulators in general hydraulic actuators are capable of producing an output force torque much larger than the force applied on the input without the use of mechanical components such as gears and levers direct drive which is a necessity for the implementation with electric actuators thus hydraulic systems have higher power to weight ratio payload capability which goes up to the order of three for the existing commercial hydraulic underwater manipulators whereas that ratio is one or less for the electrical ones for this reason and because they require fewer parts hydraulic systems are more compact for the same carrying capacity additionally hydraulic systems are inherently pressurized i e the internal pressure is higher than the ambient pressure so they are not as susceptible to the sea water ingress as are their electric counterparts another advantage of hydraulic systems is that they possess inbuilt protection against overload due to these benefits the vast majority of commercial manipulators operating underwater are driven by hydraulic oil typically actuators with limited motion such as piston cylinders and rotary vane actuators are used to drive manipulator joints however in some cases gerotors which are a type of hydraulic motors with continuous motion are used for wrist joint actuation the medium used for power transmission pressurized hydraulic fluid is conveyed from a reservoir to actuators through flexible hoses or rigid pipes by a hydraulic power unit hpu electrically driven pump and pressure regulator the motion of hydraulic systems is controlled by regulating the hydraulic fluid flow this is done by means of different electro hydraulic valves such as directional control valves switching bang bang proportional valves or servo valves these valves are located either in an external valve pack or are integrated in the body of the manipulator along with hoses pipes and electronic circuits in the latter case inner manipulator chambers containing valves and accompanying electronic circuits are oil filled and pressurized by a pressure compensator which maintains the internal pressure slightly above the external pressure leading commercial manufacturers of hydraulic underwater manipulators are kraft telerobotics schilling robotics cybernetix hydro lek among others some of the manipulators are presented in figs 2 5 apart from industrial manufacturers a number of research groups have been designing and developing experimental prototype hydraulic underwater manipulators some of the manipulators with specifications and robot configurations similar to the commercially available seven function manipulators used on work class rovs have been reported by yao et al 2009 and zhang et al 2014 conversely zuyao et al 2011 focused on atypical configuration with less dofs despite their numerous advantages hydraulically driven manipulators have drawbacks unlike their electrical equivalents they can feature poor positioning accuracy and are not suited for implementation of fine control of the interaction force with the environment during contact tasks terribile et al 1993 these limitations are not substantial in the conventional master slave teleoperation however in the case of implementation of automatic robotic functions their significance is of great concern another drawback of hydraulic systems is leakage of minor amount of hydraulic fluid which is almost impossible to solve and the necessity to protect fluids from contamination both of which bring about demands for the highest quality standards and materials for manufacturing of components making hydraulic systems more expensive moreover hydraulic manipulators require complementary equipment such as hydraulic pump reservoir filters regulators valves etc most work class rovs are propelled by hydraulically actuated thrusters and therefore hydraulic power and equipment are already available on the base vehicles however this is not always the case e g the available power can be insufficient for running both thrusters and the manipulator at the same time or if the vehicle s thrusters are electrically actuated it is less likely that the vehicle has a hpu on the other hand electrical power is the only additional requirement for an electrical manipulator and it can usually already be found on an underwater robot 3 2 electric manipulators electric underwater manipulators are less frequent in commercial use but are often custom made as prototypes for research purposes actuators which are commonly used are brushless dc bldc electric motors with harmonic drive gears featuring low backlash and large reduction ratio to stop water ingress the actuators are oil filled which also provides lubrication and cooling frequently to avoid having external cables or possible entanglement power and signal cables are fed through the same hoses used for pressure compensation terribile et al 1994 experimental prototypes using magnetic coupling mechanisms for transferring torque into joints as an alternative approach for watertightness can be found in ishitsuka and ishii 2007a and ishitsuka and ishii 2007b the main advantage of electrically driven manipulators is the capability for precise motion and force torque control as they are inherently equivalent to the industrial robot arms depending on the nature of the task electric underwater manipulators can find use in subsea intervention operations however for most industrial intervention tasks they often do not meet the speed reliability and strength or force requirements hildebrandt et al 2009a the leading commercial manufacturer of electric underwater manipulators is eca robotics whose manipulator 7e is presented in fig 6 one of the first articles addressing the design of electrically driven underwater manipulator was presented by yoerger et al 1991 where a three dof manipulator was developed for the woods hole oceanographic institution s jason rov a six dof electrical manipulator developed by tecnomare and ansaldo in italy was reported in terribile et al 1994 having 2 1m reach with maximum payload of 30 kg another example of the early work can be found in smith et al 1994 where a five dof manipulator called poseidon was developed consisting of 1m reach operational depth of up to 100m and lifting capability of 5 kg collaborating with the autonomous systems laboratory of the university of hawaii for the sauvim auv project ansaldo developed a seven dof manipulator called maris 7080 fig 7 yuh et al 1998 marani et al 2009 rated for 6000m depth it has 1 4m reach and 6 kg payload at full extension two seven dof manipulators also developed by ansaldo were used within the amadeus project lane et al 1997 casalino et al 2001 for cooperative sampling in 2007 the space system laboratory at the university of maryland teamed with the woods hole oceanographic institute and developed a six dof subsea arctic manipulator for underwater retrieval and autonomous interventions samurai lewandowski et al 2008 some more recent work on the development of experimental electrical underwater manipulators can be found in pandian and sakagami 2010 where a three dof manipulator was developed for validation of control algorithms cobos guzman et al 2013 where a three dof manipulator called lafmia umi i was developed which was to be mounted on a mini submarine and sheikhbahaee et al 2014 where a four dof manipulator called kavosh 4 was developed for usage in towing tank in xu et al 2010 a design for an electrical three dof manipulator was proposed which was later developed and tested xiao et al 2011 shen et al 2011 and within the rauvi project fernandez et al 2013 reported modifying a commercially available electric manipulator arm 5e a product of csip now eca as a result of collaborative work of irs lab from the jaume i university in spain and csip company this manipulator was rebuilt for the purpose of reducing the dimensions and weight so that it can fit on the existing underwater vehicle girona 500 and has less dynamic coupling with it another recent custom made electrical underwater manipulator is the uma fig 8 developed by graal tech srl in italy for the trident project and which subsequently is currently commercially available ribas et al 2015 its unique characteristic is that it is made by modular joints with a compatible electromechanical interface which allows building a customised manipulator according to the desired user kinematics without doing a dedicated design 4 commercial underwater manipulator control systems commercial underwater manipulators mounted on rovs are controlled by teleoperation systems and are fully reliant on the pilot operator in the loop who is located on the surface vessel the pilot observes the scene through camera and or sonar systems feedback and simultaneously takes decisions regarding the motion and remotely operates the underwater manipulator using one of a few alternate input devices depending on the technical capabilities of the underwater manipulators different control methods are utilized 4 1 rate control hydraulic underwater manipulators which are not equipped with position sensors are operated in joint rate speed control mode in this case the motion of manipulator joint actuators is controlled by a valve pack fitted with solenoid directional control valves and or proportional valves the most basic control approach with minimum equipment is achieved with directional control valves often called switching valves because they switch the fluid passing through the valve from the source of flow to one of the actuator ports walters 2013 using a pilot console fig 9 equipped with a set of 3 position on off on switches the operator controls the valves in the pack and consequently the motion of the manipulator the size of the valve orifice determines the flow rate of the passing fluid and thus limits the joint speed which can be achieved the flow rate and thus the actuator joint speed is regulated only reduced to the desired level by additional adjustable flow control valves active actuator fluid flow control and therefore joint speed control is achieved by using proportional valves thus the name proportional control these valves allow infinite positioning of spools and thus provide infinitely adjustable flow some of them are designed to provide directional control functions as well as flow speed control all in one valve instead of requiring separate valves for direction and speed various required flow rates are achieved by changing the level of electrical signals controlling the valves and smooth actuator acceleration and deceleration is achieved by regulating rate of change of these electrical signals the described switch set pilot console is the most basic input device on the pilot side and using it provides the poorest manipulation efficiency a more sophisticated and intuitive input device that is used is a type of joystick which is often called a rate hand controller or a bear claw fig 10 some hydraulic control functions are achieved by pushing buttons integrated on this input device and other by twisting it rocking it from side to side or forth and back even though it is more intuitive than the method using a switch set it still requires quite a skilled and experienced pilot for safe successful and efficient operation such systems utilize no joint sensors and are examples of open loop control systems position control is achieved with the pilot in the loop with camera view of the manipulator and scene 4 2 position control advanced underwater manipulators are equipped with position sensors in each joint such as potentiometers analog resolvers digital optical encoders or solid state linear position sensors in case of hydraulic manipulators these sensors are used in combination with hydraulic servo valves for the realisation of closed loop manipulator joint position control set point regulation servo valves are electrically operated continuously acting valves that control how hydraulic fluid is ported to an actuator low voltage signals used to control the servo valve are passed into an amplifier which provides the power to alter the valve s position and the valve then delivers the required fluid power to the actuator dunnigan et al 1996 the position sensor on each joint returns an electrical signal to the servo amplifier which based on the comparison with the command signal conditions the strength of the servo valve control voltage manipulator joint servo position control is most commonly achieved in a so called master slave configuration with the use of a miniature master arm figs 11 13 as an input device with similar kinematics to the slave arm underwater manipulator the operator physically manoeuvres the master arm whose motion is then copied to the slave arm while simultaneously observing the slave arm s response through a video system each motion action of the miniature master arm is translated into varying electrical signals by position sensors usually potentiometers placed in each joint of the master arm simultaneously position sensors in the slave arm feed back varying electrical signals corresponding to the actual slave arm joint positions these signals are compared and any difference error signal initiates control signals for the servo valve causing it to release a certain flow of fluid to the appropriate port of its hydraulic actuator resulting in the actuator slave arm joint moving towards the commanded position most master arms have several push buttons integrated for some specific functions the most common one is freeze button which disables the master slave mode and disconnects the master arm from the control loop leaving the slave arm in the last pose in which it was before the button was pressed this gives the operator time to rest or reconfigure the master arm pose before continuing with the operation other buttons can be used for jaw functions stowing functions etc master arms are integrated in the master controller which provides additional user interface functions via function keys display etc 4 3 force feedback some master slave underwater manipulator control systems have force feedback which enables the pilot to sense reaction forces generated on the underwater manipulator and therefore make remote operation easier and more intuitive this mode of operation is in literature referred to as bilateral control while the operation without it is unilateral control in order to provide force feedback master arms joints are equipped with small electric actuators in addition to position sensors in the case of hydraulic manipulators the forces torques acting on the individual joints of the underwater manipulator are measured either directly by the use of six axis force torque sensor located on the wrist of the manipulator or indirectly by measuring the pressure in the actuator supply lines and converting this information into a force torque estimation in both cases the force torque information is then used to condition the strength of the control signals for the electric actuators located in the master arm individual joints which results in force feedback to the operator in addition to the improved telepresence the compliant nature of a force feedback system greatly reduces the risk of accidental damage to both the work site and the manipulator itself even with all the benefits provided with force feedback pilots have to be highly trained in order to successfully operate the subsea manipulator this is particularly important for the use of manipulators in delicate sites such as archaeological sampling søreide and jasinski 2008 scaradozzi et al 2013 additionally if there is a push for resident rov teleoperation of manipulators i e manipulation from shore through network infrastructure then again pilot task load is increased and there is a large dependence on pilot skill and network quality the resident rov teleoperation concept has recently been introduced in the industry by ikm subsea where a permanently deployed rov system is remotely operated from shore offshore engineerm and s 2016 chevron adopted a similar field resident concept for auvs gilmour et al 2012 in the academic sector the resident rov concept has been investigated within the dexrov project and advanced assisted on shore teleoperation over long distances is proposed gancet et al 2015 as motion disturbances affecting the underwater vehicle and the manipulator become more significant the task execution with pilot in the loop becomes more difficult more time consuming and eventually impossible especially in the case where the target infrastructure is in motion and the rov for some reason cannot clamp onto to it the human operator can react only after the change has already happened and therefore even an experienced operator is likely to fail if the conditions for task execution are difficult 4 4 gripper control as is the case for rest of the actuators in the underwater manipulator system the gripper is also controlled via same miniature master arm in master slave control mode the majority of grippers are hydraulically actuated and rate controlled in open loop the pilot predefines the gripper opening and closing speed in master controller settings and by squeezing the textured bands on the master arm wrist activates the grip function some underwater manipulators have a closed loop servo position controlled gripper which is achieved with sensor feedback usually a linear variable differential transformer lvdt a minority of suppliers offer grip force control and force feedback 5 underwater manipulator motion control underwater manipulators are multibody dynamic systems and therefore two main control techniques can be implemented in the first approach the manipulator is regarded as a mechanical system formed by multiple independent systems determined by the number of joints it has each joint axis is controlled individually as a single input single output siso system where coupling effects between the joints which are induced during the motion due to the varying manipulator configuration are treated as a disturbance this type of manipulator control strategy is known in the literature as decentralized control scheme siciliano et al 2009 the opposite strategy is a centralized control scheme which takes dynamic interaction effects between the joints into account for the controller design to be able to design an adequate controller for underwater manipulator some additional factors need to be analysed such as the type of drive system used to actuate manipulator joints manipulators actuated with electric motors usually have high ratio gears which tend to linearise manipulator system dynamics and thus significantly reduce nonlinearity effects caused by coupling effects between the joints however this comes at the price of introducing significant joint friction elasticity and backlash effects on the other hand manipulators actuated with direct drives such as hydraulic actuators have to deal with kinematic and dynamic coupling between the joints which is a result of configuration dependent inertia forces coriolis and centrifugal forces hydraulic systems introduce high nonlinearities due to laminar and turbulent flow channel geometry and friction additionally hydraulic system parameters are greatly variable dependent on the oil viscosity and the relationship between flow and pressure yao and wang 2012 hydrodynamic effects influencing an underwater manipulator such as buoyancy added mass dissipative drag and lift forces as well as external disturbances current waves etc all add nonlinearities and uncertainties to the dynamics thus making modeling and control even more complicated as the precise estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients is impossible because they vary according to the temperature depth salinity etc antonelli 2006 when a body is accelerated through a fluid some of the surrounding fluid is also accelerated with the body which creates additional inertia added to the system this is known as the added mass effect and it makes dynamics model parameters become variable and uncertain fossen 2011 drag and lift forces have a similar influence on the dynamic model parameters these forces act on a vehicle due to its movement through a viscous fluid and since the density of sea water is significant the magnitude of these forces can be significant as well buoyancy forces work against gravity and are dependent on the density of the fluid and the volume of the fluid displaced by the manipulator mcmillan et al 1995 waves sea currents and tides cause fluid accelerations and therefore external motion disturbances as well as forced oscillations and loads on the manipulator and the vehicle lapierre et al 1998 finally the presence of strong kinematic and dynamics coupling effects can occur between the base vehicle and the underwater manipulator any successful control scheme applied to the underwater manipulator must be able to cope with such highly nonlinear time varying and uncertain dynamics there has been an abundance of control schemes proposed for underwater manipulators over more than two decades however the majority of research has been done on a theoretical level with control performance validation done through simulations some control strategies have been tested on real experimental underwater manipulators but the work done on commercial underwater manipulators is scarce this is not surprising as the state of the art commercially available manipulators are quite expensive and often have integrated motion controllers with limited access into the control implementation any attempt to validate control approaches using commercial manipulators requires a significant amount of modification on the manipulator hardware 5 1 decentralized control control loop feedback mechanisms which integrate proportional p integral i and derivative d terms in different variations for basic controllers p pi pd pid etc as a set point regulators have been present in industry for decades choi and chung 2004 utilizing these pid type control laws for underwater manipulators within a decentralized joint space control strategy offers simplicity of implementation and low computational cost the trajectory planning for commercial underwater manipulators falls under the joint space point to point method initial to final joint configuration due to its master slave teleoperation approach however pid based control laws provide poor dynamic accuracy when trajectory tracking comes into play and the dynamic performance of the manipulator varies according to its configuration khalil and dombre 2004 regardless of its limitations a number of authors including smith et al 1994 reported utilizing pid based joint control laws in a decentralized control scheme for underwater manipulators dunnigan et al 1996 incorporated a fixed gain pid controller for each manipulator joint and realizing that the control performance degrades when the manipulator operates at different points in the workspace proposed investigating a self tuning adaptive control approach the outcome was an adaptive siso self tuning pole placement joint angle controller which provides benefits over a fixed gain pi pid controller for a range of different operating conditions clegg et al 2001 ishimi et al 1991 propose another adaptive pid controller with automatic gain tuning in accordance with arm posture changes and with feedforward compensation for gravity buoyancy speed and acceleration huo et al 2013 also analysed the performance disadvantages of traditional pid control and propose a pi algorithm with variable gains xu et al 2005a utilized fuzzy logic theory for adaptive pd controller gain tuning yao and wang 2012 propose a model reference adaptive control mrac scheme for individual joint control where the interaction between other joints and hydrodynamics influence are considered as external disturbances and controller parameters are adjusted on line in real time 5 2 centralized control other authors focused on nonlinear centralized control schemes which take advantage of the knowledge of an underwater manipulator dynamics model to compensate for the nonlinearities by eliminating them rather than reducing the effect induced by them and therefore enhance the trajectory tracking performance siciliano et al 2009 one of the early works on the investigation of underwater manipulator model based control is reported in liceaga castro et al liceaga castro et al 1991 where a nonlinear model matching controller is proposed the manipulator dynamics model includes some hydrodynamic effects which are calculated according to morison s equations schjølberg and fossen 1994 derived an underwater manipulator dynamics model with most dominating hydrodynamic forces included using an iterative newton euler algorithm and propose an inverse dynamics control approach this approach uses a feedback linearisation method to completely linearise a nonlinear system leaving it linear and decoupled so that a much simpler stabilizing linear controller can be utilized for trajectory tracking however this approach assumes an exact knowledge of the dynamics model which is impossible to measure or estimate the model is in reality known with a degree of uncertainty and imperfect cancellation of dynamics terms is guaranteed therefore this approach does not have adequate robustness as it is sensitive to time varying and uncertain model parameters and external disturbances siciliano et al 2009 in order to design a controller that can counteract the effects of imperfect compensation and thus deal to some extent with variable parameters and disturbances relaxing the unrealistic assumption of the accurate knowledge of the underwater manipulator dynamics model parameters some researchers have investigated integrating robust and adaptive control strategies the former counteracts the effects of the model approximation and the latter adapts the model parameters to those of the real underwater manipulator dynamics model siciliano et al 2009 lee and choi 2000 propose a robust controller designed by combining a computed torque controller and a sliding mode controller smc with a multi layer neural network controller which acts as a compensator maintaining the control performance when the initial uncertainty assumptions cease to be valid another robust control scheme is presented by yuh et al 2001 which consists of a disturbance observer controller which transforms a nonlinear underwater manipulator system with uncertainties into a simple model with disturbance error and a non regressor based adaptive controller designed according to the simplified model a number of authors propose robust trajectory tracking controllers for underwater manipulators based on the sliding mode control strategy and the dynamics model for estimating uncertainty bounds kwon et al 2000 xu et al xu et al 2007 some authors propose using fuzzy logic heuristics for sliding mode controller adaptive gain tuning xu et al 2005b an observer based pd backstepping robust nonlinear control technique for underwater manipulators is proposed by mohan 2011 esfahani et al 2013 presented a control scheme where an artificial immune system algorithm with wavelet mutation is used to derive optimal parameters for the conventional sliding mode controller a modified sliding mode control scheme namely terminal smc is proposed by venkatesan et al 2014 with a disturbance observer integrated for dealing with disturbances and uncertainties another robust controller with uncertainty disturbance estimator was presented by mohan and kim 2015a where the proposed controller integrates approximated inverse dynamic model output as a model base portion of the controller uses a feed forward term to enhance the control activity estimates a perturbed term to compensate for the external disturbances and unmodelled dynamics and has a decoupled nonlinear pid as a feedback portion to enhance closed loop stability and account for the estimation error of uncertainties 5 3 neural and fuzzy control some authors have investigated neural networks and fuzzy logic theory for designing control strategies for resolving the nonlinear control problem without taking into account any knowledge of the underwater manipulator dynamics wang et al 2008 propose a hybrid control method based on the integration of fuzzy logic control with a cerebellar model articulation controller neural network another fuzzy hybrid control scheme is presented by suboh et al 2009 where a takagi sugeno fuzzy controller is merged with a model reference adaptive controller equipped with pi adjustment mechanism based on the previous work of golea et al 2002 pandian and sakagami 2010 presented a neuro fuzzy pd control scheme for underwater manipulators where a fuzzy gain tuning method is utilized for adaptation under uncertainties and disturbances while the neural network is used to approximate the dynamics of the underwater manipulator and to add a feedforward compensation input to the pd fuzzy controller 6 uvms motion control underwater manipulators are usually not standalone systems but rather a part of a uvms as they are mounted on underwater vehicles in most cases work class rovs work class rov intervention operations which include using underwater manipulators require at least two highly skilled operators one to pilot the rov trying to keep it as stable as possible by compensating for external motion disturbances sea current waves tides and rov motion induced by manipulator s reaction forces moments while the other operator performs the actual teleoperated manipulation task this is the case when the rov is not operating on the seabed and when there is no possibility to clamp it onto the underwater structure this can occur if the surrounding environment does not provide adequate conditions for a safe and secure connection or simply if the underwater structure is not designed to be clamped onto the significant disadvantage of teleoperated control becomes prominent in harsh sea conditions because even very skilled pilots are able to react only after the disturbance event has already happened which induces significant delays in the system due to a number of handicaps that contribute to the task performance complexity rov pilots eventually get fatigued which leads to significant reduction of task effectiveness cooke 2006 capocci et al therefore a plausible approach for solving these problems is to implement semi automated or fully automated uvms control methods since underwater vehicle and manipulator motion are coordinated separately for rovs in current use the straight forward approach for uvms control implementation is to decouple the vehicle and the manipulator and regard the whole system as two independent systems to be controlled conventional station keeping algorithms can be utilized for underwater vehicle control while the underwater manipulator motion can be controlled as if it were on a fixed base having the automated manipulation system carry out the prescribed tasks through arm motion alone vehicle position set point can be replanned when the target is out of the workspace of the manipulator this approach simplifies the manipulator control but places a heavy burden onto the underwater vehicle control system as it needs to have a drive system with sufficient dynamic capabilities and precision navigation so the overall system can achieve adequate manipulation performance research on rov precision navigation and motion control has been investigated by toal et al 2011 omerdic and toal 2012 among others while sole manipulator control algorithms have been outlined in the previous section the problem of this approach is that it does not take into account the dynamic and kinematic coupling that occurs between the manipulator and its base vehicle which may significantly degrade the control effectiveness of the whole uvms the dynamic coupling arises as the manipulator while in motion transmits forces and moments which are variable in magnitude and direction to its base vehicle these forces and moments alter the pose of the base vehicle and hence the manipulator end effector position and orientation which is regarded as kinematic coupling dunnigan and russell 1994 the factors that cause these coupling effects are the relative size weight and shape of the manipulator compared to its base vehicle the lower the manipulator s weight and size compared to the underwater vehicle the better as coupling can then be either neglected or taken into account and dealt with appropriately relative manipulator to vehicle weight ratios for the existing typical heavy medium and light work class rovs are presented in table 2 when coupling effect are significant advanced control approaches have to be adopted 6 1 rov compensation for coupling effects one solution to deal with coupling effects while the manipulator is operating is to decouple the uvms and run a separate control loop for the base underwater vehicle alone keeping it in a fixed pose using the propulsion system this approach was investigated by a number of researchers who proposed advanced station keeping algorithms for the underwater vehicle taking dynamic and kinematic coupling effects into account koval 1994 proposes an automatic vehicle stabilization method where the manipulator caused vehicle motion is compensated for by feedforward terms based on manipulator kinematics and simplified dynamics without hydrodynamic forces dunnigan and russell 1994 demonstrated the effect of dynamic coupling between manipulator and rov through numerical simulations and propose a scheme to reduce it using a variable structure control law where forces torques affecting the rov are deduced from the equations of motion which include simplified hydrodynamic terms mclain et al 1996 experimentally demonstrated the significance of hydrodynamic coupling between the single link manipulator and its base vehicle when no vehicle control is applied and described a coordinated control approach for the uvms by incorporating model based hydrodynamic coupling information into the vehicle control law an alternative approach for rov stabilization due to the motion induced by an operating manipulator and external disturbances was investigated by kato and lane 1995 where multiple smaller arms other than the main manipulator were used as paddles for motion compensation interaction forces that occur between the manipulator and its base vehicle can be measured using a six axis force torque sensor mounted at the base of the manipulator some authors propose utilizing controllers for vehicle station keeping that use these measurements in order to compensate for coupling effects by adjusting thruster commands to correct the position of the vehicle lapierre et al 1998 fraisse et al 2000 in case the force torque sensor is unavailable ryu et al 2001 propose a controller which is based on the developed disturbance observer geffard et al 2000 for the estimation of interaction forces between the rov and the manipulator a similar approach is presented by vossoughi et al 2004 where forces moments are estimated based on the dynamic model and used as a feedforward portion of the rov controller to predict dynamic coupling forces torques soylu et al 2005 utilize an articulated body algorithm aba which is based on the uvms feedback states and a sliding mode controller for uvms station keeping using the same aba algorithm along with a combined h infinity sliding mode control scheme for underwater vehicle station keeping is presented by soylu et al 2009 an alternative vehicle stabilization method is proposed by lynch and ellery 2014 where the focus is on the control of the uvms barycenter rather than on the vehicle position antonelli and cataldi 2014 assumed that the manipulator is controlled independently by a joint based controller and used the information of desired manipulator trajectories to design an adaptive and recursive low level controller for the vehicle in the rov case apart from vehicle manipulator dynamic coupling effects hydrodynamic and gravitational forces acting on the tether also create internal forces on the rov soylu et al 2010a addressed this problem and performed numerical simulations which revealed the extent to which the tether affects the manipulator dynamics and utilized a model based sliding mode controller for rov station keeping capable of dealing with dynamic coupling effects caused by the tether 6 2 uvms motion control instead of decoupling it into two separate systems a uvms can be addressed as a single system which can utilize different control approaches capable of dealing with coupling effects occurring between the manipulator and the base vehicle the primary focus for a number of researchers investigating this approach is on the uvms set point regulation lizarralde et al 1995 propose a velocity less pd control set point regulator which drives the vehicle and the manipulator to the desired attitude and position another examples of uvms set point regulation is presented by antonelli and chiaverini 1998a where a robust sliding mode based control approach is used and by sun and cheah 2004 with the use of a generalized adaptive saturated proportional derivative sp d controller with gravity regressor for gravity and buoyancy compensation other authors focused on deriving the detailed uvms dynamics model and propose the implementation of conventional model based control schemes which can be applied for trajectory tracking utilizing a newton euler approach fossen 1991 derived equations of motion for a uvms considered as a micro macro manipulator a specific combination of parallel and serial mechanical structures where the manipulator gives fast and accurate end effector motion and the vehicle is the slower positioning part the same author proposes an adaptive controller for the uvms which is based on the work of slotine and weiping 1988 mahesh et al 1991 derived equations of combined uvms motion using a vector dyadic method and designed a coordinated adaptive control strategy where parameters of the linearised coupled model are estimated on line and used by a discrete time adaptive velocity controller for self tuning mcmillan et al 1995 1996 report on the developed efficient uvms dynamics simulation algorithm which includes major hydrodynamic effects which can provide aid in the design of control algorithms tarn et al 1996 use kane s method for the development of a dynamics model of an underwater vehicle equipped with an n dof manipulator including major hydrodynamic terms as well and thus provide a good background for the design of uvms control algorithms schjølberg and fossen 1994 propose a feedback linearisation approach followed by a derivation of the detailed dynamic model including the most important hydrodynamic terms a similar approach based on feedback linearisation has been investigated by a number of other researchers schjølberg and egeland 1996 utilize two different spacecraft manipulator system control schemes and apply them on the uvms tarn and yang 1997 address a multiple manipulator uvms model which includes major hydrodynamic forces wilson et al 2011 have developed a computed torque controller for uvms mohan 2013 present a model reference uvms control scheme and korkmaz et al 2013 present an inverse dynamics control method for uvms trajectory tracking where separate tasks are assigned for the end effector and the vehicle mohan and kim 2012 propose a nonlinear control scheme based on the feedback linearisation using indirect knowledge of the system dynamics and external disturbances via an extended kalman filter the same authors in mohan and kim 2015b propose a coordinated motion control scheme using a disturbance observer in task space londhe et al 2017 propose a robust single input fuzzy logic controller rsiflc applied for task space trajectory control that consists of feedback linearisation and feed forward controllers along with a single input fuzzy controller and an uncertainty estimator the main drawback of the feedback linearisation approach is that it assumes the exact knowledge of the system dynamics or at least a close estimation which is unrealistic and does not guarantee robustness to model parameter variation and uncertainties dunnigan and russell 1998 emphasize the significance of dynamic coupling through computer simulations on a six dof vehicle equipped with a three dof manipulator and integrate closed form manipulator disturbance expressions neglecting hydrodynamic terms into a sliding controller which is capable of dealing with parameter uncertainties to some extent in order to improve dynamic coupling modeling accuracy and achieve better uvms coordinated motion control leabourne and rock 1998 present research on an empirically determined hydrodynamic manipulator model acquired by real experiments with a two link manipulator mounted on a free floating vehicle de wit et al de wit et al 1998a emphasize that manipulator to vehicle coupling effects are dominant over the vehicle to manipulator ones and that the feedback compensation is only needed to overcome the coupling effects from the manipulator the uvms is divided into two subsystems one of which is fully independent from the other manipulator while the other vehicle is perturbed by the first subsystem manipulator an approach based on a singular perturbation is proposed as alternative to existing approaches requiring full model knowledge to compensate for vehicle manipulator coupling and their nonlinear effects by a partial linearising decoupled controller based on the same decoupling approach de wit et al de wit et al 1998b present a robust non model based controller for the uvms which consists of a linear pd controller for the manipulator and a robust nonlinear controller for the underwater vehicle based on the work reported by williamson and de wit williamson and de wit 1995 a comparative study of the proposed controller neglecting previous assumptions such as that the saturation levels of thrusters are unbounded infinitely accurate sensors infinitely small sampling time and absence of thruster nonlinearities is presented by diaz et al 1998 based on the same singular perturbed model de wit et al de wit et al 2000 propose a robust nonlinear feedback control for the uvms with composite dynamics which offers good compromise between control complexity and closed loop performance a modular approach for uvms control is presented by antonelli et al 1999a 2004 where an adaptive tracking controller with virtual decomposition zhu et al 1997 is adopted the proposed control approach exploits the serial chain structure of the uvms to decompose the overall motion control problem into separate simple rigid body control problems i e manipulator links and the vehicle sarkar and podder 2001 use a quasi lagrange method in order to derive uvms dynamic equations of motion which include thruster dynamics and utilize a computed torque control law for uvms trajectory tracking unlike most control methods based on the computed torque ishitsuka et al 2004 propose a resolved acceleration control rac method for the uvms the proposed control method is verified by numerical simulations reported by ishitsuka and ishii 2005 2006 an extension of this algorithm which includes compensation for disturbances caused by hydrodynamic forces acting on the vehicle along with the experimental verification can be found in yatoh and sagara 2008 sagara et al 2010 present another addition to the algorithm where the disturbance compensation is utilized both for the vehicle and the manipulator followed with the experimental validation finally the same method is enriched for a dual manipulator control scheme sagara and ambar 2014 xu et al 2005c present a non adaptive model based sliding mode controller for uvms based on the decentralized dynamics with simulation validations showing that the proposed sliding mode controller provides accurate and robust tracking performance superior to that obtained with a traditional pd controller periasamy et al 2008 present the development of a uvms dynamic model using the bond graph modeling technique where major hydrodynamic effects and coupled dynamics are included and they have designed a pd plus buoyancy compensation control for the uvms end effector trajectory tracking han et al 2011 proposed a robust uvms control approach where a nonlinear h infinity optimal control is utilized as an external tracking control loop and a disturbance observer as an internal disturbance compensation loop during the execution of the uvms intervention task the manipulator motion causes the shift of the orientation equilibrium of the whole uvms which causes restoring moments and forces to change as well and this eventually leads to additional spontaneous end effector motion in order to exploit this phenomenon han and chung 2014 proposed a robust adaptive control scheme that uses variant restoring moments to actively control the uvms most of the existing uvms control approaches neglect the existence of nonlinear thruster dynamics taira et al 2010 present a regressor based adaptive controller for uvms with thruster dynamics where adaptive control inputs are composed of adaptive feedforward signals including regressors of dynamic system models and error feedback signals in order to simplify the complex structure due to regressors the same authors propose an adaptive controller in taira et al 2012 that uses radial basis function rbf networks haykin 1998 instead of the regressors while in taira et al 2011 they propose a robust controller where the feedforward term is removed completely the performance of the robust controller is improved with pre compensators including integral actions taira et al 2014 in order to avoid the unrealistic assumption of exact knowledge of uvms dynamics and the complexity of estimating close to the real dynamic model some authors resorted to adaptive control methods that are independent of any model knowledge lee and yuh 1999 lee et al 2000 report on a non regressor based adaptive control scheme for uvms trajectory tracking based on a bound estimation method and a parameter adaptation algorithm for adjusting the controller gains based on the performance of the system rather than the knowledge of the dynamic model a sliding mode type controller with fuzzy logic implementation for adaptive gain tuning is proposed by xu et al 2005b using fuzzy logic heuristics for decentralized proportional derivative pd type controller gain tuning is also presented in xu et al 2005a sakagami 2009 propose using an iterative learning control approach in order to deal with the manipulator to vehicle coupling effects which assumes that the motion of the manipulator that is to be compensated for is known in advance 6 3 manipulator compensation for coupling effects some authors address the end effector trajectory tracking control problem of uvms in a different manner where the focus is on developing advanced manipulator control methods which alone compensate for the movement introduced by coupling effects between underwater vehicle and manipulator and or the external disturbances one of the early references to compensation of the underwater vehicle motion as a result of external tidal disturbances is by ishimi et al 1991 where a sway compensation controller is developed which uses the inertial navigation system ins signal transforms it into a displacement of the manipulator and adds it to the position command signal as a feedforward term thus cancelling out the sway of the vehicle with manipulator motion alone chung et al 2000 propose modeling a uvms as a class of underactuated robotic system with the assumption that the vehicle is free floating and proposed a robust control algorithm where the rov is modelled as a passive joint and manipulator joints are modelled as active joints a robust control method is realized with a nonlinear feedback disturbance observer plus pd control scheme and applied to each active joint kim et al 2003 propose an active damping two time scale control approach where the vehicle is passive or controlled by a simple p type controller and the manipulator is controlled with a composite two time scale fast and slow controller designed according to a partial decoupling approach an algorithm implemented on the manipulator system that is able to actively compensate for the rov motion based on the model based vehicle motion prediction algorithm is proposed by hildebrandt et al 2009b some authors have investigated compensation schemes such that the manipulator control law is a function of the vehicle velocity in the trident project simetti et al 2014 propose a dynamic programming dp approach which allows an optimal manipulator movement based on the current measured vehicle velocity simetti et al 2017 report experimental results of the maris project including a parallel task priority inverse kinematics tpik solution for manipulator control also based on vehicle velocity some authors propose using vehicle motion to complement the capabilities of the manipulator by providing extra dofs to achieve manipulator end effector trajectory tracking rather than having the underwater vehicle passive or controlled for station keeping antonelli et al 2000 2004 antonelli and chiaverini 2003a 2003b however using thrusters for manipulator end effector positioning is inefficient from an energy consumption perspective this is due to the complexity of controlling the underwater vehicle in hovering and lateral directions as well as because of significant difference in vehicle and manipulator inertias mohan et al 2012 7 kinematic control and motion planning in order to improve the overall performance of underwater manipulation many researchers utilized kinematic level enhancements some focus on the improvement of conventional pilot teleoperation techniques while others resort to the utilization of semi autonomous and fully autonomous control techniques in the hope of transferring the operator from direct control to a supervisory position some of the early research on teleoperation control enhancements includes the development of a human machine interface where a choice of possible remote control input devices is available including keyboard mouse master arm or joystick each of which provides benefits for different tasks larkum and broome 1994 another important approach that has been investigated by many researchers includes real time motion simulations and virtual graphical reconstruction of the manipulator workspace including workpiece solid models presented on the monitor display such tools provide supplementary visual aids in the traditional teleoperation by helping the operator to perceive the posture of the underwater manipulator and possibly avoid collision with the environment relevant pioneering research on this topic is reported by ishimi et al 1991 broome et al 1995 while more recent research work can be found in zhang et al 2003 hildebrandt et al 2008a jun et al 2009 the description of the implementation in further detail can be found in the previous paper sivčev et al 2015 published by the authors a number of researchers have investigated cartesian space teleoperation schemes as such an approach is more intuitive from the human perspective and advantages that it offers for various underwater manipulation tasks are quite clear especially for the peg in a hole type tasks operational space teleoperation techniques implemented and tested on work class rov have been reported in jun et al 2004 2008 2009 a workspace control approach which is based on the implementation of the differential inverse kinematics algorithm is developed where the operator uses an input device to control the manipulator end effector velocity and hence its position and orientation in cartesian space hildebrandt et al 2008b presented optimal direct kinematics and closed form analytical inverse kinematics solutions with special respect to computational simplicity whilst maintaining high numerical precision this has been applied to control a commercial underwater manipulator a schilling orion 7p fernandez et al 2013 also address cartesian space control with implementation on a modified version of the eca arm 5e huo et al 2013 utilize an analytical inverse kinematics solution for the six dof underwater manipulator developed by the shenyang institute of automation of the chinese academy of sciences and the authors sivčev et al 2015 present a numerical method for the solving inverse kinematics problem for a commercial underwater manipulator schilling titan 2 as finding the closed form analytical solution for the specific manipulator is impossible due to the lack of a spherical wrist siciliano et al 2009 a cartesian space teleoperation approach which offers a variety of reference coordinate systems such as joint world and tool is demonstrated on a simulated model in virtual reality and in subsea trials sivčev et al 2018a implementing inverse kinematics algorithms and developing cartesian control methods opens a lot of new possibilities for semi automated supervisory control schemes and fully automated manipulation solutions in the former the operator selects a task via user interface and then observes and monitors while the task is being executed while in the latter the task is sensor triggered moreover this approach brings underwater manipulation closer to totally automated industrial terrestrial robotics sivčev et al 2015 this is due to the fact that the majority of industrial robot arms have kinematics control end effector motion trajectory planning carried out in the operational cartesian space followed by inverse kinematics implementation and finally low level motion control motion trajectory tracking control performed in the joint space on the other side commercial underwater manipulators are teleoperated and therefore kinematics set point control is carried out in joint space since the master arm motion is recorded in joint space and then copied directly to the slave arm one of the earliest references on the implementation of supervisory control for underwater manipulators is by ishimi et al 1991 who describe how after an operator has chosen a task motion planning is utilized automatically based on the knowledge of the environment work tools platform etc and then transformed into data for manipulator motion control broome et al 1995 also discuss semi automatic and fully automatic modes backed up with motion planning algorithms and inverse kinematics implementation zhang et al 2003 propose a semi autonomous manipulator control under operator s supervision with a possibility of using a visualization display as a tool for outlining tasks jun et al 2009 present a preprogramed way point task control approach where the manipulator is able to execute a task for which a path was taught by the operator in advance the efficiency of this approach has been experimentally tested on rov mounted schilling orion 7p manipulators performing a soil coring task hildebrandt et al 2008a propose integrating additional features to the online virtual reality 3d visualization that could help the operator during the supervisory control such as visualization of end effector paths or previewing possible manipulator configurations prior to the actual movement as a result of motion planning algorithms this is achieved by a secondary 3d visualization of the manipulator projected as a semi transparent overlay another feature that can aid the pilot in teleoperated mode is proposed by albiez et al 2009 based on the workspace analysis of the manipulator where a computer is continuously calculating the distance to the workspace border enabling the operator to get information about current dexterity of the underwater manipulator the ranges where the dexterity does not exceed a given limit and the possibility for automatic motion some authors propose integrating collision avoidance algorithms into supervisory and totally autonomous control schemes broome et al 1995 ishibashi et al 2001 2002 use genetic algorithms for obstacle avoidance of both stationary and dynamic objects where both position of the end effector and posture of the manipulator is utilized for motion planning david et al 2007 propose integrating an active collision avoidance feature based on the margritte 3d graphic supervisor gravez et al 2003 into the enhanced teleoperation scheme by coupling the real robot manipulator with a simulated one to generate movement for both of them since the simulated manipulator has integrated algorithm for automatic obstacle avoidance in the virtual reality the operator can handle the real slave manipulator safely without taking care of real environment obstacles assuming perfect knowledge and modeling of obstacles this control scheme was developed for use in the nuclear environment but was tested on a cybernetix maestro hydraulic underwater manipulator which could be applied for subsea applications sivčev et al 2018b propose a voxel based collision detection algorithm applicable for commercial work class rovs some authors address kinematic control and motion planning algorithms on a uvms level podder and sarkar 2000 propose a dynamics based trajectory planning approach capable of generating both kinematically admissible and dynamically feasible joint space trajectories for systems composed of heterogeneous dynamics such as uvms characterised by a much slower dynamic response of the underwater vehicle compared to that of the manipulator in the proposed approach task space trajectory is represented in terms of fourier series and various frequency components from the series are used to generate reference joint space trajectories based on natural frequencies of the respective subsystems shim et al 2013 address uvms motion planing and control based on rov position estimation using extended kalman filter and propose a precise dynamic workspace control method where the manipulator is controlled to move in a straight line while the rov is assumed to be floating a method for uvms global motion planning capable of generating feasible and obstacle free task paths based on the 4d bump surface concept is presented by sotiropoulos et al 2013 the pandora project has explored learning the trajectory of the vehicle and the end effector by demonstration carrera et al 2014 to accomplish the valve turning with experiments in a tank environment in the merbots project youakim et al 2017 have used the motion planning ros package moveit to compute reference trajectories for the uvms advanced control problems considering dual arm uvms are presented in farivarnejad and moosavian 2014 simetti and casalino 2015 ambar et al 2015 even more complex problems such as cooperative uvms are addressed in conti et al 2015 simetti and casalino 2017 ocean one project developed a bimanual force controlled humanoid robot that affords immediate and intuitive haptic interaction in oceanic environments khatib et al 2016 7 1 redundancy if an underwater vehicle is station keeping or fixed e g sitting on the seabed or clamped onto a structure achieving arbitrary position and orientation with end effector within its workspace is possible only if the manipulator has at least six dofs manipulators with more dofs are in a kinematic sense considered inherently redundant siciliano et al 2009 and their redundant dofs can be advantageously exploited in different ways for achieving secondary objectives such as avoiding obstacles minimizing energy consumption etc however since a free floating vehicle has its own six dofs those can be exploited together with manipulator dofs for achieving arbitrary end effector position and orientation as well as for redundancy resolution some authors addressed uvms kinematic redundancies and investigated approaches which take them into account to generate trajectories corresponding to given tasks while the extra dofs are used to assign additional motion without impeding the end effector s performance antonelli and chiaverini 1998b propose a uvms task priority inverse kinematics approach for redundancy resolution with robustness to the occurrence of algorithmic singularities where redundancy is exploited for reducing power consumption and increasing the manipulability of the system sarkar and podder 1999 2001 address the kinematic redundancy resolution with the minimization of the total drag on the uvms an approach where redundancy is exploited in order to find an optimal posture for a manipulator by obtaining either maximum manipulability staying away from the joint limits or minimizing the vehicle s roll and pitch angles is presented by antonelli and chiaverini 2003a 2003b redundancy resolution algorithms with the focus on obtaining an optimal manipulator posture are reported by jun et al 2004 2008 ismail and dunnigan 2009 propose a redundancy resolution in order to minimize gravity and buoyancy loading of the uvms soylu et al 2010b address redundancy resolution with different secondary objectives such as avoiding joint limits singularities and high joint velocities keeping the end effector in sight of the on board camera minimizing the rov motion and minimizing the drag forces on the rov han et al 2011 han and chung 2014 focus on the optimization of uvms s restoring moments a fuzzy redundancy resolution approach is investigated by antonelli and chiaverini 2003a antonelli and chiaverini 2003b and dos santos et al dos santos et al 2006 an alternative prioritization of tasks for the coordinated motion control of the uvms is proposed by casalino et al 2012 and simetti et al 2013 within this strategy end effector position and orientation is given a secondary priority objective while the high priority tasks are keeping each joint within its range of motion keeping the manipulability measure above the given positive threshold maintaining horizontal vehicle attitude in the desired range and keeping the vehicle pose in the desired range mohan and kim 2015b propose a task space coordination control scheme that is able to track the given desired path and also to perform power efficient trajectories in the pandora project cieslak et al 2015 propose an approach that combines learning and task priority and present experimental trials on the topic of redundancy resolution there are additional task priority frameworks in the literature kanoun et al 2011 escande et al 2014 moe et al 2016 simetti and casalino 2016 7 2 implementational issues investigating the application of different control techniques on commercial underwater manipulators revealed some of the implementation issues the state of the art commercially available position servo controllers for underwater manipulators work on the basis of joint space set point regulation for this reason the implementation of any trajectory tracking with detailed information about position velocity and acceleration either in joint or cartesian space is impossible without excessive hardware and software modifications on the low level motion controller of the underwater manipulator this means that any high level kinematics control and motion planning implementation on commercial underwater manipulators has to utilize joint space point to point motion planning with a path described as a sequence of set points spenneberg et al 2007 while investigating high level control implementation on a commercial hydraulic underwater manipulator schilling orion 7p hildebrandt et al 2008b emphasize the importance of the type of ramp function to be used within the joint angle reference signal as a part of described path in order to avoid jerky and hight strain movements and propose using bezier like curves computed using de casteliau s algorithm which are at least twice continuously differentiable another issue is a nonlinearity occurrence that comes with the use of a linear cylinder as the underwater manipulator actuator which can be compensated for by finding a relationship between the linear actuator stroke and the joint angle hildebrandt et al 2008b jun et al 2009 yet another issue that can be of great concern is the low position accuracy present in low level motion controllers of underwater manipulators in order to cope with this drawback hildebrandt et al 2009a propose a multi layered controller which provides increased precision without any modification of the manipulator s hardware as a combination of an adaptive speed control layer and a second sub degree position control layer since underwater manipulators are built for human in the loop teleoperation the control command set point update frequency on the top side is rather low sivčev et al 2018a e g a slingsby manipulator features a 50 hz manipulator control update while the top side pilot command update is 5 hz larkum and broome 1994 analysing the communication protocols of schiling orion 7p manipulator hildebrandt et al 2008b reports on the low 12 5 hz control frequency and emphasizes the possibility to boost it up to 62 5 hz only by modifying protocols however this is not the case with some electrical manipulators such as graal tech srl uma arm which can provide a global interface for sending commands and receiving feedback from joints at a rate of up to 200 hz ribas et al 2015 8 force control subsea intervention tasks carried out with underwater manipulators often demand extensive contact with the environment connector plugging valve turning etc therefore end effector trajectory tracking control has to be backed up with the implementation of interaction force torque control of the end effector with the environment this is due to the fact that under pure manipulator position control a slight deviations of the end effector from the planned trajectory can cause the manipulator to either lose contact with the surface or press too strongly on the surface and possibly result in disastrous consequences by generating extremely large interaction forces spong et al 2005 force control has been broadly investigated for fixed base industrial robot arms the most common control schemes in literature are passive and active compliance control impedance control and hybrid impedance control which can be found in spong et al 2005 siciliano et al 2009 siciliano and villani 2012 one of the first to address this control problem for an underwater manipulator are dunnigan et al 1996 who propose a hybrid position force control scheme and present the results achieved through practical tests on the slingsby ta9 hydraulic manipulator in dexrov project lillo et al 2016 demonstrate how force regulation can be accomplished at kinematic level both for simple interactions such as closing a valve and pushing a button or for more complex intervention such as pipe inspection activities casalino et al 2017 additional research on underwater manipulator force control algorithms with validation through extensive numerical simulations can be found in kajita and kosuge 1997 lapierre et al 1998 antonelli et al 1999b cui et al 1999 cui and sarkar 2000 antonelli et al 2002 lemieux et al 2006 cataldi and antonelli 2015 9 conclusion this paper comprehensively summarized the state of the art of practical and theoretical knowledge about underwater manipulator systems and has given a broad overview of the existing bibliography and research results it provided a survey of the use of manipulation technology for a variety of subsea intervention and inspection operations within different offshore areas of application both commercially available underwater manipulator solutions and prototype systems have been analysed relevant topics have been discussed including manipulator technical specifications mechanical design actuation robot modeling kinematics and dynamics control approaches and algorithms motion control kinematic control motion planning and a detailed comparison has been presented highlighting advantages and disadvantages of different solutions present in the underwater manipulation technology the goal of this paper is to present a realistic picture of the existing technology and its limitation in order to provide a useful background source for future research in the field of underwater robotics and manipulation critical factors limiting the performance of underwater manipulators have crystallised from the comprehensive review of the state of the art the authors strongly recommend that these factors be considered during the design of future underwater manipulator systems an important topic that was not covered within the scope of this paper is the application of machine vision for underwater manipulation it is an area that has great potential to enhance existing sub sea manipulation systems we believe a whole paper can be dedicated to it and our plan for further research is to thoroughly investigate and analyse this area and provide a complementary review before final conclusion we would like to underline the major problems in the present technology and propose areas for further research some of the main issues of the existing commercial systems are low control capabilities and lack of automation even though the top of the range manipulator systems consist of high quality sensors and drives the capabilities of its control systems are insufficient they feature low accuracy low repeatability and low control loop frequency and the reason is because these systems have been historically designed as remote tele operated devices rather than robot arms to overcome this we propose exploiting the knowledge of robot arm servo control approaches used in industrial manufacturing applications and adapting and transferring these techniques into underwater robotics the key for underwater manipulation technology is we believe in achieving industrial robot arm capabilities while keeping the operator in the control loop to some extent either directly or as an observer the goal is not to replace underwater manipulators with industrial robots but to automate as many tasks as possible such as grabbing a tool closing a valve plugging a connector etc in order to decrease the task execution time and lower the burden on the operator therefore by introducing automation some processes can become totally automatic or semi automatic while others would remain remotely operated a system which simultaneously utilizes both autonomous functions and teleoperation is also a possibility where the major motion is to be controlled automatically while the operator would be in charge of applying additional motion corrections significant improvements can be made by developing advanced control systems and implementing them on top of the existing underwater manipulator systems the huge potential benefit of this approach is the ease of integration on existing vehicles however this approach is not without limitations and further advancements can only be made by retrofitting the control systems of the existing underwater manipulators many researchers have been working on the development of control algorithms but few have actually implemented and tested them on real subsea manipulator systems moreover there are no torque controllable commercial manipulators at the moment table 1 therefore many of the proposed low level control algorithms are not applicable to commercial systems and even to most prototype ones some relatively recent academic research that included experimental subsea trials in field environment or at least in test tank has been done within ocean one maris trident rauvi pandora cmanipulator and kordi the last two addressed commercial hydraulic rov manipulator systems while the remaining ones focused on intervention auvs with electrical prototype manipulators some of the ongoing projects that are involved in relevant underwater manipulation experiments are robust http eu robust eu merbots http www irs uji es project merbots dexrov http www dexrov eu and operations support engineering spoke project under marei http www mmrrc ul ie the last one makes use of industry standard hydraulic rov manipulators and the rest use electrical manipulators on auvs collision avoidance or rather controlled collision is another aspect that can prove to be useful in manipulation technology implementing a system where the manipulator is inherently prevented from colliding with other equipment on the base vehicle and with the other manipulator if there are two on the vehicle would provide safer operations where the pilot would be able to operate with ease additionally this would increase the confidence in the implementation of automated solutions some specific tasks especially the repetitive ones could benefit from teach by demonstration methods the operator would perform a teleoperation task which would be recorded with the possibility to be repeated in an autonomous regime this feature would allow an operator who is not familiar with the robot programming to utilize autonomous functions another potential field of study that builds on the automated manipulation is the combined vehicle manipulator control approach an interesting approach to investigate is the development of systems that use vehicle navigation and positioning data for the manipulator control in order to compensate for the vehicle motion a useful example would be a system where the end effector position and or orientation is unaffected by the motion of the vehicle this would simplify the teleoperation and increase the effectiveness of autonomous manipulation the ideas of combined vehicle manipulator control approaches are not a novelty in the literature but there are very few practical implementations especially such that can easily be integrated on existing systems which we believe is crucial if it is taken up for application in the subsea industry acknowledgements this material is based upon works supported by science

schemes along with the implementation issues keywords underwater manipulation manipulator control robot arm marine robotics rov 1 introduction a manipulator robot arm is considered to be the most suitable tool for executing subsea intervention operations hence unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs such as remotely operated vehicles rovs and in some cases autonomous underwater vehicles auvs are equipped with one or more underwater manipulators uuvs with manipulators are often called underwater vehicle manipulator systems uvms the majority of existing underwater manipulators used on uuvs are anthropomorphic i e they are designed to resemble a human arm these manipulators are composed of a sequence of rigid bodies links interconnected by means of revolute joints with a suitable angular displacement between them and grippers or other interchangeable tools attached at the end effector for the observation of their surroundings they are usually accompanied with additional equipment comprising of one or more cameras and spotlights mounted on the base underwater vehicle and or on the manipulator itself underwater manipulators are used for a variety of subsea tasks in different applications within offshore oil and gas marine renewable energy mre and marine civil engineering industries as well as in marine science and military applications capocci et al 2017 as they are being used in a wide range of applications subsea manipulators are designed for different purposes e g there are manipulators with limited mobility equipped with grippers for lifting large heavy objects manipulators used for fixing a detachable gripper to a selected sunken object grabber manipulators equipped with grippers or vacuum cups used to fix an underwater vehicle to submerged structures or near flat walls during the operation manipulators equipped with inspection devices dexterous intervention manipulators with grippers that can carry different tools used for repair and maintenance operations on submerged structures etc usually work class rovs are equipped with two manipulators in most cases one simple powerful grabber to hold the rov near the hydro engineering structure or wreck while the other manipulator performs the actual intervention task some of the tasks underwater manipulators are designed to execute include pipe inspection christ and wernli 2014 salvage of sunken objects chang et al 2004 mine disposal fletcher 2000 cleaning surfaces davey et al 1999 opening and closing valves drilling rope cutting christ and wernli 2014 cable laying and repair clearing debris and fishing nets biological jones 2009 and geological sampling noé et al 2006 archaeological work coleman et al 2003 etc in general manipulators are located at the front side of the underwater vehicle but this is not always the case e g there are vehicles with a manipulator located at the bottom side ribas et al 2012 a brief overview on underwater manipulators can be found in the underwater robots review paper by yuh and west 2001 antonelli 2014 provided a good theoretical background for underwater manipulators from the modeling and control point of view however a complete article encapsulating relevant practical and theoretical knowledge state of the art technology as well as up to date research done in this area can not be found in the literature therefore the aim of this paper is to provide a review of underwater manipulators covering all the relevant aspects from an applied underwater research point of view fig 1 outlines the factors governing performance for underwater manipulation which are expanded upon in detail within this paper the remainder of the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes mechanical design features and capabilities of existing underwater manipulators and gives their comparison section 3 analyses underwater manipulator actuation methods section 4 describes control systems of commercially available subsea manipulators sections 5 and 6 cover academic research achievements in the area of motion control for underwater manipulators and underwater vehicle manipulator systems respectively the state of the art in kinematics control and motion planning algorithms is covered in section 7 while section 8 focuses on force control algorithms finally section 9 presents conclusion 2 mechanical design in order to be able to operate in deep waters and cope with the harsh conditions of subsea environment specialised materials are used in the construction of underwater manipulators additionally depending on the task for which they are designed underwater manipulators have to meet relevant requirements regarding the size of the workspace in which they are to operate lifting capacity wrist torque etc table 1 lists specifications of existing commercial underwater manipulators the most common materials used in construction of underwater manipulators are metal alloys such as titanium ti 6 4 anodized aluminium alloys 5083 6082 t6 6061 t6 7075 t6 a356 stainless steel alloys 316 630 660 as well as some plastics polyethylene the properties of these materials are relatively high strength and corrosion resistance and good machinability to reduce the weight in the water and minimize the actuator burden some experiments have been done on using buoyant materials on underwater manipulators ishimi et al 1991 typically commercially available underwater manipulators are rated between 3000 and 6500 m of sea water msw however some manipulators can operate in depths up to 7000 msw e g schilling robotics titan 4 and a prototype manipulator developed by zhang et al 2014 additionaly there are a some systems designed for full ocean depth 11000 msw woods hole oceanographic institute in collaboration with kraft robotics designed one such manipulator for the purpose of mariana trench exploration mission bowen et al 2008 others include magnum 7 a product of ise ltd and the arm and mk 37 developed by the western space and marine inc the size of underwater manipulators is described by a parameter called reach which represents the length of the whole manipulator kinematic chain along with the range of motion of joints it determines the size of manipulator workspace a set of points that can be reached by its end effector cao et al 2011 reach of existing underwater manipulators ranges from 0 5 m for the grabber manipulators up to 2 4 m for heavy duty manipulators maximum wrist torque which underwater manipulators are capable of producing ranges from 8nm to 250nm according to iso 13628 8 2002 iso 13628 8 2002 rotary low torque rov interfaces on subsea production systems which are typically used on subsea tree needle valves are rated to maximum 75nm additionally lifting carrying payload capacity for underwater manipulators ranges from 5 kg up to 500 kg manufacturers often provide different parameters for manipulator lift capacity max nominal at full extension at rated speed through envelope etc which makes the comparison non trivial as the carrying capacity is not a fixed value but depends on the pose of the manipulator underwater manipulator weight in air is between 6 kg and 150 kg however their weight in water is more important as it determines the buoyancy needed on the base vehicle in order to compensate for the manipulator the weight and size are very important factors as they are directly responsible for the amount of dynamic coupling introduced between the manipulator and the underwater robot on which it is mounted and can thus influence the performance of the whole system in order to be able to fully exploit manipulator characteristics the manipulator weight should be a low enough percentage of the whole underwater robot weight so that the dynamic coupling can be neglected or at least taken into account as an external disturbance that can be dealt with by the dynamic positioning of underwater robot if this exists higher weight and bigger size bring about higher demands concerning the robustness of underwater robot thruster system to the disturbance caused by the dynamic coupling in future research this constraint might be relaxed table 2 presents relative manipulator to vehicle weight for the typical commercial heavy medium and light work class rovs it can be seen that this ratio is significantly low even for the light work class commercial vehicles underwater manipulators can be equipped with various types of grippers on the end effector the commercial ones come with different interchangeable grippers each of which has their own specific purpose a common gripper type is one with parallel acting jaws which includes a slot for a standard t bar handle iso 13628 8 2002 and its primary function is grasping different objects and tools in a variety of subsea operations tooling is generally designed with a t bar exactly for this purpose different grippers include three four finger intermeshing jaws two three finger floating jaws scissor jaws suction foots etc gripper actuators are usually hydraulic and the gripping force of commercially available grippers ranges from 35 kgf to 652 kgf depending on the nature of the task for which they are designed underwater manipulators come with different number of degrees of freedom dof both commercial and experimental underwater manipulators are usually designed with three to six dofs without taking gripper s mobility into account the reason for this is that three dofs are sufficient for achieving an arbitrary position and six dofs for both arbitrary position and orientation of the end effector tool in the workspace spong et al 2005 the term n function is often used in the literature to describe the number of actuators contained in a manipulator and this term includes the gripper s mobility as well so for example a seven function manipulator means that there are six actuators responsible for manipulator motion that provide six true dofs plus one actuator for gripper jaw mobility underwater manipulators with seven or more dofs without gripper mobility are not very common but they do exist true seven dof manipulators are said to be inherently redundant from the kinematic point of view siciliano et al 2009 this feature can play an important role in the automation of manipulators since the redundancy can be exploited for a secondary objective such as obstacle avoidance which will be discussed later some of the work with seven dof underwater manipulators has been reported by marani et al 2009 and ribas et al 2015 and with eight dof manipulator by greig and broome 1994 some authors proposed a multi stage manipulator a micro macro manipulator concept having large positioning manipulator carrying a smaller manipulator for fine precision work ishimi et al 1991 asokan et al 2003 any robotics application of underwater manipulators requires applying kinematics modeling planning and control algorithms underwater manipulators generally have serial chain mechanical structure similar to industrial robot arms there is much literature about robot kinematics that can be applied to underwater manipulators some of which can be found in spong et al 2005 siciliano et al 2009 corke 2011 additional literature about vehicle manipulator systems can be found in from et al 2014 and more specific literature related to underwater vehicle manipulator systems in antonelli 2014 3 actuation in the early 90 s a few authors proposed and experimented on seawater driven actuators for subsea manipulators ishimi et al 1991 yoshinada et al 1991 some of the benefits of water hydraulics are low viscosity high power density non flammable properties and zero environmental impact krutz and chua 2004 however this actuation approach was abandoned over the years due to its various disadvantages such as corrosive and abrasive properties lubrication and sealing issues unsuitable working temperature range etc today all the existing commercially available underwater manipulators and most of the experimental prototype underwater manipulators developed for research purposes run on either oil hydraulic or electric power both of which have their advantages and disadvantages denket 2006 proposed a hybrid power structure using both hydraulic and electric actuators for a single manipulator in order to have the benefit of both however this actuation method has not yet found use in the commercial sector biodegradable fluids have begun to be introduced to minimize the impact on the environment of fluid leaks 3 1 hydraulic manipulators in general hydraulic actuators are capable of producing an output force torque much larger than the force applied on the input without the use of mechanical components such as gears and levers direct drive which is a necessity for the implementation with electric actuators thus hydraulic systems have higher power to weight ratio payload capability which goes up to the order of three for the existing commercial hydraulic underwater manipulators whereas that ratio is one or less for the electrical ones for this reason and because they require fewer parts hydraulic systems are more compact for the same carrying capacity additionally hydraulic systems are inherently pressurized i e the internal pressure is higher than the ambient pressure so they are not as susceptible to the sea water ingress as are their electric counterparts another advantage of hydraulic systems is that they possess inbuilt protection against overload due to these benefits the vast majority of commercial manipulators operating underwater are driven by hydraulic oil typically actuators with limited motion such as piston cylinders and rotary vane actuators are used to drive manipulator joints however in some cases gerotors which are a type of hydraulic motors with continuous motion are used for wrist joint actuation the medium used for power transmission pressurized hydraulic fluid is conveyed from a reservoir to actuators through flexible hoses or rigid pipes by a hydraulic power unit hpu electrically driven pump and pressure regulator the motion of hydraulic systems is controlled by regulating the hydraulic fluid flow this is done by means of different electro hydraulic valves such as directional control valves switching bang bang proportional valves or servo valves these valves are located either in an external valve pack or are integrated in the body of the manipulator along with hoses pipes and electronic circuits in the latter case inner manipulator chambers containing valves and accompanying electronic circuits are oil filled and pressurized by a pressure compensator which maintains the internal pressure slightly above the external pressure leading commercial manufacturers of hydraulic underwater manipulators are kraft telerobotics schilling robotics cybernetix hydro lek among others some of the manipulators are presented in figs 2 5 apart from industrial manufacturers a number of research groups have been designing and developing experimental prototype hydraulic underwater manipulators some of the manipulators with specifications and robot configurations similar to the commercially available seven function manipulators used on work class rovs have been reported by yao et al 2009 and zhang et al 2014 conversely zuyao et al 2011 focused on atypical configuration with less dofs despite their numerous advantages hydraulically driven manipulators have drawbacks unlike their electrical equivalents they can feature poor positioning accuracy and are not suited for implementation of fine control of the interaction force with the environment during contact tasks terribile et al 1993 these limitations are not substantial in the conventional master slave teleoperation however in the case of implementation of automatic robotic functions their significance is of great concern another drawback of hydraulic systems is leakage of minor amount of hydraulic fluid which is almost impossible to solve and the necessity to protect fluids from contamination both of which bring about demands for the highest quality standards and materials for manufacturing of components making hydraulic systems more expensive moreover hydraulic manipulators require complementary equipment such as hydraulic pump reservoir filters regulators valves etc most work class rovs are propelled by hydraulically actuated thrusters and therefore hydraulic power and equipment are already available on the base vehicles however this is not always the case e g the available power can be insufficient for running both thrusters and the manipulator at the same time or if the vehicle s thrusters are electrically actuated it is less likely that the vehicle has a hpu on the other hand electrical power is the only additional requirement for an electrical manipulator and it can usually already be found on an underwater robot 3 2 electric manipulators electric underwater manipulators are less frequent in commercial use but are often custom made as prototypes for research purposes actuators which are commonly used are brushless dc bldc electric motors with harmonic drive gears featuring low backlash and large reduction ratio to stop water ingress the actuators are oil filled which also provides lubrication and cooling frequently to avoid having external cables or possible entanglement power and signal cables are fed through the same hoses used for pressure compensation terribile et al 1994 experimental prototypes using magnetic coupling mechanisms for transferring torque into joints as an alternative approach for watertightness can be found in ishitsuka and ishii 2007a and ishitsuka and ishii 2007b the main advantage of electrically driven manipulators is the capability for precise motion and force torque control as they are inherently equivalent to the industrial robot arms depending on the nature of the task electric underwater manipulators can find use in subsea intervention operations however for most industrial intervention tasks they often do not meet the speed reliability and strength or force requirements hildebrandt et al 2009a the leading commercial manufacturer of electric underwater manipulators is eca robotics whose manipulator 7e is presented in fig 6 one of the first articles addressing the design of electrically driven underwater manipulator was presented by yoerger et al 1991 where a three dof manipulator was developed for the woods hole oceanographic institution s jason rov a six dof electrical manipulator developed by tecnomare and ansaldo in italy was reported in terribile et al 1994 having 2 1m reach with maximum payload of 30 kg another example of the early work can be found in smith et al 1994 where a five dof manipulator called poseidon was developed consisting of 1m reach operational depth of up to 100m and lifting capability of 5 kg collaborating with the autonomous systems laboratory of the university of hawaii for the sauvim auv project ansaldo developed a seven dof manipulator called maris 7080 fig 7 yuh et al 1998 marani et al 2009 rated for 6000m depth it has 1 4m reach and 6 kg payload at full extension two seven dof manipulators also developed by ansaldo were used within the amadeus project lane et al 1997 casalino et al 2001 for cooperative sampling in 2007 the space system laboratory at the university of maryland teamed with the woods hole oceanographic institute and developed a six dof subsea arctic manipulator for underwater retrieval and autonomous interventions samurai lewandowski et al 2008 some more recent work on the development of experimental electrical underwater manipulators can be found in pandian and sakagami 2010 where a three dof manipulator was developed for validation of control algorithms cobos guzman et al 2013 where a three dof manipulator called lafmia umi i was developed which was to be mounted on a mini submarine and sheikhbahaee et al 2014 where a four dof manipulator called kavosh 4 was developed for usage in towing tank in xu et al 2010 a design for an electrical three dof manipulator was proposed which was later developed and tested xiao et al 2011 shen et al 2011 and within the rauvi project fernandez et al 2013 reported modifying a commercially available electric manipulator arm 5e a product of csip now eca as a result of collaborative work of irs lab from the jaume i university in spain and csip company this manipulator was rebuilt for the purpose of reducing the dimensions and weight so that it can fit on the existing underwater vehicle girona 500 and has less dynamic coupling with it another recent custom made electrical underwater manipulator is the uma fig 8 developed by graal tech srl in italy for the trident project and which subsequently is currently commercially available ribas et al 2015 its unique characteristic is that it is made by modular joints with a compatible electromechanical interface which allows building a customised manipulator according to the desired user kinematics without doing a dedicated design 4 commercial underwater manipulator control systems commercial underwater manipulators mounted on rovs are controlled by teleoperation systems and are fully reliant on the pilot operator in the loop who is located on the surface vessel the pilot observes the scene through camera and or sonar systems feedback and simultaneously takes decisions regarding the motion and remotely operates the underwater manipulator using one of a few alternate input devices depending on the technical capabilities of the underwater manipulators different control methods are utilized 4 1 rate control hydraulic underwater manipulators which are not equipped with position sensors are operated in joint rate speed control mode in this case the motion of manipulator joint actuators is controlled by a valve pack fitted with solenoid directional control valves and or proportional valves the most basic control approach with minimum equipment is achieved with directional control valves often called switching valves because they switch the fluid passing through the valve from the source of flow to one of the actuator ports walters 2013 using a pilot console fig 9 equipped with a set of 3 position on off on switches the operator controls the valves in the pack and consequently the motion of the manipulator the size of the valve orifice determines the flow rate of the passing fluid and thus limits the joint speed which can be achieved the flow rate and thus the actuator joint speed is regulated only reduced to the desired level by additional adjustable flow control valves active actuator fluid flow control and therefore joint speed control is achieved by using proportional valves thus the name proportional control these valves allow infinite positioning of spools and thus provide infinitely adjustable flow some of them are designed to provide directional control functions as well as flow speed control all in one valve instead of requiring separate valves for direction and speed various required flow rates are achieved by changing the level of electrical signals controlling the valves and smooth actuator acceleration and deceleration is achieved by regulating rate of change of these electrical signals the described switch set pilot console is the most basic input device on the pilot side and using it provides the poorest manipulation efficiency a more sophisticated and intuitive input device that is used is a type of joystick which is often called a rate hand controller or a bear claw fig 10 some hydraulic control functions are achieved by pushing buttons integrated on this input device and other by twisting it rocking it from side to side or forth and back even though it is more intuitive than the method using a switch set it still requires quite a skilled and experienced pilot for safe successful and efficient operation such systems utilize no joint sensors and are examples of open loop control systems position control is achieved with the pilot in the loop with camera view of the manipulator and scene 4 2 position control advanced underwater manipulators are equipped with position sensors in each joint such as potentiometers analog resolvers digital optical encoders or solid state linear position sensors in case of hydraulic manipulators these sensors are used in combination with hydraulic servo valves for the realisation of closed loop manipulator joint position control set point regulation servo valves are electrically operated continuously acting valves that control how hydraulic fluid is ported to an actuator low voltage signals used to control the servo valve are passed into an amplifier which provides the power to alter the valve s position and the valve then delivers the required fluid power to the actuator dunnigan et al 1996 the position sensor on each joint returns an electrical signal to the servo amplifier which based on the comparison with the command signal conditions the strength of the servo valve control voltage manipulator joint servo position control is most commonly achieved in a so called master slave configuration with the use of a miniature master arm figs 11 13 as an input device with similar kinematics to the slave arm underwater manipulator the operator physically manoeuvres the master arm whose motion is then copied to the slave arm while simultaneously observing the slave arm s response through a video system each motion action of the miniature master arm is translated into varying electrical signals by position sensors usually potentiometers placed in each joint of the master arm simultaneously position sensors in the slave arm feed back varying electrical signals corresponding to the actual slave arm joint positions these signals are compared and any difference error signal initiates control signals for the servo valve causing it to release a certain flow of fluid to the appropriate port of its hydraulic actuator resulting in the actuator slave arm joint moving towards the commanded position most master arms have several push buttons integrated for some specific functions the most common one is freeze button which disables the master slave mode and disconnects the master arm from the control loop leaving the slave arm in the last pose in which it was before the button was pressed this gives the operator time to rest or reconfigure the master arm pose before continuing with the operation other buttons can be used for jaw functions stowing functions etc master arms are integrated in the master controller which provides additional user interface functions via function keys display etc 4 3 force feedback some master slave underwater manipulator control systems have force feedback which enables the pilot to sense reaction forces generated on the underwater manipulator and therefore make remote operation easier and more intuitive this mode of operation is in literature referred to as bilateral control while the operation without it is unilateral control in order to provide force feedback master arms joints are equipped with small electric actuators in addition to position sensors in the case of hydraulic manipulators the forces torques acting on the individual joints of the underwater manipulator are measured either directly by the use of six axis force torque sensor located on the wrist of the manipulator or indirectly by measuring the pressure in the actuator supply lines and converting this information into a force torque estimation in both cases the force torque information is then used to condition the strength of the control signals for the electric actuators located in the master arm individual joints which results in force feedback to the operator in addition to the improved telepresence the compliant nature of a force feedback system greatly reduces the risk of accidental damage to both the work site and the manipulator itself even with all the benefits provided with force feedback pilots have to be highly trained in order to successfully operate the subsea manipulator this is particularly important for the use of manipulators in delicate sites such as archaeological sampling søreide and jasinski 2008 scaradozzi et al 2013 additionally if there is a push for resident rov teleoperation of manipulators i e manipulation from shore through network infrastructure then again pilot task load is increased and there is a large dependence on pilot skill and network quality the resident rov teleoperation concept has recently been introduced in the industry by ikm subsea where a permanently deployed rov system is remotely operated from shore offshore engineerm and s 2016 chevron adopted a similar field resident concept for auvs gilmour et al 2012 in the academic sector the resident rov concept has been investigated within the dexrov project and advanced assisted on shore teleoperation over long distances is proposed gancet et al 2015 as motion disturbances affecting the underwater vehicle and the manipulator become more significant the task execution with pilot in the loop becomes more difficult more time consuming and eventually impossible especially in the case where the target infrastructure is in motion and the rov for some reason cannot clamp onto to it the human operator can react only after the change has already happened and therefore even an experienced operator is likely to fail if the conditions for task execution are difficult 4 4 gripper control as is the case for rest of the actuators in the underwater manipulator system the gripper is also controlled via same miniature master arm in master slave control mode the majority of grippers are hydraulically actuated and rate controlled in open loop the pilot predefines the gripper opening and closing speed in master controller settings and by squeezing the textured bands on the master arm wrist activates the grip function some underwater manipulators have a closed loop servo position controlled gripper which is achieved with sensor feedback usually a linear variable differential transformer lvdt a minority of suppliers offer grip force control and force feedback 5 underwater manipulator motion control underwater manipulators are multibody dynamic systems and therefore two main control techniques can be implemented in the first approach the manipulator is regarded as a mechanical system formed by multiple independent systems determined by the number of joints it has each joint axis is controlled individually as a single input single output siso system where coupling effects between the joints which are induced during the motion due to the varying manipulator configuration are treated as a disturbance this type of manipulator control strategy is known in the literature as decentralized control scheme siciliano et al 2009 the opposite strategy is a centralized control scheme which takes dynamic interaction effects between the joints into account for the controller design to be able to design an adequate controller for underwater manipulator some additional factors need to be analysed such as the type of drive system used to actuate manipulator joints manipulators actuated with electric motors usually have high ratio gears which tend to linearise manipulator system dynamics and thus significantly reduce nonlinearity effects caused by coupling effects between the joints however this comes at the price of introducing significant joint friction elasticity and backlash effects on the other hand manipulators actuated with direct drives such as hydraulic actuators have to deal with kinematic and dynamic coupling between the joints which is a result of configuration dependent inertia forces coriolis and centrifugal forces hydraulic systems introduce high nonlinearities due to laminar and turbulent flow channel geometry and friction additionally hydraulic system parameters are greatly variable dependent on the oil viscosity and the relationship between flow and pressure yao and wang 2012 hydrodynamic effects influencing an underwater manipulator such as buoyancy added mass dissipative drag and lift forces as well as external disturbances current waves etc all add nonlinearities and uncertainties to the dynamics thus making modeling and control even more complicated as the precise estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients is impossible because they vary according to the temperature depth salinity etc antonelli 2006 when a body is accelerated through a fluid some of the surrounding fluid is also accelerated with the body which creates additional inertia added to the system this is known as the added mass effect and it makes dynamics model parameters become variable and uncertain fossen 2011 drag and lift forces have a similar influence on the dynamic model parameters these forces act on a vehicle due to its movement through a viscous fluid and since the density of sea water is significant the magnitude of these forces can be significant as well buoyancy forces work against gravity and are dependent on the density of the fluid and the volume of the fluid displaced by the manipulator mcmillan et al 1995 waves sea currents and tides cause fluid accelerations and therefore external motion disturbances as well as forced oscillations and loads on the manipulator and the vehicle lapierre et al 1998 finally the presence of strong kinematic and dynamics coupling effects can occur between the base vehicle and the underwater manipulator any successful control scheme applied to the underwater manipulator must be able to cope with such highly nonlinear time varying and uncertain dynamics there has been an abundance of control schemes proposed for underwater manipulators over more than two decades however the majority of research has been done on a theoretical level with control performance validation done through simulations some control strategies have been tested on real experimental underwater manipulators but the work done on commercial underwater manipulators is scarce this is not surprising as the state of the art commercially available manipulators are quite expensive and often have integrated motion controllers with limited access into the control implementation any attempt to validate control approaches using commercial manipulators requires a significant amount of modification on the manipulator hardware 5 1 decentralized control control loop feedback mechanisms which integrate proportional p integral i and derivative d terms in different variations for basic controllers p pi pd pid etc as a set point regulators have been present in industry for decades choi and chung 2004 utilizing these pid type control laws for underwater manipulators within a decentralized joint space control strategy offers simplicity of implementation and low computational cost the trajectory planning for commercial underwater manipulators falls under the joint space point to point method initial to final joint configuration due to its master slave teleoperation approach however pid based control laws provide poor dynamic accuracy when trajectory tracking comes into play and the dynamic performance of the manipulator varies according to its configuration khalil and dombre 2004 regardless of its limitations a number of authors including smith et al 1994 reported utilizing pid based joint control laws in a decentralized control scheme for underwater manipulators dunnigan et al 1996 incorporated a fixed gain pid controller for each manipulator joint and realizing that the control performance degrades when the manipulator operates at different points in the workspace proposed investigating a self tuning adaptive control approach the outcome was an adaptive siso self tuning pole placement joint angle controller which provides benefits over a fixed gain pi pid controller for a range of different operating conditions clegg et al 2001 ishimi et al 1991 propose another adaptive pid controller with automatic gain tuning in accordance with arm posture changes and with feedforward compensation for gravity buoyancy speed and acceleration huo et al 2013 also analysed the performance disadvantages of traditional pid control and propose a pi algorithm with variable gains xu et al 2005a utilized fuzzy logic theory for adaptive pd controller gain tuning yao and wang 2012 propose a model reference adaptive control mrac scheme for individual joint control where the interaction between other joints and hydrodynamics influence are considered as external disturbances and controller parameters are adjusted on line in real time 5 2 centralized control other authors focused on nonlinear centralized control schemes which take advantage of the knowledge of an underwater manipulator dynamics model to compensate for the nonlinearities by eliminating them rather than reducing the effect induced by them and therefore enhance the trajectory tracking performance siciliano et al 2009 one of the early works on the investigation of underwater manipulator model based control is reported in liceaga castro et al liceaga castro et al 1991 where a nonlinear model matching controller is proposed the manipulator dynamics model includes some hydrodynamic effects which are calculated according to morison s equations schjølberg and fossen 1994 derived an underwater manipulator dynamics model with most dominating hydrodynamic forces included using an iterative newton euler algorithm and propose an inverse dynamics control approach this approach uses a feedback linearisation method to completely linearise a nonlinear system leaving it linear and decoupled so that a much simpler stabilizing linear controller can be utilized for trajectory tracking however this approach assumes an exact knowledge of the dynamics model which is impossible to measure or estimate the model is in reality known with a degree of uncertainty and imperfect cancellation of dynamics terms is guaranteed therefore this approach does not have adequate robustness as it is sensitive to time varying and uncertain model parameters and external disturbances siciliano et al 2009 in order to design a controller that can counteract the effects of imperfect compensation and thus deal to some extent with variable parameters and disturbances relaxing the unrealistic assumption of the accurate knowledge of the underwater manipulator dynamics model parameters some researchers have investigated integrating robust and adaptive control strategies the former counteracts the effects of the model approximation and the latter adapts the model parameters to those of the real underwater manipulator dynamics model siciliano et al 2009 lee and choi 2000 propose a robust controller designed by combining a computed torque controller and a sliding mode controller smc with a multi layer neural network controller which acts as a compensator maintaining the control performance when the initial uncertainty assumptions cease to be valid another robust control scheme is presented by yuh et al 2001 which consists of a disturbance observer controller which transforms a nonlinear underwater manipulator system with uncertainties into a simple model with disturbance error and a non regressor based adaptive controller designed according to the simplified model a number of authors propose robust trajectory tracking controllers for underwater manipulators based on the sliding mode control strategy and the dynamics model for estimating uncertainty bounds kwon et al 2000 xu et al xu et al 2007 some authors propose using fuzzy logic heuristics for sliding mode controller adaptive gain tuning xu et al 2005b an observer based pd backstepping robust nonlinear control technique for underwater manipulators is proposed by mohan 2011 esfahani et al 2013 presented a control scheme where an artificial immune system algorithm with wavelet mutation is used to derive optimal parameters for the conventional sliding mode controller a modified sliding mode control scheme namely terminal smc is proposed by venkatesan et al 2014 with a disturbance observer integrated for dealing with disturbances and uncertainties another robust controller with uncertainty disturbance estimator was presented by mohan and kim 2015a where the proposed controller integrates approximated inverse dynamic model output as a model base portion of the controller uses a feed forward term to enhance the control activity estimates a perturbed term to compensate for the external disturbances and unmodelled dynamics and has a decoupled nonlinear pid as a feedback portion to enhance closed loop stability and account for the estimation error of uncertainties 5 3 neural and fuzzy control some authors have investigated neural networks and fuzzy logic theory for designing control strategies for resolving the nonlinear control problem without taking into account any knowledge of the underwater manipulator dynamics wang et al 2008 propose a hybrid control method based on the integration of fuzzy logic control with a cerebellar model articulation controller neural network another fuzzy hybrid control scheme is presented by suboh et al 2009 where a takagi sugeno fuzzy controller is merged with a model reference adaptive controller equipped with pi adjustment mechanism based on the previous work of golea et al 2002 pandian and sakagami 2010 presented a neuro fuzzy pd control scheme for underwater manipulators where a fuzzy gain tuning method is utilized for adaptation under uncertainties and disturbances while the neural network is used to approximate the dynamics of the underwater manipulator and to add a feedforward compensation input to the pd fuzzy controller 6 uvms motion control underwater manipulators are usually not standalone systems but rather a part of a uvms as they are mounted on underwater vehicles in most cases work class rovs work class rov intervention operations which include using underwater manipulators require at least two highly skilled operators one to pilot the rov trying to keep it as stable as possible by compensating for external motion disturbances sea current waves tides and rov motion induced by manipulator s reaction forces moments while the other operator performs the actual teleoperated manipulation task this is the case when the rov is not operating on the seabed and when there is no possibility to clamp it onto the underwater structure this can occur if the surrounding environment does not provide adequate conditions for a safe and secure connection or simply if the underwater structure is not designed to be clamped onto the significant disadvantage of teleoperated control becomes prominent in harsh sea conditions because even very skilled pilots are able to react only after the disturbance event has already happened which induces significant delays in the system due to a number of handicaps that contribute to the task performance complexity rov pilots eventually get fatigued which leads to significant reduction of task effectiveness cooke 2006 capocci et al therefore a plausible approach for solving these problems is to implement semi automated or fully automated uvms control methods since underwater vehicle and manipulator motion are coordinated separately for rovs in current use the straight forward approach for uvms control implementation is to decouple the vehicle and the manipulator and regard the whole system as two independent systems to be controlled conventional station keeping algorithms can be utilized for underwater vehicle control while the underwater manipulator motion can be controlled as if it were on a fixed base having the automated manipulation system carry out the prescribed tasks through arm motion alone vehicle position set point can be replanned when the target is out of the workspace of the manipulator this approach simplifies the manipulator control but places a heavy burden onto the underwater vehicle control system as it needs to have a drive system with sufficient dynamic capabilities and precision navigation so the overall system can achieve adequate manipulation performance research on rov precision navigation and motion control has been investigated by toal et al 2011 omerdic and toal 2012 among others while sole manipulator control algorithms have been outlined in the previous section the problem of this approach is that it does not take into account the dynamic and kinematic coupling that occurs between the manipulator and its base vehicle which may significantly degrade the control effectiveness of the whole uvms the dynamic coupling arises as the manipulator while in motion transmits forces and moments which are variable in magnitude and direction to its base vehicle these forces and moments alter the pose of the base vehicle and hence the manipulator end effector position and orientation which is regarded as kinematic coupling dunnigan and russell 1994 the factors that cause these coupling effects are the relative size weight and shape of the manipulator compared to its base vehicle the lower the manipulator s weight and size compared to the underwater vehicle the better as coupling can then be either neglected or taken into account and dealt with appropriately relative manipulator to vehicle weight ratios for the existing typical heavy medium and light work class rovs are presented in table 2 when coupling effect are significant advanced control approaches have to be adopted 6 1 rov compensation for coupling effects one solution to deal with coupling effects while the manipulator is operating is to decouple the uvms and run a separate control loop for the base underwater vehicle alone keeping it in a fixed pose using the propulsion system this approach was investigated by a number of researchers who proposed advanced station keeping algorithms for the underwater vehicle taking dynamic and kinematic coupling effects into account koval 1994 proposes an automatic vehicle stabilization method where the manipulator caused vehicle motion is compensated for by feedforward terms based on manipulator kinematics and simplified dynamics without hydrodynamic forces dunnigan and russell 1994 demonstrated the effect of dynamic coupling between manipulator and rov through numerical simulations and propose a scheme to reduce it using a variable structure control law where forces torques affecting the rov are deduced from the equations of motion which include simplified hydrodynamic terms mclain et al 1996 experimentally demonstrated the significance of hydrodynamic coupling between the single link manipulator and its base vehicle when no vehicle control is applied and described a coordinated control approach for the uvms by incorporating model based hydrodynamic coupling information into the vehicle control law an alternative approach for rov stabilization due to the motion induced by an operating manipulator and external disturbances was investigated by kato and lane 1995 where multiple smaller arms other than the main manipulator were used as paddles for motion compensation interaction forces that occur between the manipulator and its base vehicle can be measured using a six axis force torque sensor mounted at the base of the manipulator some authors propose utilizing controllers for vehicle station keeping that use these measurements in order to compensate for coupling effects by adjusting thruster commands to correct the position of the vehicle lapierre et al 1998 fraisse et al 2000 in case the force torque sensor is unavailable ryu et al 2001 propose a controller which is based on the developed disturbance observer geffard et al 2000 for the estimation of interaction forces between the rov and the manipulator a similar approach is presented by vossoughi et al 2004 where forces moments are estimated based on the dynamic model and used as a feedforward portion of the rov controller to predict dynamic coupling forces torques soylu et al 2005 utilize an articulated body algorithm aba which is based on the uvms feedback states and a sliding mode controller for uvms station keeping using the same aba algorithm along with a combined h infinity sliding mode control scheme for underwater vehicle station keeping is presented by soylu et al 2009 an alternative vehicle stabilization method is proposed by lynch and ellery 2014 where the focus is on the control of the uvms barycenter rather than on the vehicle position antonelli and cataldi 2014 assumed that the manipulator is controlled independently by a joint based controller and used the information of desired manipulator trajectories to design an adaptive and recursive low level controller for the vehicle in the rov case apart from vehicle manipulator dynamic coupling effects hydrodynamic and gravitational forces acting on the tether also create internal forces on the rov soylu et al 2010a addressed this problem and performed numerical simulations which revealed the extent to which the tether affects the manipulator dynamics and utilized a model based sliding mode controller for rov station keeping capable of dealing with dynamic coupling effects caused by the tether 6 2 uvms motion control instead of decoupling it into two separate systems a uvms can be addressed as a single system which can utilize different control approaches capable of dealing with coupling effects occurring between the manipulator and the base vehicle the primary focus for a number of researchers investigating this approach is on the uvms set point regulation lizarralde et al 1995 propose a velocity less pd control set point regulator which drives the vehicle and the manipulator to the desired attitude and position another examples of uvms set point regulation is presented by antonelli and chiaverini 1998a where a robust sliding mode based control approach is used and by sun and cheah 2004 with the use of a generalized adaptive saturated proportional derivative sp d controller with gravity regressor for gravity and buoyancy compensation other authors focused on deriving the detailed uvms dynamics model and propose the implementation of conventional model based control schemes which can be applied for trajectory tracking utilizing a newton euler approach fossen 1991 derived equations of motion for a uvms considered as a micro macro manipulator a specific combination of parallel and serial mechanical structures where the manipulator gives fast and accurate end effector motion and the vehicle is the slower positioning part the same author proposes an adaptive controller for the uvms which is based on the work of slotine and weiping 1988 mahesh et al 1991 derived equations of combined uvms motion using a vector dyadic method and designed a coordinated adaptive control strategy where parameters of the linearised coupled model are estimated on line and used by a discrete time adaptive velocity controller for self tuning mcmillan et al 1995 1996 report on the developed efficient uvms dynamics simulation algorithm which includes major hydrodynamic effects which can provide aid in the design of control algorithms tarn et al 1996 use kane s method for the development of a dynamics model of an underwater vehicle equipped with an n dof manipulator including major hydrodynamic terms as well and thus provide a good background for the design of uvms control algorithms schjølberg and fossen 1994 propose a feedback linearisation approach followed by a derivation of the detailed dynamic model including the most important hydrodynamic terms a similar approach based on feedback linearisation has been investigated by a number of other researchers schjølberg and egeland 1996 utilize two different spacecraft manipulator system control schemes and apply them on the uvms tarn and yang 1997 address a multiple manipulator uvms model which includes major hydrodynamic forces wilson et al 2011 have developed a computed torque controller for uvms mohan 2013 present a model reference uvms control scheme and korkmaz et al 2013 present an inverse dynamics control method for uvms trajectory tracking where separate tasks are assigned for the end effector and the vehicle mohan and kim 2012 propose a nonlinear control scheme based on the feedback linearisation using indirect knowledge of the system dynamics and external disturbances via an extended kalman filter the same authors in mohan and kim 2015b propose a coordinated motion control scheme using a disturbance observer in task space londhe et al 2017 propose a robust single input fuzzy logic controller rsiflc applied for task space trajectory control that consists of feedback linearisation and feed forward controllers along with a single input fuzzy controller and an uncertainty estimator the main drawback of the feedback linearisation approach is that it assumes the exact knowledge of the system dynamics or at least a close estimation which is unrealistic and does not guarantee robustness to model parameter variation and uncertainties dunnigan and russell 1998 emphasize the significance of dynamic coupling through computer simulations on a six dof vehicle equipped with a three dof manipulator and integrate closed form manipulator disturbance expressions neglecting hydrodynamic terms into a sliding controller which is capable of dealing with parameter uncertainties to some extent in order to improve dynamic coupling modeling accuracy and achieve better uvms coordinated motion control leabourne and rock 1998 present research on an empirically determined hydrodynamic manipulator model acquired by real experiments with a two link manipulator mounted on a free floating vehicle de wit et al de wit et al 1998a emphasize that manipulator to vehicle coupling effects are dominant over the vehicle to manipulator ones and that the feedback compensation is only needed to overcome the coupling effects from the manipulator the uvms is divided into two subsystems one of which is fully independent from the other manipulator while the other vehicle is perturbed by the first subsystem manipulator an approach based on a singular perturbation is proposed as alternative to existing approaches requiring full model knowledge to compensate for vehicle manipulator coupling and their nonlinear effects by a partial linearising decoupled controller based on the same decoupling approach de wit et al de wit et al 1998b present a robust non model based controller for the uvms which consists of a linear pd controller for the manipulator and a robust nonlinear controller for the underwater vehicle based on the work reported by williamson and de wit williamson and de wit 1995 a comparative study of the proposed controller neglecting previous assumptions such as that the saturation levels of thrusters are unbounded infinitely accurate sensors infinitely small sampling time and absence of thruster nonlinearities is presented by diaz et al 1998 based on the same singular perturbed model de wit et al de wit et al 2000 propose a robust nonlinear feedback control for the uvms with composite dynamics which offers good compromise between control complexity and closed loop performance a modular approach for uvms control is presented by antonelli et al 1999a 2004 where an adaptive tracking controller with virtual decomposition zhu et al 1997 is adopted the proposed control approach exploits the serial chain structure of the uvms to decompose the overall motion control problem into separate simple rigid body control problems i e manipulator links and the vehicle sarkar and podder 2001 use a quasi lagrange method in order to derive uvms dynamic equations of motion which include thruster dynamics and utilize a computed torque control law for uvms trajectory tracking unlike most control methods based on the computed torque ishitsuka et al 2004 propose a resolved acceleration control rac method for the uvms the proposed control method is verified by numerical simulations reported by ishitsuka and ishii 2005 2006 an extension of this algorithm which includes compensation for disturbances caused by hydrodynamic forces acting on the vehicle along with the experimental verification can be found in yatoh and sagara 2008 sagara et al 2010 present another addition to the algorithm where the disturbance compensation is utilized both for the vehicle and the manipulator followed with the experimental validation finally the same method is enriched for a dual manipulator control scheme sagara and ambar 2014 xu et al 2005c present a non adaptive model based sliding mode controller for uvms based on the decentralized dynamics with simulation validations showing that the proposed sliding mode controller provides accurate and robust tracking performance superior to that obtained with a traditional pd controller periasamy et al 2008 present the development of a uvms dynamic model using the bond graph modeling technique where major hydrodynamic effects and coupled dynamics are included and they have designed a pd plus buoyancy compensation control for the uvms end effector trajectory tracking han et al 2011 proposed a robust uvms control approach where a nonlinear h infinity optimal control is utilized as an external tracking control loop and a disturbance observer as an internal disturbance compensation loop during the execution of the uvms intervention task the manipulator motion causes the shift of the orientation equilibrium of the whole uvms which causes restoring moments and forces to change as well and this eventually leads to additional spontaneous end effector motion in order to exploit this phenomenon han and chung 2014 proposed a robust adaptive control scheme that uses variant restoring moments to actively control the uvms most of the existing uvms control approaches neglect the existence of nonlinear thruster dynamics taira et al 2010 present a regressor based adaptive controller for uvms with thruster dynamics where adaptive control inputs are composed of adaptive feedforward signals including regressors of dynamic system models and error feedback signals in order to simplify the complex structure due to regressors the same authors propose an adaptive controller in taira et al 2012 that uses radial basis function rbf networks haykin 1998 instead of the regressors while in taira et al 2011 they propose a robust controller where the feedforward term is removed completely the performance of the robust controller is improved with pre compensators including integral actions taira et al 2014 in order to avoid the unrealistic assumption of exact knowledge of uvms dynamics and the complexity of estimating close to the real dynamic model some authors resorted to adaptive control methods that are independent of any model knowledge lee and yuh 1999 lee et al 2000 report on a non regressor based adaptive control scheme for uvms trajectory tracking based on a bound estimation method and a parameter adaptation algorithm for adjusting the controller gains based on the performance of the system rather than the knowledge of the dynamic model a sliding mode type controller with fuzzy logic implementation for adaptive gain tuning is proposed by xu et al 2005b using fuzzy logic heuristics for decentralized proportional derivative pd type controller gain tuning is also presented in xu et al 2005a sakagami 2009 propose using an iterative learning control approach in order to deal with the manipulator to vehicle coupling effects which assumes that the motion of the manipulator that is to be compensated for is known in advance 6 3 manipulator compensation for coupling effects some authors address the end effector trajectory tracking control problem of uvms in a different manner where the focus is on developing advanced manipulator control methods which alone compensate for the movement introduced by coupling effects between underwater vehicle and manipulator and or the external disturbances one of the early references to compensation of the underwater vehicle motion as a result of external tidal disturbances is by ishimi et al 1991 where a sway compensation controller is developed which uses the inertial navigation system ins signal transforms it into a displacement of the manipulator and adds it to the position command signal as a feedforward term thus cancelling out the sway of the vehicle with manipulator motion alone chung et al 2000 propose modeling a uvms as a class of underactuated robotic system with the assumption that the vehicle is free floating and proposed a robust control algorithm where the rov is modelled as a passive joint and manipulator joints are modelled as active joints a robust control method is realized with a nonlinear feedback disturbance observer plus pd control scheme and applied to each active joint kim et al 2003 propose an active damping two time scale control approach where the vehicle is passive or controlled by a simple p type controller and the manipulator is controlled with a composite two time scale fast and slow controller designed according to a partial decoupling approach an algorithm implemented on the manipulator system that is able to actively compensate for the rov motion based on the model based vehicle motion prediction algorithm is proposed by hildebrandt et al 2009b some authors have investigated compensation schemes such that the manipulator control law is a function of the vehicle velocity in the trident project simetti et al 2014 propose a dynamic programming dp approach which allows an optimal manipulator movement based on the current measured vehicle velocity simetti et al 2017 report experimental results of the maris project including a parallel task priority inverse kinematics tpik solution for manipulator control also based on vehicle velocity some authors propose using vehicle motion to complement the capabilities of the manipulator by providing extra dofs to achieve manipulator end effector trajectory tracking rather than having the underwater vehicle passive or controlled for station keeping antonelli et al 2000 2004 antonelli and chiaverini 2003a 2003b however using thrusters for manipulator end effector positioning is inefficient from an energy consumption perspective this is due to the complexity of controlling the underwater vehicle in hovering and lateral directions as well as because of significant difference in vehicle and manipulator inertias mohan et al 2012 7 kinematic control and motion planning in order to improve the overall performance of underwater manipulation many researchers utilized kinematic level enhancements some focus on the improvement of conventional pilot teleoperation techniques while others resort to the utilization of semi autonomous and fully autonomous control techniques in the hope of transferring the operator from direct control to a supervisory position some of the early research on teleoperation control enhancements includes the development of a human machine interface where a choice of possible remote control input devices is available including keyboard mouse master arm or joystick each of which provides benefits for different tasks larkum and broome 1994 another important approach that has been investigated by many researchers includes real time motion simulations and virtual graphical reconstruction of the manipulator workspace including workpiece solid models presented on the monitor display such tools provide supplementary visual aids in the traditional teleoperation by helping the operator to perceive the posture of the underwater manipulator and possibly avoid collision with the environment relevant pioneering research on this topic is reported by ishimi et al 1991 broome et al 1995 while more recent research work can be found in zhang et al 2003 hildebrandt et al 2008a jun et al 2009 the description of the implementation in further detail can be found in the previous paper sivčev et al 2015 published by the authors a number of researchers have investigated cartesian space teleoperation schemes as such an approach is more intuitive from the human perspective and advantages that it offers for various underwater manipulation tasks are quite clear especially for the peg in a hole type tasks operational space teleoperation techniques implemented and tested on work class rov have been reported in jun et al 2004 2008 2009 a workspace control approach which is based on the implementation of the differential inverse kinematics algorithm is developed where the operator uses an input device to control the manipulator end effector velocity and hence its position and orientation in cartesian space hildebrandt et al 2008b presented optimal direct kinematics and closed form analytical inverse kinematics solutions with special respect to computational simplicity whilst maintaining high numerical precision this has been applied to control a commercial underwater manipulator a schilling orion 7p fernandez et al 2013 also address cartesian space control with implementation on a modified version of the eca arm 5e huo et al 2013 utilize an analytical inverse kinematics solution for the six dof underwater manipulator developed by the shenyang institute of automation of the chinese academy of sciences and the authors sivčev et al 2015 present a numerical method for the solving inverse kinematics problem for a commercial underwater manipulator schilling titan 2 as finding the closed form analytical solution for the specific manipulator is impossible due to the lack of a spherical wrist siciliano et al 2009 a cartesian space teleoperation approach which offers a variety of reference coordinate systems such as joint world and tool is demonstrated on a simulated model in virtual reality and in subsea trials sivčev et al 2018a implementing inverse kinematics algorithms and developing cartesian control methods opens a lot of new possibilities for semi automated supervisory control schemes and fully automated manipulation solutions in the former the operator selects a task via user interface and then observes and monitors while the task is being executed while in the latter the task is sensor triggered moreover this approach brings underwater manipulation closer to totally automated industrial terrestrial robotics sivčev et al 2015 this is due to the fact that the majority of industrial robot arms have kinematics control end effector motion trajectory planning carried out in the operational cartesian space followed by inverse kinematics implementation and finally low level motion control motion trajectory tracking control performed in the joint space on the other side commercial underwater manipulators are teleoperated and therefore kinematics set point control is carried out in joint space since the master arm motion is recorded in joint space and then copied directly to the slave arm one of the earliest references on the implementation of supervisory control for underwater manipulators is by ishimi et al 1991 who describe how after an operator has chosen a task motion planning is utilized automatically based on the knowledge of the environment work tools platform etc and then transformed into data for manipulator motion control broome et al 1995 also discuss semi automatic and fully automatic modes backed up with motion planning algorithms and inverse kinematics implementation zhang et al 2003 propose a semi autonomous manipulator control under operator s supervision with a possibility of using a visualization display as a tool for outlining tasks jun et al 2009 present a preprogramed way point task control approach where the manipulator is able to execute a task for which a path was taught by the operator in advance the efficiency of this approach has been experimentally tested on rov mounted schilling orion 7p manipulators performing a soil coring task hildebrandt et al 2008a propose integrating additional features to the online virtual reality 3d visualization that could help the operator during the supervisory control such as visualization of end effector paths or previewing possible manipulator configurations prior to the actual movement as a result of motion planning algorithms this is achieved by a secondary 3d visualization of the manipulator projected as a semi transparent overlay another feature that can aid the pilot in teleoperated mode is proposed by albiez et al 2009 based on the workspace analysis of the manipulator where a computer is continuously calculating the distance to the workspace border enabling the operator to get information about current dexterity of the underwater manipulator the ranges where the dexterity does not exceed a given limit and the possibility for automatic motion some authors propose integrating collision avoidance algorithms into supervisory and totally autonomous control schemes broome et al 1995 ishibashi et al 2001 2002 use genetic algorithms for obstacle avoidance of both stationary and dynamic objects where both position of the end effector and posture of the manipulator is utilized for motion planning david et al 2007 propose integrating an active collision avoidance feature based on the margritte 3d graphic supervisor gravez et al 2003 into the enhanced teleoperation scheme by coupling the real robot manipulator with a simulated one to generate movement for both of them since the simulated manipulator has integrated algorithm for automatic obstacle avoidance in the virtual reality the operator can handle the real slave manipulator safely without taking care of real environment obstacles assuming perfect knowledge and modeling of obstacles this control scheme was developed for use in the nuclear environment but was tested on a cybernetix maestro hydraulic underwater manipulator which could be applied for subsea applications sivčev et al 2018b propose a voxel based collision detection algorithm applicable for commercial work class rovs some authors address kinematic control and motion planning algorithms on a uvms level podder and sarkar 2000 propose a dynamics based trajectory planning approach capable of generating both kinematically admissible and dynamically feasible joint space trajectories for systems composed of heterogeneous dynamics such as uvms characterised by a much slower dynamic response of the underwater vehicle compared to that of the manipulator in the proposed approach task space trajectory is represented in terms of fourier series and various frequency components from the series are used to generate reference joint space trajectories based on natural frequencies of the respective subsystems shim et al 2013 address uvms motion planing and control based on rov position estimation using extended kalman filter and propose a precise dynamic workspace control method where the manipulator is controlled to move in a straight line while the rov is assumed to be floating a method for uvms global motion planning capable of generating feasible and obstacle free task paths based on the 4d bump surface concept is presented by sotiropoulos et al 2013 the pandora project has explored learning the trajectory of the vehicle and the end effector by demonstration carrera et al 2014 to accomplish the valve turning with experiments in a tank environment in the merbots project youakim et al 2017 have used the motion planning ros package moveit to compute reference trajectories for the uvms advanced control problems considering dual arm uvms are presented in farivarnejad and moosavian 2014 simetti and casalino 2015 ambar et al 2015 even more complex problems such as cooperative uvms are addressed in conti et al 2015 simetti and casalino 2017 ocean one project developed a bimanual force controlled humanoid robot that affords immediate and intuitive haptic interaction in oceanic environments khatib et al 2016 7 1 redundancy if an underwater vehicle is station keeping or fixed e g sitting on the seabed or clamped onto a structure achieving arbitrary position and orientation with end effector within its workspace is possible only if the manipulator has at least six dofs manipulators with more dofs are in a kinematic sense considered inherently redundant siciliano et al 2009 and their redundant dofs can be advantageously exploited in different ways for achieving secondary objectives such as avoiding obstacles minimizing energy consumption etc however since a free floating vehicle has its own six dofs those can be exploited together with manipulator dofs for achieving arbitrary end effector position and orientation as well as for redundancy resolution some authors addressed uvms kinematic redundancies and investigated approaches which take them into account to generate trajectories corresponding to given tasks while the extra dofs are used to assign additional motion without impeding the end effector s performance antonelli and chiaverini 1998b propose a uvms task priority inverse kinematics approach for redundancy resolution with robustness to the occurrence of algorithmic singularities where redundancy is exploited for reducing power consumption and increasing the manipulability of the system sarkar and podder 1999 2001 address the kinematic redundancy resolution with the minimization of the total drag on the uvms an approach where redundancy is exploited in order to find an optimal posture for a manipulator by obtaining either maximum manipulability staying away from the joint limits or minimizing the vehicle s roll and pitch angles is presented by antonelli and chiaverini 2003a 2003b redundancy resolution algorithms with the focus on obtaining an optimal manipulator posture are reported by jun et al 2004 2008 ismail and dunnigan 2009 propose a redundancy resolution in order to minimize gravity and buoyancy loading of the uvms soylu et al 2010b address redundancy resolution with different secondary objectives such as avoiding joint limits singularities and high joint velocities keeping the end effector in sight of the on board camera minimizing the rov motion and minimizing the drag forces on the rov han et al 2011 han and chung 2014 focus on the optimization of uvms s restoring moments a fuzzy redundancy resolution approach is investigated by antonelli and chiaverini 2003a antonelli and chiaverini 2003b and dos santos et al dos santos et al 2006 an alternative prioritization of tasks for the coordinated motion control of the uvms is proposed by casalino et al 2012 and simetti et al 2013 within this strategy end effector position and orientation is given a secondary priority objective while the high priority tasks are keeping each joint within its range of motion keeping the manipulability measure above the given positive threshold maintaining horizontal vehicle attitude in the desired range and keeping the vehicle pose in the desired range mohan and kim 2015b propose a task space coordination control scheme that is able to track the given desired path and also to perform power efficient trajectories in the pandora project cieslak et al 2015 propose an approach that combines learning and task priority and present experimental trials on the topic of redundancy resolution there are additional task priority frameworks in the literature kanoun et al 2011 escande et al 2014 moe et al 2016 simetti and casalino 2016 7 2 implementational issues investigating the application of different control techniques on commercial underwater manipulators revealed some of the implementation issues the state of the art commercially available position servo controllers for underwater manipulators work on the basis of joint space set point regulation for this reason the implementation of any trajectory tracking with detailed information about position velocity and acceleration either in joint or cartesian space is impossible without excessive hardware and software modifications on the low level motion controller of the underwater manipulator this means that any high level kinematics control and motion planning implementation on commercial underwater manipulators has to utilize joint space point to point motion planning with a path described as a sequence of set points spenneberg et al 2007 while investigating high level control implementation on a commercial hydraulic underwater manipulator schilling orion 7p hildebrandt et al 2008b emphasize the importance of the type of ramp function to be used within the joint angle reference signal as a part of described path in order to avoid jerky and hight strain movements and propose using bezier like curves computed using de casteliau s algorithm which are at least twice continuously differentiable another issue is a nonlinearity occurrence that comes with the use of a linear cylinder as the underwater manipulator actuator which can be compensated for by finding a relationship between the linear actuator stroke and the joint angle hildebrandt et al 2008b jun et al 2009 yet another issue that can be of great concern is the low position accuracy present in low level motion controllers of underwater manipulators in order to cope with this drawback hildebrandt et al 2009a propose a multi layered controller which provides increased precision without any modification of the manipulator s hardware as a combination of an adaptive speed control layer and a second sub degree position control layer since underwater manipulators are built for human in the loop teleoperation the control command set point update frequency on the top side is rather low sivčev et al 2018a e g a slingsby manipulator features a 50 hz manipulator control update while the top side pilot command update is 5 hz larkum and broome 1994 analysing the communication protocols of schiling orion 7p manipulator hildebrandt et al 2008b reports on the low 12 5 hz control frequency and emphasizes the possibility to boost it up to 62 5 hz only by modifying protocols however this is not the case with some electrical manipulators such as graal tech srl uma arm which can provide a global interface for sending commands and receiving feedback from joints at a rate of up to 200 hz ribas et al 2015 8 force control subsea intervention tasks carried out with underwater manipulators often demand extensive contact with the environment connector plugging valve turning etc therefore end effector trajectory tracking control has to be backed up with the implementation of interaction force torque control of the end effector with the environment this is due to the fact that under pure manipulator position control a slight deviations of the end effector from the planned trajectory can cause the manipulator to either lose contact with the surface or press too strongly on the surface and possibly result in disastrous consequences by generating extremely large interaction forces spong et al 2005 force control has been broadly investigated for fixed base industrial robot arms the most common control schemes in literature are passive and active compliance control impedance control and hybrid impedance control which can be found in spong et al 2005 siciliano et al 2009 siciliano and villani 2012 one of the first to address this control problem for an underwater manipulator are dunnigan et al 1996 who propose a hybrid position force control scheme and present the results achieved through practical tests on the slingsby ta9 hydraulic manipulator in dexrov project lillo et al 2016 demonstrate how force regulation can be accomplished at kinematic level both for simple interactions such as closing a valve and pushing a button or for more complex intervention such as pipe inspection activities casalino et al 2017 additional research on underwater manipulator force control algorithms with validation through extensive numerical simulations can be found in kajita and kosuge 1997 lapierre et al 1998 antonelli et al 1999b cui et al 1999 cui and sarkar 2000 antonelli et al 2002 lemieux et al 2006 cataldi and antonelli 2015 9 conclusion this paper comprehensively summarized the state of the art of practical and theoretical knowledge about underwater manipulator systems and has given a broad overview of the existing bibliography and research results it provided a survey of the use of manipulation technology for a variety of subsea intervention and inspection operations within different offshore areas of application both commercially available underwater manipulator solutions and prototype systems have been analysed relevant topics have been discussed including manipulator technical specifications mechanical design actuation robot modeling kinematics and dynamics control approaches and algorithms motion control kinematic control motion planning and a detailed comparison has been presented highlighting advantages and disadvantages of different solutions present in the underwater manipulation technology the goal of this paper is to present a realistic picture of the existing technology and its limitation in order to provide a useful background source for future research in the field of underwater robotics and manipulation critical factors limiting the performance of underwater manipulators have crystallised from the comprehensive review of the state of the art the authors strongly recommend that these factors be considered during the design of future underwater manipulator systems an important topic that was not covered within the scope of this paper is the application of machine vision for underwater manipulation it is an area that has great potential to enhance existing sub sea manipulation systems we believe a whole paper can be dedicated to it and our plan for further research is to thoroughly investigate and analyse this area and provide a complementary review before final conclusion we would like to underline the major problems in the present technology and propose areas for further research some of the main issues of the existing commercial systems are low control capabilities and lack of automation even though the top of the range manipulator systems consist of high quality sensors and drives the capabilities of its control systems are insufficient they feature low accuracy low repeatability and low control loop frequency and the reason is because these systems have been historically designed as remote tele operated devices rather than robot arms to overcome this we propose exploiting the knowledge of robot arm servo control approaches used in industrial manufacturing applications and adapting and transferring these techniques into underwater robotics the key for underwater manipulation technology is we believe in achieving industrial robot arm capabilities while keeping the operator in the control loop to some extent either directly or as an observer the goal is not to replace underwater manipulators with industrial robots but to automate as many tasks as possible such as grabbing a tool closing a valve plugging a connector etc in order to decrease the task execution time and lower the burden on the operator therefore by introducing automation some processes can become totally automatic or semi automatic while others would remain remotely operated a system which simultaneously utilizes both autonomous functions and teleoperation is also a possibility where the major motion is to be controlled automatically while the operator would be in charge of applying additional motion corrections significant improvements can be made by developing advanced control systems and implementing them on top of the existing underwater manipulator systems the huge potential benefit of this approach is the ease of integration on existing vehicles however this approach is not without limitations and further advancements can only be made by retrofitting the control systems of the existing underwater manipulators many researchers have been working on the development of control algorithms but few have actually implemented and tested them on real subsea manipulator systems moreover there are no torque controllable commercial manipulators at the moment table 1 therefore many of the proposed low level control algorithms are not applicable to commercial systems and even to most prototype ones some relatively recent academic research that included experimental subsea trials in field environment or at least in test tank has been done within ocean one maris trident rauvi pandora cmanipulator and kordi the last two addressed commercial hydraulic rov manipulator systems while the remaining ones focused on intervention auvs with electrical prototype manipulators some of the ongoing projects that are involved in relevant underwater manipulation experiments are robust http eu robust eu merbots http www irs uji es project merbots dexrov http www dexrov eu and operations support engineering spoke project under marei http www mmrrc ul ie the last one makes use of industry standard hydraulic rov manipulators and the rest use electrical manipulators on auvs collision avoidance or rather controlled collision is another aspect that can prove to be useful in manipulation technology implementing a system where the manipulator is inherently prevented from colliding with other equipment on the base vehicle and with the other manipulator if there are two on the vehicle would provide safer operations where the pilot would be able to operate with ease additionally this would increase the confidence in the implementation of automated solutions some specific tasks especially the repetitive ones could benefit from teach by demonstration methods the operator would perform a teleoperation task which would be recorded with the possibility to be repeated in an autonomous regime this feature would allow an operator who is not familiar with the robot programming to utilize autonomous functions another potential field of study that builds on the automated manipulation is the combined vehicle manipulator control approach an interesting approach to investigate is the development of systems that use vehicle navigation and positioning data for the manipulator control in order to compensate for the vehicle motion a useful example would be a system where the end effector position and or orientation is unaffected by the motion of the vehicle this would simplify the teleoperation and increase the effectiveness of autonomous manipulation the ideas of combined vehicle manipulator control approaches are not a novelty in the literature but there are very few practical implementations especially such that can easily be integrated on existing systems which we believe is crucial if it is taken up for application in the subsea industry acknowledgements this material is based upon works supported by science

23224,typhoon induced waves threaten the coastal areas of taiwan each year the roaring waves caused by typhoon meranti 2016 even destroyed a lighthouse in a fishing port on the southwestern coast of taiwan therefore there has been increased interest in creating potential risk maps for typhoon induced waves along the coast of taiwan in this study the highest intensity and lowest intensity typhoons hits and lits respectively for each category from 1977 to 2016 were selected a fully coupled tide surge wave model was utilized to map the distributions of maximum significant wave heights for 18 typhoon events each map was classified into one of 5 levels and employed to generate maximum and minimum potential risk maps for typhoon induced waves our results demonstrate that the northern and the eastern coasts of taiwan are threatened by violent waves significant wave heights swhs range from 7 to 11 5 m over a coastline length of 236 4 km and roaring waves swhs exceeding 11 5 m over a coastline length of 298 1 km under hit conditions the lengths of coastline threatened by big waves swhs ranging from 3 to 6 m and small waves swhs less than 3 m are 637 7 km and 553 4 km respectively under lit conditions keywords potential risk maps typhoon induced wave tide surge wave model taiwanese waters 1 introduction typhoons that make landfall in coastal areas are among the most serious natural disasters smith 1996 nicholls et al 2007 bertin et al 2015 the direct threats of a typhoon can be devastating and include losses of human life and property damage primarily derived from destructive winds heavy rainfall storm surges and roaring waves as well as debris flows caused by continuous heavy rainfall in mountainous areas lee and kim 2015 the catastrophes caused by large typhoon induced waves generally include severe damage in coastal and offshore regions pang et al 2013 extreme waves from typhoons threaten human lives and infrastructure in taiwan for example a lighthouse in a fishing port on the southwestern coast of taiwan was destroyed during typhoon meranti 2016 ocean surface waves subject to extreme weather conditions such as typhoons or hurricanes are of great interest to oceanographers and ocean engineers young 1999 liu et al 2017 therefore there has been increased interest in creating potential risk maps for typhoon induced waves prmtws along the coast of taiwan using numerical models studies employing numerical simulations of typhoon and wind storm generated sea states have been continuously conducted for several decades cardone et al 1996 moon et al 2003 babanin et al 2011 liu et al 2017 third generation spectral wind wave models are capable of predicting wave heights under severe meteorological conditions i e typhoons as long as the wind field over the sea surface is accurately provided the wamdi group 1988 the effects of surface waves on tidal currents or tidal currents on surface waves i e wave current interactions are among the most important mechanisms in coastal hydrodynamics wave propagation over spatially varying currents especially typhoon induced strong currents can cause refraction kudryavtsev et al 1999 ris et al 1999 and wave steepening can occur if the current is opposite the direction of waves romero et al 2017 enhanced wave breaking is expected because wave current interactions modulate the bottom roughness phillips 1984 munk et al 2000 olabarrieta et al 2014 moreover extreme wave heights can result from wave current interactions white and fornberg 1998 janssen and herbers 2009 onorato et al 2011 toffoli et al 2015 it is also necessary to consider the interactions between tides and waves in numerical models to accurately simulate the coastal hydrodynamics and sea states in energetic waters including in studies of marine energy hashemi and neill 2014 sediment transport storm surges and extreme wind waves hashemi et al 2015 increases in the incident wave height are evident during rising tides davidson et al 2008 coastal wave heights are mainly controlled by the total water depth therefore the effects of tides and surges on waves must also be considered because waves contribute to the total water level by means of wave setup through radiation stress additionally wind waves and elevated water levels can enhance flooding in low lying coastal areas because the total water level is a combination of mean sea level tides and storm tidal meteorological surge plus wind induced surge waves which are often generated by the same storm event wolf 2009 in the present study the effects of tide wave and wave current interactions on wave hindcasts are considered using an unstructured grid fully coupled tide surge wave model the model consists of a coastal hydrodynamic model and a third generation spectral wave model the same computational domain and unstructured grid system are shared in the coupled model the advantage of this scenario is that errors arising from data interpolation between the two models can be avoided additionally the modeling system can efficiently perform parallel computations the primary objectives of this study are as follows 1 implement the tide surge wave fully coupled high resolution model in a study of taiwanese waters 2 validate the fully coupled model with available measured data 3 reproduce spatial distribution maps of the maximum significant wave heights swhs for selected typhoons 4 create maximum and minimum prmtws and 5 assess the length of the coastline under threat from each swh level 2 methodology and data 2 1 coastal hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamics of the waters surrounding taiwan were simulated with the novel community model schism semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism is a derivative product built from the original selfe model semi implicit eulerian lagrangian finite element volume zhang and baptista 2008 and distributed with an open source apache v2 license the model includes many enhancements and upgrades such as a new extension to a large scale eddy regime and a seamless cross scale capability ranging from the creek to ocean scales zhang et al 2016 schism and selfe have been widely used to simulate tsunami propagation zhang et al 2011 predict water quality and ecosystem dynamics rodrigues et al 2009 2011 chen and liu 2017 analyze oil spill diffusion and transport azevedo et al 2009 generate inundation maps fortunato et al 2013 chen and liu 2016 evaluate inundation extents induced by extreme river flows typhoons or hurricanes chen and liu 2014 wang et al 2014 and estimate tidal current power chen et al 2017a the surface circulation feature is similar to that at the bottom during spring wu et al 2007 and weak winter stratification is caused by vertical mixing in taiwanese waters oey et al 2010 hence the schism model employed in this study is a two dimensional vertically integrated model with a barotropic mode the governing equations in the cartesian coordinate system and two dimensional form are given as follows 1 η t u h x v h y 0 2 d u d t f v x g η α ψ ˆ p a ρ 0 τ s x τ r x τ b x ρ 0 h and 3 d v d t f u y g η α ψ ˆ p a ρ 0 τ s y τ r

x and 4b τ s y ρ a c s w x 2 w y 2 w y where c s is the wind drag coefficient ρ a is the air density and w x and w y are the 10 m wind speed components above the sea surface in the x and y directions respectively c s is often regarded as an increasing function of wind velocity but powell et al 2003 suggested that c s should be limited at high wind speeds the formula for calculating c s in schism is as follows 5 c s 1 0 3 0 61 0 063 6 0 w 6 0 0 61 0 063 w 6 0 w 50 0 0 61 0 063 50 0 w 50 0 where w is the resultant wind speed 10 m above the sea surface τ b x and τ b y are the bottom shear stress components in the x and y directions respectively and can be computed by the following formulas 6a τ b x ρ 0 c d u 2 v 2 u and 6b τ b y ρ 0 c d u 2 v 2 v where c d is the bottom drag coefficient specifically c d can be parameterized as follows 7 c d g n 2 h 1 3 where n is the manning coefficient which was set to 0 025 in the model based on the type of the sea bottom material however the bottom drag coefficient c d varies with h according to equation 9 τ r x and τ r y are the wave induced stress i e radiation stress components in the x and y directions respectively and can be computed following the methods of longuet higgins and stewart 1962 1964 8a τ r x s x x x s x y y and 8b τ r y s x y x s y y y where s x x s x y and s y y are the wave radiation stress components according to battjes 1974 these components can be represented as follows 9a s x x 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p sin θ d θ d σ 9b s x y s y x 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p cos 2 θ 1 1 2 d θ d σ and 9c s y y 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p sin 2 θ 1 1 2 d θ d σ where n is the wave action σ is the relative angular frequency of waves θ is the wave direction and c g and c p are the wave group velocity and wave phase velocity respectively 2 2 third generation spectral wave model phase averaged spectral wind wave models have the advantage of efficiently hindcasting sea states in realistic applications komen et al 1994 thus the wwm iii wind wave model iii state of the art third generation spectral wind wave model was adopted to predict the swhs caused by typhoons in the coastal waters of taiwan the governing equation for wwm ii is the wave action equation which is given as follows 10 n t c g x u n x c g y v n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s t o t σ where n is the wave action c g x and c g y are the wave group velocity components in the x and y

breaking values in shallow water areas using the method presented by battjes and janssen 1978 with a constant wave breaking coefficient of 0 78 the maximum wave direction in wwm iii is 360 and this measure is discretized into 36 bins the low and high frequency limits of the discrete wave period are 0 03 and 1 0 hz respectively and are divided into 36 bins the schism model computes the depth averaged current and water surface elevation and then passes the results to the wave model and wwm iii sends the radiation stress to schism by solving the wave action equation fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the coupling processes for the schism wwm iii modeling system more details about the model coupling procedures can be found in roland et al 2012 the previous version of schism wwm iii selfe wwm ii has been successfully applied to predict storm tides and typhoon induced waves in the coastal waters of taiwan chen et al 2017b 2 3 wind forcing and boundary conditions the wind forcing data used to drive schism wwm iii were the wind field data at 10 m above sea level produced by era interim and were acquired from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf public datasets era interim is the latest global atmospheric reanalysis dataset and is normally updated once per month with a delay of two months dee et al 2011 the 10 m u and v wind components were extracted from an era interim reanalysis data at a temporal resolution of 6 h four analysis fields per day at 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 utc and a spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 and were converted to the unstructured grids of schism wwm iii using the inverse distance weighting idw method instead of using a nested model the boundary conditions were specified for schism wwm iii the wave boundary conditions of the regional schism wwm iii model including the swh mean wave direction mean directional spreading peak frequency and zero down crossing frequency were obtained from a global wavewatch

harmonic constants of eight tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 were extracted from a regional inverse tidal model china seas and indonesia 2016 zu et al 2008 at a resolution of 1 30 and were set at each node of the open boundary to drive the model 2 4 model configuration the computational domain covers taiwan in its entirety and its main offshore islands such as the penghu islands green island and lanyu this region is within the longitudinal range of 114oe to 130oe and latitudinal range of 19on to 29on and includes the waters of the western pacific ocean the south china sea the taiwan strait and the east china sea which are located to the east south west and north of taiwan respectively as shown in fig 2 a two gridded bathymetry datasets were employed in this study one dataset comprises global data obtained from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco with a resolution of 30 arc seconds it was generated by combining quality controlled ship depth soundings with interpolations between sounding points guided by satellite derived gravitational data the other dataset consists of local data provided by the department of land administration ministry of the interior in taiwan with a resolution of 200 m this dataset spans the longitudes of 100oe to 128oe and latitudes of 4on to 29on the bathymetry data for the coupled model were produced by merging the gebco and local bathymetry datasets our modeling domain comprises 278 630 triangular cells and 142 041 non overlapping unstructured grids coarse meshes with a 30 km resolution were arranged on open ocean boundaries and fine meshes with a 300 m resolution were used along the coastline of taiwan and small offshore islands fig 2b once the unstructured grids were created the merged gridded bathymetry data were interpolated to each node to represent the bottom elevations in the coupled model fig 2a a time step of 120 s was used in the coastal hydrodynamic model with no signs of numerical instability for the present grid system whereas the time step of wwm iii is 600 s i e schism and wwm iii exchange information every five hydrodynamic time steps chen et al 2007 used the coupled adcric swan model to predict the storm surges and wind waves in mobile bay alabama they updated the current field and total water depth in the wind wave model every 30 min and suggested that the model results were insensitive to increases in the exchange frequency 2 5 selection of typhoons the central weather bureau cwb classifies typhoons that impact taiwan into nine categories hereinafter referred to as c1 to c9 according to their tracks information about each category of typhoon such as its name duration air pressure and wind speed can be found in the cwb typhoon database the typhoons with tracks closest to taiwan and with the highest intensity hit for each category were selected from the past 40 years 1977 2016 the same approach was utilized to extract the lowest intensity typhoon lit for each category these 18 typhoons 9 hit and 9 lit typhoons were used to generate the maximum and minimum prmtws fig 3 illustrates the tracks of the typhoon categories and the corresponding number of times typhoons of each category occurred from 1977 to 2016 a total of 129 typhoons impacted taiwan the most frequent typhoons are c3 and c6 events with 23 occurrences each in the past 40 years whereas the least frequent category is c8 with only 8 occurrences table 1 lists the names and years of the selected typhoons 2 6 metrics for evaluation of model performance four criteria were used to evaluate the model performance for the hindcasts of significant wave height peak period and sea surface height i e astronomical tide and storm tide mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse modified mean absolute percentage error mape and skill the skill value of 1 means perfect performance a skill value ranging between 0 65 and 1 0 indicates excellent performance very good

swhs peak period tp and sea surface heights sshs measured at four buoys in 2016 by the harbor and marine technology center hmtc and cwb in taiwan the locations of the wave buoys are shown in fig 4 the keelung suao and hualien buoys are situated along the northeastern to eastern coast of taiwan and the penghu buoy is located on the western coast of taiwan the taiwan strait fig 5 presents the model data comparisons for swhs at the keelung buoy fig 5a the suao buoy fig 5b the hualien buoy fig 5c and the penghu buoy fig 5d from sep 22 2016 to oct 10 2016 this period not only covers the normal wind generated waves but also the abnormal waves induced by strong winds from typhoon megi the interval between two red dashed lines the maximum swh reached approximately 5 5 m 9 5 m 7 5 m and 3 5 m at the keelung suao hualien and penghu buoys respectively due to the approach of typhoon megi the peak swh occurred at keelung suao and hualien buoys by sep 28 2016 with a lag of almost 1 day at the penghu buoy as shown in fig 5d this is because typhoon megi crossed taiwan from east to west model hindcasts of tp were compared with observations the results of these comparisons for four wave buoys are presented in fig 6 a to fig 6d fig 6 reveals that the schism wwm iii faithfully reproduced the variations in tp the maximum tp is approximately 12 s at the keelung buoy 15 s at the suao and hualien buoys and 10 s at the penghu buoy similar to the swh the tp increased as a result of typhoon megi the model data comparisons of sshs astronomical tide and storm tide for the keelung suao hualien and penghu buoys were shown in fig 7 a to fig 7d the ssh hydrographs indicate that simulations have good agreement with observation in both astronomical tide and storm tide in the period between two red dashed lines however model slightly underestimated ssh around maximum storm tide at the penghu buoy fig 7d the statistical errors of the differences between the model hindcasts and observations at the four wave buoys for 2016 are also estimated and is listed in table 2 the maximum mae of tp swh and ssh are 2 05 s 0 52 m and 0 14 m at the penghu buoy the maximum rmse for tp swh and ssh read as 3 88 s 0 83 m and 0 17 m at the penghu buoy the maximum mape is 25 12 for tp at the penghu buoy while the minimum mape 14 09 for swh at the suao buoy the skill index is in the excellent range 0 67 0 98 with regard to simulating swh tp and ssh as shown in table 2 although the hindcasted swhs tp and sshs exhibit good agreement with the measurements under both ordinary and extraordinary meteorological conditions slight discrepancies still exist and may be due to the lower spatial and temporal resolutions of the wind field data from era interim through the procedure of model data comparison the swh hindcasts produced by schism wwm iii are deemed reliable and can be further applied to generate the single prmtw of each category and the comprehensive prmtws for the hits and lits along the coast of taiwan 4 results and discussion 4 1 reproduction of the maximum swh to create the spatial distribution of the maximum and minimum potential typhoon induced swhs in the waters surrounding taiwan the maximum swhs were reproduced by hindcasting 9 hits and 9 lits as listed in table 1 fig 8 displays the track central air pressure and spatial distribution of the maximum swhs for each category of hit clearly the primary influence of typhoon driven maximum swhs was restricted to the right sides of the typhoon tracks at the regional scale this result is caused by the enhancements in wind velocity on the right sides of the typhoons through the increases in their translation speeds moon et al 2003 higher maximum swhs are observed for c2 fig 8b c3 fig 8c c4 fig 8d c6 fig 8f and c7 fig 8 g and reach 15 m whereas the maximum swhs of c1 fig 8a c5 fig 8e c8 fig 8 h and c9 fig 8i are relatively lower and range from 6 m to 12 m the magnitudes and distributions of maximum swh were highly dependent on the typhoon track and intensity the band of 15 m maximum swh appears for c2 c3 c4 and c7 and is especially significant for c4 and c7 because the typhoon intensities of c4 and c7 were higher than those of other categories there finding is an interesting phenomenon that must be noted the intensity of the c2 typhoons is higher than that for c3 however the extent of the band of 15 m maximum swh for c3 is larger than that for c2 the 15 m maximum swh band of c2 is only concentrated near part of the northeastern coast of taiwan fig 8b but for c3 this band occurs along the track of the typhoon fig 8c this difference may be due to the wave dissipation with a consequent decrease in wave height the dominant dissipation processes of wind waves are depth induced breaking and bottom friction xu et al 2013 the seafloor elevations under the track of c3 are deeper than those associated with the c2 track comparing fig 8b with fig 8c and referring to fig 2a and consequently c3 has less dissipation than c2 fig 9 depicts the track central air pressure and spatial distribution of the maximum swhs for each category of lit similar to the results in fig 8 for the hits the maximum swh of each category of lit was also spread along the right sides of the typhoon tracks fig 9a for c1 fig 9b for c2 fig 9c for c3 fig 9d for c4 fig 9e for c5 fig 9f for c6 fig 9g for c7 fig 9h for c8 and fig 9i for c9 nevertheless the magnitudes of the maximum swhs for the lits were smaller than those for the hits because they were the weaker typhoons 4 2 creation of the maximum and minimum prmtws the maximum swhs of the 9 categories of hits and lits were classified into five levels by cwb taiwan and mapped along the coastline of taiwan to generate the prmtws the swh ranges of the five levels and their corresponding abbreviations are listed in table 3 fig 10 a to fig 10i illustrate the prmtws of c1 to c9 for the hits gray green blue yellow and red represent small waves sws big waves bws giant waves gws violent waves vws and roaring waves rws respectively as illustrated in fig 10a c1 of the hits only impacts part of the northern coast of taiwan and lies at level bw c2 of the hits influences most of the northern coast and part of the eastern coast of taiwan fig 10b the northern coastline is threatened by rws vws and gws whereas the northeastern and northwestern coastlines are threatened by bws the extents of rws and vws shift to the northern part of the eastern coast and the northeastern coast and the lower part of the eastern coast are almost influenced by bws for c3 of the hits fig 10c rws and vws influence the entire eastern coast moreover bws are distributed over the northeastern coast and the lower part of the southwestern coast and gws appear on the southernmost coast for c4 of the hits fig 10d fig 10e depicts the distribution of the maximum swh levels for c5 of the hits the eastern and the southernmost coasts are almost entirely influenced by bws except for a fraction of the southeastern coast which is affected by vws and gws fig 10e bws threaten the entire northernmost northeastern and southeastern coasts as well as the lower part of the eastern coast moreover gws are distributed over the upper part of the eastern coast for c6 of the hits fig 10f the longest length of coastline with rws is found on the southeastern coast for c7 of the hits fig 10g due to the passage of super typhoon meranti 2016 from the bashi channel to the taiwan strait as shown in fig 8g bws dominate the northern northeastern and southwestern coasts and gws and vws strongly affect the upper and lower parts of the eastern coast respectively fig 10g only bws and sws appear for c8 and c9 of the hits fig 10h and i in addition bws are restricted to the southeastern coast for c8 and the southeastern southwestern and a tiny portion of the eastern coasts for c9 regarding the prmtws of c1 to c9 for the lits rws vws and gws are not present in fig 11 fig 11a for c1 fig 11b for c2 fig 11c for c3 fig 11d for c4 fig 11e for c5 fig 11f for c6 fig 11g for c7 fig 11h for c8 and fig 11i for c9 and even bws do not exist for c5 and c8 events i e only sws remain fig 11e and h the lengths of the coastlines corresponding to each swh level and each typhoon category for the hits and lits are summarized in table 4 the longest coastline length for sws is 1191 1 km the total coastline length of taiwan for c5 and c8 of the lits additionally c6 of the hits is associated with the longest coastline lengths at 445 1 km and 120 9 km for bws and gws respectively vws and rws have the longest coastline lengths of 249 5 km and 122 4 km for c4 and c7 respectively under hit conditions 4 3 assessment of the comprehensive prmtw a comprehensive prmtw of the nine categories of hits and lits can be found in fig 12 and fig 13 in general the northern and eastern coasts of taiwan especially the southeastern coast are potentially impacted by a very severe sea state under hit conditions as shown in fig 12 the northern and eastern coasts of taiwan are generally affected by vw swhs along a coastline length of 236 4 km and rw swhs along a coastline length of 298 1 km under hit conditions the coastline lengths threatened by sws and bws under lit conditions are 553 4 km and 637 7 km respectively fig 13 the west coast is primarily subjected to the mild effects of typhoon induced waves sws as shown in figs 12 and 13 primarily because the majority of typhoons including hits cross taiwan from east to west c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 and c7 as shown in fig 4 in addition the typhoon intensity is diminished by high mountains when crossing taiwan fig 14 illustrates the coastline length for each swh level of the comprehensive prmtw under hit and lit conditions lengths of 0 km can be found for gws vws and rws for lit events compared to hits the impacts of lits on coast are minor and insignificant however prmtws for lits are still useful to an early warning for the coast of taiwan for example the coastal highways are usually threatened by wind waves when typhoon is approaching taiwan the roads may be closed to traffic once measured wave heights exceed early warning thresholds according to the report of directorate general of highways taiwan in 2017 the early warning threshold of wave height is 6 0 m for the central east coast and is only 3 5 m for the southeastern coast the values are fallen within level bws this means that the early warning for coastal highway is considered to be issued even if lit approaches taiwan 4 4 future work the 6 h temporal and 0 125 by 0 125 spatial resolutions of the wind field data from era interim seem too low to accurately force a tide surge wave coupled model although it is a convenient approach for providing meteorological boundary conditions and producing acceptable sea state hindcasts therefore using a three layer nested wrf weather research and forecast michalakes et al 2001 model with a temporal resolution of 1 h and a spatial resolution of 45 km by 45 km for domain 1 15 km by 15 km for domain 2 and 5 km by 5 km for domain 3 will be considered as an alternative source of meteorological information for schism wwm iii to generate another set of prmtws in the future 5 summary a high resolution tide surge wave fully coupled model based on an unstructured grid schism wwm iii was implemented to simulate the hydrodynamics and sea states in the waters surrounding taiwan hindcasts of the spatial distributions of maximum swhs were developed using nine hits and nine lits in each category selected from 1977 to 2016 the 10 m winds above sea level from the era interim reanalysis dataset were established as the meteorological conditions in schism wwm iii the magnitudes and spatial distributions of maximum swhs were highly dependent on the typhoon track and intensity each of the maximum swhs was classified based on the wave levels sws bws gws vws and rws and transferred to the coastline of taiwan to generate maximum and minimum prmtws the results indicate that the northern and eastern coasts of taiwan are influenced by vws 7 m vw 11 5 m and rws rw 11 5 m induced by hits the coastlines affected by bws 3 m bw 6 m include the northeastern eastern and southwestern coasts and the northwestern and western coast are dominated by sws sw 3 m when lit conditions are present the prmtws created in this study are useful for designing and constructing coastal infrastructures such as seawalls and tetrapods additionally the results could be used to prepare detailed evacuation plans and early warnings for associated wave induced emergencies caused by approaching typhoons acknowledgments this research was supported by the ministry of science and technology most taiwan grant no most 106 2625 m 865 001

23224,typhoon induced waves threaten the coastal areas of taiwan each year the roaring waves caused by typhoon meranti 2016 even destroyed a lighthouse in a fishing port on the southwestern coast of taiwan therefore there has been increased interest in creating potential risk maps for typhoon induced waves along the coast of taiwan in this study the highest intensity and lowest intensity typhoons hits and lits respectively for each category from 1977 to 2016 were selected a fully coupled tide surge wave model was utilized to map the distributions of maximum significant wave heights for 18 typhoon events each map was classified into one of 5 levels and employed to generate maximum and minimum potential risk maps for typhoon induced waves our results demonstrate that the northern and the eastern coasts of taiwan are threatened by violent waves significant wave heights swhs range from 7 to 11 5 m over a coastline length of 236 4 km and roaring waves swhs exceeding 11 5 m over a coastline length of 298 1 km under hit conditions the lengths of coastline threatened by big waves swhs ranging from 3 to 6 m and small waves swhs less than 3 m are 637 7 km and 553 4 km respectively under lit conditions keywords potential risk maps typhoon induced wave tide surge wave model taiwanese waters 1 introduction typhoons that make landfall in coastal areas are among the most serious natural disasters smith 1996 nicholls et al 2007 bertin et al 2015 the direct threats of a typhoon can be devastating and include losses of human life and property damage primarily derived from destructive winds heavy rainfall storm surges and roaring waves as well as debris flows caused by continuous heavy rainfall in mountainous areas lee and kim 2015 the catastrophes caused by large typhoon induced waves generally include severe damage in coastal and offshore regions pang et al 2013 extreme waves from typhoons threaten human lives and infrastructure in taiwan for example a lighthouse in a fishing port on the southwestern coast of taiwan was destroyed during typhoon meranti 2016 ocean surface waves subject to extreme weather conditions such as typhoons or hurricanes are of great interest to oceanographers and ocean engineers young 1999 liu et al 2017 therefore there has been increased interest in creating potential risk maps for typhoon induced waves prmtws along the coast of taiwan using numerical models studies employing numerical simulations of typhoon and wind storm generated sea states have been continuously conducted for several decades cardone et al 1996 moon et al 2003 babanin et al 2011 liu et al 2017 third generation spectral wind wave models are capable of predicting wave heights under severe meteorological conditions i e typhoons as long as the wind field over the sea surface is accurately provided the wamdi group 1988 the effects of surface waves on tidal currents or tidal currents on surface waves i e wave current interactions are among the most important mechanisms in coastal hydrodynamics wave propagation over spatially varying currents especially typhoon induced strong currents can cause refraction kudryavtsev et al 1999 ris et al 1999 and wave steepening can occur if the current is opposite the direction of waves romero et al 2017 enhanced wave breaking is expected because wave current interactions modulate the bottom roughness phillips 1984 munk et al 2000 olabarrieta et al 2014 moreover extreme wave heights can result from wave current interactions white and fornberg 1998 janssen and herbers 2009 onorato et al 2011 toffoli et al 2015 it is also necessary to consider the interactions between tides and waves in numerical models to accurately simulate the coastal hydrodynamics and sea states in energetic waters including in studies of marine energy hashemi and neill 2014 sediment transport storm surges and extreme wind waves hashemi et al 2015 increases in the incident wave height are evident during rising tides davidson et al 2008 coastal wave heights are mainly controlled by the total water depth therefore the effects of tides and surges on waves must also be considered because waves contribute to the total water level by means of wave setup through radiation stress additionally wind waves and elevated water levels can enhance flooding in low lying coastal areas because the total water level is a combination of mean sea level tides and storm tidal meteorological surge plus wind induced surge waves which are often generated by the same storm event wolf 2009 in the present study the effects of tide wave and wave current interactions on wave hindcasts are considered using an unstructured grid fully coupled tide surge wave model the model consists of a coastal hydrodynamic model and a third generation spectral wave model the same computational domain and unstructured grid system are shared in the coupled model the advantage of this scenario is that errors arising from data interpolation between the two models can be avoided additionally the modeling system can efficiently perform parallel computations the primary objectives of this study are as follows 1 implement the tide surge wave fully coupled high resolution model in a study of taiwanese waters 2 validate the fully coupled model with available measured data 3 reproduce spatial distribution maps of the maximum significant wave heights swhs for selected typhoons 4 create maximum and minimum prmtws and 5 assess the length of the coastline under threat from each swh level 2 methodology and data 2 1 coastal hydrodynamic model the hydrodynamics of the waters surrounding taiwan were simulated with the novel community model schism semi implicit cross scale hydroscience integrated system model schism is a derivative product built from the original selfe model semi implicit eulerian lagrangian finite element volume zhang and baptista 2008 and distributed with an open source apache v2 license the model includes many enhancements and upgrades such as a new extension to a large scale eddy regime and a seamless cross scale capability ranging from the creek to ocean scales zhang et al 2016 schism and selfe have been widely used to simulate tsunami propagation zhang et al 2011 predict water quality and ecosystem dynamics rodrigues et al 2009 2011 chen and liu 2017 analyze oil spill diffusion and transport azevedo et al 2009 generate inundation maps fortunato et al 2013 chen and liu 2016 evaluate inundation extents induced by extreme river flows typhoons or hurricanes chen and liu 2014 wang et al 2014 and estimate tidal current power chen et al 2017a the surface circulation feature is similar to that at the bottom during spring wu et al 2007 and weak winter stratification is caused by vertical mixing in taiwanese waters oey et al 2010 hence the schism model employed in this study is a two dimensional vertically integrated model with a barotropic mode the governing equations in the cartesian coordinate system and two dimensional form are given as follows 1 η t u h x v h y 0 2 d u d t f v x g η α ψ ˆ p a ρ 0 τ s x τ r x τ b x ρ 0 h and 3 d v d t f u y g η α ψ ˆ p a ρ 0 τ s y τ r y τ b y ρ 0 h where η x y t is the free surface elevation h η h is the total water depth h is the bathymetric depth u x y t and v x y t are the horizontal velocity components in the x and y directions respectively f is the coriolis factor g is the acceleration due to gravity ψ ˆ is the earth s tidal potential α is the effective earth elasticity factor ρ 0 is the reference density of water and p a x y t is the atmospheric pressure at the free surface τ s x and τ s y are the wind stress components in the x and y directions respectively and can be expressed as follows 4a τ s x ρ a c s w x 2 w y 2 w x and 4b τ s y ρ a c s w x 2 w y 2 w y where c s is the wind drag coefficient ρ a is the air density and w x and w y are the 10 m wind speed components above the sea surface in the x and y directions respectively c s is often regarded as an increasing function of wind velocity but powell et al 2003 suggested that c s should be limited at high wind speeds the formula for calculating c s in schism is as follows 5 c s 1 0 3 0 61 0 063 6 0 w 6 0 0 61 0 063 w 6 0 w 50 0 0 61 0 063 50 0 w 50 0 where w is the resultant wind speed 10 m above the sea surface τ b x and τ b y are the bottom shear stress components in the x and y directions respectively and can be computed by the following formulas 6a τ b x ρ 0 c d u 2 v 2 u and 6b τ b y ρ 0 c d u 2 v 2 v where c d is the bottom drag coefficient specifically c d can be parameterized as follows 7 c d g n 2 h 1 3 where n is the manning coefficient which was set to 0 025 in the model based on the type of the sea bottom material however the bottom drag coefficient c d varies with h according to equation 9 τ r x and τ r y are the wave induced stress i e radiation stress components in the x and y directions respectively and can be computed following the methods of longuet higgins and stewart 1962 1964 8a τ r x s x x x s x y y and 8b τ r y s x y x s y y y where s x x s x y and s y y are the wave radiation stress components according to battjes 1974 these components can be represented as follows 9a s x x 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p sin θ d θ d σ 9b s x y s y x 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p cos 2 θ 1 1 2 d θ d σ and 9c s y y 0 2 π 0 n σ c g c p sin 2 θ 1 1 2 d θ d σ where n is the wave action σ is the relative angular frequency of waves θ is the wave direction and c g and c p are the wave group velocity and wave phase velocity respectively 2 2 third generation spectral wave model phase averaged spectral wind wave models have the advantage of efficiently hindcasting sea states in realistic applications komen et al 1994 thus the wwm iii wind wave model iii state of the art third generation spectral wind wave model was adopted to predict the swhs caused by typhoons in the coastal waters of taiwan the governing equation for wwm ii is the wave action equation which is given as follows 10 n t c g x u n x c g y v n y c σ n σ c θ n θ s t o t σ where n is the wave action c g x and c g y are the wave group velocity components in the x and y directions respectively u and v are the horizontal velocity components in the x and y directions respectively σ is the relative angular frequency of waves θ is the wave direction c σ and c θ are the propagation velocities in σ θ space and s t o t is the sum of the source terms of wave variance including non linear interactions wind growth and dissipation by white capping bottom friction and wave breaking the bottom friction and peak enhancement factors are set to 0 067 and 3 3 based on the formulation of the joint north sea wave project jonswap hasselmann et al 1973 wwm iii estimates wave breaking values in shallow water areas using the method presented by battjes and janssen 1978 with a constant wave breaking coefficient of 0 78 the maximum wave direction in wwm iii is 360 and this measure is discretized into 36 bins the low and high frequency limits of the discrete wave period are 0 03 and 1 0 hz respectively and are divided into 36 bins the schism model computes the depth averaged current and water surface elevation and then passes the results to the wave model and wwm iii sends the radiation stress to schism by solving the wave action equation fig 1 shows a schematic diagram of the coupling processes for the schism wwm iii modeling system more details about the model coupling procedures can be found in roland et al 2012 the previous version of schism wwm iii selfe wwm ii has been successfully applied to predict storm tides and typhoon induced waves in the coastal waters of taiwan chen et al 2017b 2 3 wind forcing and boundary conditions the wind forcing data used to drive schism wwm iii were the wind field data at 10 m above sea level produced by era interim and were acquired from the european center for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf public datasets era interim is the latest global atmospheric reanalysis dataset and is normally updated once per month with a delay of two months dee et al 2011 the 10 m u and v wind components were extracted from an era interim reanalysis data at a temporal resolution of 6 h four analysis fields per day at 00 00 06 00 12 00 and 18 00 utc and a spatial resolution of 0 125 0 125 and were converted to the unstructured grids of schism wwm iii using the inverse distance weighting idw method instead of using a nested model the boundary conditions were specified for schism wwm iii the wave boundary conditions of the regional schism wwm iii model including the swh mean wave direction mean directional spreading peak frequency and zero down crossing frequency were obtained from a global wavewatch iii ww iii model developed by the french research institute for the exploitation of the sea ifremer at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and a temporal resolution of 3 h for tide boundary conditions the harmonic constants of eight tidal constituents m2 s2 n2 k2 k1 o1 p1 and q1 were extracted from a regional inverse tidal model china seas and indonesia 2016 zu et al 2008 at a resolution of 1 30 and were set at each node of the open boundary to drive the model 2 4 model configuration the computational domain covers taiwan in its entirety and its main offshore islands such as the penghu islands green island and lanyu this region is within the longitudinal range of 114oe to 130oe and latitudinal range of 19on to 29on and includes the waters of the western pacific ocean the south china sea the taiwan strait and the east china sea which are located to the east south west and north of taiwan respectively as shown in fig 2 a two gridded bathymetry datasets were employed in this study one dataset comprises global data obtained from the general bathymetric chart of the oceans gebco with a resolution of 30 arc seconds it was generated by combining quality controlled ship depth soundings with interpolations between sounding points guided by satellite derived gravitational data the other dataset consists of local data provided by the department of land administration ministry of the interior in taiwan with a resolution of 200 m this dataset spans the longitudes of 100oe to 128oe and latitudes of 4on to 29on the bathymetry data for the coupled model were produced by merging the gebco and local bathymetry datasets our modeling domain comprises 278 630 triangular cells and 142 041 non overlapping unstructured grids coarse meshes with a 30 km resolution were arranged on open ocean boundaries and fine meshes with a 300 m resolution were used along the coastline of taiwan and small offshore islands fig 2b once the unstructured grids were created the merged gridded bathymetry data were interpolated to each node to represent the bottom elevations in the coupled model fig 2a a time step of 120 s was used in the coastal hydrodynamic model with no signs of numerical instability for the present grid system whereas the time step of wwm iii is 600 s i e schism and wwm iii exchange information every five hydrodynamic time steps chen et al 2007 used the coupled adcric swan model to predict the storm surges and wind waves in mobile bay alabama they updated the current field and total water depth in the wind wave model every 30 min and suggested that the model results were insensitive to increases in the exchange frequency 2 5 selection of typhoons the central weather bureau cwb classifies typhoons that impact taiwan into nine categories hereinafter referred to as c1 to c9 according to their tracks information about each category of typhoon such as its name duration air pressure and wind speed can be found in the cwb typhoon database the typhoons with tracks closest to taiwan and with the highest intensity hit for each category were selected from the past 40 years 1977 2016 the same approach was utilized to extract the lowest intensity typhoon lit for each category these 18 typhoons 9 hit and 9 lit typhoons were used to generate the maximum and minimum prmtws fig 3 illustrates the tracks of the typhoon categories and the corresponding number of times typhoons of each category occurred from 1977 to 2016 a total of 129 typhoons impacted taiwan the most frequent typhoons are c3 and c6 events with 23 occurrences each in the past 40 years whereas the least frequent category is c8 with only 8 occurrences table 1 lists the names and years of the selected typhoons 2 6 metrics for evaluation of model performance four criteria were

swhs peak period tp and sea surface heights sshs measured at four buoys in 2016 by the harbor and marine technology center hmtc and cwb in taiwan the locations of the wave buoys are shown in fig 4 the keelung suao and hualien buoys are situated along the northeastern to eastern coast of taiwan and the penghu buoy is located on the western coast of taiwan the taiwan strait fig 5 presents the model data comparisons for swhs at the keelung buoy fig 5a the suao buoy fig 5b the hualien buoy fig 5c and the penghu buoy fig 5d from sep 22 2016 to oct 10 2016 this period not only covers the normal wind generated waves but also the abnormal waves induced by strong winds from typhoon megi the interval between two red dashed lines the maximum swh reached approximately 5 5 m 9 5 m 7 5 m and 3 5 m at the keelung suao hualien and penghu buoys respectively due to the approach of typhoon megi the peak swh occurred at keelung suao and hualien buoys by sep 28 2016 with a lag of almost 1 day at the penghu buoy as shown in fig 5d this is because typhoon megi crossed taiwan from east to west model hindcasts of tp were compared with observations the results of these comparisons for four wave buoys are presented in fig 6 a to fig 6d fig 6 reveals that the schism wwm iii faithfully reproduced the variations in tp the maximum tp is approximately 12 s at the keelung buoy 15 s at the suao and hualien buoys and 10 s at the penghu buoy similar to the swh the tp increased as a result of typhoon megi the model data comparisons of sshs astronomical tide and storm tide for the keelung suao hualien and penghu buoys were shown in fig 7 a to fig 7d the ssh hydrographs indicate that simulations have good agreement with observation in both astronomical tide and storm tide in the period between two red dashed lines however model slightly underestimated ssh around maximum storm tide at the penghu buoy fig 7d the statistical errors of the differences between the model hindcasts and observations at the four wave buoys for 2016 are also estimated and is listed in table 2 the maximum mae of tp swh and ssh are 2 05 s 0 52 m and 0 14 m at the penghu buoy the maximum rmse for tp swh and ssh read as 3 88 s 0 83 m and 0 17 m at the penghu buoy the maximum mape is 25 12 for tp at the penghu buoy while the minimum mape 14 09 for swh at the suao buoy the skill index is in the excellent range 0 67 0 98 with regard to simulating swh tp and ssh as shown in table 2 although the hindcasted swhs tp and sshs exhibit good agreement with the measurements under both ordinary and extraordinary meteorological conditions slight discrepancies still exist and may be due to the lower spatial and temporal resolutions of the wind field data from era interim through the procedure of model data comparison the swh hindcasts produced by schism wwm iii are deemed reliable and can be further applied to generate the single prmtw of each category and the comprehensive prmtws for the hits and lits along the coast of taiwan 4 results and discussion 4 1 reproduction of the maximum swh to create the spatial distribution of the maximum and minimum potential typhoon induced swhs in the waters surrounding taiwan the maximum swhs were reproduced by hindcasting 9 hits and 9 lits as listed in table 1 fig 8 displays the track central air pressure and spatial distribution of the maximum swhs for each category of hit clearly the primary influence of typhoon driven maximum swhs was restricted to the right sides of the typhoon tracks at the regional scale this result is caused by the enhancements in wind velocity on the right sides of the typhoons through the increases in their translation speeds moon et al 2003 higher maximum swhs are observed for c2 fig 8b c3 fig 8c c4 fig 8d c6 fig 8f and c7 fig 8 g and reach 15 m whereas the maximum swhs of c1 fig 8a c5 fig 8e c8 fig 8 h and c9 fig 8i are relatively lower and range from 6 m to 12 m the magnitudes and distributions of maximum swh were highly dependent on the typhoon track and intensity the band of 15 m maximum swh appears for c2 c3 c4 and c7 and is especially significant for c4 and c7 because the typhoon intensities of c4 and c7 were higher than those of other categories there finding is an interesting phenomenon that must be noted the intensity of the c2 typhoons is higher than that for c3 however the extent of the band of 15 m maximum swh for c3 is larger than that for c2 the 15 m maximum swh band of c2 is only concentrated near part of the northeastern coast of taiwan fig 8b but for c3 this band occurs along the track of the typhoon fig 8c this difference may be due to the wave dissipation with a consequent decrease in wave height the dominant dissipation processes of wind waves are depth induced breaking and bottom friction xu et al 2013 the seafloor elevations under the track of c3 are deeper than those associated with the c2 track comparing fig 8b with fig 8c and referring to fig 2a and consequently c3 has less dissipation than c2 fig 9 depicts the track central air pressure and spatial distribution of the maximum swhs for each category of lit similar to the results in fig 8 for the hits the maximum swh of each category of lit was also spread along the right sides of the typhoon tracks fig 9a for c1 fig 9b for c2 fig 9c for c3 fig 9d for c4 fig 9e for c5 fig 9f for c6 fig 9g for c7 fig 9h for c8 and fig 9i for c9 nevertheless the magnitudes of the maximum swhs for the lits were smaller than those for the hits because they were the weaker typhoons 4 2 creation of the maximum and minimum prmtws the maximum swhs of the 9 categories of hits and lits were classified into five levels by cwb taiwan and mapped along the coastline of taiwan to generate the prmtws the swh ranges of the five levels and their corresponding abbreviations are listed in table 3 fig 10 a to fig 10i illustrate the prmtws of c1 to c9 for the hits gray green blue yellow and red represent small waves sws big waves bws giant waves gws violent waves vws and roaring waves rws respectively as illustrated in fig 10a c1 of the hits only impacts part of the northern coast of taiwan and lies at level bw c2 of the hits influences most of the northern coast and part of the eastern coast of taiwan fig 10b the northern coastline is threatened by rws vws and gws whereas the northeastern and northwestern coastlines are threatened by bws the extents of rws and vws shift to the northern part of the eastern coast and the northeastern coast and the lower part of the eastern coast are almost influenced by bws for c3 of the hits fig 10c rws and vws influence the entire eastern coast moreover bws are distributed over the northeastern coast and the lower part of the southwestern coast and gws appear on the southernmost coast for c4 of the hits fig 10d fig 10e depicts the distribution of the maximum swh levels for c5 of the hits the eastern and the southernmost coasts are almost entirely influenced by bws except for a fraction of the southeastern coast which is affected by vws and gws fig 10e bws threaten the entire northernmost northeastern and southeastern coasts as well as the lower part of the eastern coast moreover gws are distributed over the upper part of the eastern coast for c6 of the hits fig 10f the longest length of coastline with rws is found on the southeastern coast for c7 of the hits fig 10g due to the passage of super typhoon meranti 2016 from the bashi channel to the taiwan strait as shown in fig 8g bws dominate the northern northeastern and southwestern coasts and gws and vws strongly affect the upper and lower parts of the eastern coast respectively fig 10g only bws and sws appear for c8 and c9 of the hits fig 10h and i in addition bws are restricted to the southeastern coast for c8 and the southeastern southwestern and a tiny portion of the eastern coasts for c9 regarding the prmtws of c1 to c9 for the lits rws vws and gws are not present in fig 11 fig 11a for c1 fig 11b for c2 fig 11c for c3 fig 11d for c4 fig 11e for c5 fig 11f for c6 fig 11g for c7 fig 11h for c8 and fig 11i for c9 and even bws do not exist for c5 and c8 events i e only sws remain fig 11e and h the lengths of the coastlines corresponding to each swh level and each typhoon category for the hits and lits are summarized in table 4 the longest coastline length for sws is 1191 1 km the total coastline length of taiwan for c5 and c8 of the lits additionally c6 of the hits is associated with the longest coastline lengths at 445 1 km and 120 9 km for bws and gws respectively vws and rws have the longest coastline lengths of 249 5 km and 122 4 km for c4 and c7 respectively under hit conditions 4 3 assessment of the comprehensive prmtw a comprehensive prmtw of the nine categories of hits and lits can be found in fig 12 and fig 13 in general the northern and eastern coasts of taiwan especially the southeastern coast are potentially impacted by a very severe sea state under hit conditions as shown in fig 12 the northern and eastern coasts of taiwan are generally affected by vw swhs along a coastline length of 236 4 km and rw swhs along a coastline length of 298 1 km under hit conditions the coastline lengths threatened by sws and bws under lit conditions are 553 4 km and 637 7 km respectively fig 13 the west coast is primarily subjected to the mild effects of typhoon induced waves sws as shown in figs 12 and 13 primarily because the majority of typhoons including hits cross taiwan from east to west c1 c2 c3 c4 c5 and c7 as shown in fig 4 in addition the typhoon intensity is diminished by high mountains when crossing taiwan fig 14 illustrates the coastline length for each swh level of the comprehensive prmtw under hit and lit conditions lengths of 0 km can be found for gws vws and rws for lit events compared to hits the impacts of lits on coast are minor and insignificant however prmtws for lits are still useful to an early warning for the coast of taiwan for example the coastal highways are usually threatened by wind waves when typhoon is approaching taiwan the roads may be closed to traffic once measured wave heights exceed early warning thresholds according to the report of directorate general of highways taiwan in 2017 the early warning threshold of wave height is 6 0 m for the central east coast and is only 3 5 m for the southeastern coast the values are fallen within level bws this means that the early warning for coastal highway is considered to be issued even if lit approaches taiwan 4 4 future work the 6 h temporal and 0 125 by 0 125 spatial resolutions of the wind field data from era interim seem too low to accurately force a tide surge wave coupled model although it is a convenient approach for providing meteorological boundary conditions and producing acceptable sea state hindcasts therefore using a three layer nested wrf weather research and forecast michalakes et al 2001 model with a temporal resolution of 1 h and a spatial resolution of 45 km by 45 km for domain 1 15 km by 15 km for domain 2 and 5 km by 5 km for domain 3 will be considered as an alternative source of meteorological information for schism wwm iii to generate another set of prmtws in the future 5 summary a high resolution tide surge wave fully coupled model based on an unstructured grid schism wwm iii was implemented to simulate the hydrodynamics and sea states in the waters surrounding taiwan hindcasts of the spatial distributions of maximum swhs were developed using nine hits and nine lits in each category selected from 1977 to 2016 the 10 m winds above sea level from the era interim reanalysis dataset were established as the meteorological conditions in schism wwm iii the magnitudes and spatial distributions of maximum swhs were highly dependent on the typhoon track and intensity each of the maximum swhs was classified based on the wave levels sws bws gws vws and rws and transferred to the coastline of taiwan to generate maximum and minimum prmtws the results indicate that the northern and eastern coasts of taiwan are influenced by vws 7 m vw 11 5 m and rws rw 11 5 m induced by hits the coastlines affected by bws 3 m bw 6 m include the northeastern eastern and southwestern coasts and the northwestern and western coast are dominated by sws sw 3 m when lit conditions are present the prmtws created in this study are useful for designing and constructing coastal infrastructures such as seawalls and tetrapods additionally the results could be used to prepare detailed evacuation plans and early warnings for associated wave induced emergencies caused by approaching typhoons acknowledgments this research was supported by the ministry of science and technology most taiwan grant no most 106 2625 m 865 001
