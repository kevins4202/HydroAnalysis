21405,to achieve a better utilization of ocean space and energy three integrated concepts of column type wind turbine and heave type wave energy converter wec have been proposed for deep intermediate and shallow water depth conditions respectively the wecs are installed on the wind turbine columns then wave energy can be absorbed by power take off pto system through the relative heave motions between wind turbine column and the wec the spar type floating wind turbines with long and short floaters are considered for deep and intermediate water depth conditions whereas a fixed type wind turbine is considered for the shallow water depth condition on the other hand the wecs are torus shaped heave type devices with dimensions and configurations the same for the three concepts numerical models are established for all the three concepts the combined systems are subjected to various wind and wave conditions the dynamic response analysis is carried out and the responses including motions forces and power are compared among them the results show that significantly different dynamic responses of the three concepts under environmental actions are observed keywords spar torus combination monopile torus combination wind turbine wave energy converter dynamic response power production 1 introduction clean and renewable energy is increasingly emphasized with the growing public attention to the environmental pollution problem among renewable energy resources both offshore wind and wave energy are resources with great potential offshore wind technology has rapidly developed in recent years with a trend towards larger scale wind turbines further offshore distance deeper water depth and larger wind farm sizes irena 2018 wave energy also represents an energy resource with great potential of around 2 tw and with a much higher power density than wind power cruz 2008 although the global weighted average levelized cost of energy lcoe for offshore wind power in 2018 0 127 usd kwh is 20 lower than in 2010 and is already in the top half of the fossil fuel cost range it is still much higher than that for onshore wind power 0 056 usd kwh the lcoe of tidal and wave energy sectors can vary from 0 265 usd kwh to 0 986 usd kwh which is still at a significantly high level rusu and onea 2018 aiming at reduction of lcoe and optimization of the utilization of ocean space and energy resources offshore wind turbine and wave energy converter wec can be integrated together there are several advantages for the integrated concepts produced power can be increased infrastructures such as floaters mooring system and power cables can be shared so the infrastructure cost can be reduced especially in the wind and wave farm scale besides synergy on dynamic responses and performance of the devices can be achieved muliawan et al 2013 therefore the lcoe may be further reduced for wind power and significantly reduced for wave power however there may also be some challenges introduced in the integrated concepts the installation operation and maintenance cost may be increased the interface between wec and floaters should be carefully designed the survival strategies should be investigated and verified several combined wind and wave energy converter concepts have been proposed through the european commission fp7 marine renewable integrated application platform project marina website 2015 spar torus combination stc concept the semi submersible flap concept sfc and the oscillating water column owc array with a wind turbine installed the stc concept is a combination of 5 mw spar floating wind turbine and the torus shaped heave type wec moored through 3 catenary mooring system muliawan et al 2012 model tests on stc with the focus on functionality and survivability are carried out and good agreement with numerical model is achieved if there are no violent motions wan et al 2015 2016a under extreme conditions water exit and entry of stc was found in the model test and in this case strongly nonlinear numerical code was applied to achieve a reasonable comparison wan et al 2017 the model tests regarding survivability of stc were performed in two testing facilities and the results were cross verified and compared wan et al 2016b the sfc luan et al 2014 michailides et al 2014 incorporates a 5 mw semi submersible floating wind turbine with three flap type wecs that are installed on the three pontoons of the floater functionality and survivability model tests of the sfc with a 1 50 scale ratio have been performed in the ocean basin at ecole centrale de nantes ecn france michiailides et al 2016a 2016b the owc array platform has been proposed by the hydraulics and maritime research center in university college cork hmrc ucc the owc arrays include 20 owc chambers with 10 owcs installed in each arm facing the main wave direction and a wind turbine is installed on top of the structure besides the concepts under marina platform project several other integrated concepts of wind and wave energy converters were also proposed poseidon yde et al 2014 is an integrated concept based on a semi submerged structure that works both as the platform for wind turbines and multi absorber wave energy conversion and the platform is positioned by a turret mooring system two concepts were proposed by incorporating two owc chambers or one point absorber into the windfloat concept peiffer et al 2011 aubault et al 2011 the wavestar concept which is a fixed wec concept can be extended to a combined concept by adding a wind turbine on it marquis et al 2012 in addition the combined concept of monopile and tension leg platform tlp wind turbine with heave type wec were also investigated numerically and experimentally ren et al 2018a 2018b in addition there have also other combined concepts being proposed and investigated which cannot be fully listed here most of the proposed floating integrated concepts are applicable in deep water for intermediate water depth redesign of the concept floaters is necessary for shallow water conditions fixed integrated concepts with jacket monopile or gravity based foundation types are more applicable such as the combined concept of owc and monopile or jacket structure perez collazo et al 2018 for which the performance and dynamic aspects of the owc was comprehensively investigated most of the concepts mentioned here belong to the hybrid systems which are a family of multipurpose platforms besides there are also co located system and island system perez collazo et al 2015 there have been various types of integrated concepts proposed analyzed and tested through which numerical models are validated feasibility of the concepts is studied and performance is investigated however aiming at a better integrated concept for deployment comprehensive studies and comparisons among different concepts based on the same environmental conditions are necessary to evaluate the performance and further the cost level these evaluations and comparisons are seldomly seen before therefore in this work integrated concepts with column type wind turbine with heave type wec are studied in a comprehensive way different water depth affects the dynamic performance of the concept in this case three different water depths are studied aiming at evaluating the feasibility of the integration concepts applied in different water depths assessing and comparing performance of the concepts in this study the 5 mw nrel wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 is installed on the floaters of deep long spar and short spar for deployment in the deep and intermediate water depth respectively fixed monopile foundation is selected for shallow water condition the torus heave type wecs are used for all the three integrated concepts it is important to note hereby that the deep intermediate and shallow water depths are based on the water depths of deployment of the three concepts rather than referring to the shallowness and validity for various wave theories of a single regular wave or sea state linear wave theory is applied in this study 2 model description the long spar torus combination lstc are based on the stc developed in the marina project wan et al 2016a it is a long spar floater supporting a 5 mw wind turbine deployed at a water depth of 320 m it has a diameter of 6 5 m at the still water level swl position then the diameter is tapered to 9 4 m underwater a torus wec with 20 m outer and 8 m inner diameters is installed on the spar cylinder at the swl position catenary delta shape mooring system is installed the center of gravity cog is at about 90 m under swl the short spar torus combination sstc are developed supporting the 5 mw wind turbine based on the reduced water depth of 150 m wen et al 2018 it has a draft of 80 m at the swl position the spar diameter is also 6 5 m but it is tapered gradually to 12 m under water to make sure the total buoyancy forces are similar the cog is around 60 m below water the same wec with lstc is also installed for sstc at the same swl position the monopile torus combination mtc is deployed in the water depth of 20 m supporting the same wind turbine it has the uniform diameter of 6 5 m for the cylinder the cylinder bottom is assumed to be fixed to the sea floor therefore there is no mooring system designed the same wec is installed at the same swl position in fig 1 the configurations of lstc sstc and mtc are plotted on the left and the right plot shows the delta mooring system configurations and dimensions applied in the floating stc the catenary mooring system is used in the lstc and sstc at the fairlead portion a delta shape is formed in the mooring system the delta mooring system can provide additional restoring stiffness and damping to the yaw motion to alleviate the gyro effects of the floating wind turbine between the delta connection point and the anchor point of the catenary mooring line there is a clump mass of 17 253 kg the length of the delta line upper line above clump mass and the lower line below the clump mass are also shown in fig 1 where the values in parenthesis is the length values for lstc and the values outside parenthesis is for sstc the three concepts are applied to different water depth which are 320 m 150 m and 20 m respectively accordingly for lstc and sstc the spar floater and mooring system configurations are different due to the different water depths whereas the mtc is a fixed concept where the connection onto the seabed is assumed to be rigid in fig 2 the connection of the wec to the cylindrical column is described rollers and a mechanical system are designed to allow the relative heave motions and to restrict the relative horizontal motions between the wec and cylindrical column in addition an end stop system is used to limit excessive relative heave motion in harsh environments a hydraulic pto system is installed in the cylindrical column in order to convert the motion of the wec through a hydraulic circuit into energy stored in a high pressure hp accumulator and low pressure lp reservoir this enables the smoothing out of the absorbed time varying power in irregular waves and thus enhance the performance of the integrated devices following this a hydraulic motor is used to drive an electrical generator it is noted that the wec and the connection system are the same for all the three concepts table 1 shows the dimensions and mass properties for the long spar in lstc short spar in sstc and the monopile for mtc as well as the torus wec the height of the spar and monopile is 10 m longer than the draft due to the transition piece connection the wind turbine tower the upper diameter is the part connecting the wec 3 methodology hybrid time and frequency domain models naess and moan 2013 are used in this work considering nonlinear effects in the simulation of combined wind and wave devices wan et al 2015 this model establishes the aero hydro servo elastic integrated global dynamic model considering two body system the hydrodynamic properties of the foundation and the wec are calculated in frequency domain then the frequency domain properties of the two bodies are transferred to time domain through retardation function cummins 1962 in time domain the aerodynamic loads viscous drag forces pto forces nonlinear restoring forces from mooring system etc are calculated in each time step and applied in the global dynamic model in the hydrodynamic analysis the combined concepts incorporate two rigid bodies i e wind turbine floater and wec therefore the motion equation of the two rigid bodies has 12 d o f s the wind turbine tower and rotor blades are modelled using finite element model fem which is not considered in the hydrodynamic part the motion equation for the three concepts can be generally written as 1 m a 11 a 12 a 21 m a 11 x 1 t x 2 t c 11 0 0 c 22 x 1 t x 1 t x 2 t x 2 t 0 t k 11 t τ k 12 t τ k 21 t τ k 22 t τ x 1 t x 2 t d τ r 11 0 0 r 22 x 1 t x 2 t f 1 t f 2 t in which the subscript 1 or 11 signifies the variables of body 1 wind turbine floater or foundation subscript 2 or 22 signifies the variables of body 2 torus wec subscript 12 or 21 signifies the coupling terms between the foundation and the torus x x and x are the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors in time domain respectively it is noted that for mtc the monopile is fixed and is assumed to be rigid in this study in this case the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors for monopile are zero m is the structural mass a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency c is the quadratic coefficient for the viscous forces of the two bodies in heave directions r is the restoring coefficients the heave viscous forces and restoring forces for the two bodies are uncoupled so the inverse diagonal terms of restoring and heave viscous matrices are zero k τ is the retardation function matrix due to the wave memory effects cummins 1962 which is expressed as in equation 2 it tends to vanish with time and when there is no forward speed of the floating body b is zero 2 k t 2 π 0 b ω b cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 ω a ω a sin ω t d ω f t on the right hand side of the equation is the summation of hydrodynamic excitation forces 1st and 2nd order and other forces including aerodynamic loads viscous drag forces applied on morison elements pto forces and contact interface forces f 1 t and f 2 t represent the external force vectors applied on body 1 and body 2 respectively and can be expressed as 3 f 1 t f 2 t f w i n d t 0 f 1 1 t f 2 1 t f 1 2 t f 2 2 t f 1 d r a g t f 2 d r a g t f 1 interface t f 2 interface t f 1 p t o t f 2 p t o t the terms in equation 3 are explained in the following f w i n d t is the aerodynamic loads f 1 1 t and f 1 2 t are the 1st and 2nd order wave forces applied on the wind turbine foundation while f 2 1 t and f 2 2 t are the 1st and 2nd order wave forces applied on the wec respectively morison elements are used to model the foundation cylinders and the wec cylinder and f 1 d r a g t and f 2 d r a g t are the total morison drag forces applied on the two bodies respectively contact interface forces between the two bodies can be expressed as f 1 i n t e r f a c e t r x 1 t x 2 t c x 1 t x 2 t where r and c are the stiffness and damping coefficients matrix of the mechanical interface roller and mechanical interface and f 1 i n t e r f a c e t f 2 i n t e r f a c e t pto forces f p t o t are calculated by pto damping coefficient d multiplied by the relative heave velocities between the two floaters i e f p t o t d x 1 h e a v e t x 2 h e a v e t and f 1 p t o t f 2 p t o t d can be tuned to get a better wave power performance and motion performance wan et al 2016a the produced wave power p w a v e t can then be calculated by the multiplication of pto forces and relative heave velocity between body 1 and body 2 it is expressed as 4 p w a v e t f p t o t x 1 h e a v e t x 2 h e a v e t the wind turbine tower and rotor blades are modelled by beam elements in the fem aerodynamic forces are calculated using blade element momentum bem theory hansen 2008 control systems for blade pitch and electrical torque for power extraction are also applied in the wind turbine calculations through dynamic link library ormberg and bachynski 2012 finite element formulations are used to calculate the slender elements in the model the finite elements are then integrated onto the rigid bodies i e the floating or fixed foundations and the wec the mooring lines in the delta mooring system are modelled using bar elements the anchoring positions provide boundary conditions to the whole dynamic system a fully coupled tool called simo riflex aerodyn was used in the time domain analysis simo marintek 2009 is a code developed by sintef ocean to simulate marine operations involving various bodies in time domain riflex marintek 2013 is a code also developed by sintef ocean for analysis of slender marine structures it is a nonlinear time domain program with a finite element formulation that can handle large displacement and rotations it is also capable to carry out coupled analysis for floating structures integrated with dynamic slender systems flexible elements including the mooring lines tower shaft and blades are implemented in riflex the link to an external controller is also implemented aerodyn moriarty and hansen 2005 is developed for the calculation of aerodynamic forces on horizontal axis wind turbine it contains two wake models bem theory and generalized dynamic wake gdw theory the wind field is generated through turbsim jonkman 2009 based on the specified wind parameters in the simulation the aerodynamic forces are calculated in each time step and applied on the global integrated model to calculate dynamic motion and structural responses then the motion and deflections will provide updated information to aerodyn to further update the aerodynamic forces 3 1 numerical validation by model test based on the current numerical model model tests for stc and mtc were carried out previously in different testing facilities and good agreement has been achieved wan et al 2015 2016a 2016b ren et al 2018a besides the validation of the stc and mtc concepts sfc was also investigated numerically and experimentally michailides et al 2016 and simo rilfex was used as the numerical model and reasonably good agreement was achieved for the stc concepts model tests were carried out in italian national towing tank insean rome and sintef ocean norway under operational and survival conditions respectively for operational conditions good agreements are achieved for a large range of pto damping level under large pto damping due to air compressibility there was little discrepancy between model test and numerical model an introduction of air stiffness term has then improved the prediction for survivability conditions there have been several survival modes proposed for stc i e released mode mean water level mwl mode and submerged sub mode released mode will induce extremely large end stop forces so is not considered as a feasible solution mwl and sub modes are considered for further study however for mwl mode there was water entry and exit of the wec observed and in this case the weekly nonlinear hydrodynamic model is not possible to predict the correct responses a strongly nonlinear hydrodynamic model was used and the comparison is significantly improved wan et al 2017 for mtc the model test was performed in state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe china maximum hs of 6 m was set as the higher limit of the test to avoid too much pto forces and slamming due to water exit and entry of the wec under this limit it was proved that the numerical model predicts the model test results quite well in addition the combined concept of tension leg platform tlp and torus wec was also investigated numerically and experimentally ren et al 2018b a bit higher wave power is produced by mtc compared with the tlp concept regarding the wind turbine test there have always been reynold s number distortion if the froude scaling was used in the offshore wave basin test modifications of the airfoils and chord length can help in improving the turbine performance but the aerodynamic thrust and torque could still not be properly modelled fowler et al 2013 real time hybrid testing sauder et al 2016 was carried out to apply real time simulated aerodynamic loads on the testing model based on the testing model dynamic responses aerodyn is widely used in the wind turbine simulation and also validated through experimental data laino et al 2002 3 2 numerical investigation scenarios although model tests have been carried out for several integrated concepts to validate numerical models comprehensive and systematic studies and comparisons are needed to evaluate the performance of various integrated concepts lstc sstc and mtc under the same environmental conditions and under various water depths between floating foundation and fixed foundation one is to expect the performance to vary significantly also the dynamic performance may also vary for different floater configurations deployed in the deep and intermediate water depth condition the lstc sstc and mtc are the typical concepts for the deep intermediate and shallow water depth the comparisons provide design considerations on the performance in terms of motion structural and power responses firstly decay test and eigen value analysis are carried out for the system identification regular wave simulation is then performed shallow and intermediate water depths are the cases studied so the dispersion relationship and calculation formula of wave length λ for finite water depth are used and are expressed as follows respectively 5 ω 2 g k tanh k h 6 λ g 2 π t 2 tanh 2 π λ h where k is the wave number defined as k 2 π λ h is water depth t is wave period and ω is wave frequency wave lengths λ and amplitudes ζ change with respect to the changes in the water depth but the free surface conditions remain linear to ensure the same linearity a uniform wave steepness number k ζ 0 1 is used the regular wave simulation matrix is listed in table 2 for the different combination of λ and ζ under varying wave period and water depth conditions for example the wave length in shallow water decreased under the same wave period as compared to that of the deep water and therefore the wave amplitudes in the former condition decrease accordingly to ensure the same linearity an operational sea state matrix for the combined concepts are then defined in table 3 with hs ranges from 2 m to 8 m and tp varies from 4 to 14 ss the selected sea states marked as y are considered in the simulation to ensure mild wave steepness the jonswap spectrum hasselmannet al 1973 is used to describe the sea state with steepness parameter of 0 3 the linear hydrodynamic model is considered applicable for the selected sea states based on the previous lstc model test and numerical validation wan et al 2016a finite water depth dispersion relationship is also applied in the irregular wave modelling in case of large sea states limited nonlinearities such as higher order waves or wave breaking may occur in real circumstances however these are not the scope in this study and the wave forces are still considered in the linear region table 4 presents the combination of wind and wave conditions based on five sea state or load cases lc uw m s is the mean wind speed at the nacelle position the mean wind speed varies from the cut in speed of 5 m s to the cut out speed of 25 m s the wind speed reference position is taken at the hub of the wind turbine the sea state is increased from lc1 to lc5 the wind speed is also increased accordingly from 5 m s to 25 m s covering a large range from cut in to cut out speed lc2 corresponds to the wind speed close to the rated speed of the wind turbine the wind field is generated through turbsim at 170 m 170 m vertical area with the center at the hub and with a time step of 0 05s the wind has the power law profile on the rotor disk and logarithmic profile elsewhere the turbulent wind field is described by iec kaimal model with normal turbulence jonkman and kilcher 2012 for class c from iec standard commission 2005 pto force will influence the relative heave velocity and the absorbed wave power zero pto damping values indicate no wave power is absorbed and relative heave velocity will not be affected if the pto damping values are too large the relative velocity will be too small which means small wave energy is absorbed it is important to know an optimum pto damping value for maximum wave power output the optimal value of the pto damping is varied for different wave periods and various concepts wan et al 2014 therefore parametric study on pto damping using four values i e 0 200 2000 and 20 000 kn m are carried out with the aim to identify appropriate and optimum values and to assess their effects on the wec motion and power performance the following parts show the numerical results and discussion 4 numerical results and analysis 4 1 decay test and eigen values decay test is carried out to identify the system natural periods in the decay test horizontal coupling between spar and torus can be taken as rigid while vertical coupling is transferred through the pto system pto damping can change heave natural periods of spar and torus significantly over damped system and the pto damping has the trend to make spar and torus having uniform heave resonant period wan et al 2016a in this decay study only zero pto damping is considered and the heave resonant periods of spar and torus can be identified separately pto damping effect on the heave natural periods can then be observed through the regular wave analysis table 6 shows the natural periods of the systems obtained from the decay test it is to note that only the torus heave natural period can be identified for the mtc also it can be observed that the surge sway natural periods for the lstc and sstc are different i e 180 s and 123 s respectively due to the different horizontal restoring stiffness in the mooring system for the two different water depth conditions the heave natural period of the spar is 33 s and is identical for lstc and sstc because of the same water plane areas for both devices the heave natural period for the wec is 4 7 s and is also identical for all the three concepts it is noted in table 6 that the pitch roll and yaw natural periods are slightly different for the lstc and sstc the tower turbine shaft and blades are modelled by using the finite elements methods where the eigen analysis is carried out to obtain the first two eigenvalues for the tower as listed in table 6 the two eigen modes are the tower side side and fore aft modes it is seen that the first two eigen values are around 3 and 4 ss 4 2 dynamic response analysis in this session the performance of sstc lstc and mtc are investigated through the dynamic response analysis under various conditions including regular wave conditions irregular wave conditions as well as the combined wind and wave conditions the performance under regular wave conditions provide an overview of the response properties of the concepts the response amplitude operators raos of surge and pitch motions spar heave and relative heave motions as well as the tower base bending moments and shear forces are presented from figs 3 5 to show the response property differences among the three concepts as well as the pto damping effects the mean wave power output under regular waves are shown in fig 6 to investigate the differences induced by pto damping levels and different concepts irregular wave analysis provides the performance of the concepts under real sea states which cover a wide range of the operational conditions surge relative heave motions and mean wave power are investigated parameters to show the motion and power output properties for the three concepts under various sea states with a fixed pto damping of 2000 kn m the results are shown from figs 7 9 furthermore wind cases are included and wind effects are studied the combined wind and wave conditions shows realistic system performance under operational modes therefore investigations on surge and pitch motions wave power output and wind power output tower base bending moments and shear forces as well as mooring line tensions and mtc monopile base shear forces reflect the important properties and show performance of the concepts in a systematic way the results are presented from figs 10 13 under various pre defined load cases in addition spectral analysis is carried out to identify the frequency contributions in the responses from various sources and results are shown from figs 14 16 4 2 1 performance under regular wave conditions regular wave simulations are carried out based on the same wave steepness as summarized in table 2 fig 3 shows the surge and pitch raos for the sstc and lstc the spar and torus heave raos as well as the relative heave raos for the three concepts are shown in fig 4 all the simulations are subjected to pto damping of 0 and 2000 kn m the pto damping has little even no effect on surge and pitch motions in addition the lstc and sstc are found to have insignificant difference in the surge and pitch motion pto damping has strong effects on the spar heave and relative heave motions spar heave in lstc is found to be more sensitive to pto damping than sstc which may due to smaller mass and added mass the most significant differences in the relative heave rao are due to varied pto damping rather than due to various concepts among lstc sstc and mtc the relative heave rao for mtc is larger when subjected to large wave period say larger than 10 s because monopile is fixed and the wec tends to follow the wave under long wave length while for the two floating concepts lstc and sstc both spars and wecs tend to follow the waves inducing smaller relative heave it is worth mentioning that when pto damping is zero the heave resonant periods for wecs and spars are separated with no intervention as indicated in table 5 while when pto damping of sufficiently large value is applied wecs and spars tend to have similar resonant period to have higher wave power large relative heave motions are expected in such cases the concepts will have large motions for both spars and wecs under operational conditions and thus producing more power at the resonant period however significantly large motions will occur under extreme environmental conditions inducing water entry and exit of wecs this will impose challenges to the survivability of the integrated concepts due to the wave impact and water on deck of the wecs therefore the survivability strategies are crucial for the integrated concepts and need investigations this will also increase the cost of the integrated concepts fig 5 shows the tower base bending moment and shear force raos for the three concepts it is expected that the pto damping has no effects hence only the zero pto damping is considered it can be seen from the figure that the tower base bending moment and shear force raos are similar and follow the same trend on the other hand the bending moment and shear force roas for the mtc are significantly different this is because the inertia effect due to the surge motion is very weak on the fixed monopile tower in mtc that is being refrained from moving horizontally fig 6 shows the mean wave power responses under regular wave condition and the same vertical axis scale is set for better comparisons the mean power under regular waves are divided by the square of the wave amplitude for pto of 200 kn m the three concepts have similar performance and the peak values for the three concepts of the wave power are close to the torus heave resonant period i e around 6s when the pto damping is increased to 2000 kn m the power curves are still similar for lstc sstc and mtc which all have peak values around 9s however when the pto damping is 20 000 kn m the power curve is suppressed for mtc whereas lstc and sstc shows similar trends that the curves have peak at around 12s and the power for wave periods smaller than 10s is smaller than that with pto damping of 2000 kn m with the increasing of pto damping the power peaks for different pto gradually increase until 12 s and then decrease for lstc and sstc whose heave resonance occurs in this region it can be concluded that lstc and sstc can be applied by larger pto damping which induces larger wave power compared with mtc 4 2 2 performance under irregular wave conditions the performance of the combined concepts under real sea states is investigated in this section simulations with 3 h steady state responses are carried out then three sea state realizations for each 3 h simulation are performed to reduce the stochastic uncertainties average of the statistical values for the three realizations are used in the analysis i e average values of standard deviation std maximum and minimum from the three realizations are used pto damping of 2000 kn m is applied in the simulations the mean values and std of surge motions for lstc and sstc are shown in fig 7 the surge motion is getting larger under larger hs but are getting smaller with increasing tp generally sstc has smaller values for mean and std of surge motions figs 8 and 9 shows the relative heave motion and the mean wave power under hs 2 m hs 4 m and hs 6 m respectively the same vertical axis scale is set for better comparisons it shows that the relative heaves increase with increasing tp and hs but the relative heave for lstc and sstc are always larger than that of mtc the same trend can be found for the mean wave power especially under large hs the wave power for lstc and sstc can be much larger 4 2 3 performance under combined wind and wave conditions for combined wind and wave conditions the same system parameters are used as in the wave only cases the simulation matrix is listed in table 4 the mean std and maximum values of surge and pitch motions of the lstc and sstc are shown in fig 10 compared with the mean surge motions under wave only conditions the mean surge motions under wind and wave have much larger values which implies that the wind induces the large portion of the surge mean responses the lstc always has larger surge motions but smaller pitch motions compared with sstc under the same load case it is also obvious that the largest surge and pitch motions occur for lc2 because it corresponds to the rated wind speed and thus the largest rotor thrust the produced wave power and wind power for different load cases are shown in fig 11 the mean wave power for lstc and sstc are similar and both are much larger than mtc under lc4 and lc5 which represent severe sea states the std of the wave power for lstc and sstc are also much larger than that of mtc contrary to the wave power the produced wind power is quite consistent for all the three concepts it increases to 5 mw from lc1 to lc2 until lc5 which have the wind speeds above rated value generally the existence of the wec in lstc and sstc can boost the total power by above 10 for lc4 and lc5 while the boost of power is slightly lower for mtc the tower base bending moment mean and std values for different load cases with and without wind loads nw are shown in fig 12 it shows the effect of aerodynamic loads on the tower base bending moment the bending moment mean values under wind actions follow the rotor thrust curve of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine and are largest at lc2 which has the wind speed close to rated value by comparison of wind and no wind cases the mean values of the tower bending moment are mainly induced by the aerodynamic loads both for lstc and sstc and for mtc the std of the tower base bending moment is contributed by both wind and wave effects these provide insights into the ultimate strength or fatigue issues of the tower the mooring line tensions for lstc and sstc and the monopile base shear force for mtc are shown in fig 13 mooring line tension is influenced by both wind and wave and the wind effect is dominant in addition the mooring line 1 is on the leeward side of wind and wave therefore the tension of mooring line 1 is decreased from lc1 to lc2 and then has the increasing trend from lc2 to lc5 which is inverse to the rotor thrust the mooring line tension is not varied so significantly as other parameters like tower base bending moment this could be due to that the mooring line tension is induced by both surge and pitch motions while the surge and pitch have somehow opposite effect on the line tension because the c o g for spar is quite low and close to the fairlead positions in the plot of the monopile base shear force cases with and without wind are presented the std of the monopile base shear forces with and without wind effects has no significant differences which indicates that the std of the base shear is mainly due to the wave effect the mean values of the base shear are contributed by both wind and wave effects the mooring line mean forces are different between lstc and sstc for lc5 spectral analysis is carried out to sort out the frequency components of the responses surge and pitch spectra of sstc and lstc are presented in fig 14 besides the wave frequency response of around 0 6 rad s there are prominent surge resonance due to slow drift and pitch resonant motions again it is seen that lstc has larger surge motion while smaller pitch motions compared with sstc in the spectra for relative heave shown in fig 15 the responses are mainly wave frequency responses for all the three concepts in the tower base bending moment spectra shown in fig 16 there are several frequency components it is noted that the monopile base bending moment is also plotted together with the tower base bending moment for the mtc the tower base bending moment response frequency is the rotor frequency with the rated value of 72 62 deg s 1 23 rad s in the simulation while the monopile base bending moment also has strong wave frequency component for sstc and lstc the tower base bending moment has peaks of wave frequency pitch resonant frequency and rotor frequency responses the main difference between stc and mtc is that mtc don t have pitch resonant frequency response the mooring line tension spectra for lstc and sstc shown in fig 16 mainly have wave frequency and wave difference frequency responses 4 3 survival strategies under extreme environmental conditions water exit and entry of the wecs are inevitable when green water on deck and strong slamming or impact on the wec will occur in addition wecs are designed to have relatively large motion under wave actions so too much motions and forces may be induced to the concepts and challenge the integrity of the structure therefore survival modes need to be proposed and are critical for the concepts integrity several survival strategies for the concepts are discussed here released mode locked mode and two submerged modes wan et al 2015 released mode means releasing the pto under extreme environmental conditions this mode is not a feasible solution since there will be extremely large motions of the wec and large forces in the end stop system locked mode means locking the wec on the cylinder through the mechanical system this mode will introduce large interface forces between wec and cylinder the submerged modes are potentially possible strategies the wec can be locked on the cylinder then the whole system for the floating concepts is submerged by additional ballast until a specific draft that the wec is fully submerged the other alternative is to submerge the wec only through ballast until it is fully submerged the latter strategy can be used for both floating concepts lstc and sstc and fixed concepts mtc in the submerged modes the wave forces can be effectively reduced by a significant amount under survival mode the wind turbine can be parked with the blades feathered into the wind to reduce the wind loads which is proved to be feasible 4 4 uncertainty analysis to address the stochastic uncertainty in the simulations different numbers of wave realizations are carried out the results used in this paper is under three times of realizations for the case hs 4 m tp 8s 20 realizations are carried out the average values of the different realizations are used in the comparison study to address the stochastic uncertainty take the case of 20 realizations as a basis 10 5 and the 3 realizations are compared with the basis respectively and the relative differences are shown in table 7 in this table max and std values of relative heave for lstc and of monopile bending moment for mtc are presented it is shown that by reducing the realization numbers the max value differences are slightly higher than the std value difference the largest relative difference lies in the max of monopile bending moment for mtc which is around 7 difference for the 3 realizations however the std value differences are limited or even negligible with the maximum difference of 1 1 this analysis shows stochastic uncertainties due to different realizations the other type of uncertainties is due to the shallow water waves that partly may not be properly modelled by linear wave in the simulation small steepness parameters have been applied to reduce this effect sea states selected are also mild in the regular wave analysis the purpose is to get the response properties based on the linear assumption so the nonlinearities in real environmental conditions is not a concern irregular wave in real environment may has higher order effects or even breaking waves but these nonlinearities are limited based on the previous model test and numerical validation wan et al 2016a strongly nonlinear phenomena are not considered as the scope of this work 5 conclusions and discussions in this work the numerical analysis has been carried out on the three combined concepts applied at three different water depths lstc is deployed for the large water depth of 320 m sstc is deployed for intermediate water depth of 150 m while mtc is designed for shallow water of 20 m the spar in sstc was modified for optimal operation in the intermediate water depth condition a comparison between the floating and fixed integrated wave and wind energy concepts under different water depths conditions was also successfully investigated as indicated in the paper model tests have been carried out previously to verify the concepts and validate the numerical models in this case it is confident to perform the comprehensive study on the three concepts based on the current numerical methods various scenarios have been set up for the numerical investigations decay and eigen value analysis were carried out to identify the system parameters regular wave analysis was used to get the raos of different response parameters including motion forces and power different sea states were chosen to study the real performance of the three concepts combined wind and wave conditions were introduced to investigate the aerodynamic effects from the simulation results one can get several conclusions for the guidance on future design there are different natural periods for the lstc and sstc due to different configurations and mooring system inducing different raos and wave power performance lstc has relatively larger surge but smaller pitch compared with sstc lstc also has larger wave power output than sstc especially under large sea state and large pto damping level mtc is observed to have minimum wave power output among the three but mtc has the smallest tower base bending moment wind power output is generally the same for the three concepts when the wind speed is larger than rated value wind contributes mainly to the mean values of the horizontal motions and tower base bending moment the std values of the horizontal motions and tower base bending moments are contributed both by wind and wave in general the combination with wec can boost the total maximum output power by above 10 from spectral analysis the surge and pitch motions are mostly induced by the slow drift motions or resonance heave motions are mainly the wave frequency response tower base bending moment shows complicated contributions by various frequencies for floating concepts the contributions from pitch resonance wave frequency and rotor frequency are significant while for mtc rotor frequency contributes most of the tower base bending moment the uncertainty analysis shows that the three realizations in the current simulation can provide relatively accurate results with limited stochastic uncertainties it is noted that for mtc the soil structure interaction effects have not been considered further study on these effects will provide more insights into the mtc performance the three concepts developed for different water depth show different properties these investigations provide insights into dynamic responses of the three concepts the response properties

21405,to achieve a better utilization of ocean space and energy three integrated concepts of column type wind turbine and heave type wave energy converter wec have been proposed for deep intermediate and shallow water depth conditions respectively the wecs are installed on the wind turbine columns then wave energy can be absorbed by power take off pto system through the relative heave motions between wind turbine column and the wec the spar type floating wind turbines with long and short floaters are considered for deep and intermediate water depth conditions whereas a fixed type wind turbine is considered for the shallow water depth condition on the other hand the wecs are torus shaped heave type devices with dimensions and configurations the same for the three concepts numerical models are established for all the three concepts the combined systems are subjected to various wind and wave conditions the dynamic response analysis is carried out and the responses including motions forces and power are compared among them the results show that significantly different dynamic responses of the three concepts under environmental actions are observed keywords spar torus combination monopile torus combination wind turbine wave energy converter dynamic response power production 1 introduction clean and renewable energy is increasingly emphasized with the growing public attention to the environmental pollution problem among renewable energy resources both offshore wind and wave energy are resources with great potential offshore wind technology has rapidly developed in recent years with a trend towards larger scale wind turbines further offshore distance deeper water depth and larger wind farm sizes irena 2018 wave energy also represents an energy resource with great potential of around 2 tw and with a much higher power density than wind power cruz 2008 although the global weighted average levelized cost of energy lcoe for offshore wind power in 2018 0 127 usd kwh is 20 lower than in 2010 and is already in the top half of the fossil fuel cost range it is still much higher than that for onshore wind power 0 056 usd kwh the lcoe of tidal and wave energy sectors can vary from 0 265 usd kwh to 0 986 usd kwh which is still at a significantly high level rusu and onea 2018 aiming at reduction of lcoe and optimization of the utilization of ocean space and energy resources offshore wind turbine and wave energy converter wec can be integrated together there are several advantages for the integrated concepts produced power can be increased infrastructures such as floaters mooring system and power cables can be shared so the infrastructure cost can be reduced especially in the wind and wave farm scale besides synergy on dynamic responses and performance of the devices can be achieved muliawan et al 2013 therefore the lcoe may be further reduced for wind power and significantly reduced for wave power however there may also be some challenges introduced in the integrated concepts the installation operation and maintenance cost may be increased the interface between wec and floaters should be carefully designed the survival strategies should be investigated and verified several combined wind and wave energy converter concepts have been proposed through the european commission fp7 marine renewable integrated application platform project marina website 2015 spar torus combination stc concept the semi submersible flap concept sfc and the oscillating water column owc array with a wind turbine installed the stc concept is a combination of 5 mw spar floating wind turbine and the torus shaped heave type wec moored through 3 catenary mooring system muliawan et al 2012 model tests on stc with the focus on functionality and survivability are carried out and good agreement with numerical model is achieved if there are no violent motions wan et al 2015 2016a under extreme conditions water exit and entry of stc was found in the model test and in this case strongly nonlinear numerical code was applied to achieve a reasonable comparison wan et al 2017 the model tests regarding survivability of stc were performed in two testing facilities and the results were cross verified and compared wan et al 2016b the sfc luan et al 2014 michailides et al 2014 incorporates a 5 mw semi submersible floating wind turbine with three flap type wecs that are installed on the three pontoons of the floater functionality and survivability model tests of the sfc with a 1 50 scale ratio have been performed in the ocean basin at ecole centrale de nantes ecn france michiailides et al 2016a 2016b the owc array platform has been proposed by the hydraulics and maritime research center in university college cork hmrc ucc the owc arrays include 20 owc chambers with 10 owcs installed in each arm facing the main wave direction and a wind turbine is installed on top of the structure besides the concepts under marina platform project several other integrated concepts of wind and wave energy converters were also proposed poseidon yde et al 2014 is an integrated concept based on a semi submerged structure that works both as the platform for wind turbines and multi absorber wave energy conversion and the platform is positioned by a turret mooring system two concepts were proposed by incorporating two owc chambers or one point absorber into the windfloat concept peiffer et al 2011 aubault et al 2011 the wavestar concept which is a fixed wec concept can be extended to a combined concept by adding a wind turbine on it marquis et al 2012 in addition the combined concept of monopile and tension leg platform tlp wind turbine with heave type wec were also investigated numerically and experimentally ren et al 2018a 2018b in addition there have also other combined concepts being proposed and investigated which cannot be fully listed here most of the proposed floating integrated concepts are applicable in deep water for intermediate water depth redesign of the concept floaters is necessary for shallow water conditions fixed integrated concepts with jacket monopile or gravity based foundation types are more applicable such as the combined concept of owc and monopile or jacket structure perez collazo et al 2018 for which the performance and dynamic aspects of the owc was comprehensively investigated most of the concepts mentioned here belong to the hybrid systems which are a family of multipurpose platforms besides there are also co located system and island system perez collazo et al 2015 there have been various types of integrated concepts proposed analyzed and tested through which numerical models are validated feasibility of the concepts is studied and performance is investigated however aiming at a better integrated concept for deployment comprehensive studies and comparisons among different concepts based on the same environmental conditions are necessary to evaluate the performance and further the cost level these evaluations and comparisons are seldomly seen before therefore in this work integrated concepts with column type wind turbine with heave type wec are studied in a comprehensive way different water depth affects the dynamic performance of the concept in this case three different water depths are studied aiming at evaluating the feasibility of the integration concepts applied in different water depths assessing and comparing performance of the concepts in this study the 5 mw nrel wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 is installed on the floaters of deep long spar and short spar for deployment in the deep and intermediate water depth respectively fixed monopile foundation is selected for shallow water condition the torus heave type wecs are used for all the three integrated concepts it is important to note hereby that the deep intermediate and shallow water depths are based on the water depths of deployment of the three concepts rather than referring to the shallowness and validity for various wave theories of a single regular wave or sea state linear wave theory is applied in this study 2 model description the long spar torus combination lstc are based on the stc developed in the marina project wan et al 2016a it is a long spar floater supporting a 5 mw wind turbine deployed at a water depth of 320 m it has a diameter of 6 5 m at the still water level swl position then the diameter is tapered to 9 4 m underwater a torus wec with 20 m outer and 8 m inner diameters is installed on the spar cylinder at the swl position catenary delta shape mooring system is installed the center of gravity cog is at about 90 m under swl the short spar torus combination sstc are developed supporting the 5 mw wind turbine based on the reduced water depth of 150 m wen et al 2018 it has a draft of 80 m at the swl position the spar diameter is also 6 5 m but it is tapered gradually to 12 m under water to make sure the total buoyancy forces are similar the cog is around 60 m below water the same wec with lstc is also installed for sstc at the same swl position the monopile torus combination mtc is deployed in the water depth of 20 m supporting the same wind turbine it has the uniform diameter of 6 5 m for the cylinder the cylinder bottom is assumed to be fixed to the sea floor therefore there is no mooring system designed the same wec is installed at the same swl position in fig 1 the configurations of lstc sstc and mtc are plotted on the left and the right plot shows the delta mooring system configurations and dimensions applied in the floating stc the catenary mooring system is used in the lstc and sstc at the fairlead portion a delta shape is formed in the mooring system the delta mooring system can provide additional restoring stiffness and damping to the yaw motion to alleviate the gyro effects of the floating wind turbine between the delta connection point and the anchor point of the catenary mooring line there is a clump mass of 17 253 kg the length of the delta line upper line above clump mass and the lower line below the clump mass are also shown in fig 1 where the values in parenthesis is the length values for lstc and the values outside parenthesis is for sstc the three concepts are applied to different water depth which are 320 m 150 m and 20 m respectively accordingly for lstc and sstc the spar floater and mooring system configurations are different due to the different water depths whereas the mtc is a fixed concept where the connection onto the seabed is assumed to be rigid in fig 2 the connection of the wec to the cylindrical column is described rollers and a mechanical system are designed to allow the relative heave motions and to restrict the relative horizontal motions between the wec and cylindrical column in addition an end stop system is used to limit excessive relative heave motion in harsh environments a hydraulic pto system is installed in the cylindrical column in order to convert the motion of the wec through a hydraulic circuit into energy stored in a high pressure hp accumulator and low pressure lp reservoir this enables the smoothing out of the absorbed time varying power in irregular waves and thus enhance the performance of the integrated devices following this a hydraulic motor is used to drive an electrical generator it is noted that the wec and the connection system are the same for all the three concepts table 1 shows the dimensions and mass properties for the long spar in lstc short spar in sstc and the monopile for mtc as well as the torus wec the height of the spar and monopile is 10 m longer than the draft due to the transition piece connection the wind turbine tower the upper diameter is the part connecting the wec 3 methodology hybrid time and frequency domain models naess and moan 2013 are used in this work considering nonlinear effects in the simulation of combined wind and wave devices wan et al 2015 this model establishes the aero hydro servo elastic integrated global dynamic model considering two body system the hydrodynamic properties of the foundation and the wec are calculated in frequency domain then the frequency domain properties of the two bodies are transferred to time domain through retardation function cummins 1962 in time domain the aerodynamic loads viscous drag forces pto forces nonlinear restoring forces from mooring system etc are calculated in each time step and applied in the global dynamic model in the hydrodynamic analysis the combined concepts incorporate two rigid bodies i e wind turbine floater and wec therefore the motion equation of the two rigid bodies has 12 d o f s the wind turbine tower and rotor blades are modelled using finite element model fem which is not considered in the hydrodynamic part the motion equation for the three concepts can be generally written as 1 m a 11 a 12 a 21 m a 11 x 1 t x 2 t c 11 0 0 c 22 x 1 t x 1 t x 2 t x 2 t 0 t k 11 t τ k 12 t τ k 21 t τ k 22 t τ x 1 t x 2 t d τ r 11 0 0 r 22 x 1 t x 2 t f 1 t f 2 t in which the subscript 1 or 11 signifies the variables of body 1 wind turbine floater or foundation subscript 2 or 22 signifies the variables of body 2 torus wec subscript 12 or 21 signifies the coupling terms between the foundation and the torus x x and x are the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors in time domain respectively it is noted that for mtc the monopile is fixed and is assumed to be rigid in this study in this case the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors for monopile are zero m is the structural mass a is the added mass matrix at infinite frequency c is the quadratic coefficient for the viscous forces of the two bodies in heave directions r is the restoring coefficients the heave viscous forces and restoring forces for the two bodies are uncoupled so the inverse diagonal terms of restoring and heave viscous matrices are zero k τ is the retardation function matrix due to the wave memory effects cummins 1962 which is expressed as in equation 2 it tends to vanish with time and when there is no forward speed of the floating body b is zero 2 k t 2 π 0 b ω b cos ω t d ω 2 π 0 ω a ω a sin ω t d ω f t on the right hand side of the equation is the summation of hydrodynamic excitation forces 1st and 2nd order and other forces including aerodynamic loads viscous drag forces applied on morison elements pto forces and contact interface forces f 1 t and f 2 t represent the external force vectors applied on body 1 and body 2 respectively and can be expressed as 3 f 1 t f 2 t

the aerodynamic loads f 1 1 t and f 1 2 t are the 1st and 2nd order wave forces applied on the wind turbine foundation while f 2 1 t and f 2 2 t are the 1st and 2nd order wave forces applied on the wec respectively morison elements are used to model the foundation cylinders and the wec cylinder and f 1 d r a g t and f 2 d r a g t are the total morison drag forces applied on the two bodies respectively contact interface forces between the two bodies can be expressed as f 1 i n t e r f a c e t r x 1 t x 2 t c x 1 t x 2 t where r and c are the stiffness and damping coefficients matrix of the mechanical interface roller and mechanical interface and f 1 i n t e r f a c e t f 2 i n t e r f a c e t pto forces f p t o t are calculated by pto damping coefficient d multiplied by the relative

et al 2016a the produced wave power p w a v e t can then be calculated by the multiplication of pto forces and relative heave velocity between body 1 and body 2 it is expressed as 4 p w a v e t f p t o t x 1 h e a v e t x 2 h e a v e t the wind turbine tower and rotor blades are modelled by beam elements in the fem aerodynamic forces are calculated using blade element momentum bem theory hansen 2008 control systems for blade pitch and electrical torque for power extraction are also applied in the wind turbine calculations through dynamic link library ormberg and bachynski 2012 finite element formulations are used to calculate the slender elements in the model the finite elements are then integrated onto the rigid bodies i e the floating or fixed foundations and the wec the mooring lines in the delta mooring system are modelled using bar elements the anchoring positions provide boundary conditions to the whole dynamic system a fully coupled tool called simo riflex aerodyn was used in the time domain analysis simo marintek 2009 is a code developed by sintef ocean to simulate marine operations involving various bodies in time domain riflex marintek 2013 is a code also developed by sintef ocean for analysis of slender marine structures it is a nonlinear time domain program with a finite element formulation that can handle large displacement and rotations it is also capable to carry out coupled analysis for floating structures integrated with dynamic slender systems flexible elements including the mooring lines tower shaft and blades are implemented in riflex the link to an external controller is also implemented aerodyn moriarty and hansen 2005 is developed for the calculation of aerodynamic forces on horizontal axis wind turbine it contains two wake models bem theory and generalized dynamic wake gdw theory the wind field is generated through turbsim jonkman 2009 based on the specified wind parameters in the simulation the aerodynamic forces are calculated in each time step and applied on the global integrated model to calculate dynamic motion and structural responses then the motion and deflections will provide updated information to aerodyn to further update the aerodynamic forces 3 1 numerical validation by model test based on the current numerical model model tests for stc and mtc were carried out previously in different testing facilities and good agreement has been achieved wan et al 2015 2016a 2016b ren et al 2018a besides the validation of the stc and mtc concepts sfc was also investigated numerically and experimentally michailides et al 2016 and simo rilfex was used as the numerical model and reasonably good agreement was achieved for the stc concepts model tests were carried out in italian national towing tank insean rome and sintef ocean norway under operational and survival conditions respectively for operational conditions good agreements are achieved for a large range of pto damping level under large pto damping due to air compressibility there was little discrepancy between model test and numerical model an introduction of air stiffness term has then improved the prediction for survivability conditions there have been several survival modes proposed for stc i e released mode mean water level mwl mode and submerged sub mode released mode will induce extremely large end stop forces so is not considered as a feasible solution mwl and sub modes are considered for further study however for mwl mode there was water entry and exit of the wec observed and in this case the weekly nonlinear hydrodynamic model is not possible to predict the correct responses a strongly nonlinear hydrodynamic model was used and the comparison is significantly improved wan et al 2017 for mtc the model test was performed in state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering slcoe china maximum hs of 6 m was set as the higher limit of the test to avoid too much pto forces and slamming due to water exit and entry of the wec under this limit it was proved that the numerical model predicts the model test results quite well in addition the combined concept of tension leg platform tlp and torus wec was also investigated numerically and experimentally ren et al 2018b a bit higher wave power is produced by mtc compared with the tlp concept regarding the wind turbine test there have always been reynold s number distortion if the froude scaling was used in the offshore wave basin test modifications of the airfoils and chord length can help in improving the turbine performance but the aerodynamic thrust and torque could still not be properly modelled fowler et al 2013 real time hybrid testing sauder et al 2016 was carried out to apply real time simulated aerodynamic loads on the testing model based on the testing model dynamic responses aerodyn is widely used in the wind turbine simulation and also validated through experimental data laino et al 2002 3 2 numerical investigation scenarios although model tests have been carried out for several integrated concepts to validate numerical models comprehensive and systematic studies and comparisons are needed to evaluate the performance of various integrated concepts lstc sstc and mtc under the same environmental conditions and under various water depths between floating foundation and fixed foundation one is to expect the performance to vary significantly also the dynamic performance may also vary for different floater configurations deployed in the deep and intermediate water depth condition the lstc sstc and mtc are the typical concepts for the deep intermediate and shallow water depth the comparisons provide design considerations on the performance in terms of motion structural and power responses firstly decay test and eigen value analysis are carried out for the system identification regular wave simulation is then performed shallow and intermediate water depths are the cases studied so the dispersion relationship and calculation formula of wave length λ for finite water depth are used and are expressed as follows respectively 5 ω 2 g k tanh k h 6 λ g 2 π t 2 tanh 2 π λ h where k is the wave number defined as k 2 π λ h is water depth t is wave period and ω is wave frequency wave lengths λ and amplitudes ζ change with respect to the changes in the water depth but the free surface conditions remain linear to ensure the same linearity a uniform wave steepness number k ζ 0 1 is used the regular wave simulation matrix is listed in table 2 for the different combination of λ and ζ under varying wave period and water depth conditions for example the wave length in shallow water decreased under the same wave period as compared to that of the deep water and therefore the wave amplitudes in the former condition decrease accordingly to ensure the same linearity an operational sea state matrix for the combined concepts are then defined in table 3 with hs ranges from 2 m to 8 m and tp varies from 4 to 14 ss the selected sea states marked as y are considered in the simulation to ensure mild wave steepness the jonswap spectrum hasselmannet al 1973 is used to describe the sea state with steepness parameter of 0 3 the linear hydrodynamic model is considered applicable for the selected sea states based on the previous lstc model test and numerical validation wan et al 2016a finite water depth dispersion relationship is also applied in the irregular wave modelling in case of large sea states limited nonlinearities such as higher order waves or wave breaking may occur in real circumstances however these are not the scope in this study and the wave forces are still considered in the linear region table 4 presents the combination of wind and wave conditions based on five sea state or load cases lc uw m s is the mean wind speed at the nacelle position the mean wind speed varies from the cut in speed of 5 m s to the cut out speed of 25 m s the wind speed reference position is taken at the hub of the wind turbine the sea state is increased from lc1 to lc5 the wind speed is also increased accordingly from 5 m s to 25 m s covering a large range from cut in to cut out speed lc2 corresponds to the wind speed close to the rated speed of the wind turbine the wind field is generated through turbsim at 170 m 170 m vertical area with the center at the hub and with a time step of 0 05s the wind has the power law profile on the rotor disk and logarithmic profile elsewhere the turbulent wind field is described by iec kaimal model with normal turbulence jonkman and kilcher 2012 for class c from iec standard commission 2005 pto force will influence the relative heave velocity and the absorbed wave power zero pto damping values indicate no wave power is absorbed and relative heave velocity will not be affected if the pto damping values are too large the relative velocity will be too small which means small wave energy is absorbed it is important to know an optimum pto damping value for maximum wave power output the optimal value of the pto damping is varied for different wave periods and various concepts wan et al 2014 therefore parametric study on pto damping using four values i e 0 200 2000 and 20 000 kn m are carried out with the aim to identify appropriate and optimum values and to assess their effects on the wec motion and power performance the following parts show the numerical results and discussion 4 numerical results and analysis 4 1 decay test and eigen values decay test is carried out to identify the system natural periods in the decay test horizontal coupling between spar and torus can be taken as rigid while vertical coupling is transferred through the pto system pto damping can change heave natural periods of spar and torus significantly over damped system and the pto damping has the trend to make spar and torus having uniform heave resonant period wan et al 2016a in this decay study only zero pto damping is considered and the heave resonant periods of spar and torus can be identified separately pto damping effect on the heave natural periods can then be observed through the regular wave analysis table 6 shows the natural periods of the systems obtained from the decay test it is to note that only the torus heave natural period can be identified for the mtc also it can be observed that the surge sway natural periods for the lstc and sstc are different i e 180 s and 123 s respectively due to the different horizontal restoring stiffness in the mooring system for the two different water depth conditions the heave natural period of the spar is 33 s and is identical for lstc and sstc because of the same water plane areas for both devices the heave natural period for the wec is 4 7 s and is also identical for all the three concepts it is noted in table 6 that the pitch roll and yaw natural periods are slightly different for the lstc and sstc the tower turbine shaft and blades are modelled by using the finite elements methods where the eigen analysis is carried out to obtain the first two eigenvalues for the tower as listed in table 6 the two eigen modes are the tower side side and fore aft modes it is seen that the first two eigen values are around 3 and 4 ss 4 2 dynamic response analysis in this session the performance of sstc lstc and mtc are investigated through the dynamic response analysis under various conditions including regular wave conditions irregular wave conditions as well as the combined wind and wave conditions the performance under regular wave conditions provide an overview of the response properties of the concepts the response amplitude operators raos of surge and pitch motions spar heave and relative heave motions as well as the tower base bending moments and shear forces are presented from figs 3 5 to show the response property differences among the three concepts as well as the pto damping effects the mean wave power output under regular waves are shown in fig 6 to investigate the differences induced by pto damping levels and different concepts irregular wave analysis provides the performance of the concepts under real sea states which cover a wide range of the operational conditions surge relative heave motions and mean wave power are investigated parameters to show the motion and power output properties for the three concepts under various sea states with a fixed pto damping of 2000 kn m the results are shown from figs 7 9 furthermore wind cases are included and wind effects are studied the combined wind and wave conditions shows realistic system performance under operational modes therefore investigations on surge and pitch motions wave power output and wind power output tower base bending moments and shear forces as well as mooring line tensions and mtc monopile base shear forces reflect the important properties and show performance of the concepts in a systematic way the results are presented from figs 10 13 under various pre defined load cases in addition spectral analysis is carried out to identify the frequency contributions in the responses from various sources and results are shown from figs 14 16 4 2 1 performance under regular wave conditions regular wave simulations are carried out based on the same wave steepness as summarized in table 2 fig 3 shows the surge and pitch raos for the sstc and lstc the spar and torus heave raos as well as the relative heave raos for the three concepts are shown in fig 4 all the simulations are subjected to pto damping of 0 and 2000 kn m the pto damping has little even no effect on surge and pitch motions in addition the lstc and sstc are found to have insignificant difference in the surge and pitch motion pto damping has strong effects on the spar heave and relative heave motions spar heave in lstc is found to be more sensitive to pto damping than sstc which may due to smaller mass and added mass the most significant differences in the relative heave rao are due to varied pto damping rather than due to various concepts among lstc sstc and mtc the relative heave rao for mtc is larger when subjected to large wave period say larger than 10 s because monopile is fixed and the wec tends to follow the wave under long wave length while for the two floating concepts lstc and sstc both spars and wecs tend to follow the waves inducing smaller relative heave it is worth mentioning that when pto damping is zero the heave resonant periods for wecs and spars are separated with no intervention as indicated in table 5 while when pto damping of sufficiently large value is applied wecs and spars tend to have similar resonant period to have higher wave power large relative heave motions are expected in such cases the concepts will have large motions for both spars and wecs under operational conditions and thus producing more power at the resonant period however significantly large motions will occur under extreme environmental conditions inducing water entry and exit of wecs this will impose challenges to the survivability of the integrated concepts due to the wave impact and water on deck of the wecs therefore the survivability strategies are crucial for the integrated concepts and need investigations this will also increase the cost of the integrated concepts fig 5 shows the tower base bending moment and shear force raos for the three concepts it is expected that the pto damping has no effects hence only the zero pto damping is considered it can be seen from the figure that the tower base bending moment and shear force raos are similar and follow the same trend on the other hand the bending moment and shear force roas for the mtc are significantly different this is because the inertia effect due to the surge motion is very weak on the fixed monopile tower in mtc that is being refrained from moving horizontally fig 6 shows the mean wave power responses under regular wave condition and the same vertical axis scale is set for better comparisons the mean power under regular waves are divided by the square of the wave amplitude for pto of 200 kn m the three concepts have similar performance and the peak values for the three concepts of the wave power are close to the torus heave resonant period i e around 6s when the pto damping is increased to 2000 kn m the power curves are still similar for lstc sstc and mtc which all have peak values around 9s however when the pto damping is 20 000 kn m the power curve is suppressed for mtc whereas lstc and sstc shows similar trends that the curves have peak at around 12s and the power for wave periods smaller than 10s is smaller than that with pto damping of 2000 kn m with the increasing of pto damping the power peaks for different pto gradually increase until 12 s and then decrease for lstc and sstc whose heave resonance occurs in this region it can be concluded that lstc and sstc can be applied by larger pto damping which induces larger wave power compared with mtc 4 2 2 performance under irregular wave conditions the performance of the combined concepts under real sea states is investigated in this section simulations with 3 h steady state responses are carried out then three sea state realizations for each 3 h simulation are performed to reduce the stochastic uncertainties average of the statistical values for the three realizations are used in the analysis i e average values of standard deviation std maximum and minimum from the three realizations are used pto damping of 2000 kn m is applied in the simulations the mean values and std of surge motions for lstc and sstc are shown in fig 7 the surge motion is getting larger under larger hs but are getting smaller with increasing tp generally sstc has smaller values for mean and std of surge motions figs 8 and 9 shows the relative heave motion and the mean wave power under hs 2 m hs 4 m and hs 6 m respectively the same vertical axis scale is set for better comparisons it shows that the relative heaves increase with increasing tp and hs but the relative heave for lstc and sstc are always larger than that of mtc the same trend can be found for the mean wave power especially under large hs the wave power for lstc and sstc can be much larger 4 2 3 performance under combined wind and wave conditions for combined wind and wave conditions the same system parameters are used as in the wave only cases the simulation matrix is listed in table 4 the mean std and maximum values of surge and pitch motions of the lstc and sstc are shown in fig 10 compared with the mean surge motions under wave only conditions the mean surge motions under wind and wave have much larger values which implies that the wind induces the large portion of the surge mean responses the lstc always has larger surge motions but smaller pitch motions compared with sstc under the same load case it is also obvious that the largest surge and pitch motions occur for lc2 because it corresponds to the rated wind speed and thus the largest rotor thrust the produced wave power and wind power for different load cases are shown in fig 11 the mean wave power for lstc and sstc are similar and both are much larger than mtc under lc4 and lc5 which represent severe sea states the std of the wave power for lstc and sstc are also much larger than that of mtc contrary to the wave power the produced wind power is quite consistent for all the three concepts it increases to 5 mw from lc1 to lc2 until lc5 which have the wind speeds above rated value generally the existence of the wec in lstc and sstc can boost the total power by above 10 for lc4 and lc5 while the boost of power is slightly lower for mtc the tower base bending moment mean and std values for different load cases with and without wind loads nw are shown in fig 12 it shows the effect of aerodynamic loads on the tower base bending moment the bending moment mean values under wind actions follow the rotor thrust curve of the nrel 5 mw wind turbine and are largest at lc2 which has the wind speed close to rated value by comparison of wind and no wind cases the mean values of the tower bending moment are mainly induced by the aerodynamic loads both for lstc and sstc and for mtc the std of the tower base bending moment is contributed by both wind and wave effects these provide insights into the ultimate strength or fatigue issues of the tower the mooring line tensions for lstc and sstc and the monopile base shear force for mtc are shown in fig 13 mooring line tension is influenced by both wind and wave and the wind effect is dominant in addition the mooring line 1 is on the leeward side of wind and wave therefore the tension of mooring line 1 is decreased from lc1 to lc2 and then has the increasing trend from lc2 to lc5 which is inverse to the rotor thrust the mooring line tension is not varied so significantly as other parameters like tower base bending moment this could be due to that the mooring line tension is induced by both surge and pitch motions while the surge and pitch have somehow opposite effect on the line tension because the c o g for spar is quite low and close to the fairlead positions in the plot of the monopile base shear force cases with and without wind are presented the std of the monopile base shear forces with and without wind effects has no significant differences which indicates that the std of the base shear is mainly due to the wave effect the mean values of the base shear are contributed by both wind and wave effects the mooring line mean forces are different between lstc and sstc for lc5 spectral analysis is carried out to sort out the frequency components of the responses surge and pitch spectra of sstc and lstc are presented in fig 14 besides the wave frequency response of around 0 6 rad s there are prominent surge resonance due to slow drift and pitch resonant motions again it is seen that lstc has larger surge motion while smaller pitch motions compared with sstc in the spectra for relative heave shown in fig 15 the responses are mainly wave frequency responses for all the three concepts in the tower base bending moment spectra shown in fig 16 there are several frequency components it is noted that the monopile base bending moment is also plotted together with the tower base bending moment for the mtc the tower base bending moment response frequency is the rotor frequency with the rated value of 72 62 deg s 1 23 rad s in the simulation while the monopile base bending moment also has strong wave frequency component for sstc and lstc the tower base bending moment has peaks of wave frequency pitch resonant frequency and rotor frequency responses the main difference between stc and mtc is that mtc don t have pitch resonant frequency response the mooring line tension spectra for lstc and sstc shown in fig 16 mainly have wave frequency and wave difference frequency responses 4 3 survival strategies under extreme environmental conditions water exit and entry of the wecs are inevitable when green water on deck and strong slamming or impact on the wec will occur in addition wecs are designed to have relatively large motion under wave actions so too much motions and forces may be induced to the concepts and challenge the integrity of the structure therefore survival modes need to be proposed and are critical for the concepts integrity several survival strategies for the concepts are discussed here released mode locked mode and two submerged modes wan et al 2015 released mode means releasing the pto under extreme environmental conditions this mode is not a feasible solution since there will be extremely large motions of the wec and large forces in the end stop system locked mode means locking the wec on the cylinder through the mechanical system this mode will introduce large interface forces between wec and cylinder the submerged modes are potentially possible strategies the wec can be locked on the cylinder then the whole system for the floating concepts is submerged by additional ballast until a specific draft that the wec is fully submerged the other alternative is to submerge the wec only through ballast until it is fully submerged the latter strategy can be used for both floating concepts lstc and sstc and fixed concepts mtc in the submerged modes the wave forces can be effectively reduced by a significant amount under survival mode the wind turbine can be parked with the blades feathered into the wind to reduce the wind loads which is proved to be feasible 4 4 uncertainty analysis to address the stochastic uncertainty in the simulations different numbers of wave realizations are carried out the results used in this paper is under three times of realizations for the case hs 4 m tp 8s 20 realizations are carried out the average values of the different realizations are used in the comparison study to address the stochastic uncertainty take the case of 20 realizations as a basis 10 5 and the 3 realizations are compared with the basis respectively and the relative differences are shown in table 7 in this table max and std values of relative heave for lstc and of monopile bending moment for mtc are presented it is shown that by reducing the realization numbers the max value differences are slightly higher than the std value difference the largest relative difference lies in the max of monopile bending moment for mtc which is around 7 difference for the 3 realizations however the std value differences are limited or even negligible with the maximum difference of 1 1 this analysis shows stochastic uncertainties due to different realizations the other type of uncertainties is due to the shallow water waves that partly may not be properly modelled by linear wave in the simulation small steepness parameters have been applied to reduce this effect sea states selected are also mild in the regular wave analysis the purpose is to get the response properties based on the linear assumption so the nonlinearities in real environmental conditions is not a concern irregular wave in real environment may has higher order effects or even breaking waves but these nonlinearities are limited based on the previous model test and numerical validation wan et al 2016a strongly nonlinear phenomena are not considered as the scope of this work 5 conclusions and discussions in this work the numerical analysis has been carried out on the three combined concepts applied at three different water depths lstc is deployed for the large water depth of 320 m sstc is deployed for intermediate water depth of 150 m while mtc is designed for shallow water of 20 m the spar in sstc was modified for optimal operation in the intermediate water depth condition a comparison between the floating and fixed integrated wave and wind energy concepts under different water depths conditions was also successfully investigated as indicated in the paper model tests have been carried out previously to verify the concepts and validate the numerical models in this case it is confident to perform the comprehensive study on the three concepts based on the current numerical methods various scenarios have been set up for the numerical investigations decay and eigen value analysis were carried out to identify the system parameters regular wave analysis was used to get the raos of different response parameters including motion forces and power different sea states were chosen to study the real performance of the three concepts combined wind and wave conditions were introduced to investigate the aerodynamic effects from the simulation results one can get several conclusions for the guidance on future design there are different natural periods for the lstc and sstc due to different configurations and mooring system inducing different raos and wave power performance lstc has relatively larger surge but smaller pitch compared with sstc lstc also has larger wave power output than sstc especially under large sea state and large pto damping level mtc is observed to have minimum wave power output among the three but mtc has the smallest tower base bending moment wind power output is generally the same for the three concepts when the wind speed is larger than rated value wind contributes mainly to the mean values of the horizontal motions and tower base bending moment the std values of the horizontal motions and tower base bending moments are contributed both by wind and wave in general the combination with wec can boost the total maximum output power by above 10 from spectral analysis the surge and pitch motions are mostly induced by the slow drift motions or resonance heave motions are mainly the wave frequency response tower base bending moment shows complicated contributions by various frequencies for floating concepts the contributions from pitch resonance wave frequency and rotor frequency are significant while for mtc rotor frequency contributes most of the tower base bending moment the uncertainty analysis shows that the three realizations in the current simulation can provide relatively accurate results with limited stochastic uncertainties it is noted that for mtc the soil structure interaction effects have not been considered further study on these effects will provide more insights into the mtc performance the three concepts developed for different water depth show different properties these investigations provide insights into dynamic responses of the three concepts the response properties can provide guidance into further structural design and cost estimations funding all the sources of funding for the work described in this publication are acknowledged intellectual property we confirm

21406,a numerical modelling technique for the estimation of as laid pipeline embedment in clayey sediments is introduced in the paper the process of pipe laying is modelled numerically with the pipe soil interaction defined using a nonlinear elasto plastic model therefore the soil resistance contributed by soil buoyancy can be well considered in the evaluation of as laid pipeline embedment the impact of the soil buoyancy in the estimate of as laid embedment is then quantitatively assessed using the proposed numerical modelling technique and the results show that the as laid pipeline embedment can be significantly overestimated if the soil buoyancy is ignored in the analysis keywords pipelines finite element method clay pipe laying embedment buoyancy 1 introduction offshore pipelines are commonly laid on the seabed by a laying barge in deep waters without prior trenching or burial fig 1 where the typical deposit is normally consolidated fine grained soil the embedment of the pipeline after installation so called as laid pipeline embedment is a function of the pipeline self weight relative to the seabed strength but is complicated by the laying process firstly the contact force between the pipe and soil in the touchdown zone tdz is larger than the self weight of the pipeline due to bending of the pipeline caused by the catenary laying shape shown in fig 1 secondly the pipeline dynamic motion during the laying process would lead to remoulding of soil within the tdz water entrainment and possible trenching to further increase the penetration westgate et al 2012 accurate assessment of the as laid embedment is essential for pipeline stability and integrity designs as the embedment substantially affects pipe soil interaction and thus the pipeline behaviour of lateral buckling on bottom stability axial friction resistance and heat transition white et al 2017 there is no conservative estimation of the as laid pipeline embedment for example underestimation of the embedment may eventually result in more heat losses in the design and therefore underestimation of the thermal expansion which increase the risk of snap through buckling while a higher hydrodynamic load would be used in stability analysis with possible unnecessary costly stabilisation solutions to be taken therefore the accurate estimation of the as laid embedment is concerned in this paper the major efforts have been devoted to the modelling of soil responses experimentally and numerically such as the softening of soil stiffness shiri and randolph 2010 clukey et al 2011 aubeny et al 2015 zhao et al 2020 and the effect of consolidation hodder et al 2009 yuan et al 2017 zargar et al 2019 the effects of remoulding for short term loadings are majorly considered in the analysis of the pipeline as laid embedment and the typical studies are summarised in table 1 including the analytical solutions and the finite element fe analysis by commercial software orcaflex orcina 2012 the pipe penetration resistance was approximately assumed to increase linearly with depth in the theoretical analyses lenci and callegari 2005 yuan et al 2012 due to the difficulties in solving the differential equations although a hysteretic seabed model is adopted for pipe soil interaction in orcaflex the resistance related to soil buoyancy is ignored the contribution of soil buoyancy to the total soil resistance may become significant as the undrained strength of clay is reduced due to soil remoulding during the laying process randolph and gourvenec 2010 chatterjee et al 2012 clukey et al 2017 the aim of this note is to develop a fe modelling technique to evaluate the as laid pipeline embedment in which the normally consolidated clayey seabed with shear strength increasing proportionally with depth is considered and the entire pipe laying process is reproduced to obtain the enhanced contact force in the tdz the anisotropy structure and time dependency of soil strength randolph 2004 yin et al 2011 grimstad et al 2012 are not considered here nonlinear elasto plastic pipe soil interaction can be implemented easily in fe modelling and therefore the soil buoyancy is taken into account in estimation of as laid embedment the dynamic lay effects such as soil remoulding due to cyclic loadings and water entrainment are implicitly accounted for by using a remoulded soil shear strength profile 2 finite element modelling a numerical modelling technique for the pipe laying process is developed within commercial fe package abaqus the pipeline is discretised using beam elements b21 in abaqus and the continuity of bending moment and shear along the pipeline can be well simulated in the pipe laying process the seabed is represented by a series of macro springs defined at each node of the beam elements with the spacing of 1 m shown in fig 2 based on the plasticity theory the loading responses of pipe soil interaction are formulated and applied on macro element scale tian and cassidy 2008 as such each spring is a force resultant model implemented as a macro element through abaqus built in user subroutine shiri 2014 liu et al 2016 three force resultant models for the pipe soil interaction are studied respectively 2 1 modelling of pipe laying process the purpose of tracking the pipe laying process is to obtain the pipeline catenary laying shape and hence the enhanced contact force in the tdz a 4000 m long pipeline sufficient long for the water depth of 1000 m in the analysis is taken as an example and the rigid stinger needs to be mimicked as well fig 2 schematically shows the modelling procedure which is illustrated as five steps step 1 apply self weight of the pipeline which is initially sitting on the seabed the seabed is not simulated explicitly but the pipe soil interaction is defined by the macro element that will be detailed in section 2 2 step 2 uplift the left end of the pipeline point a in fig 2 to the height of z a using a displacement control mode point a is free to rotate and move horizontally z a was selected here by trial and error to achieve a required pipeline configuration together with the step 4 step 3 apply a horizontal tension gradually at point a while the vertical constraint is remained until the pipeline inclination angle at the point a reaches the targeted lay angle θ step 4 move the rigid stinger created beforehand at a height of z s horizontally until it pushes the pipeline in a catenary laying shape point a is fixed during this step the height of the stinger z s is also obtained by the trial and error to achieve the targeted laying conditions step 5 move the stinger towards the left handed and pipeline laying process is realised essentially the first four steps is to form the pipeline laying shape and the last step is to reproduce the laying process z a 1060 m and z s 1020 m were adopted for the targeted laying conditions summarised in table 2 the targeted lay angle θ 80 and water depth z w 1000 m should be measured from a inflexion point shown in fig 2b where the bending moment is nearly zero randolph and white 2008 2 2 pipe soil interaction the penetration resistance v is zero when the pipe is above the mudline penetration of pipe invert w 0 the force resultant models usually based on theoretical solutions or experimental results have been used to capture the interaction between soil and the pipe segment when the pipe is below the mudline w 0 three pipe soil interaction models schematically shown in fig 3 are integrated into simulations of pipe laying the linear elastic and elasto plastic models are employed to compare with the existing solutions for the purpose of verification and a more sophisticated nonlinear elasto plastic model is then applied to quantify the influence of soil buoyancy on the as laid pipeline embedment in the linear elastic and elasto plastic pipe soil models a linear relationship is assumed between the penetration resistance v and penetration of pipe invert w that is actually an approximate fitting line to the theoretical power law solution aubeny et al 2005 1 v d s u a w d b k v p w where d is the pipe diameter s u is the undrained shear strength increasing linearly with soil depth w with a gradient of k i e s u kw a and b are two coefficients related to the roughness of the pipe soil interface aubeny et al 2005 k vp and k ve are the pipe penetration stiffness and rebounding stiffness respectively as shown in fig 3a it is assumed k vp k ve in the linear elastic pipe soil model while the pipe plastic penetration is simulated in the linear elasto plastic model fig 3b with a high rebounding stiffness taken as k ve 50k vp yuan et al 2014 for the nonlinear elasto plastic model the overall pipe penetration resistance including the contribution from soil buoyancy is estimated by equation 2 randolph and white 2008 2 v d s u a w ˆ b f b γ a s w ˆ

submerged unit weight of soil a s is the pipe nominal embedded area w ˆ w d is the normalised pipe penetration depth and f b is the heave effect factor equation 4 was suggested by white et al 2010 in which w ˆ d e e p indicates the normalised depth at which the failure mechanism transitions from heaving to a deep flow round mechanism w ˆ d e e p was taken as 1 5 by white et al 2010 the elastic unloading and reloading in this model are also defined through rebounding stiffness k ve 50k vp where k vp is the loading gradient of the unloading point on the backbone curve shown in fig 3c 3 verification of the modelling technique the modelling technique proposed is verified by comparison with the existing solutions with concerns on a the pipeline laying shape which dominates the contact force in the tdz and b the as laid pipeline embedment in the tdz all comparisons are against the properties of pipeline and soil and laying conditions provided in table 2 3 1 pipeline laying shape linear elastic pipe soil interaction the available analytical solution for the pipeline laying shape was developed with the linear elastic pipe soil interaction lenci and callegari 2005 for the purpose of comparison the same linear elastic pipe soil interaction shown in fig 3a is adopted in the fe analysis the numerical procedure follows that in section 2 1 fig 4 a demonstrates the fe results of the pipeline laying shape pipeline embedment near tdz versus the arc length of the pipeline l which is zeroed at the pipeline touchdown point the distribution of contacted force normalised by pipe submerged weight pʹ is provided in fig 4b the fe results show excellent agreements with the analytical solutions lenci and callegari 2005 especially in the region near the tdz 3 2 as laid pipeline embedment linear elasto plastic pipe soil interaction the as laid pipeline embedment is analysed with the pipe soil interaction defined in terms of the linear elasto plastic model shown in fig 3b two different seabed stiffness termed as stiff k vp 45 kpa and soft k vp 5 6 kpa are investigated the fe results are verified by comparison with the analytical solutions by yuan et al 2014 and results from the commercial program oxflex orcina 2012 fig 5 a and b show good agreements between the predictions of the pipeline embedment near the tdz for stiff and soft seabed respectively correspondingly the contact force distributions agree well with each other as proved in fig 6 if the elastic model is employed the pipeline maximum embedment in the tdz is underestimated marginally fig 5 this is attributed to the different soil rebound stiffnesses k ve k vp for the elastic model and k ve 50k vp for the elasto plastic model 4 as laid pipeline embedment with consideration of soil buoyancy in this section the influence of soil buoyancy on the as laid embedment is investigated using the modelling technique proposed in which the nonlinear elasto plastic pipe soil interaction shown in fig 3c is adopted the intact shear strength gradient k is assumed as 12 kpa m a variety of soil effective unit weight is studied as γ γ w 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 2 where γ w 9 8 kn m3 is the unit weight of water and the reduction of shear strength caused by soil remoulding due to pipe dynamic motion is considered by soil sensitivity s t ranging from 1 to 8 therefore k is changed from 12 kpa m to 1 5 kpa m pipeline properties and laying condition are given in table 2 the resulted as laid pipeline embedment is expressed in terms of the non dimensional stiffness k which follows the expression proposed by pesce et al 1998 5 k λ 2 t 0 k d where λ e i t 0 ei is the bending rigidity of the pipeline and t 0 is the horizontal component of the effective tension in the pipeline and t 0 637 kn is obtained by the tension force at the touchdown point from the numerical results the numerical results of the embedment in the normalised form of w ˆ m a x w max d are shown by the dots in fig 7 a as a function of the stiffness k w max is the maximum embedment in the tdz and indicated in fig 5 the as laid pipeline embedment is represented by w max with negligible discrepancy for the soil plastic behaviour shown in fig 5 the fe results can be fitted as 6 w ˆ m a x 1 2 w ˆ 0 4 γ ˆ k 0 8 w ˆ 0 2 γ ˆ where w ˆ w γ w d 2 and γ ˆ γ γ w the results by equation 6 are shown as the solid lines in fig 7a in fig 7a open diamonds indicate the predictions from the analysis without consideration of soil buoyancy in the pipe soil interaction see equation 1 representing the typical results of the existing studies the numerical predictions accounting for the soil buoyancy equation 2 are featured with much smaller as laid embedment as k is decreased due to soil remoulding or γ is increased the overestimation of the as laid embedment induced by ignoring soil buoyancy would become larger almost twice the embedment for the case of γ 1 2γ w and s t 8 k 0 87 as shown in fig 7a correspondingly the maximum contact forces for each case are presented in the normalised form of v max pʹ shown in fig 7b the stress concentration v max pʹ generally increase with the soil effective unit weight γ γ w or soil buoyancy and may be underestimated largely with the decrease of k or increase of γ if the soil buoyancy is not considered in the analysis the fe results shown in fig 7 are an appropriate example to demonstrate the importance of taking account of the soil buoyancy in the estimation of as laid pipeline embedment especially with the fact that the seabed soils would eventually become remoulded during the pipe laying process 5 conclusions a modelling technique incorporating finite element simulation and the pipe soil interaction model is developed to evaluate the as laid pipeline embedment this technique can estimate the contact force in the touchdown zone reasonably given that a sophisticated pipe soil interaction model such as the nonlinear elasto plastic model used is incorporated the modelling technique is validated by comparison with the existing analytical solutions the penetration resistance contributed by soil buoyancy is then taken into consideration to estimate the as laid pipeline embedment more accurately a wide range of the undrained strength and submerged unit weight of soil are investigated for given pipeline properties and laying conditions the results show that the as laid pipeline embedment may be overestimated significantly if the soil buoyancy is ignored credit authorship contribution statement liang zhao conceptualization

pipeline catenary laying shape and hence the enhanced contact force in the tdz a 4000 m long pipeline sufficient long for the water depth of 1000 m in the analysis is taken as an example and the rigid stinger needs to be mimicked as well fig 2 schematically shows the modelling procedure which is illustrated as five steps step 1 apply self weight of the pipeline which is initially sitting on the seabed the seabed is not simulated explicitly but the pipe soil interaction is defined by the macro element that will be detailed in section 2 2 step 2 uplift the left end of the pipeline point a in fig 2 to the height of z a using a displacement control mode point a is free to rotate and move horizontally z a was selected here by trial and error to achieve a required pipeline configuration together with the step 4 step 3 apply a horizontal tension gradually at point a while the vertical constraint is remained until the pipeline inclination angle at the point a reaches the targeted lay angle θ step 4 move the rigid stinger created beforehand at a height of z s horizontally until it pushes the pipeline in a catenary laying shape point a is fixed during this step the height of the stinger z s is also obtained by the trial and error to achieve the targeted laying conditions step 5 move the stinger towards the left handed and pipeline laying process is realised essentially the first four steps is to form the pipeline laying shape and the last step is to reproduce the laying process z a 1060 m and z s 1020 m were adopted for the targeted laying conditions summarised in table 2 the targeted lay angle θ 80 and water depth z w 1000 m should be measured from a inflexion point shown in fig 2b where the bending moment is nearly zero randolph and white 2008 2 2 pipe soil interaction the penetration resistance v is zero when the pipe is above the mudline penetration of pipe invert w 0 the force resultant models usually based on theoretical solutions or experimental results have been used to capture the interaction between soil and the pipe segment when the pipe is below the mudline w 0 three pipe soil interaction models schematically shown in fig 3 are integrated into simulations of pipe laying the linear elastic and elasto plastic models are employed to compare with the existing solutions for the purpose of verification and a more sophisticated nonlinear elasto plastic model is then applied to quantify the influence of soil buoyancy on the as laid pipeline embedment in the linear elastic and elasto plastic pipe soil models a linear relationship is assumed between the penetration resistance v and penetration of pipe invert w that is actually an approximate fitting line to the theoretical power law solution aubeny et al 2005 1 v d s u a w d b k v p w where d is the pipe diameter s u is the undrained shear strength increasing linearly with soil depth w with a gradient of k i e s u kw a and b are two coefficients related to the roughness of the pipe soil interface aubeny et al 2005 k vp and k ve are the pipe penetration stiffness and rebounding stiffness respectively as shown in fig 3a it is assumed k vp k ve in the linear elastic pipe soil model while the pipe plastic penetration is simulated in the linear elasto plastic model fig 3b with a high rebounding stiffness taken as k ve 50k vp yuan et al 2014 for the nonlinear elasto plastic model the overall pipe penetration resistance including the contribution from soil buoyancy is estimated by equation 2 randolph and white 2008 2 v d s u a w ˆ b f b γ a s w ˆ

submerged unit weight of soil a s is the pipe nominal embedded area w ˆ w d is the normalised pipe penetration depth and f b is the heave effect factor equation 4 was suggested by white et al 2010 in which w ˆ d e e p indicates the normalised depth at which the failure mechanism transitions from heaving to a deep flow round mechanism w ˆ d e e p was taken as 1 5 by white et al 2010 the elastic unloading and reloading in this model are also defined through rebounding stiffness k ve 50k vp where k vp is the loading gradient of the unloading point on the backbone curve shown in fig 3c 3 verification of the modelling technique the modelling technique proposed is verified by comparison with the existing solutions with concerns on a the pipeline laying shape which dominates the contact force in the tdz and b the as laid pipeline embedment in the tdz all comparisons are against the properties of pipeline and soil and laying conditions provided in table 2 3 1 pipeline laying shape linear elastic pipe soil interaction the available analytical solution for the pipeline laying shape was developed with the linear elastic pipe soil interaction lenci and callegari 2005 for the purpose of comparison the same linear elastic pipe soil interaction shown in fig 3a is adopted in the fe analysis the numerical procedure follows that in section 2 1 fig 4 a demonstrates the fe results of the pipeline laying shape pipeline embedment near tdz versus the arc length of the pipeline l which is zeroed at the pipeline touchdown point the distribution of contacted force normalised by pipe submerged weight pʹ is provided in fig 4b the fe results show excellent agreements with the analytical solutions lenci and callegari 2005 especially in the region near the tdz 3 2 as laid pipeline embedment linear elasto plastic pipe soil interaction the as laid pipeline embedment is analysed with the pipe soil interaction defined in terms of the linear elasto plastic model shown in fig 3b two different seabed stiffness termed as stiff k vp 45 kpa and soft k vp 5 6 kpa are investigated the fe results are verified by comparison with the analytical solutions by yuan et al 2014 and results from the commercial program oxflex orcina 2012 fig 5 a and b show good agreements between the predictions of the pipeline embedment near the tdz for stiff and soft seabed respectively correspondingly the contact force distributions agree well with each other as proved in fig 6 if the elastic model is employed the pipeline maximum embedment in the tdz is underestimated marginally fig 5 this is attributed to the different soil rebound stiffnesses k ve k vp for the elastic model and k ve 50k vp for the elasto plastic model 4 as laid pipeline embedment with consideration of soil buoyancy in this section the influence of soil buoyancy on the as laid embedment is investigated using the modelling technique proposed in which the nonlinear elasto plastic pipe soil interaction shown in fig 3c is adopted the intact shear strength gradient k is assumed as 12 kpa m a variety of soil effective unit weight is studied as γ γ w 0 3 0 5 0 7 and 1 2 where γ w 9 8 kn m3 is the unit weight of water and the reduction of shear strength caused by soil remoulding due to pipe dynamic motion is considered by soil sensitivity s t ranging from 1 to 8 therefore k is changed from 12 kpa m to 1 5 kpa m pipeline properties and laying condition are given in table 2 the resulted as laid pipeline embedment is expressed in terms of the non dimensional stiffness k which follows the expression proposed by pesce et al 1998 5 k λ 2 t 0 k d where λ e i t 0 ei is the bending rigidity of the pipeline and t 0 is the horizontal component of the effective tension in the pipeline and t 0 637 kn is obtained by the tension force at the touchdown point from the numerical results the numerical results of the embedment in the normalised form of w ˆ m a x w max d are shown by the dots in fig 7 a as a function of the stiffness k w max is the maximum embedment in the tdz and indicated in fig 5 the as laid pipeline embedment is represented by w max with negligible discrepancy for the soil plastic behaviour shown in fig 5 the fe results can be fitted as 6 w ˆ m a x 1 2 w ˆ 0 4 γ ˆ k 0 8 w ˆ 0 2 γ ˆ where w ˆ w γ w d 2 and γ ˆ γ γ w the results by equation 6 are shown as the solid lines in fig 7a in fig 7a open diamonds indicate the predictions from the analysis without consideration of soil buoyancy in the pipe soil interaction see equation 1 representing the typical results of the existing studies the numerical predictions accounting for the soil buoyancy equation 2 are featured with much smaller as laid embedment as k is decreased due to soil remoulding or γ is increased the overestimation of the as laid embedment induced by ignoring soil buoyancy would become larger almost twice the embedment for the case of γ 1 2γ w and s t 8 k 0 87 as shown in fig 7a correspondingly the maximum contact forces for each case are presented in the normalised form of v max pʹ shown in fig 7b the stress concentration v max pʹ generally increase with the soil effective unit weight γ γ w or soil buoyancy and may be underestimated largely with the decrease of k or increase of γ if the soil buoyancy is not considered in the analysis the fe results shown in fig 7 are an appropriate example to demonstrate the importance of taking account of the soil buoyancy in the estimation of as laid pipeline embedment especially with the fact that the seabed soils would eventually become remoulded during the pipe laying process 5 conclusions a modelling technique incorporating finite element simulation and the pipe soil interaction model is developed to evaluate the as laid pipeline embedment this technique can estimate the contact force in the touchdown zone reasonably given that a sophisticated pipe soil interaction model such as the nonlinear elasto plastic model used is incorporated the modelling technique is validated by comparison with the existing analytical solutions the penetration resistance contributed by soil buoyancy is then taken into consideration to estimate the as laid pipeline embedment more accurately a wide range of the undrained strength and submerged unit weight of soil are investigated for given pipeline properties and laying conditions the results show that the as laid pipeline embedment may be overestimated significantly if the soil buoyancy is ignored credit authorship contribution statement liang zhao conceptualization

21407,this study investigates the wind wave coupling effects on fatigue damage of tendons that connect multiple bodies of a novel floating platform telwind supporting a 10 mw wind turbine an aero hydro servo tool is developed for dynamic analysis of a multi body floating wind turbine fwt platform by incorporating aerodyn with aqwa through a user defined dynamic library link dll to conduct simulations of the fwt subjected to wind wave and current loadings the comparison against fast has validated the accuracy of the aqwa aerodyn coupling framework in predicting coupled responses of the fwt a specific site in the northern coast of scotland is selected and design load cases are examined for the estimation of the fatigue damage of the tendons of the fwt in the absence of wind wave coupling the motion differences between the two bodies of the platform are larger leading to 43 7 enhancement in the tension fluctuation of tendons in average consequently the fatigue damage of the tendons is significantly overestimated also the investigation on the influence of effective simulation length on the fatigue damage shows that 90 accuracy can be achieved when 20 of the simulation analysis length is decreased keywords multi body platform floating wind turbines arcwind aero hydro servo coupled method fatigue analysis tendons 1 introduction the technology of offshore wind energy extraction is continuing to receive more attention due to its maturity abundance of offshore wind reserves and the role of wind energy as an alternative to fossil fuels it is expected that no less than 55 gw of wind turbines would be installed each year until 2023 gwec 2019 one of the main goals of recent studies on offshore wind energy utilization has been to reduce the levelized cost of electricity lcoe with the increase of wind turbine scale the up front costs are decreased through economies of scale and reduced plant costs on a per megawatt basis the performance of large scale wind turbines with taller towers and longer blades is better than that of small wind turbines in addition large scale offshore wind turbines offer the advantage of reduced frequency of transportation installation and maintenance related activities in combination these trends have reduced the lcoe of an offshore wind farm made of large wind turbines wiser et al 2016 compared to a fixed bottom type the floating type is more suitable for large scale 10 mw offshore wind generation applications because it can operate in deeper seas where more abundant wind resources exist the past decade has witnessed the developments of numerous floating platform concepts for wind turbines statoil developed a spar buoy in the hywind project for the world first full scale fwt in 2009 this was followed by the modification of the hywind spar buoy by national renewable energy laboratory nrel to support the nrel 5 mw wind turbine in the offshore code comparison collaboration oc3 project sponsored by the international energy agency iea in 2010 jonkman 2010 the oc3 spar platform has been extensively used in various studies for further development of offshore wind energy system karimirad and moan 2011 yu et al 2015 yue et al 2020 in addition nrel developed a semi submersible platform in the subsequent deepcwind project robertson et al 2014 and a tension leg platform tlp based on the massachusetts institute of technology design concept matha 2010 as part of the oc4 and oc5 projects respectively three 1 50th scaled models of the nrel s spar semi submersible and tlp were tested in different environmental conditions to provide sufficient experimental data for validating the numerical analysis tools of floating wind turbines fwts goupee et al 2012 dynamic responses of the nrel s spar tlp and a barge vijfhuizen 2006 supporting the nrel 5 mw wind turbine were compared quantitatively however the capacity of wind turbines supported by aforementioned floating platforms were limited to 5 mw it is noted that the offshore applications of higher capacity wind turbines 10 mw have been the focus of research in the recent years due to their high potentials in reducing lcoe bak et al 2012 velarde 2016 of fwts in deep sea areas european union eu has been at the forefront in funding some pioneering projects in developing floating platforms for 10 mw class wind turbines for instance the innwind project azcona et al 2017 proposed a semi submersible concept for the dtu technical university of denmark 10 mw wind turbine hydrodynamic performance of the platform was investigated the life50 project yu et al 2017 has developed four floating concepts for 10 mw wind turbines including two semi submersible platforms made of concrete and steel a concrete barge platform and a steel tlp hawc2 and fast were used as the numerical analysis tools to conduct the coupled analysis after comparisons against wave tank experiments comprehensively more recently a free float capable tlp uzunoglu and soares 2020 was developed in the arcwind project for 10 mw wind turbines the hydrodynamic performance of the platform under operational and 50 year extreme conditions was evaluated and the results verified the survivability of the structure in addition the arcwind project employed a novel two body spar floating platform called telwind platform developed by esteyco armesto et al 2018 for 10 mw fwts applications the telwind platform consists of two concrete tanks an upper tank ut which provides buoyancy and a ballasting lower tank lt providing pitch stability the ut and the lt are connected by 6 tendons which are designed to always be in tension to ensure a low centre of gravity cog of the platform as shown in fig 1 it is apparent that the safety and stability of the fwt significantly depend on the integrity of the tendons therefore it is imperative to conduct fatigue assessment of the tendons for this particular platform as revealed in the recent studies wen et al 2017 2019 antonutti et al 2016 liu et al 2017 dai et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 dynamic responses of a fwt are affected by the interactions between aerodynamic loads and hydrodynamic loads therefore the wind wave coupling effect must be taken into account when evaluating fatigue life of the multi body platform tendons it is noted that the commonly used numerical tools have limitations in their capability to examine the dynamic responses of a multi body floating platform connected by flexible elements in order to address these limitations this study has developed a coupled numerical method for multi body floating platforms by incorporating aerodyn with aqwa through a user defined dll the developed generic numerical method is applied for fatigue analysis of the tendons of the multi body platform after validating against fast the design load cases for the fatigue assessment are defined according to the observed met ocean data during the period from 2011 to 2016 in a specified site off the northern coast of scotland a comparative analysis of fatigue damage of the tendons between the coupled method and decoupled method analysis is performed in order to quantitatively evaluate the wind wave coupling effects for the coupled method the responses of the wind turbine due to wind wave and current excitations are coupled through the user defined dll while for the decoupled method the aerodynamic loads of the wind turbine are calculated independently of the platform motions and are then used together with hydrodynamic loads for solving the equation of motion in time domain based on the time domain results obtained from both the coupled and decoupled analysis fatigue damage of each of the tendons is predicted in accordance with the international electrotechnical commission iec standard iec 2009 the wind wave coupling effects on the fatigue damage of the tendons of the telwind multi body platform are determined and discussed in addition the influence of the simulation duration is examined and quantified using the coupled method 2 wind turbine model 2 1 dtu 10 mw baseline wind turbine dtu developed a reference 10 mw wind turbine in collaboration with vestas in the light rotor project bak et al 2012 the three bladed wind turbine has been classed as an iec class 1 a wind climate with a rated wind speed of 11 4 m s a simple nacelle and a drivetrain were also designed for the dtu baseline wind turbine due to availability of the detailed aerodynamic shape and structural properties in public domain the dtu 10 mw wind turbine has been widely used for the development of various offshore support structures table 1 presents a summary of design parameters of the dtu reference wind turbine it is noted that the fwt supported by the multi body platform has the same hub height as the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine 2 2 description of the 10 mw multi body model the telwind model is originally developed by esteyco for the floating application of offshore wind turbines the floating platform consists of two bodies ut and lt connected by six tendons the ut is designed to provide buoyancy while the lt is for ballasting to ensure stability of the whole wind turbine system the two bodies are made of concrete in order to reduce the cost a telescopic tower is incorporated in the platform to ease the transport and installation processes the tower consists of three sections a topmost steel section that directly supports the turbine and two lower sections made of concrete it is noted that the tower has a much higher bending stiffness compared to the dtu reference tower more specifically the tower base bending stiffness of the telwind concept is 1 30 1013 n m2 while the bending stiffness of the 10 mw dtu reference tower at the base is 1 77 1012 n m2 fig 2 presents a schematic diagram of the 10 mw multi body wind turbine which is applicable to 110 m water depth areas or deeper seas with appropriate modifications on mooring lines configuration the ut is 10 m below the mean sea level msl with a draught of 16 75 m the lt has a draught of 22 5 m and the total draught of the combined structure is 92 25 m the diameters of ut and lt are 44 5 m and 23 0 m respectively each of the tendons has a length of 48 81 m and an equivalent diameter of 0 271 m in aqwa each tendon is modelled as a catenary fig 3 presents the orientations of the tendons and mooring lines there are 6 and 3 connection points for the tendons on the ut and lt respectively the ut tendon connection points distribute uniformly around the circumference of the bottom surface the fairleads of the mooring lines are attached on the top surface of the ut each of the mooring lines has an unstretched length of 620 m and a wet weight of 250 kg m the coordinates of the connection points of the tendons and mooring lines are presented in table 2 by conducting free decay analysis of the moored fwt in all six degrees of freedom natural periods and frequencies of the platform in the six degrees of freedom dofs are obtained and presented in table 3 3 coupling between aqwa and aerodyn 3 1 development of the coupling framework fast is an excellent multi physical engineering tool that is commonly used for coupled analysis of fwts however in its current form fast is incapable of examining the coupled effects of a multi body platform connected by flexile elements especially when the focus is the connection element it is noted that aqwa is capable of performing frequency domain and time domain analyses of offshore and marine structures with multiple floaters although the baseline version of aqwa is not capable of calculating aerodynamic loads of fwts it accepts external forces calculated by a user defined dll at each time step of the time domain analysis therefore aqwa becomes a suitable option in this study as the numerical tool after modifying its built in dll to make it capable of handling servo control and predicting aerodynamic loads of a multi body fwt consequently a coupling framework presented in fig 4 is developed and implemented by incorporating aerodyn in aqwa after modifying its source code the calculation procedure of the aerodynamic loads in every time step is coupled with the floating platform dynamic responses to be more specifically the relative speed between the rotor and inflow wind is affected by the platform surge and pitch rotation velocities at each time step of the simulation in aqwa the relative wind speed is calculated by 1 v rel v in v s ω p h hub h cog where v rel is the relative wind speed v in is the inflow wind speed v s and ω p are the surge velocity and pitch velocity of the platform respectively h hub is the hub height and h cog is the distance of ut s cog to the msl in addition a transformation matrix t mat is applied to correct the rotor coordinates due to the platform rotational motions the corrected coordinates x y z of a rotor point x 0 y 0 z 0 is given as 2 x y z θ 1 2 1 s θ 2 2 θ 3 2 s 1 s θ 3 s θ 1 θ 2 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 2 s θ 1 θ 3 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 3 s θ 1 θ 2 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 2 2 1 s θ 1 2 θ 3 2 s 1 s θ 1 s θ 2 θ 3 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 2 s θ 1 θ 3 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 1 s θ 2 θ 3 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 3 2 1 s θ 1 2 θ 2 2 s 1 s x 0 y 0 z 0 where θ 1 θ 2 and θ 3 are the roll pitch and yaw displacements of the platform respectively s is the sum of squares of each rotation equal to θ 1 2 θ 2 2 θ 3 2 during the time domain simulation in aqwa aerodyn is invoked at each time step to calculate aerodynamic loads of the wind turbine based on the operational parameters including the rotor speed blade pitch tilt angle and yaw angle the generalized dynamic wake model gdw is used to examine the dynamic inflow effects of the wind turbine the force vector obtained by aerodyn through the dll is applied at the hub height of the wind turbine the dynamic responses of the platform subjected to the coupled loadings at the next time step are then calculated in aqwa the equation of motion of each of the ut and lt is given below 3 m a wv x t c x t kx t 0 t h t τ x τ d τ f h t f t t f e t where m is the inertial mass matrix of the platform a wv is the hydrodynamic added mass matrix k and c are respectively the total stiffness and damping matrices x t x t and x t are respectively the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors of the platform h t is the impulse function matrix used to examine the hydrodynamic radiation memory effects as denoted in eq 4 f h t and f t t are respectively the hydrodynamic and mooring load vectors acting on the platform f e t is the external force vector obtained through the dll 4 h t 2 π 0 b ω sin ω t ω d ω where b ω is the radiation damping and ω is the wave frequency the added mass radiation damping and excitation forces of both the ut and lt are calculated in aqwa by performing a frequency domain analysis based on the potential theory each mooring line is modelled as a dynamic catenary the inertial effects of the mooring line and the platform motions are considered in predicting the mooring tensions it is noted that the external force of the lt is zero while the external force acting on the ut is calculated using the dll the aerodynamic loads acting on the hub obtained through the dll are referenced to the ut s local coordinate system and the external force item in eq 3 is applied at the ut s centre of mass and referenced to the inertial coordinate system therefore aerodynamic loads directly obtained through the dll are converted using eq 5 and eq 6 before being passed into the aqwa solver for solving the equation of motion 5 f aqwa t mat 1 f dll 6 m aqwa t mat 1 m dll hub cog f dll where f aqwa and f dll are the translational force vectors in the aqwa solver and dll respectively t mat 1 is the inverse matrix of t mat m aqwa used in aqwa is the moment vector acting at the ut s centre of mass with respect to the inertial coordinate system m dll obtained in the dll is the moment vector acting at the hub height with respect to the platform s local coordinate system hub and cog are the position vectors of the hub and the ut respectively 3 2 implementation of the torque pitch controller in order to examine the start up procedure and normal power production cases a torque pitch controller is developed and integrated with the aqwa aerodyn coupling interface to adjust the rotor speed and blade pitch the torque pitch controller consists of a simple partial load controller and a proportional integral pi controller the partial load controller defines the relationship between desired torque and speed of the generator when the output power is smaller than the rated power the pi controller takes over to adjust blade pitch once the output power exceeds the rated power referring to the basic algorithm applied for a 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 the torque speed variation is divided into 5 regions as shown in fig 5 region 1 corresponds to the start up process of the wind turbine the generator torque remains 0 until the rotor speed exceeds the minimum speed 6 0 rpm region 1 1 2 is a transitional region where the generator will be accelerated to reach the minimum speed at region 2 that is the control region with an optimal efficiency to capture wind energy as the wind turbine operates under the best tip speed ratio tsr the generator torque is proportional to the square of the generator speed in this region region 2 1 2 is used to limit the minimum generator speed at rated power and the maximum blade tip speed due to noise emission in region 3 the wind turbine outputs the rated power constantly implying that the generator speed is inverse to the torque for the dtu 10 mw wind turbine the minimum rotor speed is 6 0 rpm and the gearbox ratio is 50 implying that the starting limit of region 1 1 2 is 300 0 rpm the starting and ending limits of region 2 are chosen as 123 of the minimum generator speed and 95 of the rated generator speed respectively by assuming that the generator power at 480 rpm is 10 mw with an efficiency of 94 4 jonkman et al 2009 generator torques corresponding to 368 rpm and 456 rpm are 141 kn m and 210 kn m respectively in order to avoid excessive overloading in region 3 the saturated torque is set as 10 above the rated capacity and the maximum torque ratio is 75 kn m s in region 3 the pitch controller is activated to adjust blade pitch angle for moderating structural loads and cutting off excess power the adjustment of blade pitch is determined by aerodynamic power which is influenced by rotor speed therefore the pitch control is implemented through the developed pi model of rotor speed and blade pitch the drivetrain system which consists of the rotor and the generator can be treated as a single dof system the equation of motion of the drivetrain system is denoted as 7 t r n g t g i r n g 2 i g d ω 0 δ ω d t i g t δ ω where t r is rotor torque and t g is generator torque n g is gearbox ratio i r and i g are the rotor inertia and generator inertia respectively ω 0 and δ ω are the rated rotor speed and rotor speed perturbation during d t respectively i g t is the drivetrain inertia and δ ω is rotor acceleration perturbation the blade pitch error δ θ can be denoted in a pi form as 8 δ θ k p n g δ ω k i 0 t n g δ ω d t where k p and k i are the proportional gain and integral gain respectively which are denoted as 9 k p 2 i g t ω 0 ξ ϕ ω ϕ n n g p θ 10 k i i g t ω 0 ω ϕ n 2 n g p θ where ω ϕ n and ξ ϕ are the frequency and damping ratio of the controller the frequency and damping ratio of the basic pitch controller developed by dtu for the 10 mw reference wind turbine are 0 377 rad s and 0 7 respectively bak et al 2013 by calculating the aerodynamic power at different blade pitch angles the sensitivity of power to pitch p θ can be obtained as the p θ varies considerably with blade pitch over region 3 hansen and henriksen 2013 constant k p and k i are insufficient to adjust blade pitch effectively therefore an adjustment coefficient η θ is used to correct k p and k i at different blade pitch angles 11 k p θ k p 0 η θ 12 k i θ k i 0 η θ where k p θ and k i θ are the proportional and integral gains at blade pitch θ respectively k p 0 and k i 0 are the proportional and integral gains at zero blade pitch respectively as given in the dtu basic controller report the pi gains at zero blade pitch are 0 010490 rad s rad and 0 002824 rad rad respectively hansen and henriksen 2013 the adjustment coefficient η θ is given as 13 η 1 1 θ ψ 1 θ 2 ψ 2 where ψ 1 and ψ 2 are 3 46 rad and 0 21 rad2 respectively the controller frequency is designed as 0 377 rad s which is larger than the roll pitch natural frequency of the multi body platform see table 3 in order to avoid potential resonant response of roll pitch motion the controller frequency is detuned by 4 times to 0 094 rad s the proportional and integral gains at zero blade pitch are 0 002622425 rad s rad and 0 00017654 rad rad respectively 3 3 validation of the aqwa aerodyn coupling framework in order to validate the accuracy of the aqwa aerodyn coupling framework in predicting the aero hydro servo coupled responses of a fwt a commonly used numerical analysis tool fast is employed for comparison purposes in the comparisons between aqwa aerodyn and fast the dtu 10 mw wind turbine supported by the telwind platform is used since fast is incapable of conducting simulations of a multi body platform the telwind platform is modelled as a unibody by assuming the tendons as rigid connections in both fast and aqwa the hydrodynamic coefficients including the added mass radiation damping and excitation forces of the unibody platform required for the time domain analysis in fast are calculated using aqwa the stiffness of the fwt tower used in this study is significantly higher than the dtu reference tower s consequently the platform motions of the fwt including and excluding the tower flexibility under a regular wave condition are obtained using fast in order to evaluate the effects of tower elasticity the examined wave height and period are 1 80 m and 4 27 s respectively the current speed distribution along the water depth follows a power law profile with an exponent of 1 7 and the current speed at the msl is 0 22 m s the average wind speed of the turbulent wind field at the hub height is 9 m s the statistical results are compared in table 4 the measured platform motions of the rigid and flexible tower models are almost identical for instance the relative difference between the maximum pitch motions of the rigid and flexible tower models is 0 908 the difference between the mean surge heave and pitch motions of the rigid and flexible towers are 0 019 0 024 and 0 898 respectively which are smaller than 1 the difference in the standard deviations of the platform motions are also negligible the comparison indicates that the platform motions of this particular fwt concept are not significantly affected by the tower flexibility the plausible reason is that this large diameter tower is not necessarily flexible since the bending stiffness of the tower is very large the tower base stiffness of this fwt is over 6 times larger than the stiffness of the dtu reference tower in addition the natural frequencies of the 1st order and 2nd order fore aft bending modes of the tower are 0 46 hz and 2 41 hz respectively which are out of the excitation frequency range of the examined wave condition as a result the platform motions are insensitive to the tower elasticity for the examined wave condition in order to ensure the consistency of the models in the validation between aqwa aerodyn and fast the tower and blades are modelled as rigid elements in the fast simulation a regular wave is used since the process of generating an irregular wave in aqwa and fast is different in order to confirm that the torque pitch controller and aerodyn have been well integrated within aqwa fig 6 presents the rotor thrust generation power and rotor speed of the fwt predicted by fast and aqwa aerodyn under the aforementioned loadings it is observed that the rotor speed and generator power obtained using aqwa aerodyn are almost the same as the results calculated by fast it implies that the servo control ability is well implemented within aqwa aerodyn for dynamic analysis of fwts similarly the rotor thrust predicted by aqwa aerodyn follows the same trend as the result of fast the difference in magnitude between the results calculated in these two tools is negligible this indicates that aerodyn has been well integrated with aqwa for performing aero hydro servo analysis of fwts the coupled platform responses due to the wind wave current loadings are calculated by aqwa aerodyn and fast and then compared in fig 7 in the simulation performed using fast the feamooring module is adopted to examine the dynamics of mooring lines it can be seen that the platform surge from aqwa aerodyn follows the same variation trend as the results of fast over the entire simulation the platform surge motions predicted by these two tools fluctuate within a similar range although slight differences are observed before the completion of the transient behaviour the average surge motions between 1500 s and 4500 s predicted by fast and aqwa aerodyn are 29 0 m and 29 8 m respectively the corresponding standard deviations are 6 93 m and 7 14 m respectively meaning that the relative error is around 3 0 although both aqwa and the feamooring module in fast employ the finite element method to examine the dynamics of the mooring lines a slight difference exists in their implementations in feamooring the hydrodynamic loads acting on the mooring lines are calculated based on the wave kinematics of their initial positions wendt et al 2016 however aqwa calculates the hydrodynamic loads on the mooring lines based on the wave kinematics of their actual positions in addition the slight differences between the surge motions from these two tools are also caused by the hydrodynamic loads of the platform as required by hydrodyn which is the fast module for calculating the hydrodynamic loads the vertical centre of mass of the platform is set to zero when performing the frequency domain analysis needed to obtain the added mass radiation damping and excitation forces this is done to avoid double counting of the pitch and roll restoring forces that are intrinsically considered in the elastdyn module of fast if the centre of mass of the platform is set appropriately jonkman et al 2014 consequently the excitation pitch force is smaller compared to the realistic excitation force that is obtained by setting the actual centre of mass of the platform when performing the frequency domain analysis nonetheless the overall agreement between the platform surge responses from aqwa aerodyn and fast is good better agreements between aqwa aerodyn and fast are observed in the predictions of the platform heave and pitch motions the platform heave calculated by aqwa aerodyn follows the same variation trend as the results predicted using fast since the fluctuation of vertical load on the platform is small the aqwa aerodyn slightly overestimates the heave response and this is attributed to the difference between the heave restoring forces of the mooring lines of aqwa and fast the platform pitch motion obtained using aqwa aerodyn agrees very well with the results of fast in terms of both magnitude and trends although negligible discrepancies exist the spectral responses of the platform motions are obtained and presented in fig 8 by applying the fast flourier transformation fft on the time series from 1500 s to 4500 s the spectral amplitude of the surge motion calculated by aqwa aerodyn agrees well with fast s result at the natural frequency of surge mode the heave amplitudes calculated by these two tools follow the same trend versus frequency although aqwa aerodyn obtains slightly larger predictions the overall discrepancy in the magnitude is small the agreement between the two numerical analysis tools in predicting the pitch motion is good the results have a similar spectral amplitude at the natural frequency of the pitch mode the comparisons against fast have verified the accuracy and credibility of aqwa aerodyn in predicting aero hydro servo coupled responses of fwts although some discrepancies in the surge motion are observed the overall agreements between aqwa aerodyn and fast are reasonably good for aerodynamic load calculation and servo control in addition the discrepancies in platform heave and pitch motions between the results obtained using these two tools are small the comparisons indicate that the developed aqwa aerodyn coupling framework can be used to perform dynamic analysis of the 10 mw fwt supported by the telwind multi body platform subjected to wind wave and current loadings 4 evaluation of fatigue damage the fluctuating tensions obtained from aqwa aerodyn are broken down into individual hysteresis cycles using the rainflow counting approach the fatigue damage is assumed to accumulate linearly with each of the load cycles according to miner s rule as denoted by eq 14 14 d i n i n i l i r f where d is total fatigue damage n i is the cycle count of the ith time series n i is the number of cycles to failure due to the cycle load range l i r f over a fixed load mean value according to a s n curve n i can be denoted as follows 15 n i l u l t l m f 0 5 l i r f m where l u l t is the ultimate design load of the tendon l m f denotes the fixed load mean which is calculated by aggregating all of the time series of the load cases m is the wöhler exponent in accordance with the specification of the iec standard iec 2009 for steel strands the selected s n curve has a stress of 320 mpa corresponding to 5 105 cycles and a stress of 250 mpa at 2 106 cycles resulting in a wöhler exponent of 6 in an actual situation load cycles occur over a spectrum of mean loads rather than a fixed mean load therefore the goodman correction is applied to adjust the cycle load range l i r f as shown in eq 16 16 l i r f l i r l u l t l m f l u l t l i m where l i r is the ith cycle range over the load mean l i m fig 9 presents the process of the fatigue evaluation 5 design load cases a site of the floating wind farm located at the northern coast of scotland as shown in fig 10 is examined based on the met ocean data observed from 2011 to 2016 ifremer 2020 the probability of a wind speed associated with the significant wave height and peak spectral period is obtained fig 11 presents the probability of the wind speed distribution for the specific site it is noted that the wind speed is referred to the hub height and a power law profile with an exponent of 0 12 is used for calculating the wind speed based on the observed data at 10 m above the msl based on the observed met ocean data provided by ifremer 2020 the wave heights and periods corresponding to the defined wind speeds are obtained in addition the current speed distribution along the water depth follows a power law profile with an exponent of 1 7 and the current speed at the msl is 0 22 m s for each of the load cases the inflow directions of the wind wave and current are 0 see fig 3 table 5 presents the load cases defined for the fatigue analysis for both the coupled and decoupled analysis the turbulent winds are generated using turbsim jonkman and buhl 2006 based on the kaimal spectrum a power law profile with an exponent of 0 12 is used to examine the wind shear effect the irregular waves are generated based on the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum which can be found in pierson and moskowitz 1964 6 results and discussions 6 1 wind wave coupling effects on the platform motions the multi body platform is composed by two floating bodies the ut and lt which are connected by six tendons in static conditions the tendon tensions are the result of the difference of the weight and buoyancy between the ut and lt of the platform the motion difference between the ut and lt affects the tension values of the tendons therefore the fatigue damage of each tendon is significantly affected by the instant motion differences between the two tanks fig 12 presents the motion differences between the ut and lt predicted using the coupled and decoupled methods under the condition with a wind speed of 15 m s see table 5 it is noted that the first 1500 s of the analysis are truncated in order not to consider possible transient numerical analysis effects the motion differences between the two tanks obtained using the coupled model are smaller than the relevant differences obtained with the decoupled model for all six dofs the discrepancies in the surge pitch and yaw motions between the results predicted using the coupled and decoupled models are relatively larger when compared with the ones in other three motions the surge pitch and yaw motions are more sensitive to the coupling between aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads the statistics of the motion differences are presented in table 6 it is noted that the maximum surge difference obtained from the coupled analysis is 1 245 m while the corresponding value predicted using the decoupled method is 2 134 m resulting in a 71 overestimation in addition the standard deviation of the surge difference obtained using the decoupled and coupled models are 0 609 m and 0 358 m respectively it implies that an overestimation of 70 is made on surge difference if the coupling effect between aerodynamic loads and platform responses is ignored similar discrepancy between the results calculated using the coupled and decoupled methods is observed for the pitch motion the standard deviations of the motion differences are overestimated by the decoupled model it is anticipated that the tension of each tendon predicted by the decoupled method would have a larger magnitude and more severe fluctuation compared to the one obtained from the coupled method as the tensions in the tendons are significantly affected by the relative position of the two tanks 6 2 wind wave coupling effects on the tendon tension the time varying tensions of the six tendons under the condition with a wind speed of 15 m s are presented in fig 13 table 7 presents the statistics of the tension of each tendon since the wind inflow direction is aligned with the orientations of tendon 1 and tendon 4 these two tendons suffer from the most severe tension as observed from the results of the decoupled model it is noted that the tension of each tendon predicted by the decoupled model has a larger fluctuation magnitude compared to the results obtained using the coupled model for instance when comparing the results obtained using these two methods there is an overestimation in the maximum tension in tendon 1 by around 28 resulting from neglecting the coupling effect the standard deviation of the tension in tendon 1 predicted by the decoupled model is 57 larger than the relevant results of the coupled model similarly the tension in tendon 4 obtained using the decoupled model is more severe than that obtained using the coupled model the maximum magnitude and standard deviation of the tension in tendon 4 is overestimated by 19 and 62 respectively due to the absence of coupling effects of hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads this implies that the coupling effect needs to be examined in the analysis of the tendons fig 14 presents the maximum tension of each tendon predicted by the coupled and decoupled models under the 22 load cases defined in table 5 it is observed that the tension in each tendon from the decoupled analysis is larger than the corresponding result obtained using the coupled model for each of the examined load cases the absence of the coupling effects has a larger influence on the tension in tendon 1 and tendon 4 which are aligned with the wind direction it implies that the coupling effects of platform responses and aerodynamic loads lead to a smaller discrepancy between the motions of the ut and lt resulting in a smaller tension in the loading aligned tendons the standard deviations of the tension in each tendon obtained from the coupled and decoupled models are presented in fig 15 as can be seen similar to the results of the maximum tension the standard deviations of the tensions corresponding to the decoupled method are much larger than those of the coupled method the maximum mean and minimum overestimations are 227 3 43 7 and 17 1 respectively when the wind wave coupling effects are ignored this implies that the tension of the decoupled method fluctuates in a wider range consequently the external loads produce larger fatigue damage to the tendons it is anticipated that the fatigue damage predicted using the results from the decoupled method could be larger when compared to the results from the coupled method 6 3 fatigue damage assessment of the tendons 6 3 1 fatigue damage of the tendons the fatigue damage of the tendons due to wind wave and current loadings is evaluated based on the results obtained using the coupled and decoupled models in order to avoid the impact of the transient behaviour on the platform when considering its low natural frequency the first 1500 s of each time series are ignored in the fatigue damage evaluation the accumulated fatigue damage in 25 years for each tendon based on the design load case is presented in fig 16 as can be seen the decoupled method overestimates the fatigue damage by dozens of times for each examined case more specifically the accumulated fatigue damage of tendon 1 predicted by the coupled method is around 2 77 10 2 for the load case with a wind speed of 15 m s whereas the corresponding value of the decoupled method is 5 28 10 1 which is 19 times larger compared to the coupled method this is mainly because the larger fluctuation range of the decoupled method causes more stress damage under the same load cycles it further indicates that the coupling effect of wind and wave must be considered for a fatigue analysis the accumulated damage in 25 years and the lifetime of the tendons are presented in table 8 as predicted using the results from the coupled method all of the tendons are able to operate in the specific site for over 37 years however the fatigue evaluation using the results of the decoupled method is found to be too conservative fatigue damage would be overestimated by a factor of more than 15 leading to an unrealistic failure in tendon 1 and tendon 4 within 5 years due to fatigue this comparison emphasizes that the coupling effect of wind and wave must be considered for the fatigue analysis of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine supported by the telwind multi body platform due to the huge difference predicted 6 3 2 influence of numerical simulation length this particular fwt has large natural periods hence the simulation length is suggested to be larger than 1 h in order to cover every potential wave period and height kvittem and moan 2015 it is noted that the examined wind turbine is subject to combined loadings of wind and wave the turbulent wind and irregular wave both have different magnitudes over the simulation the effect of high ranges cannot be captured in short length simulations this implies that simulation length may have a notable influence on the fatigue evaluation however the modelling of coupled environmental loadings for a fwt is a challenging work requiring significant computational resources for a fatigue analysis for instance this study conducted all the simulations at a workstation with 8 intel xeon 3 30 ghz cores taking around 8 h to complete one coupled simulation using aqwa incorporated with aerodyn in order to reduce the computational resource on the premise of accuracy of for the fatigue analysis this study has calculated fatigue damages of the tendons for 7 different simulation lengths fig 17 presents the accumulated damages over 25 years of the tendons that are evaluated based on the results with different simulation lengths for each of the examined simulation lengths a 1500 s transient period is considered in addition the relative differences in the results of the 3 h length are presented as can be seen significant difference is observed between the results of different effective simulation length analyses more specifically there is over 20 discrepancy between the 1 h length and the 3 h length for tendon 1 it implies that simulation length affects the accuracy of fatigue evaluation as the effect of simulation length increases the damages converges towards the result of the 3 h length analysis for the 6000 s length results the relative differences in fatigue of 4 out of the 6 tendons are below 10 except for tendon 1 and tendon 4 for the 8400 s length results the relative differences between the tendons are smaller than 10 in this regard around 20 computational resources can be saved 7 conclusions this study presented a fatigue analysis of the tendons that connect the upper and lower tanks of a multi body 10 mw fwt whose integrity determines the safety and stability of the platform an aero hydro servo coupled analysis tool based on aqwa and aerodyn is developed through a user defined dll to conduct numerical simulations of the fwt supported by a multi body platform the accuracy and credibility of the aqwa aerodyn coupling framework in predicting dynamic responses of the fwt is validated by comparing it with fast based on the observed met ocean data of the selected site at the northern coast of scotland 22 load cases are defined for a fatigue analysis the dynamic responses of the fwt under each of the load cases are examined and compared using the coupled model and a decoupled model respectively the wind wave coupling effects on the fatigue damage of each tendon is quantitatively evaluated based on the time domain results of the coupled and decoupled methods the results have confirmed the application feasibility of the telwind multi body platform for supporting the dtu10 mw reference wind turbine in addition the influence of the effective simulation length on the fatigue damage is investigated and discussed the main conclusions of this study are presented as follows a generic aero hydro servo coupling tool is developed based on aqwa and aerodyn the agreement between the results obtained using the developed tool and fast are reasonably good indicating that a valid numerical tool capable of performing a wind wave coupled analysis of a fwt supported by a multi body platform has been developed neglecting the wind wave coupling effect enhances the motion differences between the two tanks of the platform consequently this increases the tension fluctuation in the tendons by 43 the accumulated fatigue damage of each tendon during its design lifetime is overestimated by over 67 when the wind wave coupling effects are not examined it reduces the fatigue life estimation of each tendon by over 20 years from current design practice the effective length of the simulations has a significant influence on the fatigue damage prediction the simulation length must be longer than 8400 s for the fatigue analysis of the multi body platform

21407,this study investigates the wind wave coupling effects on fatigue damage of tendons that connect multiple bodies of a novel floating platform telwind supporting a 10 mw wind turbine an aero hydro servo tool is developed for dynamic analysis of a multi body floating wind turbine fwt platform by incorporating aerodyn with aqwa through a user defined dynamic library link dll to conduct simulations of the fwt subjected to wind wave and current loadings the comparison against fast has validated the accuracy of the aqwa aerodyn coupling framework in predicting coupled responses of the fwt a specific site in the northern coast of scotland is selected and design load cases are examined for the estimation of the fatigue damage of the tendons of the fwt in the absence of wind wave coupling the motion differences between the two bodies of the platform are larger leading to 43 7 enhancement in the tension fluctuation of tendons in average consequently the fatigue damage of the tendons is significantly overestimated also the investigation on the influence of effective simulation length on the fatigue damage shows that 90 accuracy can be achieved when 20 of the simulation analysis length is decreased keywords multi body platform floating wind turbines arcwind aero hydro servo coupled method fatigue analysis tendons 1 introduction the technology of offshore wind energy extraction is continuing to receive more attention due to its maturity abundance of offshore wind reserves and the role of wind energy as an alternative to fossil fuels it is expected that no less than 55 gw of wind turbines would be installed each year until 2023 gwec 2019 one of the main goals of recent studies on offshore wind energy utilization has been to reduce the levelized cost of electricity lcoe with the increase of wind turbine scale the up front costs are decreased through economies of scale and reduced plant costs on a per megawatt basis the performance of large scale wind turbines with taller towers and longer blades is better than that of small wind turbines in addition large scale offshore wind turbines offer the advantage of reduced frequency of transportation installation and maintenance related activities in combination these trends have reduced the lcoe of an offshore wind farm made of large wind turbines wiser et al 2016 compared to a fixed bottom type the floating type is more suitable for large scale 10 mw offshore wind generation applications because it can operate in deeper seas where more abundant wind resources exist the past decade has witnessed the developments of numerous floating platform concepts for wind turbines statoil developed a spar buoy in the hywind project for the world first full scale fwt in 2009 this was followed by the modification of the hywind spar buoy by national renewable energy laboratory nrel to support the nrel 5 mw wind turbine in the offshore code comparison collaboration oc3 project sponsored by the international energy agency iea in 2010 jonkman 2010 the oc3 spar platform has been extensively used in various studies for further development of offshore wind energy system karimirad and moan 2011 yu et al 2015 yue et al 2020 in addition nrel developed a semi submersible platform in the subsequent deepcwind project robertson et al 2014 and a tension leg platform tlp based on the massachusetts institute of technology design concept matha 2010 as part of the oc4 and oc5 projects respectively three 1 50th scaled models of the nrel s spar semi submersible and tlp were tested in different environmental conditions to provide sufficient experimental data for validating the numerical analysis tools of floating wind turbines fwts goupee et al 2012 dynamic responses of the nrel s spar tlp and a barge vijfhuizen 2006 supporting the nrel 5 mw wind turbine were compared quantitatively however the capacity of wind turbines supported by aforementioned floating platforms were limited to 5 mw it is noted that the offshore applications of higher capacity wind turbines 10 mw have been the focus of research in the recent years due to their high potentials in reducing lcoe bak et al 2012 velarde 2016 of fwts in deep sea areas european union eu has been at the forefront in funding some pioneering projects in developing floating platforms for 10 mw class wind turbines for instance the innwind project azcona et al 2017 proposed a semi submersible concept for the dtu technical university of denmark 10 mw wind turbine hydrodynamic performance of the platform was investigated the life50 project yu et al 2017 has developed four floating concepts for 10 mw wind turbines including two semi submersible platforms made of concrete and steel a concrete barge platform and a steel tlp hawc2 and fast were used as the numerical analysis tools to conduct the coupled analysis after comparisons against wave tank experiments comprehensively more recently a free float capable tlp uzunoglu and soares 2020 was developed in the arcwind project for 10 mw wind turbines the hydrodynamic performance of the platform under operational and 50 year extreme conditions was evaluated and the results verified the survivability of the structure in addition the arcwind project employed a novel two body spar floating platform called telwind platform developed by esteyco armesto et al 2018 for 10 mw fwts applications the telwind platform consists of two concrete tanks an upper tank ut which provides buoyancy and a ballasting lower tank lt providing pitch stability the ut and the lt are connected by 6 tendons which are designed to always be in tension to ensure a low centre of gravity cog of the platform as shown in fig 1 it is apparent that the safety and stability of the fwt significantly depend on the integrity of the tendons therefore it is imperative to conduct fatigue assessment of the tendons for this particular platform as revealed in the recent studies wen et al 2017 2019 antonutti et al 2016 liu et al 2017 dai et al 2018 cheng et al 2019 dynamic responses of a fwt are affected by the interactions between aerodynamic loads and hydrodynamic loads therefore the wind wave coupling effect must be taken into account when evaluating fatigue life of the multi body platform tendons it is noted that the commonly used numerical tools have limitations in their capability to examine the dynamic responses of a multi body floating platform connected by flexible elements in order to address these limitations this study has developed a coupled numerical method for multi body floating platforms by incorporating aerodyn with aqwa through a user defined dll the developed generic numerical method is applied for fatigue analysis of the tendons of the multi body platform after validating against fast the design load cases for the fatigue assessment are defined according to the observed met ocean data during the period from 2011 to 2016 in a specified site off the northern coast of scotland a comparative analysis of fatigue damage of the tendons between the coupled method and decoupled method analysis is performed in order to quantitatively evaluate the wind wave coupling effects for the coupled method the responses of the wind turbine due to wind wave and current excitations are coupled through the user defined dll while for the decoupled method the aerodynamic loads of the wind turbine are calculated independently of the platform motions and are then used together with hydrodynamic loads for solving the equation of motion in time domain based on the time domain results obtained from both the coupled and decoupled analysis fatigue damage of each of the tendons is predicted in accordance with the international electrotechnical commission iec standard iec 2009 the wind wave coupling effects on the fatigue damage of the tendons of the telwind multi body platform are determined and discussed in addition the influence of the simulation duration is examined and quantified using the coupled method 2 wind turbine model 2 1 dtu 10 mw baseline wind turbine dtu developed a reference 10 mw wind turbine in collaboration with vestas in the light rotor project bak et al 2012 the three bladed wind turbine has been classed as an iec class 1 a wind climate with a rated wind speed of 11 4 m s a simple nacelle and a drivetrain were also designed for the dtu baseline wind turbine due to availability of the detailed aerodynamic shape and structural properties in public domain the dtu 10 mw wind turbine has been widely used for the development of various offshore support structures table 1 presents a summary of design parameters of the dtu reference wind turbine it is noted that the fwt supported by the multi body platform has the same hub height as the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine 2 2 description of the 10 mw multi body model the telwind model is originally developed by esteyco for the floating application of offshore wind turbines the floating platform consists of two bodies ut and lt connected by six tendons the ut is designed to provide buoyancy while the lt is for ballasting to ensure stability of the whole wind turbine system the two bodies are made of concrete in order to reduce the cost a telescopic tower is incorporated in the platform to ease the transport and installation processes the tower consists of three sections a topmost steel section that directly supports the turbine and two lower sections made of concrete it is noted that the tower has a much higher bending stiffness compared to the dtu reference tower more specifically the tower base bending stiffness of the telwind concept is 1 30 1013 n m2 while the bending stiffness of the 10 mw dtu reference tower at the base is 1 77 1012 n m2 fig 2 presents a schematic diagram of the 10 mw multi body wind turbine which is applicable to 110 m water depth areas or deeper seas with appropriate modifications on mooring lines configuration the ut is 10 m below the mean sea level msl with a draught of 16 75 m the lt has a draught of 22 5 m and the total draught of the combined structure is 92 25 m the diameters of ut and lt are 44 5 m and 23 0 m respectively each of the tendons has a length of 48 81 m and an equivalent diameter of 0 271 m in aqwa each tendon is modelled as a catenary fig 3 presents the orientations of the tendons and mooring lines there are 6 and 3 connection points for the tendons on the ut and lt respectively the ut tendon connection points distribute uniformly around the circumference of the bottom surface the fairleads of the mooring lines are attached on the top surface of the ut each of the mooring lines has an unstretched length of 620 m and a wet weight of 250 kg m the coordinates of the connection points of the tendons and mooring lines are presented in table 2 by conducting free decay analysis of the moored fwt in all six degrees of freedom natural periods and frequencies of the platform in the six degrees of freedom dofs are obtained and presented in table 3 3 coupling between aqwa and aerodyn 3 1 development of the coupling framework fast is an excellent multi physical engineering tool that is commonly used for coupled analysis of fwts however in its current form fast is incapable of examining the coupled effects of a multi body platform connected by flexile elements especially when the focus is the connection element it is noted that aqwa is capable of performing frequency domain and time domain analyses of offshore and marine structures with multiple floaters although the baseline version of aqwa is not capable of calculating aerodynamic loads of fwts it accepts external forces calculated by a user defined dll at each time step of the time domain analysis therefore aqwa becomes a suitable option in this study as the numerical tool after modifying its built in dll to make it capable of handling servo control and predicting aerodynamic loads of a multi body fwt consequently a coupling framework presented in fig 4 is developed and implemented by incorporating aerodyn in aqwa after modifying its source code the calculation procedure of the aerodynamic loads in every time step is coupled with the floating platform dynamic responses to be more specifically the relative speed between the rotor and inflow wind is affected by the platform surge and pitch rotation velocities at each time step of the simulation in aqwa the relative wind speed is calculated by 1 v rel v in v s ω p h hub h cog where v rel is the relative wind speed v in is the inflow wind speed v s and ω p are the surge velocity and pitch velocity of the platform respectively h hub is the hub height and h cog is the distance of ut s cog to the msl in addition a transformation matrix t mat is applied to correct the rotor coordinates due to the platform rotational motions the corrected coordinates x y z of a rotor point x 0 y 0 z 0 is given as 2 x y z θ 1 2 1 s θ 2 2 θ 3 2 s 1 s θ 3 s θ 1 θ 2 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 2 s θ 1 θ 3 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 3 s θ 1 θ 2 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 2 2 1 s θ 1 2 θ 3 2 s 1 s θ 1 s θ 2 θ 3 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 2 s θ 1 θ 3 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 1 s θ 2 θ 3 1 s 1 s 1 s θ 3 2 1 s θ 1 2 θ 2 2 s 1 s x 0 y 0 z 0 where θ 1 θ 2 and θ 3 are the roll pitch and yaw displacements of the platform respectively s is the sum of squares of each rotation equal to θ 1 2 θ 2 2 θ 3 2 during the time domain simulation in aqwa aerodyn is invoked at each time step to calculate aerodynamic loads of the wind turbine based on the operational parameters including the rotor speed blade pitch tilt angle and yaw angle the generalized dynamic wake model gdw is used to examine the dynamic inflow effects of the wind turbine the force vector obtained by aerodyn through the dll is applied at the hub height of the wind turbine the dynamic responses of the platform subjected to the coupled loadings at the next time step are then calculated in aqwa the equation of motion of each of the ut and lt is given below 3 m a wv x t c x t kx t 0 t h t τ x τ d τ f h t f t t f e t where m is the inertial mass matrix of the platform a wv is the hydrodynamic added mass matrix k and c are respectively the total stiffness and damping matrices x t x t and x t are respectively the displacement velocity and acceleration vectors of the platform h t is the impulse function matrix used to examine the hydrodynamic radiation memory effects as denoted in eq 4 f h t and f t t are respectively the hydrodynamic and mooring load vectors acting on the platform f e t is the external force vector obtained through the dll 4 h t 2 π 0 b ω sin ω t ω d ω where b ω is the radiation damping and ω is the wave frequency the added mass radiation damping and excitation forces of both the ut and lt are calculated in aqwa by performing a frequency domain analysis based on the potential theory each mooring line is modelled as a dynamic catenary the inertial effects of the mooring line and the platform motions are considered in predicting the mooring tensions it is noted that the external force of the lt is zero while the external force acting on the ut is calculated using the dll the aerodynamic loads acting on the hub obtained through the dll are referenced to the ut s local coordinate system and the external force item in eq 3 is applied at the ut s centre of mass and referenced to the inertial coordinate system therefore aerodynamic loads directly obtained through the dll are converted using eq 5 and eq 6 before being passed into the aqwa solver for solving the equation of motion 5 f aqwa t mat 1 f dll 6 m aqwa t mat 1 m dll hub cog f dll where f aqwa and f dll are the translational force vectors in the aqwa solver and dll respectively t mat 1 is the inverse matrix of t mat m aqwa used in aqwa is the moment vector acting at the ut s centre of mass with respect to the inertial coordinate system m dll obtained in the dll is the moment vector acting at the hub height with respect to the platform s local coordinate system hub and cog are the position vectors of the hub and the ut respectively 3 2 implementation of the torque pitch controller in order to examine the start up procedure and normal power production cases a torque pitch controller is developed and integrated with the aqwa aerodyn coupling interface to adjust the rotor speed and blade pitch the torque pitch controller consists of a simple partial load controller and a proportional integral pi controller the partial load controller defines the relationship between desired torque and speed of the generator when the output power is smaller than the rated power the pi controller takes over to adjust blade pitch once the output power exceeds the rated power referring to the basic algorithm applied for a 5 mw wind turbine jonkman et al 2009 the torque speed variation is divided into 5 regions as shown in fig 5 region 1 corresponds to the start up process of the wind turbine the generator torque remains 0 until the rotor speed exceeds the minimum speed 6 0 rpm region 1 1 2 is a transitional region where the generator will be accelerated to reach the minimum speed at region 2 that is the control region with an optimal efficiency to capture wind energy as the wind turbine operates under the best tip speed ratio tsr the generator torque is proportional to the square of the generator speed in this region region 2 1 2 is used to limit the minimum generator speed at rated power and the maximum blade tip speed due to noise emission in region 3 the wind turbine outputs the rated power constantly implying that the generator speed is inverse to the torque for the dtu 10 mw wind turbine the minimum rotor speed is 6 0 rpm and the gearbox ratio is 50 implying that the starting limit of region 1 1 2 is 300 0 rpm the starting and ending limits of region 2 are chosen as 123 of the minimum generator speed and 95 of the rated generator speed respectively by assuming that the generator power at 480 rpm is 10 mw with an efficiency of 94 4 jonkman et al 2009 generator torques corresponding to 368 rpm and 456 rpm are 141 kn m and 210 kn m respectively in order to avoid excessive overloading in region 3 the saturated torque is set as 10 above the rated capacity and the maximum torque ratio is 75 kn m s in region 3 the pitch controller is activated to adjust blade pitch angle for moderating structural loads and cutting off excess power the adjustment of blade pitch is determined by aerodynamic power which is influenced by rotor speed therefore the pitch control is implemented through the developed pi model of rotor speed and blade pitch the drivetrain system which consists of the rotor and the generator can be treated as a single dof system the equation of motion of the drivetrain system is denoted as 7 t r n g t g i r n g 2 i g d ω 0 δ ω d t i g t δ ω where t r is rotor torque and t g is generator torque n g is gearbox ratio i r and i g are the rotor inertia and generator inertia respectively ω 0 and δ ω are the rated rotor speed and rotor speed perturbation during d t respectively i g t is the drivetrain inertia and δ ω is rotor acceleration perturbation the blade pitch error δ θ can be denoted in a pi form as 8 δ θ k p n g δ ω k i 0 t n g δ ω d t where k p and k i are the proportional gain and integral gain respectively which are denoted as 9 k p 2 i g t ω 0 ξ ϕ ω ϕ n n g p θ 10 k i i g t ω 0 ω ϕ n 2 n g p θ where ω ϕ n and ξ ϕ are the frequency and damping ratio of the controller the frequency and damping ratio of the basic pitch controller developed by dtu for the 10 mw reference wind turbine are 0 377 rad s and 0 7 respectively bak et al 2013 by calculating the aerodynamic power at different blade pitch angles the sensitivity of power to pitch p θ can be obtained as the p θ varies considerably with blade pitch over region 3 hansen and henriksen 2013 constant k p and k i are insufficient to adjust blade pitch effectively therefore an adjustment coefficient η θ is used to correct k p and k i at different blade pitch angles 11 k p θ k p 0 η θ 12 k i θ k i 0 η θ where k p θ and k i θ are the proportional and integral gains at blade pitch θ respectively k p 0 and k i 0 are the proportional and integral gains at zero blade pitch respectively as given in the dtu basic controller report the pi gains at zero blade pitch are 0 010490 rad s rad and 0 002824 rad rad respectively hansen and henriksen 2013 the adjustment coefficient η θ is given as 13 η 1 1 θ ψ 1 θ 2 ψ 2 where ψ 1 and ψ 2 are 3 46 rad and 0 21 rad2 respectively the controller frequency is designed as 0 377 rad s which is larger than the roll pitch natural frequency of the multi body platform see table 3 in order to avoid potential resonant response of roll pitch motion the controller frequency is detuned by 4 times to 0 094 rad s the proportional and integral gains at zero blade pitch are 0 002622425 rad s rad and 0 00017654 rad rad respectively 3 3 validation of the aqwa aerodyn coupling framework in order to validate the accuracy of the aqwa aerodyn coupling framework in predicting the aero hydro servo coupled responses of a fwt a commonly used numerical analysis tool fast is employed for comparison purposes in the comparisons between aqwa aerodyn and fast the dtu 10 mw wind turbine supported by the telwind platform is used since fast is incapable of conducting simulations of a multi body platform the telwind platform is modelled as a unibody by assuming the tendons as rigid connections in both fast and aqwa the hydrodynamic coefficients including the added mass radiation damping and excitation forces of the unibody platform required for the time domain analysis in fast are calculated using aqwa the stiffness of the fwt tower used in this study is significantly higher than the dtu reference tower s consequently the platform motions of the fwt including and excluding the tower flexibility under a regular wave condition are obtained using fast in order to evaluate the effects of tower elasticity the examined wave height and period are 1 80 m and 4 27 s respectively the current speed distribution along the water depth follows a power law profile with an exponent of 1 7 and the current speed at the msl is 0 22 m s the average wind speed of the turbulent wind field at the hub height is 9 m s the statistical results are compared in table 4 the measured platform motions of the rigid and flexible tower models are almost identical for instance the relative difference between the maximum pitch motions of the rigid and flexible tower models is 0 908 the difference between the mean surge heave and pitch motions of the rigid and flexible towers are 0 019 0 024 and 0 898 respectively which are smaller than 1 the difference in the standard deviations of the platform motions are also negligible the comparison indicates that the platform motions of this particular fwt concept are not significantly affected by the tower flexibility the plausible reason is that this large diameter tower is not necessarily flexible since the bending stiffness of the tower is very large the tower base stiffness of this fwt is over 6 times larger than the stiffness of the dtu reference tower in addition the natural frequencies of the 1st order and 2nd order fore aft bending modes of the tower are 0 46 hz and 2 41 hz respectively which are out of the excitation frequency range of the examined wave condition as a result the platform motions are insensitive to the tower elasticity for the examined wave condition in order to ensure the consistency of the models in the validation between aqwa aerodyn and fast the tower and blades are modelled as rigid elements in the fast simulation a regular wave is used since the process of generating an irregular wave in aqwa and fast is different in order to confirm that the torque pitch controller and aerodyn have been well integrated within aqwa fig 6 presents the rotor thrust generation power and rotor speed of the fwt predicted by fast and aqwa aerodyn under the aforementioned loadings it is observed that the rotor speed and generator power obtained using aqwa aerodyn are almost the same as the results calculated by fast it implies that the servo control ability is well implemented within aqwa aerodyn for dynamic analysis of fwts similarly the rotor thrust predicted by aqwa aerodyn follows the same trend as the result of fast the difference in magnitude between the results calculated in these two tools is negligible this indicates that aerodyn has been well integrated with aqwa for performing aero hydro servo analysis of fwts the coupled platform responses due to the wind wave current loadings are calculated by aqwa aerodyn and fast and then compared in fig 7 in the simulation performed using fast the feamooring module is adopted to examine the dynamics of mooring lines it can be seen that the platform surge from aqwa aerodyn follows the same variation trend as the results of fast over the entire simulation the platform surge motions predicted by these two tools fluctuate within a similar range although slight differences are observed before the completion of the transient behaviour the average surge motions between 1500 s and 4500 s predicted by fast and aqwa aerodyn are 29 0 m and 29 8 m respectively the corresponding standard deviations are 6 93 m and 7 14 m respectively meaning that the relative error is around 3 0 although both aqwa and the feamooring module in fast employ the finite element method to examine the dynamics of the mooring lines a slight difference exists in their implementations in feamooring the hydrodynamic loads acting on the mooring lines are calculated based on the wave kinematics of their initial positions wendt et al 2016 however aqwa calculates the hydrodynamic loads on the mooring lines based on the wave kinematics of their actual positions in addition the slight differences between the surge motions from these two tools are also caused by the hydrodynamic loads of the platform as required by hydrodyn which is the fast module for calculating the hydrodynamic loads the vertical centre of mass of the platform is set to zero when performing the frequency domain analysis needed to obtain the added mass radiation damping and excitation forces this is done to avoid double counting of the pitch and roll restoring forces that are intrinsically considered in the elastdyn module of fast if the centre of mass of the platform is set appropriately jonkman et al 2014 consequently the excitation pitch force is smaller compared to the realistic excitation force that is obtained by setting the actual centre of mass of the platform when performing the frequency domain analysis nonetheless the overall agreement between the platform surge responses from aqwa aerodyn and fast is good better agreements between aqwa aerodyn and fast are observed in the predictions of the platform heave and pitch motions the platform heave calculated by aqwa aerodyn follows the same variation trend as the results predicted using fast since the fluctuation of vertical load on the platform is small the aqwa aerodyn slightly overestimates the heave response and this is attributed to the difference between the heave restoring forces of the mooring lines of aqwa and fast the platform pitch motion obtained using aqwa aerodyn agrees very well with the results of fast in terms of both magnitude and trends although negligible discrepancies exist the spectral responses of the platform motions are obtained and presented in fig 8 by applying the fast flourier transformation fft on the time series from 1500 s to 4500 s the spectral amplitude of the surge motion calculated by aqwa aerodyn agrees well with fast s result at the natural frequency of surge mode the heave amplitudes calculated by these two tools follow the same trend versus frequency although aqwa aerodyn obtains slightly larger predictions the overall discrepancy in the magnitude is small the agreement between the two numerical analysis tools in predicting the pitch motion is good the results have a similar spectral amplitude at the natural frequency of the pitch mode the comparisons against fast have verified the accuracy and credibility of aqwa aerodyn in predicting aero hydro servo coupled responses of fwts although some discrepancies in the surge motion are observed the overall agreements between aqwa aerodyn and fast are reasonably good for aerodynamic load calculation and servo control in addition the discrepancies in platform heave and pitch motions between the results obtained using these two tools are small the comparisons indicate that the developed aqwa aerodyn coupling framework can be used to perform dynamic analysis of the 10 mw fwt supported by the telwind multi body platform subjected to wind wave and current loadings 4 evaluation of fatigue damage the fluctuating tensions obtained from aqwa aerodyn are broken down into individual hysteresis cycles using the rainflow counting approach the fatigue damage is assumed to accumulate linearly with each of the load cycles according to miner s rule as denoted by eq 14 14 d i n i n i l i r f where d is total fatigue damage n i is the cycle count of the ith time series n i is the number of cycles to failure due to the cycle load range l i r f over a fixed load mean value according to a s n curve n i can be denoted as follows 15 n i l u l t l m f 0 5 l i r f m where l u l t is the ultimate design load of the tendon l m f denotes the fixed load mean which is calculated by aggregating all of the time series of the load cases m is the wöhler exponent in accordance with the specification of the iec standard iec 2009 for steel strands the selected s n curve has a stress of 320 mpa corresponding to 5 105 cycles and a stress of 250 mpa at 2 106 cycles resulting in a wöhler exponent of 6 in an actual situation load cycles occur over a spectrum of mean loads rather than a fixed mean load therefore the goodman correction is applied to adjust the cycle load range l i r f as shown in eq 16 16 l i r f l i r l u l t l m f l u l t l i m where l i r is the ith cycle range over the load mean l i m fig 9 presents the process of the fatigue evaluation 5 design load cases a site of the floating wind farm located at the northern coast of scotland as shown in fig 10 is examined based on the met ocean data observed from 2011 to 2016 ifremer 2020 the probability of a wind speed associated with the significant wave height and peak spectral period is obtained fig 11 presents the probability of the wind speed distribution for the specific site it is noted that the wind speed is referred to the hub height and a power law profile with an exponent of 0 12 is used for calculating the wind speed based on the observed data at 10 m above the msl based on the observed met ocean data provided by ifremer 2020 the wave heights and periods corresponding to the defined wind speeds are obtained in addition the current speed distribution along the water depth follows a power law profile with an exponent of 1 7 and the current speed at the msl is 0 22 m s for each of the load cases the inflow directions of the wind wave and current are 0 see fig 3 table 5 presents the load cases defined for the fatigue analysis for both the coupled and decoupled analysis the turbulent winds are generated using turbsim jonkman and buhl 2006 based on the kaimal spectrum a power law profile with an exponent of 0 12 is used to examine the wind shear effect the irregular waves are generated based on the pierson moskowitz wave spectrum which can be found in pierson and moskowitz 1964 6 results and discussions 6 1 wind wave coupling effects on the platform motions the multi body platform is composed by two floating bodies the ut and lt which are connected by six tendons in static conditions the tendon tensions are the result of the difference of the weight and buoyancy between the ut and lt of the platform the motion difference between the ut and lt affects the tension values of the tendons therefore the fatigue damage of each tendon is significantly affected by the instant motion differences between the two tanks fig 12 presents the motion differences between the ut and lt predicted using the coupled and decoupled methods under the condition with a wind speed of 15 m s see table 5 it is noted that the first 1500 s of the analysis are truncated in order not to consider possible transient numerical analysis effects the motion differences between the two tanks obtained using the coupled model are smaller than the relevant differences obtained with the decoupled model for all six dofs the discrepancies in the surge pitch and yaw motions between the results predicted using the coupled and decoupled models are relatively larger when compared with the ones in other three motions the surge pitch and yaw motions are more sensitive to the coupling between aerodynamic and hydrodynamic loads the statistics of the motion differences are presented in table 6 it is noted that the maximum surge difference obtained from the coupled analysis is 1 245 m while the corresponding value predicted using the decoupled method is 2 134 m resulting in a 71 overestimation in addition the standard deviation of the surge difference obtained using the decoupled and coupled models are 0 609 m and 0 358 m respectively it implies that an overestimation of 70 is made on surge difference if the coupling effect between aerodynamic loads and platform responses is ignored similar discrepancy between the results calculated using the coupled and decoupled methods is observed for the pitch motion the standard deviations of the motion differences are overestimated by the decoupled model it is anticipated that the tension of each tendon predicted by the decoupled method would have a larger magnitude and more severe fluctuation compared to the one obtained from the coupled method as the tensions in the tendons are significantly affected by the relative position of the two tanks 6 2 wind wave coupling effects on the tendon tension the time varying tensions of the six tendons under the condition with a wind speed of 15 m s are presented in fig 13 table 7 presents the statistics of the tension of each tendon since the wind inflow direction is aligned with the orientations of tendon 1 and tendon 4 these two tendons suffer from the most severe tension as observed from the results of the decoupled model it is noted that the tension of each tendon predicted by the decoupled model has a larger fluctuation magnitude compared to the results obtained using the coupled model for instance when comparing the results obtained using these two methods there is an overestimation in the maximum tension in tendon 1 by around 28 resulting from neglecting the coupling effect the standard deviation of the tension in tendon 1 predicted by the decoupled model is 57 larger than the relevant results of the coupled model similarly the tension in tendon 4 obtained using the decoupled model is more severe than that obtained using the coupled model the maximum magnitude and standard deviation of the tension in tendon 4 is overestimated by 19 and 62 respectively due to the absence of coupling effects of hydrodynamic and aerodynamic loads this implies that the coupling effect needs to be examined in the analysis of the tendons fig 14 presents the maximum tension of each tendon predicted by the coupled and decoupled models under the 22 load cases defined in table 5 it is observed that the tension in each tendon from the decoupled analysis is larger than the corresponding result obtained using the coupled model for each of the examined load cases the absence of the coupling effects has a larger influence on the tension in tendon 1 and tendon 4 which are aligned with the wind direction it implies that the coupling effects of platform responses and aerodynamic loads lead to a smaller discrepancy between the motions of the ut and lt resulting in a smaller tension in the loading aligned tendons the standard deviations of the tension in each tendon obtained from the coupled and decoupled models are presented in fig 15 as can be seen similar to the results of the maximum tension the standard deviations of the tensions corresponding to the decoupled method are much larger than those of the coupled method the maximum mean and minimum overestimations are 227 3 43 7 and 17 1 respectively when the wind wave coupling effects are ignored this implies that the tension of the decoupled method fluctuates in a wider range consequently the external loads produce larger fatigue damage to the tendons it is anticipated that the fatigue damage predicted using the results from the decoupled method could be larger when compared to the results from the coupled method 6 3 fatigue damage assessment of the tendons 6 3 1 fatigue damage of the tendons the fatigue damage of the tendons due to wind wave and current loadings is evaluated based on the results obtained using the coupled and decoupled models in order to avoid the impact of the transient behaviour on the platform when considering its low natural frequency the first 1500 s of each time series are ignored in the fatigue damage evaluation the accumulated fatigue damage in 25 years for each tendon based on the design load case is presented in fig 16 as can be seen the decoupled method overestimates the fatigue damage by dozens of times for each examined case more specifically the accumulated fatigue damage of tendon 1 predicted by the coupled method is around 2 77 10 2 for the load case with a wind speed of 15 m s whereas the corresponding value of the decoupled method is 5 28 10 1 which is 19 times larger compared to the coupled method this is mainly because the larger fluctuation range of the decoupled method causes more stress damage under the same load cycles it further indicates that the coupling effect of wind and wave must be considered for a fatigue analysis the accumulated damage in 25 years and the lifetime of the tendons are presented in table 8 as predicted using the results from the coupled method all of the tendons are able to operate in the specific site for over 37 years however the fatigue evaluation using the results of the decoupled method is found to be too conservative fatigue damage would be overestimated by a factor of more than 15 leading to an unrealistic failure in tendon 1 and tendon 4 within 5 years due to fatigue this comparison emphasizes that the coupling effect of wind and wave must be considered for the fatigue analysis of the dtu 10 mw reference wind turbine supported by the telwind multi body platform due to the huge difference predicted 6 3 2 influence of numerical simulation length this particular fwt has large natural periods hence the simulation length is suggested to be larger than 1 h in order to cover every potential wave period and height kvittem and moan 2015 it is noted that the examined wind turbine is subject to combined loadings of wind and wave the turbulent wind and irregular wave both have different magnitudes over the simulation the effect of high ranges cannot be captured in short length simulations this implies that simulation length may have a notable influence on the fatigue evaluation however the modelling of coupled environmental loadings for a fwt is a challenging work requiring significant computational resources for a fatigue analysis for instance this study conducted all the simulations at a workstation with 8 intel xeon 3 30 ghz cores taking around 8 h to complete one coupled simulation using aqwa incorporated with aerodyn in order to reduce the computational resource on the premise of accuracy of for the fatigue analysis this study has calculated fatigue damages of the tendons for 7 different simulation lengths fig 17 presents the accumulated damages over 25 years of the tendons that are evaluated based on the results with different simulation lengths for each of the examined simulation lengths a 1500 s transient period is considered in addition the relative differences in the results of the 3 h length are presented as can be seen significant difference is observed between the results of different effective simulation length analyses more specifically there is over 20 discrepancy between the 1 h length and the 3 h length for tendon 1 it implies that simulation length affects the accuracy of fatigue evaluation as the effect of simulation length increases the damages converges towards the result of the 3 h length analysis for the 6000 s length results the relative differences in fatigue of 4 out of the 6 tendons are below 10 except for tendon 1 and tendon 4 for the 8400 s length results the relative differences between the tendons are smaller than 10 in this regard around 20 computational resources can be saved 7 conclusions this study presented a fatigue analysis of the tendons that connect the upper and lower tanks of a multi body 10 mw fwt whose integrity determines the safety and stability of the platform an aero hydro servo coupled analysis tool based on aqwa and aerodyn is developed through a user defined dll to conduct numerical simulations of the fwt supported by a multi body platform the accuracy and credibility of the aqwa aerodyn coupling framework in predicting dynamic responses of the fwt is validated by comparing it with fast based on the observed met ocean data of the selected site at the northern coast of scotland 22 load cases are defined for a fatigue analysis the dynamic responses of the fwt under each of the load cases are examined and compared using the coupled model and a decoupled model respectively the wind wave coupling effects on the fatigue damage of each tendon is quantitatively evaluated based on the time domain results of the coupled and decoupled methods the results have confirmed the application feasibility of the telwind multi body platform for supporting the dtu10 mw reference wind turbine in addition the influence of the effective simulation length on the fatigue damage is investigated and discussed the main conclusions of this study are presented as follows a generic aero hydro servo coupling tool is developed based on aqwa and aerodyn the agreement between the results obtained using the developed tool and fast are reasonably good indicating that a valid numerical tool capable of performing a wind wave coupled analysis of a fwt supported by a multi body platform has been developed neglecting the wind wave coupling effect enhances the motion differences between the two tanks of the platform consequently this increases the tension fluctuation in the tendons by 43 the accumulated fatigue damage of each tendon during its design lifetime is overestimated by over 67 when the wind wave coupling effects are not examined it reduces the fatigue life estimation of each tendon by over 20 years from current design practice the effective length of the simulations has a significant influence on the fatigue damage prediction the simulation length must be longer than 8400 s for the fatigue analysis of the multi body platform tendons to have an accuracy of more than 90 or an error that is less than 10 credit authorship contribution statement yang yang conceptualization methodology investigation software validation data

21408,this study aims to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics of stepped and without step planing hulls by conducting experiments at nimala towing tank iran for this accomplishment total resistance trim angles and total wetted area are measured for without step hulls under various deadrise angles β and froude numbers fr moreover total resistance trim angles reattachment length as well as forebody and aftbody wetted surfaces of one step planing hulls are investigated at different longitudinal distances of the step from transom ls and froude numbers according to our lab tests total resistance total trim angle and bottom wetted area of without step planing hulls are increased by an increase in the deadrise angle the dynamic trim angle of one step planing hull is decreased by an increase in the hull velocity and longitudinal distances of the step from the transom however lower resistance is obtained for smaller longitudinal distances of the step from the transom moreover forebody aftbody and total wetted areas are increased by an increase in the longitudinal distances of the step from the transom based on the comparison between the results obtained from without step and stepped planing hulls it is found that the total wetted area of stepped planing hulls is significantly smaller than that of without step hull while greater total trim angle is achieved for stepped planing hulls compared to the without step hull keywords towing tank test planing hull transverse step wetted surface 1 introduction drag to lift ratio in high speed crafts is a major parameter to assess the hydrodynamic efficiency of planing hulls doctors 1985 drag to lift ratio in high speed crafts increases by increasing the speed of these vessels until now different strategies have been suggested to decrease the drag to lift ratio in high speed crafts among which using transverse step in the bottom of these crafts i e stepped planing hulls is considered as one of the interesting solutions flow separation at the step region is the reason for drag to lift ratio reduction in stepped planing crafts which is achieved by decreasing the bottom wetted area for other advantages of using a transverse step we can refer to more uniform bottom pressure distribution and longitudinal stability savitsky and morabito 2010 geometrical parameters of the step such as the height of the step longitudinal location of the step from the transom etc are the key parameters in the hydrodynamical performance i e drag to lift ratio trim angle wetted area and etc of stepped planing crafts under different froude numbers indeed the hydrodynamics performance of stepped planing hulls is completely related to the pattern and value of the bottom wetted surfaces which are dependent on the height of the step longitudinal location of the step from transom hull velocity etc therefore an appropriate knowledge on the bottom wetted surfaces of the stepped planing hulls compared to the without step hulls is a prerequisite to advancing their design and to obtaining high performance stepped planing craft thus in the current study the hydrodynamic characteristics and bottom wetted areas in without step and stepped planing hulls are investigated by conducting experimental towing tests various experimental numerical and analytical investigations are conducted so far to assess the hydrodynamics of planing crafts for example blount and clement 1963 experimentally studied the drag forces i e resistance and flow patterns around the planing hulls by conducting series of lab tests which are known as tmb series 62 they investigated the effects of length to beam ratio weight and longitudinal center of gravity on the resistance of without step hulls with deadrise angle of 25 according to some experimental tests on the wedge like prismatic planing hulls savitsky 1964 presented a semi empirical formulation to estimate the drag and lift forces wetted area and center of pressure as a function of hull velocity deadrise and trim of without step planing crafts gassman and kartinen 1994 experimentally investigated the effects of transverse location of the step from transom ls on the hydrodynamic performance of stepped planing craft in the calm water they conducted their test in the calm water on planing hull with one deadrise angle of 15 and step height of 0 013 m and varying ls in range of 0 495 m up to 0 799 m they found smaller resistance value for step closer to the transom the drag and lift forces in without step wedge shaped prismatic planing surface with constant deadrise angle of 20 are investigated by brizzolara and serra 2007 using cfd analysis their cfd data was in appropriate accordance with shuford 1958 theoretical and experimental study savitsky et al 2007 experimentally studied the influences of whisker spray on the drag of without step prismatic planing craft they presented a semi empirical formulation to predict the whisker spray component in drag of high speed crafts as a function of hull velocity deadrise and trim angles savitsky and morabito 2010 also proposed some empirical formulations to estimate the centerline and ¼ beam wake profiles of simple prismatic planing hulls their lab test was conducted in the calm water and for planing hulls with three different deadrise angles of 10 20 and 30 their conducted tests provide proper knowledge related to the design of one stepped planing hulls according to their bottom wetted areas in 2009 svahn 2009 analytically and numerically studied the performance of stepped planing crafts by developing the savitsky 1964 formulations he developed its formulations based on the one step planing hull with three different deadrise angles of 10 20 and 30 step height of 0 05 m and transverse location of the step from transom 2 5 m moreover makasyeyev 2009 analytically studied the cavity flow on the bottom of a stepped planing hull at the wavy condition he found that optimizing the cavitation number and angle of the step can be used for minimizing the wake amplitude of the stepped planing hulls 2d t method is one of the adopted mathematical theories to investigate the performance of a stepped planing hull niazmand bilandi et al 2018 2019 for example hydrodynamic forces and bottom pressure distribution in one step planing hulls are investigated via2d t theory mathematical method and towing tank tests by niazmand bilandi et al niazmand bilandi et al 2018b recently niazmand bilandi et al niazmand bilandi et al 2020 investigated the performance and running attitude of two swept steps planing hull by conducting experimental test with mathematical approach of 2d t theory taunton et al 2010 2011 conducted a series of experimental tests to investigate the performance of high speed crafts with constant deadrise angle of 22 5 under different static trim angles length to displacement ratios and radiuses of gyration at both calm water and wavy conditions they evaluated the resistance dynamic trim angle dynamic sinkage and wetted areas to assess the hydrodynamic performance of high speed crafts begovic and bertorello 2012 conducted a series of experimental investigation on hard chine warped hull form planing hulls they studied the resistance sinkage and wetted areas of warped hull form planing hulls under different deadrise angles and loading coefficients likewise in another experimental study in 2014 begovic et al 2014a investigated the seakeeping of hard chine warped hull form planing hulls under regular wave lee et al 2014 conducted some experimental tests to investigate the effects of step height ranging from 3 2 mm to 9 6 mm and the step location from transom ranging from 0 0032 to 1 016 m on the resistance of two step planing craft they found lower resistance in the smallest forward facing step of height and the largest aft facing step of height lotfi et al 2015 numerically simulated one step planing craft under different deadrise angles ranging from 10 up to 30 taunton et al 2010 2011validated cfd results of the resistance lift running draft dynamic trim angle and wetted area of high speed planing craft against the experimental data with good accordance seo et al 2016 experimentally studied the resistance and seakeeping in a planing craft with wave piercing and spray rails they conducted their tests in calm water and wavy condition on without step bare hull they proved that the spray rails have positive role in stabilizing the planing hulls in the wavy condition and that it has no negative effect on total resistance jiang et al 2016 experimentally and numerically investigated the hydrodynamic of trimaran planing hull under different hull speeds they calculated the resistance sinkage and trim angle of trimaran planing hulls and they found that the key role of tunnel design in trimaran hulls is to obtain an efficient planing craft hydrodynamic and fluid flow pattern i e vertical flow around one step planing hull with deadrise angle of 23 using transverse step with a height of 6 mm are experimentally and numerically studied via de marco et al de marco et al 2017 they showed that the fluid flow on the un wetted bottom surfaces has 3d complex vortices which are originated from air shedding on sides of the transverse step recently hydrodynamic of stepped planing crafts under various physical and geometrical conditions such as different weight loadings trim angles lcg distance from aft body froude numbers loni et al 2013 kazemi et al 2019 najafi et al 2019 nourghassemi et al 2019 dashtimanesh et al 2018 and different shapes of the step najafi and nowruzi 2019 are numerically and experimentally investigated by the researchers however based on the literature review we found that the details of bottom wetted surfaces gathered from the stepped planing hulls under various geometrical parameters of the step are not well known in our previous experimental study in ref najafi et al 2019b we conducted a series of towing tank tests on one step planing hulls i e with two deadrise angles of 20 and 30 three different longitudinal positions of step from transom ranging from 600 to 1100 mm and three step heights of 10 20 and 30 mm to investigate the total resistance trim angle reattachment lengths and bottom wetted areas we also formulated the bottom wetted surfaces of one step planing hull based on the reattached flow patterns the present paper is strongly linked to our previous experimental study mentioned in ref najafi et al 2019b the major purpose of the current study is to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics of stepped and without step planing hulls i e one step planing hull under different physical and geometrical conditions see table 1 by conducting a series of experimental tests for this purpose the total resistance trim angle and wetted area in without step fridsma planing craft under different deadrise angles and froude numbers are investigated then we evaluated the total resistance trim angle reattachment length of separated flow and forebody and aftbody wetted areas in one step fridsma planing craft at deadrise angle of 15 and the step height of 20 mm under different longitudinal locations of the step from the transom and froude numbers 2 experimental setup 2 1 model geometry in the present study fridsma planing hull is selected then dynamical and geometrical similarities criteria are used to choose the dimensions of the considered hull model for this purpose maximum of froude number and blockage factor are intended table 1 shows the fundamental geometrical dimensions of fridsma hull without any transverse steps i e this model is used as a basic model on which the transverse step it is installed and one step fridsma planing hull according to table 1 the blockage factor as the maximum hull model cross sectional area ax per the sectional area of the towing tank a is 0 0065 which is significantly lower than

three different parts i e forebody module aftbody module and connecting block are considered to fabricate the hull model forebody module along with the connecting block is shown in fig 1 fiberglass composite material is used for forebody module and high strength teflon is used for the connecting block likewise several movable blocks are utilized to build the aftbody module for the ability to change the height and longitudinal position of the step aftbody module is fabricated as cg block via six pvc sections for tuning the center of gravity and transom block to the assignment of ballast weights aftbody modules are illustrated in fig 2 all blocks and modules are fabricated according to the ittc tolerances proceduresrecommen 2011 afterwards the displacement weight of the hull model is

crafts are shown in fig 3 as may be seen in fig 3 the hull model bottom is transparent to permit the visual examination of bottom wetted surfaces based on the other scholars studies begovic and bertorello 2012 begovic et al 2014b the transparent bottom of the models makes accurate determination of wetted surface possible 2 2 towing test in calm water towing tests are conducted based on the ittc guidelines ittc 2002 committee 2002 at the towing tank of national iranian marine laboratory nimala with dimensions of 392 m 6 m 4 m nimala maximum carriage speed maximum capacity of the force gauge and maximum measurement range of potentiometer are 19 m s 600 n with the accuracy of force gauge equal to 0 02 of maximum force and 30 with the accuracy of potentiometer equal to 0 01 respectively according to our previous investigations najafi et al 2018a 2018b nowruzi and najafi 2019 calm water condition is selected in the water with the temperature of 293 15 k density of 1002 kg m3 and kinematic viscosity of 1 19e 6 m2 s the model is connected to the towing carriage in the longitudinal centerline lcg of the model which is 0 9 m from ap please see table 1 the schematic diagram of the towing test is presented in fig 4 the experimental setup model is also depicted in fig 5 dynamic motions of roll sway and yaw are restricted during the test while heave and pitch motions are free total resistance dynamic trim and characteristics of wetted area are measured for both without step and one step planing crafts uncertainty analysis is conducted on parameters froude number fr total trim angle τ t t a total resistance r t δ and total wetted area s w t o t a l 2 3 for both without step and one step planing hulls according to the proposed method in ref coleman and steele 1999 the maximum confidence interval 99 27 is obtained for fr of without step planing hull while minimum confidence interval 91 16 is measured for s w t o t a l 2 3 of stepped planing hull due to the presence of uncertainty sources such as spray area and flow separation we obtained the greatest uncertainty in the estimation of total wetted areas of stepped planing hulls details of uncertainty analysis are presented for the obtained experimental results in appendix 1 in the next section the experimental results of the hydrodynamics of without step and one step planing hulls are presented and discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 resistance trim angle and wetted area of without step planing hull preliminary towing test results of total resistance trim angle i e static dynamic and total and wetted area are presented for without step planing hull with deadrise angles of15 20 and 30 in table 2 in table 2 the symbol of wo s x y means without step planing hull with deadrise angle x and the case number y moreover the comparative diagrams of total resistance total trim and wetted area under different deadrise angles and froude numbers are presented in figs 6 8 respectively as can be seen in table 2 and fig 6 the total resistance is increased by an increase in the hull velocity in addition the higher total resistance is obtained by an increase in the deadrise angle for hull model with deadrise angle of 15 the porpoising phenomenon has occurred at the fr 5 30 based on table 2 and fig 7 for all deadrise angles the total trim angle is increased up to the froude number corresponding to the planing condition and then the trim angle is decreased by an increase in hull velocity due to the increase in the lift force at the aft bottom of the model moreover increasing the deadrise angle cause an increase in the total trim angle according to table 2 and fig 8 for all deadrise angles lower bottom wetted area is achieved by increasing the hull speed in addition the wetted area is increased by an increase in deadrise angle especially from 20 to 30 3 2 resistance trim angle reattachment length and wetted area of one step planing hull fig 9 shows the wetted areas at the bottom of without step and one step planing hulls as may be seen in fig 9 the reattached length of the separated flow from the step at the centerline is presented by x c l moreover the forebody wetted area as the region that is located before the transverse step and aftbody wetted area as region that is located after the transverse step are shown by s w f o r e and s w a f t respectively in the current study the reattachment lengths and bottom wetted area are measured from recorded experimental underwater images taken by camera with 720 1280 resolution and frame rate of 30 fps by solidworks the experimental results of total resistance the trim angle i e static dynamic and total reattachment lengths and wetted area are presented in table 3 for one step planing hull at two different longitudinal distances of step from the transom ls under different froude numbers in table 3 the symbol of w s x y means one step planing hull with ls x and the case number y in addition the comparative diagrams of total resistance total trim reattachment length and wetted area under different deadrise angles as well as the froude numbers are presented in fig 10 as can be seen in table 3 and fig 10 the dynamic and total trim angle is decreased by an increase in the hull velocity and in the longitudinal position of step from transom ls in addition decreasing ls is one of the strategies to minimize the total resistance according to table 3 and fig 10 x c l is increased with an increase in the hull velocity however no significant difference is achieved in x c l by changing ls based on the achieved experimental data by increasing the hull velocity in the case of ls 600 s w f o r e s w a f t and s w t o t a l are decreased which may be related to higher exit rate of the planing hull from the water by increasing the hull velocity in case of ls 800 the irregular trends on the values of the wetted areas are obtained by increasing the hull velocity also by increasing the longitudinal position of step from transom ls s w f o r e s w a f t and s w t o t a l are increased it is notable that porpoising of the planing hull has occurred for fr 5 30 and fr 6 36 at l 600 and ls 800 respectively therefore it can be concluded that the porpoising is delayed by increasing the longitudinal position of step from transom in one step planing hull formation of aftbody wetted area in case of ls 600 and fr 3 71 and ls 800 and fr 5 30 are depicted in fig 11 as can be seen in fig 11 increasing the hull velocity and ls results in an increase in the parameter of x c l while the angle of aftbody spray line is decreased for better investigation of the effects of the steps on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the planing hulls the results achieved from without step and stepped planing hulls are compared to each other to this purpose the total resistance total trim angle and total wetted area in without step planing hull at deadrise angle of15 and one step planing hulls are compared with each other in fig 12 as can be seen in fig 12 in all cases i e without step and one step planing hulls the total resistance is decreased by an increase in the hull velocity moreover the total resistance of the stepped hull is remarkably smaller than that of the without step hull the reason behind this fact is the existence of major larger bottom wetted area in case of without step hull compared to the stepped hulls see fig 12 c in fig 12 b a greater total trim angle i e with positive role to increase the lift to drag ratio is obtained for one step planing hulls in comparison with the without step hull the detailed quantitative percentage values of total resistance total trim angle and total wetted area changes obtained by adding steps to the without step hull are also tabulated in table 4 for more details about the without step planing hull and the effects of geometrical parameters of the step on the hydrodynamics characteristics of one step planing hull test cases which are representative of the maximum and minimum of total trim angle total resistance and total areas are presented in fig 13 for this purpose the present experimental data for without step and one step hulls see table 1 are evaluated with our recently published paper in ref najafi et al 2019b where we experimentally investigated one step hulls under deadrise angle 20 to 30 fr in range of 3 71 5 3 ls in the interval of 600 mm 1100 mm and hs ranging from 10 mm to 30 mm according to fig 13 maximum of total trim angle τ 5 04 is obtained for one step hull with greater hs and smaller ls while minimum of total trim angle τ 5 04 is achieved for without step hull with β 15 at fr 0 53 the maximum of non dimensional total resistance rt δ 0 54 is measured for without step hull with β 30 at fr 7 42 while maximum of total resistance rt δ 0 28 is achieved for one step planing hulls as illustrated in fig 13 c total wetted are of one step planing hulls is remarkably decreased compared to without step hulls the maximum of the forebody wetted area is obtained for one step hull with the largest deadrise angle β 30 while the maximum of the aftbody wetted area is achieved for one step hull with the smallest step height hs 10 mm as can be seen in fig 13 the minimum of the wetted area doesn t necessarily mean a minimum of the total resistance it is also notable that the stepped planing hull is not strictly specified via drag reduction indeed an increase in the hydrodynamic lift to drag ratio at high speeds and the reduction of the bottom wetted areas due to flow separation are the main characteristics of the stepped hulls savitsky and morabito 2010 de marco et al 2017 in order to achieve more comprehensive conclusion we need more lab tests in a wider range of geometrical parameters of the step for both one and multi stepped planing hulls 4 conclusion an appropriate understanding of the effects of geometrical parameters of the step in the stepped planing hulls hydrodynamics has a significant role in developing their design this study aims to assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of without step and stepped planing hulls experimentally therefore the total resistance trim angle reattachment lengths and forebody and aftbody wetted areas are measured at different deadrise angles β longitudinal distance of the step from transom ls and hull velocities fr based on the obtained experimental data the total resistance for the planing hull without a step is increased by an increase in the deadrise angle and hull velocities by increasing the hull velocity the total trim angle in without step hull initially increased until the planing condition started and then decreased while a greater trim angle is achieved via increasing the deadrise angle moreover lower wetted area in without step hull is obtained at higher hull velocities and lower deadrise angle porpoising phenomenon is also occurred at fr 5 30 for without step planing hull in the case of one step planing hulls the total trim angle is decreased by increasing the hull velocity and longitudinal position of step from transom the total resistance in one step planing hull is also decreased by reducing the longitudinal position of step from transom by increasing the hull velocity x c l is increased while the parameter of ls has an insignificant effect on the x c l in addition forebody aftbody and total wetted areas are increased by increasing the longitudinal position of step from transom while irregular trends on the wetted areas are achieved by increasing the hull velocity the lab results show delay in porpoising when increasing the longitudinal position of step from transom for one step planing hull based on the comparison between the results achieved form without step planing hull and stepped planing hulls it is found that the total resistance of the stepped hulls is remarkably smaller i e up to 32 84 less at fr 5 3 for one step with ls 800 than that of the without step hull greater total trim angle i e up to 24 93 greater at fr 4 24 for one step with ls 600 is obtained for one step planing hull compared to the without step hull the total wetted area of one stepped planing hull is significantly smaller i e up to 119 83 less at fr 4 24 for one step with ls 600 than that of the without step hull finally we presented the planing hulls which are representative of the minimum and maximum of the total resistance trim angle and wetted areas in without step and one step planing hulls by comparing the current study data with our recently published experimental data

21408,this study aims to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics of stepped and without step planing hulls by conducting experiments at nimala towing tank iran for this accomplishment total resistance trim angles and total wetted area are measured for without step hulls under various deadrise angles β and froude numbers fr moreover total resistance trim angles reattachment length as well as forebody and aftbody wetted surfaces of one step planing hulls are investigated at different longitudinal distances of the step from transom ls and froude numbers according to our lab tests total resistance total trim angle and bottom wetted area of without step planing hulls are increased by an increase in the deadrise angle the dynamic trim angle of one step planing hull is decreased by an increase in the hull velocity and longitudinal distances of the step from the transom however lower resistance is obtained for smaller longitudinal distances of the step from the transom moreover forebody aftbody and total wetted areas are increased by an increase in the longitudinal distances of the step from the transom based on the comparison between the results obtained from without step and stepped planing hulls it is found that the total wetted area of stepped planing hulls is significantly smaller than that of without step hull while greater total trim angle is achieved for stepped planing hulls compared to the without step hull keywords towing tank test planing hull transverse step wetted surface 1 introduction drag to lift ratio in high speed crafts is a major parameter to assess the hydrodynamic efficiency of planing hulls doctors 1985 drag to lift ratio in high speed crafts increases by increasing the speed of these vessels until now different strategies have been suggested to decrease the drag to lift ratio in high speed crafts among which using transverse step in the bottom of these crafts i e stepped planing hulls is considered as one of the interesting solutions flow separation at the step region is the reason for drag to lift ratio reduction in stepped planing crafts which is achieved by decreasing the bottom wetted area for other advantages of using a transverse step we can refer to more uniform bottom pressure distribution and longitudinal stability savitsky and morabito 2010 geometrical parameters of the step such as the height of the step longitudinal location of the step from the transom etc are the key parameters in the hydrodynamical performance i e drag to lift ratio trim angle wetted area and etc of stepped planing crafts under different froude numbers indeed the hydrodynamics performance of stepped planing hulls is completely related to the pattern and value of the bottom wetted surfaces which are dependent on the height of the step longitudinal location of the step from transom hull velocity etc therefore an appropriate knowledge on the bottom wetted surfaces of the stepped planing hulls compared to the without step hulls is a prerequisite to advancing their design and to obtaining high performance stepped planing craft thus in the current study the hydrodynamic characteristics and bottom wetted areas in without step and stepped planing hulls are investigated by conducting experimental towing tests various experimental numerical and analytical investigations are conducted so far to assess the hydrodynamics of planing crafts for example blount and clement 1963 experimentally studied the drag forces i e resistance and flow patterns around the planing hulls by conducting series of lab tests which are known as tmb series 62 they investigated the effects of length to beam ratio weight and longitudinal center of gravity on the resistance of without step hulls with deadrise angle of 25 according to some experimental tests on the wedge like prismatic planing hulls savitsky 1964 presented a semi empirical formulation to estimate the drag and lift forces wetted area and center of pressure as a function of hull velocity deadrise and trim of without step planing crafts gassman and kartinen 1994 experimentally investigated the effects of transverse location of the step from transom ls on the hydrodynamic performance of stepped planing craft in the calm water they conducted their test in the calm water on planing hull with one deadrise angle of 15 and step height of 0 013 m and varying ls in range of 0 495 m up to 0 799 m they found smaller resistance value for step closer to the transom the drag and lift forces in without step wedge shaped prismatic planing surface with constant deadrise angle of 20 are investigated by brizzolara and serra 2007 using cfd analysis their cfd data was in appropriate accordance with shuford 1958 theoretical and experimental study savitsky et al 2007 experimentally studied the influences of whisker spray on the drag of without step prismatic planing craft they presented a semi empirical formulation to predict the whisker spray component in drag of high speed crafts as a function of hull velocity deadrise and trim angles savitsky and morabito 2010 also proposed some empirical formulations to estimate the centerline and ¼ beam wake profiles of simple prismatic planing hulls their lab test was conducted in the calm water and for planing hulls with three different deadrise angles of 10 20 and 30 their conducted tests provide proper knowledge related to the design of one stepped planing hulls according to their bottom wetted areas in 2009 svahn 2009 analytically and numerically studied the performance of stepped planing crafts by developing the savitsky 1964 formulations he developed its formulations based on the one step planing hull with three different deadrise angles of 10 20 and 30 step height of 0 05 m and transverse location of the step from transom 2 5 m moreover makasyeyev 2009 analytically studied the cavity flow on the bottom of a stepped planing hull at the wavy condition he found that optimizing the cavitation number and angle of the step can be used for minimizing the wake amplitude of the stepped planing hulls 2d t method is one of the adopted mathematical theories to investigate the performance of a stepped planing hull niazmand bilandi et al 2018 2019 for example hydrodynamic forces and bottom pressure distribution in one step planing hulls are investigated via2d t theory mathematical method and towing tank tests by niazmand bilandi et al niazmand bilandi et al 2018b recently niazmand bilandi et al niazmand bilandi et al 2020 investigated the performance and running attitude of two swept steps planing hull by conducting experimental test with mathematical approach of 2d t theory taunton et al 2010 2011 conducted a series of experimental tests to investigate the performance of high speed crafts with constant deadrise angle of 22 5 under different static trim angles length to displacement ratios and radiuses of gyration at both calm water and wavy conditions they evaluated the resistance dynamic trim angle dynamic sinkage and wetted areas to assess the hydrodynamic performance of high speed crafts begovic and bertorello 2012 conducted a series of experimental investigation on hard chine warped hull form planing hulls they studied the resistance sinkage and wetted areas of warped hull form planing hulls under different deadrise angles and loading coefficients likewise in another experimental study in 2014 begovic et al 2014a investigated the seakeeping of hard chine warped hull form planing hulls under regular wave lee et al 2014 conducted some experimental tests to investigate the effects of step height ranging from 3 2 mm to 9 6 mm and the step location from transom ranging from 0 0032 to 1 016 m on the resistance of two step planing craft they found lower resistance in the smallest forward facing step of height and the largest aft facing step of height lotfi et al 2015 numerically simulated one step planing craft under different deadrise angles ranging from 10 up to 30 taunton et al 2010 2011validated cfd results of the resistance lift running draft dynamic trim angle and wetted area of high speed planing craft against the experimental data with good accordance seo et al 2016 experimentally studied the resistance and seakeeping in a planing craft with wave piercing and spray rails they conducted their tests in calm water and wavy condition on without step bare hull they proved that the spray rails have positive role in stabilizing the planing hulls in the wavy condition and that it has no negative effect on total resistance jiang et al 2016 experimentally and numerically investigated the hydrodynamic of trimaran planing hull under different hull speeds they calculated the resistance sinkage and trim angle of trimaran planing hulls and they found that the key role of tunnel design in trimaran hulls is to obtain an efficient planing craft hydrodynamic and fluid flow pattern i e vertical flow around one step planing hull with deadrise angle of 23 using transverse step with a height of 6 mm are experimentally and numerically studied via de marco et al de marco et al 2017 they showed that the fluid flow on the un wetted bottom surfaces has 3d complex vortices which are originated from air shedding on sides of the transverse step recently hydrodynamic of stepped planing crafts under various physical and geometrical conditions such as different weight loadings trim angles lcg distance from aft body froude numbers loni et al 2013 kazemi et al 2019 najafi et al 2019 nourghassemi et al 2019 dashtimanesh et al 2018 and different shapes of the step najafi and nowruzi 2019 are numerically and experimentally investigated by the researchers however based on the literature review we found that the details of bottom wetted surfaces gathered from the stepped planing hulls under various geometrical parameters of the step are not well known in our previous experimental study in ref najafi et al 2019b we conducted a series of towing tank tests on one step planing hulls i e with two deadrise angles of 20 and 30 three different longitudinal positions of step from transom ranging from 600 to 1100 mm and three step heights of 10 20 and 30 mm to investigate the total resistance trim angle reattachment lengths and bottom wetted areas we also formulated the bottom wetted surfaces of one step planing hull based on the reattached flow patterns the present paper is strongly linked to our previous experimental study mentioned in ref najafi et al 2019b the major purpose of the current study is to evaluate the hydrodynamic characteristics of stepped and without step planing hulls i e one step planing hull under different physical and geometrical conditions see table 1 by conducting a series of experimental tests for this purpose the total resistance trim angle and wetted area in without step fridsma planing craft under different deadrise angles and froude numbers are investigated then we evaluated the total resistance trim angle reattachment length of separated flow and forebody and aftbody wetted areas in one step fridsma planing craft at deadrise angle of 15 and the step height of 20 mm under different longitudinal locations of the step from the transom and froude numbers 2 experimental setup 2 1 model geometry in the present study fridsma planing hull is selected then dynamical and geometrical similarities criteria are used to choose the dimensions of the considered hull model for this purpose maximum of froude number and blockage factor are intended table 1 shows the fundamental geometrical dimensions of fridsma hull without any transverse steps i e this model is used as a basic model on which the transverse step it is installed and one step

the maximum confidence interval 99 27 is obtained for fr of without step planing hull while minimum confidence interval 91 16 is measured for s w t o t a l 2 3 of stepped planing hull due to the presence of uncertainty sources such as spray area and flow separation we obtained the greatest uncertainty in the estimation of total wetted areas of stepped planing hulls details of uncertainty analysis are presented for the obtained experimental results in appendix 1 in the next section the experimental results of the hydrodynamics of without step and one step planing hulls are presented and discussed 3 results and discussion 3 1 resistance trim angle and wetted area of without step planing hull preliminary towing test results of total resistance trim angle i e static dynamic and total and wetted area are presented for without step planing hull with deadrise angles of15 20 and 30 in table 2 in table 2 the symbol of wo s x y means without step planing hull with deadrise angle x and the case number y moreover the comparative diagrams of total resistance total trim and wetted area under different deadrise angles and froude numbers are presented in figs 6 8 respectively as can be seen in table 2 and fig 6 the total resistance is increased by an increase in the hull velocity in addition the higher total resistance is obtained by an increase in the deadrise angle for hull model with deadrise angle of 15 the porpoising phenomenon has occurred at the fr 5 30 based on table 2 and fig 7 for all deadrise angles the total trim angle is increased up to the froude number corresponding to the planing condition and then the trim angle is decreased by an increase in hull velocity due to the increase in the lift force at the aft bottom of the model moreover increasing the deadrise angle cause an increase in the total trim angle according to table 2 and fig 8 for all deadrise angles lower bottom wetted area is achieved by increasing the hull speed in addition the wetted area is increased by an increase in deadrise angle especially from 20 to 30 3 2 resistance trim angle reattachment length and wetted area of one step planing hull fig 9 shows the wetted areas at the bottom of without step and one step planing hulls as may be seen in fig 9 the reattached length of the separated flow from the step at the centerline is presented by x c l moreover the forebody wetted area as the region that is located before the transverse step and aftbody wetted area as region that is located after the transverse step are shown by s w f o r e and s w a f t respectively in the current study the reattachment lengths and bottom wetted area are measured from recorded experimental underwater images taken by camera with 720 1280 resolution and frame rate of 30 fps by solidworks the experimental results of total resistance the trim angle i e static dynamic and total reattachment lengths and wetted area are presented in table 3 for one step planing hull at two different longitudinal distances of step from the transom ls under different froude numbers in table 3 the symbol of w s x y means one step planing hull with ls x and the case number y in addition the comparative diagrams of total resistance total trim reattachment length and wetted area under different deadrise angles as well as the froude numbers are presented in fig 10 as can be seen in table 3 and fig 10 the dynamic and total trim angle is decreased by an increase in the hull velocity and in the longitudinal position of step from transom ls in addition decreasing ls is one of the strategies to minimize the total resistance according to table 3 and fig 10 x c l is increased with an increase in the hull velocity however no significant difference is achieved in x c l by changing ls based on the achieved experimental data by increasing the hull velocity in the case of ls 600 s w f o r e s w a f t and s w t o t a l are decreased which may be related to higher exit rate of the planing hull from the water by increasing the hull velocity in case of ls 800 the irregular trends on the values of the wetted areas are obtained by increasing the hull velocity also by increasing the longitudinal position of step from transom ls s w f o r e s w a f t and s w t o t a l are increased it is notable that porpoising of the planing hull has occurred for fr 5 30 and fr 6 36 at l 600 and ls 800 respectively therefore it can be concluded that the porpoising is delayed by increasing the longitudinal position of step from transom in one step planing hull formation of aftbody wetted area in case of ls 600 and fr 3 71 and ls 800 and fr 5 30 are depicted in fig 11 as can be seen in fig 11 increasing the hull velocity and ls results in an increase in the parameter of x c l while the angle of aftbody spray line is decreased for better investigation of the effects of the steps on the hydrodynamic characteristics of the planing hulls the results achieved from without step and stepped planing hulls are compared to each other to this purpose the total resistance total trim angle and total wetted area in without step planing hull at deadrise angle of15 and one step planing hulls are compared with each other in fig 12 as can be seen in fig 12 in all cases i e without step and one step planing hulls the total resistance is decreased by an increase in the hull velocity moreover the total resistance of the stepped hull is remarkably smaller than that of the without step hull the reason behind this fact is the existence of major larger bottom wetted area in case of without step hull compared to the stepped hulls see fig 12 c in fig 12 b a greater total trim angle i e with positive role to increase the lift to drag ratio is obtained for one step planing hulls in comparison with the without step hull the detailed quantitative percentage values of total resistance total trim angle and total wetted area changes obtained by adding steps to the without step hull are also tabulated in table 4 for more details about the without step planing hull and the effects of geometrical parameters of the step on the hydrodynamics characteristics of one step planing hull test cases which are representative of the maximum and minimum of total trim angle total resistance and total areas are presented in fig 13 for this purpose the present experimental data for without step and one step hulls see table 1 are evaluated with our recently published paper in ref najafi et al 2019b where we experimentally investigated one step hulls under deadrise angle 20 to 30 fr in range of 3 71 5 3 ls in the interval of 600 mm 1100 mm and hs ranging from 10 mm to 30 mm according to fig 13 maximum of total trim angle τ 5 04 is obtained for one step hull with greater hs and smaller ls while minimum of total trim angle τ 5 04 is achieved for without step hull with β 15 at fr 0 53 the maximum of non dimensional total resistance rt δ 0 54 is measured for without step hull with β 30 at fr 7 42 while maximum of total resistance rt δ 0 28 is achieved for one step planing hulls as illustrated in fig 13 c total wetted are of one step planing hulls is remarkably decreased compared to without step hulls the maximum of the forebody wetted area is obtained for one step hull with the largest deadrise angle β 30 while the maximum of the aftbody wetted area is achieved for one step hull with the smallest step height hs 10 mm as can be seen in fig 13 the minimum of the wetted area doesn t necessarily mean a minimum of the total resistance it is also notable that the stepped planing hull is not strictly specified via drag reduction indeed an increase in the hydrodynamic lift to drag ratio at high speeds and the reduction of the bottom wetted areas due to flow separation are the main characteristics of the stepped hulls savitsky and morabito 2010 de marco et al 2017 in order to achieve more comprehensive conclusion we need more lab tests in a wider range of geometrical parameters of the step for both one and multi stepped planing hulls 4 conclusion an appropriate understanding of the effects of geometrical parameters of the step in the stepped planing hulls hydrodynamics has a significant role in developing their design this study aims to assess the hydrodynamic characteristics of without step and stepped planing hulls experimentally therefore the total resistance trim angle reattachment lengths and forebody and aftbody wetted areas are measured at different deadrise angles β longitudinal distance of the step from transom ls and hull velocities fr based on the obtained experimental data the total resistance for the planing hull without a step is increased by an increase in the deadrise angle and hull velocities by increasing the hull velocity the total trim angle in without step hull initially increased until the planing condition started and then decreased while a greater trim angle is achieved via increasing the deadrise angle moreover lower wetted area in without step hull is obtained at higher hull velocities and lower deadrise angle porpoising phenomenon is also occurred at fr 5 30 for without step planing hull in the case of one step planing hulls the total trim angle is decreased by increasing the hull velocity and longitudinal position of step from transom the total resistance in one step planing hull is also decreased by reducing the longitudinal position of step from transom by increasing the hull velocity x c l is increased while the parameter of ls has an insignificant effect on the x c l in addition forebody aftbody and total wetted areas are increased by increasing the longitudinal position of step from transom while irregular trends on the wetted areas are achieved by increasing the hull velocity the lab results show delay in porpoising when increasing the longitudinal position of step from transom for one step planing hull based on the comparison between the results achieved form without step planing hull and stepped planing hulls it is found that the total resistance of the stepped hulls is remarkably smaller i e up to 32 84 less at fr 5 3 for one step with ls 800 than that of the without step hull greater total trim angle i e up to 24 93 greater at fr 4 24 for one step with ls 600 is obtained for one step planing hull compared to the without step hull the total wetted area of one stepped planing hull is significantly smaller i e up to 119 83 less at fr 4 24 for one step with ls 600 than that of the without step hull finally we presented the planing hulls which are representative of the minimum and maximum of the total resistance trim angle and wetted areas in without step and one step planing hulls by comparing the current study data with our recently published experimental data

21409,the paper studies a sloshing phenomenon occurring as a result of a vibroimpact motion of a rectangular tank subjected to an external harmonic excitation this presented model is a result of an idealization of realistic scenario in which an impact interaction between a ship and floating ice can occur the behavior of a liquid inside the tank is modeled by the five mass spring damper subsystems mimicking a response of the liquid at different sloshing response modes two sided motionless barriers are introduced to model the vibroimpact motion of the tank the paper studies the influence of the vibroimpact motion onto the sloshing intensity and proposes a sloshing mitigation strategy which employs a flexible vertically oriented baffle the results of the numerical simulations indicate that the sloshing intensity is higher in the case of a classical rigid baffle and can be significantly reduced by the flexible baffle keywords sloshing dynamics vibro impact systems ship ice interaction lumped mass system sloshing mitigation flexible baffle 1 introduction with the development of arctic waterways being increasingly valued by various countries related research on ship ice collisions has gradually become a hot spot for scholars in the world the opening of the arctic routes has great and far reaching significance for the development of every nations shipping industry jian et al 2014 arctic ocean provides the shortest nautical trade route connecting europe east cost of america and asia that could operate all year long if not the harsh environmental conditions in the region ice conditions do not allow conventional ships to travel freely over this route without a help of specially equipped ships icebreakers icebreakers are used to clear a path through frozen and ice water making a waterway however icebreakers do not completely remove the ice large ice pieces or icebergs but simply push them sideways as a result these ice pieces remain floating around the passing ships as shown in fig 1 sometimes colliding with the ships these collisions may cause damages influence their direction of motion influence the stability of cargo and containers carried by the ships as well as cause the sloshing phenomenon in the ships with liquids or liquefied gases increasing number of accidents of liquefied petroleum gas lpg and liquefied natural gas lng vessels associated with sloshing in the 1990s returned the attention of scientists to this non trivial phenomenon in many countries including canada norway america china and russia ship ice interaction is a complex process and ice loading on the passing by ships is a random process therefore the impact may happen from either side of the ship may vary in its strength and direction depending of the environment the ship characteristics and its current speed tryaskin et al 2012 obviously before considering such a complex problem some new accurate statistical methods and models should be developed and applied to estimate stresses that should be considered jian et al 2019a some basic understanding of the influence of the tank impact interaction onto the sloshing phenomenon can come from studying a relatively fundamental problem of a vibroimpact motion of the partially filled tank which is proposed in this paper sloshing is the effect of vibrations of liquids inside a partially filled tank due to the tank excitation ibrahim 2005 this excitation may occur as a result waves acting onto a moving vessel or may arise as a result of impacts caused by ice pieces when the vessel navigates through a floating ice region fig 1 at a certain value of the excitation frequency matching the natural frequency of the liquid its free surface starts oscillating and under this condition these oscillations continue with the gradually increasing response amplitude although sloshing may also occur with the vertical direction of excitation it is usually associated with the horizontal excitation of the tank almost everyone has experienced a danger of sloshing while carrying a cup of coffee with a certain pace and being frightened to spill it on yourself ockendon and ockendon 2017 sloshing has been of interest of many scientists due to the negative effect the moving liquid may have on the dynamics of carrying tracks ships and aircrafts the studies of sloshing were initiated in earlier fifties of the twentieth century by nasa where the moving liquid had noticeable effect on stability and response of aircrafts and missiles one of the earliest analytical work was reported in graham and rodriquez 1951 where an analytical solution for a partially filled rectangular tank subjected to three different types of motion was proposed actually in that work graham and rodriquez 1951 the authors developed for the first time a relationship between the developed exact analytical solutions and the lumped mass model s parameters that are used in this paper the analytical results for circular spherical toroidal and conical tanks were reported in abramson 1966 where also early findings on the nonlinear effects of sloshing were reported a theoretical and experimental studies were conducted and reported again in verhagen and wijngaarden 1956 who had studied the steady state oscillations in a shallow rectangular container disregarding the frequency dispersion and dissipation published later works chester and bones 1967 chester 1968 have acknowledged the importance of dispersion and dissipation especially near the resonance in reflection to these studies the authors of lepelletier and raichlen 1998 have experimentally demonstrated that the linear theory near the resonance becomes inadequate and nonlinear theory should be used these works have stimulated the development and application of nonlinear asymptotic methods to the problem of sloshing in ockendon and ockendon 1972 hill 2003 2005 forbes 2010 the authors used an asymptotic analysis for studying the nonlinear behavior near the resonance and potentially multiple stable solutions were reported it should be stressed that moiseev 1958 was actually one of the first authors who had addressed the nonlinear sloshing phenomenon much earlier than the above mentioned authors using the perturbation approach the authors in faltinsen et al 2003 have proposed a multi modal approach using a variational principle for studying the sloshing phenomenon near the resonance other authors have studied nonlinear sloshing phenomenon and discovered a number of nonlinear regimes that can occur near the multimodal nonlinear resonance bryant and stiassnie 1994 waterhouse 1995 ockendon et al 1996 the influence of the liquid viscosity onto the sloshing dynamics and the existence of a critical viscosity has been reported in jin and lin 2019 many experimental tests have been carried out for instance kim et al 2007 bouscasse et al 2013 wang et al 2017 moreover at certain conditions the moving liquid may exert impacts onto the internal walls of the tank cox et al 1980 el sayad et al 1999 ibrahim 2014 farid and gendelman 2016 and the lid kim 2001 causing an excessive stress the most complete list of the contributions to this field prior to 2005 can be found in ibrahim 2005 unfortunately the real life sloshing phenomenon often exhibits a complex nonlinear behavior depended on a number of factors such as a tank shape the fluid height the fluid properties therefore there is a need to build some rigid floating ice models in order to simulate the collision condition more explicitly one of such a ship ice collision model which leads to sloshing is shown in fig 2 and was studied in jian et al 2019b usually to study the sloshing phenomenon a finite element method pandit and biswal 2018 mitra et al 2012 jian et al 2018 boundary element method zhang 2015 nakayama and washizu 1981 finite volume jung et al 2015 finite difference kim et al 2007 kim 2001 celebi and akyildiz 2002 chen et al 2009 and particle luo et al 2016 methods are used which are capable of predicting relatively accurately the dynamics of the free surface other commercial packages like wamit openfoam sesam can be adapted to study the sloshing phenomenon zhang 2015 newman 2005 hu et al 2017 the above mentioned numerical methods are highly computationally demanding moreover some dynamic interactions like impulses or impacts are hard to incorporate into them thus a lumped mass model shown in fig 3 can be adapted ibrahim 2005 graham and rodriquez 1951 to study sloshing under more complicated excitations in this model the liquid is substituted by a number of mass spring damper systems modeled as a single degree of freedom sdof system and representing different sloshing modes this is a very powerful approach which allows studying the behavior of various complex liquids bingham liquid various non newtonian liquids because each sdof system can in general have a nonlinear stiffness f n f n x n and nonlinear damping g n g n x n x n terms as shown in fig 3 right when the sdof system is linear i e f n k n x n g n c n x n the motion of the free surface at different modes is approximated by a straight line as shown in fig 3 left whereas when the sdof is taken as a nonlinear system the free surface will be described by a curve the nonlinear sloshing regime can be modeled by a system of pendulums and the effect of the sloshing impact onto the inner tank walls can be studied by introducing an impact between the pendulums and the tank s walls thus this approximation allows converting the original problem described by a set of partial differential equations to a multidimensional problem described by ordinary differential equations in general nonlinear which require much less computational power one way to fight the sloshing is to introduce a baffle usually a baffle is a vertically or horizontally oriented rigid separator which does not reach the free surface and is capable of modifying the flow pattern ibrahim 2005 it has been shown by a number of authors that a baffle can reduce the internal impact intensity onto the tank walls celebi and akyildiz 2002 lsaacson and premasiri 2001 younes and younes 2015 and it has been shown that the flow pattern depends on the baffle design cho and lee 2004 in xue et al 2017 jung et al 2012 the baffles of various heights were studied and it has been shown that the higher the baffle the better the result of the sloshing mitigation can be achieved other options of mitigating the sloshing were investigated by scientists for instance a 3 baffle system with either all vertically oriented or two horizontally oriented baffles was studied in brara and singh 2014 whereas ünal et al 2019 have studied the effect of a t shaped baffle in kim et al 2018 the authors proposed to use of an air trapping system to reduce sloshing in a rectangular tank and zhang et al 2019 have studied the effect of floating foams in farid and gendelman 2018 the authors proposed a strategy which is focused on designing a nonlinear energy sink nes acting as a nonlinear absorber in this paper a mass spring damper model consisting of an external system the rectangular tank and the internal five separate sdof systems representing the sloshing modes is adapted the main goal of the paper is to study the effect of periodic external impacts onto the sloshing dynamics of the rectangular container although the harmonic vibroimpact motion is very unlikely in the open sea environment it is possible that a series of impacts may occur tryaskin et al 2012 which will excite the sloshing thus a problem of the vibroimpact motion of a partially filled tank is addressed in this paper for the first time then a sloshing mitigation strategy is proposed by introducing a flexible baffle of different heights in section 2 the model and its main parameters are discussed and selected in section 3 the validation of the model and the results of the numerical simulations for the system with and without impacts are discussed in section 4 the mitigation strategy is studied finally conclusions are drawn and design recommendations for the device are given 2 the lump mass equivalent model of sloshing an exact analytical solution developed in graham and rodriquez 1951 for a rectangular tank under a horizontal excitation was used to identify the parameters of an equivalent lumped mass spring damper system similar to one shown in fig 3 right in these derivations the authors assumed that the liquid was viscous and homogeneous thus the effect of air cavities studied in rognebakke and faltinsen 2005 or stratified liquid could not be considered within the framework of this model following these derivations let s assume that a rectangular tank is rigidly connected to a ship which experiences some impacts against large floating ice pieces within this assumption the problem of sloshing is reduced to another problem of studying the vibroimpact dynamics of a system subjected to an external excitation f t where δ is the distance to a barrier k is the stiffness of the entire system as presented in fig 5 for a given size of the rectangular tank of width a and length b the total volume of the liquid is a b h and the total mass is m f ρ a b h where ρ is the liquid density and h is its height in the linear approximation k i and c i are the stiffness and the viscous damping coefficients of each layer mode however for a homogeneous liquid all the damping coefficients are taken the same c i c following the derivations proposed in graham and rodriquez 1951 the model parameters should be selected from the basic physical arguments for instance the mass of all the layers should be equal to the total mass i e m f m m i and the center of gravity of the original and the lumped mass systems should be the same at rest for the rectangular shape of the tank the following formulas were derived 1 m i m f 8 π 3 t a n h 2 i 1 π h a 2 i 1 π h a ω n i 2 2 i 1 π g a t a n h 2 i 1 π h a where g 9 81 m s e c 2 is the acceleration of gravity ω n i is the natural frequency of the corresponding sloshing i t h mode it can be seen that the proposed algorithm assigns a bulk majority of the total mass to the non moving mass defined as m m f m i and the largest moving mass m 0 thus a high number of masses leads to the almost negligible contribution of each consequent mass above certain value of i which can be clearly seen from fig 4 left where the mass ratios for the five moving masses and fixed mass m are presented as functions of h a it can be seen that with the increase of h a ratio going from a relatively shallow to a relatively deep tank the fraction of fixed mass m is gradually increasing whereas the mass ratios of other moving masses are gradually decreasing this can be seen in fig 4 right which presents the zoom in area of the bottom left corner of fig 4 left based on this figure one can see that the mass ratio for h a 0 2 is m 2 m f 0 01 and m 4 m f 0 0018 whereas for a relatively deep tank with h a 3 these values are m 2 m f 6 9 10 4 and m 4 m f 1 18 10 4 correspondingly these results clearly indicate that for a relatively deep tank three moving mass will be sufficient but for a relatively shallow tank five masses will provide adequate description of the sloshing modes thus in this paper a model consisting of n 5 moving masses and a single fixed mass is adapted the natural frequencies of each layer calculated according to 1 have an increasing trend for the increasing values of h a and then achieves a constant values independent of h a where the frequency of a low layer is lower than that of the layer above having defined the parameters of the system required for further calculations one can write the governing equations of motion of the system shown in fig 5 where the values of the stiffness coefficients of each moving mass k i can be found using the above natural frequencies and masses of each layer 2 m 0 x 0 k 0 x 0 x c x 0 x m 1 x 1 k 1 x 1 x c x 1 x m 2 x 2 k 2 x 2 x c x 2 x m 3 x 3 k 3 x 3 x c x 3 x m 4 x 4 k 4 x 4 x c x 4 x m x i 0 4 m i x x i k x f t x δ x r x x δ the last equation describes the impact condition at which the velocity after impact x is related to the velocity before impact x through the restitution coefficient 0 r 1 3 influence of a vibroimpact motion onto the sloshing dynamics to study the effect of impacts on sloshing dynamics first a nonimpacting model should be validated against an established experimental or numerical result for this purpose the experimental and numerical results reported in faltinsen et al 2000 were used with the rectangular tank size 1 73 m 0 2 m and the water level of h 0 6 m fig 6 demonstrates the results of the numerical simulations obtained using equations from 1 left column and the results presented in faltinsen et al 2000 for the excitation period of t 1 3 s top row and t 1 5 s bottom row correspondingly the simulations used zero initial conditions and the same excitation amplitude as expected the results are agreed well away from the resonance whereas the results closer to the resonance area shown in the bottom row have a slightly different pattern namely the produced results are symmetric due to the linear assumption used whereas the presented in faltinsen et al 2000 results demonstrate some nonlinear behavior with asymmetric pattern the effect of nonlinear behavior was mentioned in lepelletier and raichlen 1998 and thus it was expected to have some discrepancies in the near resonant behaviour due to adapted linear model however because the overall response amplitude agrees well the same peak to trough magnitude slightly over 0 65 m and based on the excellent agreement with the far from resonance pattern the proposed model is considered to be adequate for the purpose of studying the vibroimpact response it should be noted that a similar approach with a nonlinear lumped mass pendulum model was used in aliabadi et al 2003 and proved to be adequate for predicting a sloshing response in the cylindrical container for low and moderate amount of fuel at this point another tank dimensions are taken to simulate the system response which is presented in fig 7 where the maximum amplitude of each mass is shown in all the future simulations except when it is stated otherwise the restitution coefficient was taken r 0 9 the natural frequencies of the moving masses were relatively close to each other and for the presented case of h a 0 5 they were ω 0 2 2 ω 1 2 56 ω 2 2 99 ω 3 3 43 and ω 4 3 82 correspondingly fig 7 demonstrates the forced non impacting response of the system for different values of the excitation frequency one can observe a number of peaks including the first peak near 0 5 r a d s e c which corresponds to the response of the main mass m time responses of the system at different frequencies are shown in fig 8 for specified values of the excitation frequency as a function of time for different values of h a ratio as expected all the curves in all the figures have distinct peaks at the natural frequency of the main mass m with the increase of h a ratio the peak values go down h a 1 and then go up again for higher values of h a ratio since it is not relevant to the sloshing itself but is a feature of the external frequency of the tank one can ignore this peak around ω 0 5 the pattern of vibrations changes with the increasing h a ratio but the peak of each layer in the vicinity of its natural frequency remains common to all the figures where the peak of the m 4 is lower than the peak of the m 3 which in its turn is lower than the peak of m 2 and lower than that of m 1 however the peak of m 0 varies and can be lower than that of m 4 like in fig 8 a and b or higher than the peak of m 4 as shown in fig 8 c and d with the increase of h a ratio from 0 5 to 1 sloshing intensifies for the main harmonics and reduces for higher harmonics moving from h a 1 to h a 1 5 and h a 2 the level of sloshing either reduces or remains unchanged interestingly enough the level of vibrations of the higher harmonics corresponding to mass m 4 remains about the same for all presented values of h a next set of plots in fig 9 demonstrates the time response of the moving masses for h a 1 and different values of the excitation frequencies which were selected at the peak response of m 1 m 2 m 3 and m 4 correspondingly in fig 9 a mass m 0 is moving almost in anti phase with other masses whereas in fig 9 b masses m 0 and m 1 are moving in anti phse to the upper layers when the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of m 4 as can be seen in fig 9 d all masses are moving in phase with a lag behind the main mass imposing a two sided barrier to the system will result in the tank vibroimpact motion against these barriers as soon as the tank s displacement reaches δ the plots in fig 10 represent the maximum response amplitude of a relative motion of the moving masses for different values of h a ratio in the first two plots there is a distinct dip around ω 2 2 which disappears when h a 2 this dip is associate with the fact that no vibroimpact motion happens in the vicinity of this frequency as can be seen from fig 11 a where the phase portrait of the main mass m is presented when h a 2 the vibroimpact motion of the main mass occurs and the dip has disappeared as can be seem in fig 11 b thus the response for small values of h a ratio is very similar to one in fig 8 as can be seen from fig 11 c fig 11 d shows a typical vibroimpact response of the moving masses where the piecewise continuous response curves can be observed apart from this particular dip the overall comparison with no impact case in fig 8 demonstrates the increase in the sloshing intensity by higher level of vibrations for all the modes this increase is directly associated with vibroimpact motion of the main mass and this motion basically excites higher sloshing modes with relatively high response amplitudes 4 numerical study of a sloshing mitigation strategy using a flexible baffle the above results indicate that first of all the impacts make the sloshing more intense increasing the overall force acting on the tank walls thereby actively influencing the tank carrying structure and secondly the impacts excite high sloshing modes this increasing force on another hand can move the system away from the vibroimpact regime which results in reduced sloshing intensity the baffle or barrier which is usually assumed to be absolutely rigid and can vary in height changes the flow pattern and in some cases indeed reduces sloshing in this paper a flexible baffle is introduced which can be represented by a vertically oriented beam as shown in fig 12 a one can model it as a set of extra linear springs added to each mass if required as shown in fig 12 b where k b 0 k b 1 and so on are the stiffness of the baffle at the corresponding level when a rigid baffle is assumed it can be modeled as a very stiff barrier with a high stiffness coefficient the following set of plot in fig 13 presents a case of a short baffle tuned to the first sloshing mode only four figures correspond to different values of the stiffness coefficient k b 0 and ω 3 0 the presented results can be compared with the case of no baffle depicted in fig 10 d where the peak responses of m 4 m 3 and m 2 cross the level of 3 5 in fig 13 a the response of m 2 reaches 5 and is higher than that in the case of no baffle and with increase of k b 0 value the response remains high for the higher modes in fig 13 b however the response has reached a steady state level after 400 s where the main system was moved away from a vibroimpact motion interestingly enough the increase in the baffle stiffness does not mitigate the sloshing but keep the system in the vibroimpact mode with high oscillation level next the baffle height is increased and reaches the values associated with the second moving mass m 1 i e tuned to the second sloshing mode thus two stiffness coefficients can be selected k b 0 and k b 1 for example it can be achieved by appropriately selecting the baffle thickness keeping other parameters the same fig 14 presents four responses for the ratio h a 2 ω 3 and four sets of stiffness coefficients fig 14 a presents the response of the moving masses for k b 0 1 2 k 0 and k b 1 1 2 k 1 whereas in 14 a the stiffness coefficients were take k b 0 2 k 0 and k b 1 2 k 1 correspondingly in both these cases the extra stiffnesses of both the masses have been increased proportionally and as one can see the high intensity sloshing resulted from the vibroimpact motion continues in the system the next two plots in fig 14 c and d demonstrate the results for the different increase in the values of the stiffness coefficients so that the bottom mass has higher stiffness coefficient than the one on top of it in both these cases a relatively high level of oscillations and therefore sloshing is observed with a periodic steady state vibroimpact motion of the main mass following this design procedure the baffle height is extended to achieve the values associated with the first four moving mass with the potentially different values of the stiffness coefficients next four plots in fig 15 demonstrate the response of all the moving masses for different values of the stiffnesses coefficients modeling the baffle staring from the similar increase in the stiffness coefficients fig 15 a presents results for k b 0 2 k 0 k b 1 0 2 k 1 k b 2 0 2 k 2 and k b 3 0 2 k 3 these coefficients increased to k b 0 k 0 k b 1 k 1 k b 2 k 2 and k b 3 k 3 in fig 15 b and reach values k b 0 2 2 k 0 k b 1 2 2 k 1 k b 2 2 2 k 2 and k b 3 2 2 k 3 in fig 15 c one can clearly observe from the presented graphs that the increase in the stiffnesses does not reduce the sloshing intensity and oscillations of all the moving masses remain intense in fig 15 d one can see the response of the system when the stiffness coefficients were increased disproportionately namely k b 0 2 0 k 0 k b 1 1 5 k 1 k b 2 k 2 and k b 3 5 k 3 in this case the level of oscillations remains high and is very similar to one depicted in fig 15 c nevertheless it is possible to select the coefficients to mitigate the sloshing quite effectively as shown in fig 16 for k b 0 5 k 0 k b 1 0 4 k 1 k b 2 0 3 k 2 and k b 3 0 1 k 3 it can be seen that the maximum response for the selected set of parameters reaches only 0 3 which is 10 times smaller than that without such a baffle moreover the response amplitude of the free surface of the 5th mode modeled by mass m 4 is reduced to the level of 0 1 which is almost 40 times 5 conclusions the paper studies the sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular tank subjected to a vibroimpact harmonic motion the sloshing was approximated by the five lumped mass model with a linear spring and viscous damping where each mass system was representing a sloshing mode the proposed model without impacts was validated against existing experimental and numerical results presented in faltinsen et al 2000 and demonstrated a good agreement in the far from resonance region the results of the numerical simulations have indicated high sloshing intensity due to the vibroimpact motion of the tank when compared to the nonimpact harmonic response the sloshing mitigation strategy represented by a flexible baffle has been proposed and studied numerically the flexible baffle was modeled as an extra set of linear springs whose stiffnesses were selected appropriately to tune to a selected number of sloshing mode it has been shown that a rigid baffle may not be the most effective sloshing mitigation strategy numerical results have indicated that a flexible baffle with a properly selected step wise linear stiffness is significantly more effective than its rigid analogy namely it has been shown that a high sloshing intensity expressed in the oscillation amplitudes of sloshing modes has been reduced more than 10 times with a proper selection of the stiffness coefficients of the flexible baffle credit authorship contribution statement jian

21409,the paper studies a sloshing phenomenon occurring as a result of a vibroimpact motion of a rectangular tank subjected to an external harmonic excitation this presented model is a result of an idealization of realistic scenario in which an impact interaction between a ship and floating ice can occur the behavior of a liquid inside the tank is modeled by the five mass spring damper subsystems mimicking a response of the liquid at different sloshing response modes two sided motionless barriers are introduced to model the vibroimpact motion of the tank the paper studies the influence of the vibroimpact motion onto the sloshing intensity and proposes a sloshing mitigation strategy which employs a flexible vertically oriented baffle the results of the numerical simulations indicate that the sloshing intensity is higher in the case of a classical rigid baffle and can be significantly reduced by the flexible baffle keywords sloshing dynamics vibro impact systems ship ice interaction lumped mass system sloshing mitigation flexible baffle 1 introduction with the development of arctic waterways being increasingly valued by various countries related research on ship ice collisions has gradually become a hot spot for scholars in the world the opening of the arctic routes has great and far reaching significance for the development of every nations shipping industry jian et al 2014 arctic ocean provides the shortest nautical trade route connecting europe east cost of america and asia that could operate all year long if not the harsh environmental conditions in the region ice conditions do not allow conventional ships to travel freely over this route without a help of specially equipped ships icebreakers icebreakers are used to clear a path through frozen and ice water making a waterway however icebreakers do not completely remove the ice large ice pieces or icebergs but simply push them sideways as a result these ice pieces remain floating around the passing ships as shown in fig 1 sometimes colliding with the ships these collisions may cause damages influence their direction of motion influence the stability of cargo and containers carried by the ships as well as cause the sloshing phenomenon in the ships with liquids or liquefied gases increasing number of accidents of liquefied petroleum gas lpg and liquefied natural gas lng vessels associated with sloshing in the 1990s returned the attention of scientists to this non trivial phenomenon in many countries including canada norway america china and russia ship ice interaction is a complex process and ice loading on the passing by ships is a random process therefore the impact may happen from either side of the ship may vary in its strength and direction depending of the environment the ship characteristics and its current speed tryaskin et al 2012 obviously before considering such a complex problem some new accurate statistical methods and models should be developed and applied to estimate stresses that should be considered jian et al 2019a some basic understanding of the influence of the tank impact interaction onto the sloshing phenomenon can come from studying a relatively fundamental problem of a vibroimpact motion of the partially filled tank which is proposed in this paper sloshing is the effect of vibrations of liquids inside a partially filled tank due to the tank excitation ibrahim 2005 this excitation may occur as a result waves acting onto a moving vessel or may arise as a result of impacts caused by ice pieces when the vessel navigates through a floating ice region fig 1 at a certain value of the excitation frequency matching the natural frequency of the liquid its free surface starts oscillating and under this condition these oscillations continue with the gradually increasing response amplitude although sloshing may also occur with the vertical direction of excitation it is usually associated with the horizontal excitation of the tank almost everyone has experienced a danger of sloshing while carrying a cup of coffee with a certain pace and being frightened to spill it on yourself ockendon and ockendon 2017 sloshing has been of interest of many scientists due to the negative effect the moving liquid may have on the dynamics of carrying tracks ships and aircrafts the studies of sloshing were initiated in earlier fifties of the twentieth century by nasa where the moving liquid had noticeable effect on stability and response of aircrafts and missiles one of the earliest analytical work was reported in graham and rodriquez 1951 where an analytical solution for a partially filled rectangular tank subjected to three different types of motion was proposed actually in that work graham and rodriquez 1951 the authors developed for the first time a relationship between the developed exact analytical solutions and the lumped mass model s parameters that are used in this paper the analytical results for circular spherical toroidal and conical tanks were reported in abramson 1966 where also early findings on the nonlinear effects of sloshing were reported a theoretical and experimental studies were conducted and reported again in verhagen and wijngaarden 1956 who had studied the steady state oscillations in a shallow rectangular container disregarding the frequency dispersion and dissipation published later works chester and bones 1967 chester 1968 have acknowledged the importance of dispersion and dissipation especially near the resonance in reflection to these studies the authors of lepelletier and raichlen 1998 have experimentally demonstrated that the linear theory near the resonance becomes inadequate and nonlinear theory should be used these works have stimulated the development and application of nonlinear asymptotic methods to the problem of sloshing in ockendon and ockendon 1972 hill 2003 2005 forbes 2010 the authors used an asymptotic analysis for studying the nonlinear behavior near the resonance and potentially multiple stable solutions were reported it should be stressed that moiseev 1958 was actually one of the first authors who had addressed the nonlinear sloshing phenomenon much earlier than the above mentioned authors using the perturbation approach the authors in faltinsen et al 2003 have proposed a multi modal approach using a variational principle for studying the sloshing phenomenon near the resonance other authors have studied nonlinear sloshing phenomenon and discovered a number of nonlinear regimes that can occur near the multimodal nonlinear resonance bryant and stiassnie 1994 waterhouse 1995 ockendon et al 1996 the influence of the liquid viscosity onto the sloshing dynamics and the existence of a critical viscosity has been reported in jin and lin 2019 many experimental tests have been carried out for instance kim et al 2007 bouscasse et al 2013 wang et al 2017 moreover at certain conditions the moving liquid may exert impacts onto the internal walls of the tank cox et al 1980 el sayad et al 1999 ibrahim 2014 farid and gendelman 2016 and the lid kim 2001 causing an excessive stress the most complete list of the contributions to this field prior to 2005 can be found in ibrahim 2005 unfortunately the real life sloshing phenomenon often exhibits a complex nonlinear behavior depended on a number of factors such as a tank shape the fluid height the fluid properties therefore there is a need to build some rigid floating ice models in order to simulate the collision condition more explicitly one of such a ship ice collision model which leads to sloshing is shown in fig 2 and was studied in jian et al 2019b usually to study the sloshing phenomenon a finite element method pandit and biswal 2018 mitra et al 2012 jian et al 2018 boundary element method zhang 2015 nakayama and washizu 1981 finite volume jung et al 2015 finite difference kim et al 2007 kim 2001 celebi and akyildiz 2002 chen et al 2009 and particle luo et al 2016 methods are used which are capable of predicting relatively accurately the dynamics of the free surface other commercial packages like wamit openfoam sesam can be adapted to study the sloshing phenomenon zhang 2015 newman 2005 hu et al 2017 the above mentioned numerical methods are highly computationally demanding moreover some dynamic interactions like impulses or impacts are hard to incorporate into them thus a lumped mass model shown in fig 3 can be adapted ibrahim 2005 graham and rodriquez 1951 to study sloshing under more complicated excitations in this model the liquid is substituted by a number of mass spring damper systems modeled as a single degree of freedom sdof system and representing different sloshing modes this is a very powerful approach which allows studying the behavior of various complex liquids bingham liquid various non newtonian liquids because each sdof system can in general have a nonlinear stiffness f n f n x n and nonlinear damping g n g n x n x n terms as shown in fig 3 right when the sdof system is linear i e f n k n x n g n c n x n the motion of the free surface at different modes is approximated by a straight line as shown in fig 3 left whereas when the sdof is taken as a nonlinear system the free surface will be described by a curve the nonlinear sloshing regime can be modeled by a system of pendulums and the effect of the sloshing impact onto the inner tank walls can be studied by introducing an impact between the pendulums and the tank s walls thus this approximation allows converting the original problem described by a set of partial differential equations to a multidimensional problem described by ordinary differential equations in general nonlinear which require much less computational power one way to fight the sloshing is to introduce a baffle usually a baffle is a vertically or horizontally oriented rigid separator which does not reach the free surface and is capable of modifying the flow pattern ibrahim 2005 it has been shown by a number of authors that a baffle can reduce the internal impact intensity onto the tank walls celebi and akyildiz 2002 lsaacson and premasiri 2001 younes and younes 2015 and it has been shown that the flow pattern depends on the baffle design cho and lee 2004 in xue et al 2017 jung et al 2012 the baffles of various heights were studied and it has been shown that the higher the baffle the better the result of the sloshing mitigation can be achieved other options of mitigating the sloshing were investigated by scientists for instance a 3 baffle system with either all vertically oriented or two horizontally oriented baffles was studied in brara and singh 2014 whereas ünal et al 2019 have studied the effect of a t shaped baffle in kim et al 2018 the authors proposed to use of an air trapping system to reduce sloshing in a rectangular tank and zhang et al 2019 have studied the effect of floating foams in farid and gendelman 2018 the authors proposed a strategy which is focused on designing a nonlinear energy sink nes acting as a nonlinear absorber in this paper a mass spring damper model consisting of an external system the rectangular tank and the internal five separate sdof systems representing the sloshing modes is adapted the main goal of the paper is to study the effect of periodic external impacts onto the sloshing dynamics of the rectangular container although the harmonic vibroimpact motion is very unlikely in the open sea environment it is possible that a series of impacts may occur tryaskin et al 2012 which will excite the sloshing thus a problem of the vibroimpact motion of a partially filled tank is addressed in this paper for the first time then a sloshing mitigation strategy is proposed by introducing a flexible baffle of different heights in section 2 the model and its main parameters are discussed and selected in section 3 the validation of the model and the results of the numerical simulations for the system with and without impacts are discussed in section 4 the mitigation strategy is studied finally conclusions are drawn and design recommendations for the device are given 2 the lump mass equivalent model of sloshing an exact analytical solution developed in graham and rodriquez 1951 for a rectangular tank under a horizontal excitation was used to identify the parameters of an equivalent lumped mass spring damper system similar to one shown in fig 3 right in these derivations the authors assumed that the liquid was viscous and homogeneous thus the effect of air cavities studied in rognebakke and faltinsen 2005 or stratified liquid could not be considered within the framework of this model following these derivations let s assume that a rectangular tank is rigidly connected to a ship which experiences some impacts against large floating ice pieces within this assumption the problem of sloshing is reduced to another problem of studying the vibroimpact dynamics of a system subjected to an external excitation f t where δ is the distance to a barrier k is the stiffness of the entire system as presented in fig 5 for a given size of the rectangular tank of width a and length b the total volume of the liquid is a b h and the total mass is m f ρ a b h where ρ is the liquid density and h is its height in the linear approximation k i and c i are the stiffness and the viscous damping coefficients of each layer mode however for a homogeneous liquid all the damping coefficients are taken the same c i c following the derivations proposed in graham and rodriquez 1951 the model parameters should be selected from the basic physical arguments for instance the mass of all the layers should be equal to the total mass i e m f m m i and the center of gravity of the original and the lumped mass systems should be the same at rest for the rectangular shape of the tank the following formulas were derived 1 m i m f 8 π 3 t a n h 2 i 1 π h a 2 i 1 π h a ω n i 2 2 i 1 π g a t a n h 2 i 1 π h a where g 9 81 m s e c 2 is the acceleration of gravity ω n i is the natural frequency of the corresponding sloshing i t h mode it can be seen that the proposed algorithm assigns a bulk majority of the total mass to the non moving mass defined as m m f m i and the largest moving mass m 0 thus a high number of masses leads to the almost negligible contribution of each consequent mass above certain value of i which can be clearly seen from fig 4 left where the mass ratios for the five moving masses and fixed mass m are presented as functions of h a it can be seen that with the increase of h a ratio going from a relatively shallow to a relatively deep tank the fraction of fixed mass m is gradually increasing whereas the mass ratios of other moving masses are gradually decreasing this can be seen in fig 4 right which presents the zoom in area of the bottom left corner of fig 4 left based on this figure one can see that the mass ratio for h a 0 2 is m 2 m f 0 01 and m 4 m f 0 0018 whereas for a relatively deep tank with h a 3 these values are m 2 m f 6 9 10 4 and m 4 m f 1 18 10 4 correspondingly these results clearly indicate that for a relatively deep tank three moving mass will be sufficient but for a relatively shallow tank five masses will provide adequate description of the sloshing modes thus in this paper a model consisting of n 5 moving masses and a single fixed mass is adapted the natural frequencies of each layer calculated according to 1 have an increasing trend for the increasing values of h a and then achieves a constant values independent of h a where the frequency of a low layer is lower than that of the layer above having defined the parameters of the system required for further calculations one can write the governing equations of motion of the system shown in fig 5 where the values of the stiffness coefficients of each moving mass k i can be found using the above natural frequencies and masses of each layer 2 m 0 x 0 k 0 x 0 x c x 0 x m 1 x 1 k 1 x 1 x c x 1 x m 2 x 2 k 2 x 2 x c x 2 x m 3 x 3 k 3 x 3 x c x 3 x m 4 x 4 k 4 x 4 x c x 4 x m x i 0 4 m i x x i k x f t x δ x r x x δ the last equation describes the impact condition at which the velocity after impact x is related to the velocity before impact x through the restitution coefficient 0 r 1 3 influence of a vibroimpact motion onto the sloshing dynamics to study the effect of impacts on sloshing dynamics first a nonimpacting model should be validated against an established experimental or numerical result for this purpose the experimental and numerical results reported in faltinsen et al 2000 were used with the rectangular tank size 1 73 m 0 2 m and the water level of h 0 6 m fig 6 demonstrates the results of the numerical simulations obtained using equations from 1 left column and the results presented in faltinsen et al 2000 for the excitation period of t 1 3 s top row and t 1 5 s bottom row correspondingly the simulations used zero initial conditions and the same excitation amplitude as expected the results are agreed well away from the resonance whereas the results closer to the resonance area shown in the bottom row have a slightly different pattern namely the produced results are symmetric due to the linear assumption used whereas the presented in faltinsen et al 2000 results demonstrate some nonlinear behavior with asymmetric pattern the effect of nonlinear behavior was mentioned in lepelletier and raichlen 1998 and thus it was expected to have some discrepancies in the near resonant behaviour due to adapted linear model however because the overall response amplitude agrees well the same peak to trough magnitude slightly over 0 65 m and based on the excellent agreement with the far from resonance pattern the proposed model is considered to be adequate for the purpose of studying the vibroimpact response it should be noted that a similar approach with a nonlinear lumped mass pendulum model was used in aliabadi et al 2003 and proved to be adequate for predicting a sloshing response in the cylindrical container for low and moderate amount of fuel at this point another tank dimensions are taken to simulate the system response which is presented in fig 7 where the maximum amplitude of each mass is shown in all the future simulations except when it is stated otherwise the restitution coefficient was taken r 0 9 the natural frequencies of the moving masses were relatively close to each other and for the presented case of h a 0 5 they were ω 0 2 2 ω 1 2 56 ω 2 2 99 ω 3 3 43 and ω 4 3 82 correspondingly fig 7 demonstrates the forced non impacting response of the system for different values of the excitation frequency one can observe a number of peaks including the first peak near 0 5 r a d s e c which corresponds to the response of the main mass m time responses of the system at different frequencies are shown in fig 8 for specified values of the excitation frequency as a function of time for different values of h a ratio as expected all the curves in all the figures have distinct peaks at the natural frequency of the main mass m with the increase of h a ratio the peak values go down h a 1 and then go up again for higher values of h a ratio since it is not relevant to the sloshing itself but is a feature of the external frequency of the tank one can ignore this peak around ω 0 5 the pattern of vibrations changes with the increasing h a ratio but the peak of each layer in the vicinity of its natural frequency remains common to all the figures where the peak of the m 4 is lower than the peak of the m 3 which in its turn is lower than the peak of m 2 and lower than that of m 1 however the peak of m 0 varies and can be lower than that of m 4 like in fig 8 a and b or higher than the peak of m 4 as shown in fig 8 c and d with the increase of h a ratio from 0 5 to 1 sloshing intensifies for the main harmonics and reduces for higher harmonics moving from h a 1 to h a 1 5 and h a 2 the level of sloshing either reduces or remains unchanged interestingly enough the level of vibrations of the higher harmonics corresponding to mass m 4 remains about the same for all presented values of h a next set of plots in fig 9 demonstrates the time response of the moving masses for h a 1 and different values of the excitation frequencies which were selected at the peak response of m 1 m 2 m 3 and m 4 correspondingly in fig 9 a mass m 0 is moving almost in anti phase with other masses whereas in fig 9 b masses m 0 and m 1 are moving in anti phse to the upper layers when the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of m 4 as can be seen in fig 9 d all masses are moving in phase with a lag behind the main mass imposing a two sided barrier to the system will result in the tank vibroimpact motion against these barriers as soon as the tank s displacement reaches δ the plots in fig 10 represent the maximum response amplitude of a relative motion of the moving masses for different values of h a ratio in the first two plots there is a distinct dip around ω 2 2 which disappears when h a 2 this dip is associate with the fact that no vibroimpact motion happens in the vicinity of this frequency as can be seen from fig 11 a where the phase portrait of the main mass m is presented when h a 2 the vibroimpact motion of the main mass occurs and the dip has disappeared as can be seem in fig 11 b thus the response for small values of h a ratio is very similar to one in fig 8 as can be seen from fig 11 c fig 11 d shows a typical vibroimpact response of the moving masses where the piecewise continuous response curves can be observed apart from this particular dip the overall comparison with no impact case in fig 8 demonstrates the increase in the sloshing intensity by higher level of vibrations for all the modes this increase is directly associated with vibroimpact motion of the main mass and this motion basically excites higher sloshing modes with relatively high response amplitudes 4 numerical study of a sloshing mitigation strategy using a flexible baffle the above results indicate that first of all the impacts make the sloshing more intense increasing the overall force acting on the tank walls thereby actively influencing the tank carrying structure and secondly the impacts excite high sloshing modes this increasing force on another hand can move the system away from the vibroimpact regime which results in reduced sloshing intensity the baffle or barrier which is usually assumed to be absolutely rigid and can vary in height changes the flow pattern and in some cases indeed reduces sloshing in this paper a flexible baffle is introduced which can be represented by a vertically oriented beam as shown in fig 12 a one can model it as a set of extra linear springs added to each mass if required as shown in fig 12 b where k b 0 k b 1 and so on are the stiffness of the baffle at the corresponding level when a rigid baffle is assumed it can be modeled as a very stiff barrier with a high stiffness coefficient the following set of plot in fig 13 presents a case of a short baffle tuned to the first sloshing mode only four figures correspond to different values of the stiffness coefficient k b 0 and ω 3 0 the presented results can be compared with the case of no baffle depicted in fig 10 d where the peak responses of m 4 m 3 and m 2 cross the level of 3 5 in fig 13 a the response of m 2 reaches 5 and is higher than that in the case of no baffle and with increase of k b 0 value the response remains high for the higher modes in fig 13 b however the response has reached a steady state level after 400 s where the main system was moved away from a vibroimpact motion interestingly enough the increase in the baffle stiffness does not mitigate the sloshing but keep the system in the vibroimpact mode with high oscillation level next the baffle height is increased and reaches the values associated with the second moving mass m 1 i e tuned to the second sloshing mode thus two stiffness coefficients can be selected k b 0 and k b 1 for example it can be achieved by appropriately selecting the baffle thickness keeping other parameters the same fig 14 presents four responses for the ratio h a 2 ω 3 and four sets of stiffness coefficients fig 14 a presents the response of the moving masses for k b 0 1 2 k 0 and k b 1 1 2 k 1 whereas in 14 a the stiffness coefficients were take k b 0 2 k 0 and k b 1 2 k 1 correspondingly in both these cases the extra stiffnesses of both the masses have been increased proportionally and as one can see the high intensity sloshing resulted from the vibroimpact motion continues in the system the next two plots in fig 14 c and d demonstrate the results for the different increase in the values of the stiffness coefficients so that the bottom mass has higher stiffness coefficient than the one on top of it in both these cases a relatively high level of oscillations and therefore sloshing is observed with a periodic steady state vibroimpact motion of the main mass following this design procedure the baffle height is extended to achieve the values associated with the first four moving mass with the potentially different values of the stiffness coefficients next four plots in fig 15 demonstrate the response of all the moving masses for different values of the stiffnesses coefficients modeling the baffle staring from the similar increase in the stiffness coefficients fig 15 a presents results for k b 0 2 k 0 k b 1 0 2 k 1 k b 2 0 2 k 2 and k b 3 0 2 k 3 these coefficients increased to k b 0 k 0 k b 1 k 1 k b 2 k 2 and k b 3 k 3 in fig 15 b and reach values k b 0 2 2 k 0 k b 1 2 2 k 1 k b 2 2 2 k 2 and k b 3 2 2 k 3 in fig 15 c one can clearly observe from the presented graphs that the increase in the stiffnesses does not reduce the sloshing intensity and oscillations of all the moving masses remain intense in fig 15 d one can see the response of the system when the stiffness coefficients were increased disproportionately namely k b 0 2 0 k 0 k b 1 1 5 k 1 k b 2 k 2 and k b 3 5 k 3 in this case the level of oscillations remains high and is very similar to one depicted in fig 15 c nevertheless it is possible to select the coefficients to mitigate the sloshing quite effectively as shown in fig 16 for k b 0 5 k 0 k b 1 0 4 k 1 k b 2 0 3 k 2 and k b 3 0 1 k 3 it can be seen that the maximum response for the selected set of parameters reaches only 0 3 which is 10 times smaller than that without such a baffle moreover the response amplitude of the free surface of the 5th mode modeled by mass m 4 is reduced to the level of 0 1 which is almost 40 times 5 conclusions the paper studies the sloshing phenomenon in a rectangular tank subjected to a vibroimpact harmonic motion the sloshing was approximated by the five lumped mass model with a linear spring and viscous damping where each mass system was representing a sloshing mode the proposed model without impacts was validated against existing experimental and numerical results presented in faltinsen et al 2000 and demonstrated a good agreement in the far from resonance region the results of the numerical simulations have indicated high sloshing intensity due to the vibroimpact motion of the tank when compared to the nonimpact harmonic response the sloshing mitigation strategy represented by a flexible baffle has been proposed and studied numerically the flexible baffle was modeled as an extra set of linear springs whose stiffnesses were selected appropriately to tune to a selected number of sloshing mode it has been shown that a rigid baffle may not be the most effective sloshing mitigation strategy numerical results have indicated that a flexible baffle with a properly selected step wise linear stiffness is significantly more effective than its rigid analogy namely it has been shown that a high sloshing intensity expressed in the oscillation amplitudes of sloshing modes has been reduced more than 10 times with a proper selection of the stiffness coefficients of the flexible baffle credit authorship contribution statement jian
