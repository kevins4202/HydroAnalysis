11100,while the benefits of irrigation for agricultural production are well established the effects of irrigation management on production and environmental consequences are not well quantified we used the apsim agricultural production systems simulator model to simulate the effect of six different irrigation management scenarios on pasture production and nitrogen n losses from both urine patches and non urine affected areas using new zealand farming systems as a test case nitrogen losses included nitrate no3 leaching and gaseous emissions via ammonia nh3 volatilisation and denitrification nitrous oxide n2o and dinitrogen n2 emissions the effects of different climate and rainfall regimes were simulated for three different soil types deep poorly drained otokia deep well drained templeton and shallow well drained eyre soils using 20 years of data from two climate stations with mean annual rainfall amounts of 600 and 800 mm in the shallow soil with the least plant available water more frequent irrigation with higher total annual amounts resulted in a significant increase in predicted pasture production compared with less frequent irrigation due to less plant water stress however predicted n losses through leaching denitrification and n2o emissions also increased in the deep soils pasture growth was not affected by the frequency of irrigation whereas denitrification increased with higher frequency irrigation especially in the poorly drained soil leading to increased n2o emissions based on these modelling results n losses can be reduced with little effect on production by irrigating less frequently and maintaining soil water deficits keywords apsim modelling irrigation management n leaching denitrification n2o emissions 1 introduction worldwide intensification of agriculture over the last century has led to a significant increase in food production enabled through increased use of irrigation and fertiliser wilcock et al 2011 the increasing level of intensification and land use change has been linked to adverse effects on the environment including elevated no3 levels in soils and degradation of surface waters and groundwater di and

canterbury and otago irrigation has increased dramatically over the last three decades approximately 760 000 ha of new zealand s land is irrigated with 75 of the area under pastoral production

have occurred in australia with 60 of the water consumption used for agriculture wilcock et al 2011 the economic benefits of irrigation for increasing pasture production are well established studies in canterbury which represents about 65 of irrigated land in new zealand wilcock et al 2011 have shown that irrigation can double the pasture yield compared to non irrigated land clark et al 2007 martin et al 2006 thorrold et al 2004 enabling intensification and expansion of farm systems or land use change from less intensive sheep or beef farms to higher value dairying apart from increased yields irrigation provides greater reliability of production with less year to year variability vogeler et al 2016b and improved quality of products environmental consequences of this intensification due to irrigation are however not well quantified new zealand irrigation practices are diverse ranging from surface flood irrigation to subsurface drip irrigation most irrigation water in new zealand is applied using a wide range of overhead sprinkler systems with 80 of the irrigation applied in canterbury using a spray system dynes et al 2010 key characteristics of the management of these overhead systems are the application depth and frequency return interval between irrigation that they apply water for example centre pivot systems tend to apply small amounts of irrigation often typically 5 to 15 mm per application whereas some other travelling gun or boom type systems may apply 30 to 60 mm weekly or less frequently thomas et al 2006 regionally pasture or crop irrigation requirements vary depending on rainfall inputs and the amount of plant available water stored in the soil nutrient losses are likely to be function of both the amount of irrigation and soil type carrick et al 2013 francis et al 2006 while n2o emissions are strongly related to the soil drainage characteristics and moisture content van der weerden et al 2014 according to the guidelines provided

point in the rooting zone 0 5 m for an irrigated pasture when the potential evaporation is 5 mm day this water stress point will vary as evaporative demand increases or decreases and with different pasture species while some studies suggest that deficits of 35 60 mm would not impact on pasture growth other studies have demonstrated that an adequate soil moisture in the topsoil soil moisture deficit does not increase beyond 12 20 mm is important for pasture growth due to the generally higher nutrient status in this soil layer sumanasena et al 2011 agricultural systems models such as the agricultural production systems simulator apsim www apsim info holzworth et al 2014 are increasingly being used to assess the effects of changes in farm practice on economic and environmental outcomes vellinga et al 2001 vibart et al 2015 vogeler et al 2016a understanding the impact that differences in climate soils and management have on pasture growth and environmental impact will enable more sound management practices tailored to site specific conditions the objective of this paper is to investigate the impacts of irrigation management on pasture production and n losses in contrasting soils and under different climatic conditions using the apsim modelling framework 2 materials and methods 2 1 apsim model description apsim is a modular process oriented simulation framework maintained by the apsim initiative www apsim info the primary modules used in the simulation for this study included the soil module swim2 verburg et al 1996 based on richards equation for water flow and the convection dispersion equation for solute transport the surfaceom and soiln modules for soil c and n transformations probert et al 1998 and a custom built module to describe the volatilisation of ammonia vogeler et al 2013b and agpasture li et al 2011 with a mix of ryegrass lolium perenne l and white clover trifolium repens l for pasture growth and n uptake 2 2 apsim model set up to assess the effect of irrigation management on pasture production and n loss pathways apsim modelling scenarios were set up with two contrasting climates and three different soil types to cover a range of environmental conditions and year to year variability all climate by soil type combinations were run for the 20 years the modelling set up was based on field trials conducted in two regions of the south island new zealand canterbury and otago details of the experiments and testing of the model are provided in thomas et al 2016 all the simulations used in this study were derived from a base simulation which was based on the experimental design for the control and the urine treatments in this base simulation the pasture was cut every 21 days to a residual of 1500 kg dm ha n fertiliser was applied at a rate of 30 kg n ha on 15 august october december february and april totalling 150 kg n ha year irrigation was applied from october to april according to the six different irrigation scenarios described below urine was applied at rates of 0 or 600 kg n ha the latter representative of a typical dairy cow urine n loading haynes and williams 1993 to understand the effect of timing of deposition urine was applied monthly in separate simulation runs to capture the full potential for n leaching from urine patches the simulations were run for two years with n leaching defined as the amount of n leached past a depth of either 0 45 or 0 6 m this base simulation was modified by varying either the irrigation treatment year month of urine deposition soil type or climate location thus covering a wide range of environmental conditions details are provided below a total of 17 280 simulations were run all simulations were initialised three months before to allow the simulation variables to adjust to environmental conditions thus reducing effects of the initial conditions the outputs from those three months were discarded two climate stations located in the canterbury region lincoln and hororata were selected on the basis of having long term average annual rainfalls of about 600 and 800 mm table 1 daily weather data 1992 to 2011 were accessed from the niwa virtual climate station vcs network tait et al 2006 the three different soil types were selected to represent typical irrigated pasture soils types within the canterbury region of new zealand these were deep poorly drained otokia deep well drained templeton and shallow well drained eyre soils table 2 the soils hydraulic properties were obtained from data from the new zealand national soils database nz nsd wilde 2003 pedotransfer functions were used to complement the soils hydraulic properties cichota et al 2013 six irrigation management scenarios were chosen to provide a wide range of irrigation frequencies and soil moisture contents that would be applicable to the range of irrigation systems used for pasture irrigation in new zealand irrigation scenarios included applying different depths of irrigation 10 30 and 50 mm with trigger soil moisture deficits ranging from 10 to 60 mm and either no deficit or a deficit of 10 mm after irrigation table 3 rules allowed the intervals to vary and to prevent applying irrigation after a rainfall amount of 5 mm on the previous day 2 3 data analysis daily simulation outputs included irrigation amounts pasture production no3 leaching losses denitrification n2o emissions and ammonia volatilisation these were aggregated to annual values for every simulation run the annual output values for each month from the urine and non urine patch areas were then

package www jmp com the student s t test a 0 05 was used to determine significant differences between treatments 3 results and discussions 3 1 pasture production irrigation frequency and application depth significantly affected annual pasture dry matter dm production for the eyre soil ranging from an average over the 20 years simulated of 18 1 t ha at the low frequency large application depth irr6 to 19 3 t ha at the high frequency low application depth irr1 for the warmer lincoln climate and from 17 3 t ha to 18 1 t ha for the cooler hororata climate fig 1 a and b and table 4 year to year variability accounted for a difference of about 1 5 t ha and 2 5 t ha for the lincoln and hororata climate for the templeton soil irrigation frequency and application depth significantly affected only dm production under the lincoln climate p 0 05 but to a much smaller extent ranging from 19 5 to 19 8 t ha for the templeton soil with the hororata climate and the otokia soil with both the lincoln and the hororata climate dm production was not significantly affected by irrigation management figs 1 c to d broadly our dry matter results are consistent with our trigger points exceeding the soil depletion values when plant water stress occurs estimated using the fao approach allen et al 1998 maximum soil water depletion for the eyre templeton and otokia are 38 mm 55 mm and 58 mm respectively based on paw values in table 2 and assuming a rooting depth of 0 5 m and potential evaporation rate of 5 mm day sumanasena et al 2011 working in the manawatu region of new zealand on a manawatu fine sandy loam similarly found a significant increase in pasture pure ryegrass dm growth with increased irrigation frequency trigged by 20 mm deficit compared with a trigger deficit of 40 mm or 60 mm the total annual amount of irrigation averaged over the 20 years simulated varies with soil type and climate as well as with irrigation management table 4 as expected lower amounts were required in the wetter hororata climate and the deeper soils with higher paw table 4 from the various irrigation treatments the lowest amounts were applied at low frequency high application depth irr6 the irrigation amounts for the shallow eyre soil are similar to the irrigation requirement simulated by the soil plant atmosphere system model for a light soil in canterbury which equated to 525 mm in an average year with a probability of needing 650 mm being about 10 clothier et al 2010 these values are also almost identical to simulations based on a water balance model for a shallow silt loam soil in the canterbury area given by horne et al 2011 with an average over 30 years of 484 mm and 364 at trigger deficits of 20 mm and 60 mm the required irrigation for any climate soil irrigation treatment is highly variable across years with a difference between the minimum and maximum required amount of about 300 mm year table 4 to calculate the cost of irrigation for the various sites and irrigation treatments we assumed an average cost of irrigation in the canterbury region of 0 14 nz m3 of water reese and borrie 2014 which equates to average water costs ranging from 500 to 660 nz ha for the drier lincoln climate and from 300 to 500 nz ha in the wetter hororata climate table 4 across soils and climates irrigation costs at the higher frequency lower application depth irr1 are on average 150 110 and 70 nz ha higher compared with the lower frequency high application depth irr6 changing irrigation management from high frequency irrigation could potentially lead to large cost savings for an individual farm in particular the largest savings can be made for the deeper templeton and otokia soils as production is not affected as production was affected by the larger deficit management of the eyre soil irr4 to 6 the cost savings moving from irr1 to irr3 are lower on average nz 47 ha if irrigating is scheduled to achieve the highest production 3 2 nitrate leaching overall applying more irrigation resulted in higher average no3 leaching estimates for each soil and climate tables 4 and 5 nitrate leaching at a depth of 600 mm was much greater from the shallow eyre soil compared with the deeper templeton and otokia soil with an average over the irrigation treatments and years of 40 and 51 kg n ha yr for the lincoln and hororata climate stations fig 2 greater leaching for the wetter hororata climate is due to 80 mm greater drainage in comparison average n leaching in the templeton soil was 28 and 39 kg n ha year and for the otokia 14 and 19 kg n ha year for the lincoln and hororata climate stations respectively these results are in accordance with other studies who have reported higher n leaching from shallow soils compared with deeper soils lilburne and webb 2002 vogeler et al 2013a significant differences in n leaching due to irrigation management was only found in the eyre soil with highest n leaching under high frequency low intensity irr1 and lowest leaching in low frequency high intensity irr6 for the eyre soil the additional average pasture grown under irr1 of 1200 kg dm ha year compared with irr6 resulted in an additional average n leaching of 8 1 kg n ha year this is equivalent to an additional n leaching of 6 75 kg ha for an additional 1 t ha dm grown or an additional n leaching of 0 08 kg ha mm of additional irrigation water applied nitrate leaching at a depth of 600 mm was lower than at 450 mm with average reduction of 16 in the eyre soil and 36 and 34 in the deeper templeton and otokia soil this highlights the importance of maintaining the no3 in the upper soil profile in soils with high hydraulic conductivities and low paw e g shallow free draining eyre soil table 2 so that the plants can take up the soil no3 before it can be leached most of this paddock scale n leaching originates from urine patches with losses highly dependent on the month of the urine deposition this dependency has been shown previously shepherd et al 2011 vogeler et al 2013a and is shown as an example for the templeton soil under the lincoln climate in fig 3 highest leaching occurs from urine depositions in summer and autumn december to may while in all months leaching losses under urine patches are higher under more frequent low application depth irrigation this effect is pronounced in the march to may autumn period fig 3b suggesting that especially in these months irrigation should be less frequent to avoid n leaching losses 3 3 denitrification and n2o emissions denitrification and n2o emissions were as expected much higher in the slow poorly draining otokia soil compared with the free draining eyre and templeton soils fig 4 and 5 this is due to the higher saturation level with an average water filled pores space wfps in the topsoil 0 75 mm over the first 20 days following urine application of 0 80 in the otokia soil and of 0 70 in the eyre soil all soils and climates showed significantly higher denitrification and n2o emissions under high frequency low intensity irrigation irr1 compared with low frequency high intensity irr6 due to the soils being above a critical moisture content which favours denitrification van der weerden et al 2017 in the apsim model the factor accounting for the limitation of water content for denitrification is scaled from total suppression at field capacity to no limitation at saturation with a wfps of 1 leaving a deficit of 10 mm after irrigation decreased the wfps in the topsoils from 0 80 to 0 73 in the otokia soil from 0 78 to 0 73 in the templeton soil and from 0 70 to 0 62 in the eyre soil this reduction in soil saturation also decreased denitrification significantly ammonia nh3 volatilisation was higher in the warmer lincoln climate compared with the hororata climate in contrast to the other n losses volatilisation was higher under the low frequency high intensity irr6 compared with the high frequency low intensity irr1 irrigation management in all soils and climates fig 6 4 conclusions simulating irrigation management scenarios using a farm system model such as apsim provides a cost effective way of identifying the impact of different irrigation management practices for a range of soils and climates of particular value is the ability to simulate pasture or crop growth no3 leaching nh3 and n2o emissions in response to farm management practices that enables analysis of the trade off between production and environmental costs and benefits of irrigation management strategies in this study we were able to demonstrate that on deep soils deficit practices should be used to both reduce irrigation application costs and reduce n leaching losses without compromising production deficit irrigation also has the benefit of reducing n2o emissions especially important for fine textured or poorly draining soils less frequent irrigation and maintaining lower soil water contents will also reduce denitrification losses of no3 reducing an agronomic loss of n more frequent irrigation did have a benefit of reducing nh3 emissions however this might be reduced if irrigation occurred soon after grazing manure or urea fertiliser application if large soil moisture deficits are maintained then this impact is likely to be reduced without necessarily increasing risks of n2o or no3 leaching losses our simulations also demonstrate the benefits of irrigating pasture growing on deep soils compared to shallow soils because these soils had more paw storage if well managed they can build up larger deficits before plants are water stressed from an environmental sustainability perspective the soils with greater paw require less irrigation capture more rainfall drain and leach less in comparison soils with lower paw such as shallow soils will require more careful management to maintain soil moisture deficits while avoiding plant water stress to minimise water n2o or no3 leaching losses acknowledgments this research was funded by the ministry for primary industries sustainable land management and climate change slmacc research programme and the plant food research strategic science investment fund

water stress however predicted n losses through leaching denitrification and n2o emissions also increased in the deep soils pasture growth was not affected by the frequency of irrigation whereas

nitrate leaching at a depth of 600 mm was lower than at 450 mm with average reduction of 16 in the eyre soil and 36 and 34 in the deeper templeton and otokia soil this highlights the importance of maintaining the no3 in the upper soil profile in soils with high hydraulic conductivities and low paw e g shallow free draining eyre soil table 2 so that the plants can take up the soil no3 before it can be leached most of this paddock scale n leaching originates from urine patches with losses highly dependent on the month of the urine deposition this dependency has been shown previously shepherd et al 2011 vogeler et al 2013a and is shown as an example for the templeton soil under the lincoln climate in fig 3 highest leaching occurs from urine depositions in summer and autumn december to may while in all months leaching losses under urine patches are higher under more frequent low application depth irrigation this effect is pronounced in the march to may autumn period fig 3b suggesting that especially in these months irrigation should be less frequent to avoid n leaching losses 3 3 denitrification and n2o emissions denitrification and n2o emissions were as expected much higher in the slow poorly draining otokia soil compared with the free draining eyre and templeton soils fig 4 and 5 this is due to the higher saturation level with an average water filled pores space wfps in the topsoil 0 75 mm over the first 20 days following urine application of 0 80 in the otokia soil and of 0 70 in the eyre soil all soils and climates showed significantly higher denitrification and n2o emissions under high frequency low intensity irrigation irr1 compared with low frequency high intensity irr6 due to the soils being above a critical moisture content which favours denitrification van der weerden et al 2017 in the apsim model the factor accounting for the limitation of water content for denitrification is scaled from total suppression at field capacity to no limitation at saturation with a wfps of 1 leaving a deficit of 10 mm after irrigation decreased the wfps in the topsoils from 0 80 to 0 73 in the otokia soil from 0 78 to 0 73 in the templeton soil and from 0 70 to 0 62 in the eyre soil this reduction in soil saturation also decreased denitrification significantly ammonia nh3 volatilisation was higher in the warmer lincoln climate compared with the hororata climate in contrast to the other n losses volatilisation was higher under the low frequency high intensity irr6 compared with the high frequency low intensity irr1 irrigation management in all soils and climates fig 6 4 conclusions simulating irrigation management scenarios using a farm system model such as apsim provides a cost effective way of identifying the impact of different irrigation management practices for a range of soils and climates of particular value is the ability to simulate pasture or crop growth no3 leaching nh3 and n2o emissions in response to farm management practices that enables analysis of the trade off between production and environmental costs and benefits of irrigation management strategies in this study we were able to demonstrate that on deep soils deficit practices should be used to both reduce irrigation application costs and reduce n leaching losses without compromising production deficit irrigation also has the benefit of reducing n2o emissions especially important for fine textured or poorly draining soils less frequent irrigation and maintaining lower soil water contents will also reduce denitrification losses of no3 reducing an agronomic loss of n more frequent irrigation did have a benefit of reducing nh3 emissions however this might be reduced if irrigation occurred soon after grazing manure or urea fertiliser application if large soil moisture deficits are maintained then this impact is likely to be reduced without necessarily increasing risks of n2o or no3 leaching losses our simulations also demonstrate the benefits of irrigating pasture growing on deep soils compared to shallow soils because these soils had more paw storage if well managed they can build up larger deficits before plants are water stressed from an environmental sustainability perspective the soils with greater paw require less irrigation capture more rainfall drain and leach less in comparison soils with lower paw such as shallow soils will require more careful management to maintain soil moisture deficits while avoiding plant water stress to minimise water n2o or no3 leaching losses acknowledgments this research was funded by the

dehydration were detected in stomata and trichome measurements as compared to watered plants for chemlali and chetoui cultivars the epidermal observations of the stressed leaves from the two cultivars have a significant increase in both stomatal and trichome densities table 2 chemlali and chetoui cvs showed the highest stomatal density when the soil is amended by hydrogel in drought stress the same trend was observed in trichome density table 2 also the leaf area the number of leaves shoot length and stem diameter shown in table 2 were increased in ts treatment for both cultivars for stressed and watered conditions and for both cultivars ts treatment gives usually the best value of leaf area and stem diameter table 2 furthermore in stressed conditions the stockosorb treatment showed the highest number of leaves 203 and 167 for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively the greatest value of shoot length under drought stress was found in tss treatment 71 5 cm for chemlali cv while there is no significant difference between tcs and tss treatments for chetoui cv in irrigated conditions tsi treatment has also the highest value of shoot length 87 5 cm and 105 cm for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively as shown in table 2 a high significant result p 0 001 was detected in wr with regard to stomata and trichome densities leaf area the number of leaves shoot height and

highest values of roots dry weights about 9 36 g and 10 41 g for both chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively in watered regime root dry weights with tsi treatment were about 15 42 g and 14 15 g

chemlali and chetoui cultivars and were about 49 07 and 38 38 respectively data not shown as indicated in table 3 significant interactions were detected between the hydrogel water regime and cultivars s cv wr with regard to rwc parameter 3 5 maximal quantum efÔ¨Åciency of the photosystem ii the maximal quantum efÔ¨Åciency of the photosystem ii was used to detect changes produced by drought stress

stress the same trend was found in irrigated plants for both cultivars thus stockosorb treatment has the highest fv fm ratio 0 76 and 0 80 for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively as shown in table 4 statistical analysis demonstrated that there was a highly significant interaction p 0 001 between the hydrogel water regime and cultivars s cv wr with regard to the fv fm ratio 3 6 photosynthetic pigment content photosynthetic pigments were recorded under two water conditions in olive leaves chl a b and carotenoid car contents were decreased significantly under drought stress

respectively as compared to control plants in stressed conditions the tsi treatment has shown also the greatest values of total chlorophyll in irrigated conditions table 4 about 1 11 mg g 1 fm and 1 01 mg g 1 fm for both chemali and chetoui cultivars respectively the same finding was obtained for chemlali cv on car concentration table 4 for stressed and irrigated conditions for chetoui cv plants treated with stockosorb have also the highest value of car 0 18 mg g 1 fm as compared to tcs treatment 0 15 mg g 1 fm under stress conditions however under well watered conditions ts treatment has the highest chlorophyll and car contents for chemlali cv while chetoui cv has the highest ones under drought stress as shown in table 4 also a heigh significances of interactions p 0 01 in cv wr and s cv

significantly under drought stress as compared to irrigated status under dehydration the less value of total phenols was obtained in the tss treatment 53 94 mg g 1 gae whereas tcs treatment has the highest value 74 36 mg g 1 gae for chemlali cv the same finding was obtained in chetoui cv total phenols was about 57 37 mg g 1 gae in tss treatment in irrigated conditions the tsi treatment has the greatest values 43 93 mg g 1 gae and 45 06 mg g 1 gae for both chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively there is also a heigh statistical significances p 0 01 in the interactions s cv and s wr 3 8 proline content under no irrigation conditions the highest proline accumulation was found in non treated plants 0 017 mg g 1 fm for the chemlali cv table 4 there is no significant difference between both cultivars when the soil was amended by hydrogel under watered regime 0 011 mg g 1 fm as compared to tci treatment the hydrogel tsi increased leaf proline concentrations in well watered regime while it decreased significantly under drought stress in both chemlali and chetoui cultivars as shown in table 4 proline content showed a significance difference in the interactions cv wr and s wr and s cv wr 4 discussion the importance of olive productivity is still rising because of the continuous increase of his beneficial effects on health issues one probably alternative to enhance olive production is to ameliorate tolerance against stressful conditions by the amendment of hydrogels in the soils in this paper we reported our experience with a new hydrogel in the case of olea europaea l during water stress and well watered conditions chemlali and chetoui cultivars are the main extensively cultivated olive cultivars in tunisia despite the importance of these two cultivars little information was provided about their responses to water deficit during the dry season when the soil is amended with hydrogel our experimental study evaluates morpho anatomical and physiological responses in two tunisian olive cultivars under well watered and drought stress regimes our results showed that soil humidity was increased in the soil amended by hydrogel ts than in tc treatment as proved by marandi et al 2009 hydrogels are able to absorb and store an important quantity of water up to hundreds of times their own weight chehab et al 2017 confirmed also that hydrogel amendment in soils improved their water holding capacity indeed some studies explained that the hydrogel polymers do not interact directly with the soil matrices after its application it forms an aqueous gels which have diameters in the range of cm and act as a water reservoir in the plant roots drought stressed plants in order to tolerate stressful conditions developed anatomical alterations in their leaves in this fact we control stomatal and trichome densities to find the contribution of anatomical responses in olive leaves that could interfere with plants treated with water deficit in our paper drought stress induced a decrease in density of stomata with a parallel increase in trichomes density compared with results found under well watered conditions changes in stomata density may be an important mechanism that optimizes water productivity for tolerant olive cultivar to drought stress in the same case we suggest that stomata play an important role in plant physiology because they can adapt to environmental changes cornic et al 2000 thus chemlali and chetoui cultivars could be noted as tolerant to drought stress grown under greenhouse conditions it is well documented that leaf trichomes function is a physical barrier to heat and drought stress guerfel et al 2009 to the emission of co2 and h2o and it is a protecting form against ultraviolet b radiation damages liakopoulos et al 2006 as shown in table 2 ts treatment enhanced significantly both stomata and trichomes densities the rise of these parameters under drought stress in ts treatment as compared to control plants may be a drought tolerant situation for the two cultivars in addition the increase of these epidermal structures in olive leaves contributes to better transpirational control bosabalidis and kofidis 2002 our results presented here differed from those reported by guerfel et al 2009 whose demonstrated that a tolerant cultivar has a lower trichome density but their results reported the most resistant olive cultivar to water stress without hydrogel addition in soil several experiments have demonstrated that growth measurments are reduced significantly under drought in olive plants guerfel et al 2009 in our study drought stress had a negative effect on almost of the growth parameters tested whereas in ts treatment we noted an improvement of the growth in leaf area shoot length and stem diameter this finding suggests that hydrogel may enhance growth under both water regimes by improving water status in fact bouranis et al 1995 confirmed that the enhancement of hydrophilic polymers on plant drought tolerance is due to the supplementary water obtained from the hydrophilic polymer granules that improved water availability in water deficit conditions thus we suggest that the roots of olive plantlets pick up water from the polymer granules and growth damages were consequently alleviated in addition to growth parameters results showed also a significant decrease in plant dry weights under drought stress compared to watered regime table 3 we found that irrigated plants have a significant higher growth values than the stressed plants as well as a higher root dry weight table 3 rana munns 2005 reported that dry biomass of plants is an important parameter to stress perception after dehydration soil amended by hydrogel showed a significant increase in dry weights for chemlali and chetoui cultivars indeed the increase of root dry weight by the stockosorb application was about 27 06 chemlali cv and 32 15 chetoui cv for stressed plants results showed clearly that stockosorb treatment is a real solution to reserve water disponibility in plantlets of both chemlali and chetoui cultivars in fact hydrogels enhance also the amount of available water to the plant beniwal et al 2010 similarly marandi et al 2009 reported that hydrogels are able to adsorb a large part of water a highly significant interactions between s wr in one hand and between s cv in the other hand were detected in plant dry weights this observation confirms usually that hydrogel is able to absorb and store a large part of water under stressful conditions therefore we suggest that the plant roots can take up water from the hydrophilic polymers when the conditions are unfavorable our research demonstrated that rwc decreased significantly with the decrease of water availability the ts treatment has the highest values of rwc in drought conditions mainly in chemlali cv as described in above parameters chemlali cv showed a better tolerance in stressed conditions this proved the higher water maintenance of stockosorb his efficiency of water retention and his disponibility in soil accordingly some researchers proved that rwc is the main indicator of plant drought stress than leaf water potential rouina et al 2007 as noted by wildhagen et al 2009 hydrogels applied to the rooting medium may store water during irrigation and then release the water progressively along drought period shi et al 2010 savi et al 2014 claimed that hydrogel can enhance the water holding capacity and water disponibility of green roof substrates and improve plant performance naouraz et al 2018 furtheremore the high maintain of leaf water status under water deficit is a great test to detect the dehydration tolerance level similarly our research indicates that stockosorb ameliorates the capacity of both cultivars to retain water in the soil when water is available and its distribution when the conditions are unfavorables in other cases the cultivars that maintained high rwc under stress maintain also a high fv fm ratio and experienced the lowest injury to psii performance this finding is in agreement with our results which showed that under drought stress chemlali cv presents a higher value of rwc and fv fm when the soil is amended by hydrogel as demonstrated by boughalleb and hajlaoui 2011 water deficit may induce destruction of photosynthetic pigments after dehydration our results suggest that ts treatment has increased and ameliorated photosynthetic pigment in olive leaves for both cultivars as compared with control plants furthermore stockosorb may prevent the olive tree from oxidative stress and ameliorate photosynthetic pigments by the increase of chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations our paper showed clearly that chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were significantly enhanced when the soil is amended by the stockosorb hydrogel in the same case wei et al 2016 who demonstrated that the addition of water retaining polymer could increase the plant leaf photosynthetic performances the decrease in chlorophyll content has been widely described to be a great symptom of oxidative stress in one hand and may be the result of pigment photo oxidation chlorophyll degradation and or chlorophyll synthesis deficiency in the other hand the decrease of both total phenols and proline content in chemlali cv under stressed conditions seems to be related to olive protection from drought stress and confirms that plants treated with stockosorb were better protected than control plants as compared to control plants total phenols of drought stressed plants were decreased by 50 09 and 10 01 for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively in ts treatment while proline content was reduced by 39 01 and 12 16 for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively these results are significantly higher for chemlali cv than chetoui cv proline secondary metabolite is well known as the main osmoregulatory compounds of olive leaves indicating an essential mechanism to avoid stress in contrast ottow et al 2005 claimed that proline could not contribute directly to osmotic adjustment the above data evidenced that proline accumulation is an indicator of drought stress situation because it increases significantly in leaves as compared with irrigated conditions in accordance with our results ahmed et al 2009 reported that chemlali cv as a drought tolerant cultivar showed the greatest accumulation of proline compared to picholine and meski cultivars it has been demonstrated that the accumulation of proline in olive leaves is related to water deficit ahmed et al 2009 but the mechanism of this pattern is not explained yet 5 conclusion data for improvement of stressful conditions of olive trees olea europaea l still lacking and up to now the intimate interactions between hydrogels and olive trees are not well understood the present study shows that the amendment of stockosorb 660 in soil can improve different responses under drought stress mainly for chemlali cv than chetoui cv other studies should be developed to a better understanding of the beneficial effect of stockosorb amendement in soil acknowledgments we wish to thank the

chetoui cultivars soil moisture was recorded at the beginning and at the end of the experiments table 1 the plantlets grown when the soil was amended by stockosorb hydrogel and subjected to drought stress showed a greater hydration of the soil moisture the soil moisture varied from 68 to 35 for ts treatment and from 55 to 2 for non treated plantlets tc 3 2 growth responses changes due to dehydration were detected in stomata and trichome measurements as compared to watered plants for chemlali and chetoui cultivars the epidermal observations of the stressed leaves from the two cultivars have a significant increase in both stomatal and trichome densities table 2 chemlali and chetoui cvs showed the highest stomatal density when the soil is amended by hydrogel in drought stress the same trend was observed in trichome density table 2 also the leaf area the number of leaves shoot length and stem diameter shown in table 2 were increased in ts treatment for both cultivars for stressed and watered conditions and for both cultivars ts treatment gives usually the best value of leaf area and stem diameter table 2 furthermore in stressed conditions the stockosorb treatment showed the highest number of leaves 203 and 167 for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively the greatest value of shoot length under drought stress was found in tss treatment 71 5 cm for chemlali cv while there is no significant difference between tcs and tss treatments for chetoui cv in irrigated conditions tsi treatment has also the highest value of shoot length 87 5 cm and 105 cm for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively as shown in table 2 a high significant result p 0 001 was detected in wr with regard to stomata and trichome densities leaf area the number of leaves shoot height and stem diameter 3 3 dry weight the results presented in table 3 suggest that stockosorb treatment enhance leaf shoot and root biomass under no irrigation conditions plants treated with hydrogel have the highest values of roots dry weights about 9 36 g and 10 41 g for both chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively in watered regime root dry weights with tsi treatment were about 15 42 g and 14 15 g for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively a high statistical interactions p 0 01 were obtained in wr s and cv wr with regard to leaves shoot and root dry weights table 3 3 4 leaf water status the rwc table 3 was carried out to evaluate the water availability under water deficit for both cultivars under irrigated conditions the rwc for chemlali cv was about 94 68 and 94 16 for tci and tsi treatments respectively while it was about 59 88 and 80 40 for chetoui plants in tci and tsi treatments respectively for non treated plants drought stress induced reductions in this parameter for both chemlali and chetoui cultivars and were about 49 07 and 38 38 respectively data not shown as indicated in table 3 significant interactions were detected between the hydrogel water regime and cultivars s cv wr with regard to rwc parameter 3 5 maximal quantum efÔ¨Åciency of the photosystem ii the maximal quantum efÔ¨Åciency of the photosystem ii was used to detect changes produced by drought stress as shown in table 4 this ratio was significantly higher in irrigated plants than in stressed plants for chemlali and chetoui cultivars in drought stress chemlali cv has shown the lowest value of fv fm ratio 0 17 in control plants as compared to chetoui cv 0 20 the greatest value of fv fm ratio was found in tsi treatment 0 53 and 0 36 for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively under drought stress the same trend was found in irrigated plants for both cultivars thus stockosorb treatment has the highest fv fm ratio 0 76 and 0 80 for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively as shown in table 4 statistical analysis demonstrated that there was a highly significant interaction p 0 001 between the hydrogel water regime and cultivars s cv wr with regard to the fv fm ratio 3 6 photosynthetic pigment content photosynthetic pigments were recorded under two water conditions in olive leaves chl a b and carotenoid car contents were decreased significantly under drought stress for both chemlali and chetoui cultivars as shown in table 4 stockosorb treatment has the highest chlorophyll contents of 0 76 mg g 1 fm and 0 82 mg g 1 fm for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively as compared to control plants in stressed conditions the tsi treatment has shown also the greatest values of total chlorophyll in irrigated conditions table 4 about 1 11 mg g 1 fm and 1 01 mg g 1 fm for both chemali and chetoui cultivars respectively the same finding was obtained for chemlali cv on car concentration table 4 for stressed and irrigated conditions for chetoui cv plants treated with stockosorb have also the highest value of car 0 18 mg g 1 fm as compared to tcs treatment 0 15 mg g 1 fm under stress conditions however under well watered conditions ts treatment has the highest chlorophyll and car contents for chemlali cv while chetoui cv has the highest ones under drought stress as shown in table 4 also a heigh significances of interactions p 0 01 in cv wr and s cv wr with regard to chl a b and car 3 7 total phenols total phenols were calculated under two water regimes in leaves of the two cultivars table 4 the concentrations of this parameter were increased significantly under drought stress as compared to irrigated status under dehydration the less value of total phenols was obtained in the tss treatment 53 94 mg g 1 gae whereas tcs treatment has the highest value 74 36 mg g 1 gae for chemlali cv the same finding was obtained in chetoui cv total phenols was about 57 37 mg g 1 gae in tss treatment in irrigated conditions the tsi treatment has the greatest values 43 93 mg g 1 gae and 45 06 mg g 1 gae for both chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively there is also a heigh statistical significances p 0 01 in the interactions s cv and s wr 3 8 proline content under no irrigation conditions the highest proline accumulation was found in non treated plants 0 017 mg g 1 fm for the chemlali cv table 4 there is no significant difference between both cultivars when the soil was amended by hydrogel under watered regime 0 011 mg g 1 fm as compared to tci treatment the hydrogel tsi increased leaf proline concentrations in well watered regime while it decreased significantly under drought stress in both chemlali and chetoui cultivars as shown in table 4 proline content showed a significance difference in the interactions cv wr and s wr and s cv wr 4 discussion the importance of olive productivity is still rising because of the continuous increase of his beneficial effects on health issues one probably alternative to enhance olive production is to ameliorate tolerance against stressful conditions by the amendment of hydrogels in the soils in this paper we reported our experience with a new hydrogel in the case of olea europaea l during water stress and well watered conditions chemlali and chetoui cultivars are the main extensively cultivated olive cultivars in tunisia despite the importance of these two cultivars little information was provided about their responses to water deficit during the dry season when the soil is amended with hydrogel our experimental study evaluates morpho anatomical and physiological responses in two tunisian olive cultivars under well watered and drought stress regimes our results showed that soil humidity was increased in the soil amended by hydrogel ts than in tc treatment as proved by marandi et al 2009 hydrogels are able to absorb and store an important quantity of water up to hundreds of times their own weight chehab et al 2017 confirmed also that hydrogel amendment in soils improved their water holding capacity indeed some studies explained that the hydrogel polymers do not interact directly with the soil matrices after its application it forms an aqueous gels which have diameters in the range of cm and act as a water reservoir in the plant roots drought stressed plants in order to tolerate stressful conditions developed anatomical alterations in their leaves in this fact we control stomatal and trichome densities to find the contribution of anatomical responses in olive leaves that could interfere with plants treated with water deficit in our paper drought stress induced a decrease in density of stomata with a parallel increase in trichomes density compared with results found under well watered conditions changes in stomata density may be an important mechanism that optimizes water productivity for tolerant olive cultivar to drought stress in the same case we suggest that stomata play an important role in plant physiology because they can adapt to environmental changes cornic et al 2000 thus chemlali and chetoui cultivars could be noted as tolerant to drought stress grown under greenhouse conditions it is well documented that leaf trichomes function is a physical barrier to heat and drought stress guerfel et al 2009 to the emission of co2 and h2o and it is a protecting form against ultraviolet b radiation damages liakopoulos et al 2006 as shown in table 2 ts treatment enhanced significantly both stomata and trichomes densities the rise of these parameters under drought stress in ts treatment as compared to control plants may be a drought tolerant situation for the two cultivars in addition the increase of these epidermal structures in olive leaves contributes to better transpirational control bosabalidis and kofidis 2002 our results presented here differed from those reported by guerfel et al 2009 whose demonstrated that a tolerant cultivar has a lower trichome density but their results reported the most resistant olive cultivar to water stress without hydrogel addition in soil several experiments have demonstrated that growth measurments are reduced significantly under drought in olive plants guerfel et al 2009 in our study drought stress had a negative effect on almost of the growth parameters tested whereas in ts treatment we noted an improvement of the growth in leaf area shoot length and stem diameter this finding suggests that hydrogel may enhance growth under both water regimes by improving water status in fact bouranis et al 1995 confirmed that the enhancement of hydrophilic polymers on plant drought tolerance is due to the supplementary water obtained from the hydrophilic polymer granules that improved water availability in water deficit conditions thus we suggest that the roots of olive plantlets pick up water from the polymer granules and growth damages were consequently alleviated in addition to growth parameters results showed also a significant decrease in plant dry weights under drought stress compared to watered regime table 3 we found that irrigated plants have a significant higher growth values than the stressed plants as well as a higher root dry weight table 3 rana munns 2005 reported that dry biomass of plants is an important parameter to stress perception after dehydration soil amended by hydrogel showed a significant increase in dry weights for chemlali and chetoui cultivars indeed the increase of root dry weight by the stockosorb application was about 27 06 chemlali cv and 32 15 chetoui cv for stressed plants results showed clearly that stockosorb treatment is a real solution to reserve water disponibility in plantlets of both chemlali and chetoui cultivars in fact hydrogels enhance also the amount of available water to the plant beniwal et al 2010 similarly marandi et al 2009 reported that hydrogels are able to adsorb a large part of water a highly significant interactions between s wr in one hand and between s cv in the other hand were detected in plant dry weights this observation confirms usually that hydrogel is able to absorb and store a large part of water under stressful conditions therefore we suggest that the plant roots can take up water from the hydrophilic polymers when the conditions are unfavorable our research demonstrated that rwc decreased significantly with the decrease of water availability the ts treatment has the highest values of rwc in drought conditions mainly in chemlali cv as described in above parameters chemlali cv showed a better tolerance in stressed conditions this proved the higher water maintenance of stockosorb his efficiency of water retention and his disponibility in soil accordingly some researchers proved that rwc is the main indicator of plant drought stress than leaf water potential rouina et al 2007 as noted by wildhagen et al 2009 hydrogels applied to the rooting medium may store water during irrigation and then release the water progressively along drought period shi et al 2010 savi et al 2014 claimed that hydrogel can enhance the water holding capacity and water disponibility of green roof substrates and improve plant performance naouraz et al 2018 furtheremore the high maintain of leaf water status under water deficit is a great test to detect the dehydration tolerance level similarly our research indicates that stockosorb ameliorates the capacity of both cultivars to retain water in the soil when water is available and its distribution when the conditions are unfavorables in other cases the cultivars that maintained high rwc under stress maintain also a high fv fm ratio and experienced the lowest injury to psii performance this finding is in agreement with our results which showed that under drought stress chemlali cv presents a higher value of rwc and fv fm when the soil is amended by hydrogel as demonstrated by boughalleb and hajlaoui 2011 water deficit may induce destruction of photosynthetic pigments after dehydration our results suggest that ts treatment has increased and ameliorated photosynthetic pigment in olive leaves for both cultivars as compared with control plants furthermore stockosorb may prevent the olive tree from oxidative stress and ameliorate photosynthetic pigments by the increase of chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations our paper showed clearly that chlorophyll and carotenoid contents were significantly enhanced when the soil is amended by the stockosorb hydrogel in the same case wei et al 2016 who demonstrated that the addition of water retaining polymer could increase the plant leaf photosynthetic performances the decrease in chlorophyll content has been widely described to be a great symptom of oxidative stress in one hand and may be the result of pigment photo oxidation chlorophyll degradation and or chlorophyll synthesis deficiency in the other hand the decrease of both total phenols and proline content in chemlali cv under stressed conditions seems to be related to olive protection from drought stress and confirms that plants treated with stockosorb were better protected than control plants as compared to control plants total phenols of drought stressed plants were decreased by 50 09 and 10 01 for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively in ts treatment while proline content was reduced by 39 01 and 12 16 for chemlali and chetoui cultivars respectively these results are significantly higher for chemlali cv than chetoui cv proline secondary metabolite is well known as the main osmoregulatory compounds of olive leaves indicating an essential mechanism to avoid stress in contrast ottow et al 2005 claimed that proline could not contribute directly to osmotic adjustment the above data evidenced that proline accumulation is an indicator of drought stress situation because it increases significantly in leaves as compared with irrigated conditions in accordance with our results ahmed et al 2009 reported that chemlali cv as a drought tolerant cultivar showed the greatest accumulation of proline compared to picholine and meski cultivars it has been demonstrated that the accumulation of proline in olive leaves is related to water deficit ahmed et al 2009 but the mechanism of this pattern is not explained yet 5 conclusion data for improvement of stressful conditions of olive trees olea europaea l still lacking and up to now the intimate interactions between hydrogels and olive trees are not well understood the present study shows that the amendment of stockosorb 660 in soil can improve different responses under drought stress mainly for chemlali cv than chetoui cv other studies should be developed to a better understanding of the beneficial effect of stockosorb amendement in soil acknowledgments we wish to thank the

land allocation patterns in responding to variations in water availability electricity consumption and market price keywords agricultural water land nexus amu darya river basin irrigation efficiency management multiple uncertainties 1 introduction 1 1 importance water and land are the two most critical resources for food production in recent years the land and water resources for agricultural activities are facing with a number of problems due to the rapid growth of population development of urbanization and spread of pollution das et al 2015 according to fao 2013 global per capita agricultural land is about 0 7 ha only 37 9 of per capital land area meanwhile global per capital freshwater withdrawal amounts to 552 1 m3 per year nearly 70 is attributed to agricultural use chen et al 2018 however only 50 of agricultural water resources is estimated to be consumed by crops the remainder is lost during storage conveyance and sub surface drainage after application al faraj et al 2016 especially water losses are more enormous as high as 60 in central asia because of outdated infrastructure and the dominance of highly inefficient flood and furrow irrigation techniques bekchanov et al 2016 in the real world problems agricultural water and land resources are intricately linked the utilization of them is significantly affected by specific limitations associated with individual conditions and the constraints imposed by their interactions on one hand water resources is a pre requisite for agricultural land uses requiring irrigation singh 2015 the amount of water resources would direct or indirect influence the areas of land cultivation and irrigation on the other hand agricultural land use expansion can alter water flow regime affect water availability and intensify water demand weatherhead and howden 2009 as a result extensive water withdrawal for agricultural land would result in water scarcity and enlarge the competition among different water users gheewala et al 2018 it is reported that agricultural production requirements of the burgeoning global population are expected to increase by about 50 in 2050 mcclymon et al 2019 this task seems to be challenging in the context of scarcity of land and water resources caused by speedy urbanization and severe climate change particularly in arid and semi arid regions e g central asia therefore it is desired to co manage water and land resources and plan water land nexus system wlns 1 2 literature review previously a number of research works focused on seeking sustainable solutions to wlns management increased water use efficiency seems to be a promising strategy nazari et al 2018 malek and verburg 2018 sun et al 2018 das et al 2015 developed a linear programming model for land and water resources allocation in eastern india with consideration of canal conveyance and field application efficiencies which suggested that irrigation efficiencies would largely influence resources allocation patterns fu et al 2018 investigated water saving potential of an irrigation area based on an evapotranspiration model results showed that irrigation efficiency was positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with the net irrigation water volume malek and verburg 2018 developed a global land system model for exploring the significant adaptation options for land management with constraints of water availability results indicated that no or low irrigation efficiency improvements led to a reduction in irrigated areas mirshadiev et al 2018 advanced a strength weakness opportunity and threat framework for identifying the promising land management and water use practices where the impacts of different irrigation modes with varied efficiencies on crop yield were investigated the above studies show that improving water use efficiency are efficient practices for reducing the volume of water applied to agriculture and increasing crop yields koopman et al 2017 however most of these studies mainly focused on managing wlns in a deterministic framework there is a gap between the recognition of uncertainty s importance and its actual incorporation in models wlns is often associated with multiple resources e g water and land multiple irrigation modes e g furrow sprinkle and drip and multiple crops e g cotton vegetable and grain such a complex system as well as inextricable interactions among subsystems enlarges the difficulties for exploring irrigation efficiency s impact on wlns management the system is also plagued with uncertainties due to inexact information natural process and human subjectivity li et al 2009 for example available water resources are influenced by random events such as precipitation and evaporation which are represented as a probability distribution around the actual streamflow li et al 2017 all these uncertainties bring great challenges to decision makers for identifying efficient water land management strategies in response to such complexities and uncertainties more robust system analysis techniques are desired stochastic optimization methods were proposed for dealing with problems with known probability distributions in the agricultural management system guo et al 2014 khandelwal and dhiman 2018 singh 2015 developed a chance constrained programming ccp model for the seasonal optimal allocation of available land and water resources where the net irrigation demand was expressed as a random variable niu et al 2016 advanced an interactive two stage fuzzy stochastic programming model for crop planning in which multiple uncertainties in irrigational water availability were handled ccp is an effective tool for reflecting reliability of satisfying or risk of violating system constraints under uncertainty which permits an in depth analysis of tradeoffs between system benefit and water shortage risk such an analysis could provide more robust strategies for mitigating water shortage risk especially for some arid regions besides wlns management may be influenced by some subjective policies e g energy consumption limitation price uncertainty is high due to underdeveloped markets and the commodity processing sector burrell 2013 all these difficulties are beyond the capability of ccp flexible fuzzy programming ffp which can handle uncertainties in association with soft constraints of polices and flexibility on target value of goals is effective in reflecting the policy variations derived from decision makers pishvaee and khalaf 2016 possibilitic fuzzy programming pfp coping with imprecise input parameters or the lack of knowledge about parameters can effectively tackle the uncertainties of price of crop and cost for water pumping 1 3 contribution and novelty the contribution of this study is to develop a possiblilistic flexible chance constrained programming pfcp method through integrating techniques of pfp ffp and ccp into a general framework each technique offers a unique contribution towards the enhancement of pfcp capabilities of wlns management under multiple uncertainties the main novelty and contribution can be listed as i pfcp can be superior to the conventional optimization approaches e g ccp by introduction of pfp and ffp dealing with multiple uncertainties expressed as possibilistic distributions flexible variables and probabilistic distributions ii it can help gain in depth analysis the tradeoffs between system benefit and risk of violating system constraints iii pfcp will be effectively incorporated into wlns management for system uncertainty reflection and risk analysis iv irrigation efficiency will be explored in wlns management for identifying optimal water and land resources allocation patterns 1 4

of pfp ffp and ccp into a general framework ii development of pfcp wlns management model to attain maximum system benefit under resources and technique constraints iii application of the proposed method to the lower reaches of amu darya river basin in central asia iv analysis of results of system benefit crop area water allocation pattern and unit water benefit and v identification of the desired schemes under different irrigation efficiencies and uncertainties 2 methodology chance constrained programming ccp is useful for dealing with random uncertainty and analyzing the risk of violating system constraints suo et al 2017 a ccp model can be formulated as 1a max f i 1 m c i x i j 1 n d j y j subject to 1b a i x i b i i 1 2 3 m 1c p r t g j t y j h j t 1 p j j 1 2 3 n 1d x i y j 0 i j where xi and yj are decision variables hj t is a set of random elements defined on a probability space t t t the function pr represents the probability distribution of random variable hj t model 1c consists of fixing a certain level of probability p j 0 1 for each constraint j and imposing a condition that the constraint is satisfied with at least a probability of 1 pj when the left hand side coefficient gj t is determined and the right hand side coefficient hj t is a random variable an equivalent deterministic version can be defined as 2 g j t y j h j t p j j where h j t p j f 1 p j given the cumulative distribution function of hj t i e f hj t and the probability of violating constraint j i e p j the problem with model 2 can reflect the case when gj t is deterministic if both gj t and hj t are uncertain the set of feasible constraints may become more complicated and detailed transformation could refer to li et al 2009 simic and dabic ostojic 2017 li et al 2018 and khishandar 2019 moreover model 1 can only reflect the random features of variables which cannot fully reflect the ambiguous and vagueness in the objective and constraints due to the subjective judgements experience and insufficient data therefore fuzzy chance constrained programming is desired for solving such problems a fuzzy chance constrained programming model can be formulated as follows 3a max f i 1 m c i x i j 1 n d j y j subject to 3b a i x i b i i 1 2 3 m 3c p r t g j t y j h j t 1 p j j 1 2 3 n 3d x i y j 0 i j where ci dj are fuzzy coefficients represents fuzzy inequality which implies that right hand side of constraint is essentially larger than or similar to the left hand side value obviously model 3 can reflect uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets in constraints and objective function flexible fuzzy programming ffp can support different kinds of fuzzy numbers as well as various fuzzy ranking methods in soft constraints to defuzzify uncertain parameters besides ffp is effective for dealing with soft constraints and flexibility on target of goals based on pishvaee and khalaf 2016 a fuzzy number Œæ can be used to show the violation of soft constraints as follows 4a max f i 1 m c i x i j 1 n d j y j subject to 4b a i x i b i Œæ i 1 Œ≤ i 1 2 3 m 4c p r t g j t y j h j t 1 p j j 1 2 3 n 4d x i y j 0 i j 4e 0 Œ≤ 1 where Œ≤ is indicator of minimum satisfaction level of flexible constraints which should be carried out subjectively by decision makers Œæ is a triangular fuzzy number which can be presented by their three prominent points i

tributary of area sea basin in central asia with length of 2400 km and annual mean streamflow of 97 4 km3 the streamflow is mainly discharged by glacier and snow melting during wet seasons from april to august the lower reaches of amu darya river basin divided by tuyamuyun reservoir contains three districts i e karakalpakstan and khorezm in uzbekistan and dashaoguz in turkmenistan as shown in fig 1 the lower reaches are dominated by plains and agriculture zones with elevation less than 200 m the region is characterized by dry continental climate with average temperature of 13 0 c throughout the year the mean annual precipitation is less than 100 mm and the potential evapotranspiration is as high as 1150 mm awan et al 2011 the economy in the lower reaches mainly relies on agricultural practices the scarce precipitation and excessive evaporation cause that crop cultivation is only feasible through irrigation cai et al 2009 since 1960 due to expansion of crop area and high water consumption of irrigation sharing about 90 of total water use water delivered to the area sea basin has sharply decreased leading to 75 of the surface area being disappeared flood and furrow irrigations are the most widespread types of irrigation in the lower reaches they are characterized by relatively low water use efficiency less than 50 and high waste of water resources bekchanov et al 2015 such irrigation modes not only have negative impacts on water availability but also could influence the groundwater table and lead to soil salinization land degradation caused by soil salinization has been widespread in this region where about 15 20 has become unsuitable for cropping djumaeva et al 2013 as food demand is increasing and water and land resources are continuing to decline improving water use efficiency is thus desired for both promoting unit water benefit and making irrigated land resources sustainably arable with less salinization agricultural wlns management in the study area is also subject to various sources of uncertainties and risks for example in recent decades both annual and seasonal agricultural water supplies have decreased crop market price is fluctuated with economic status and policies irrigation mainly relies on complicated pumps and canals electricity for irrigation shares about 25 of the total electricity consumption which is generated from hydropower that is influenced by random streamflow and changed infrastructure capacity djaniberkov and finger 2018 all these problems would further amplify the difficulties in wlns management 3 2 modeling formulation a pfcp based wlns management pfcp wln model is formulated that simultaneously allocates water and land resources the objective is to maximize system benefit subject to a series of

outputs and provide useful information for decision makers the computational time for each scenario is less than 1 s on an intel r core tm i7 6700 3 40 ghz cpu with 8 0 gb of memory 3 3 data collection and analysis the planning horizon includes five periods with each of one year 2019 2023 data related to society economy agriculture water and land resources are obtained from the related literatures site investigation statistical yearbooks and websites for instance the prices of crops as shown in table 2 the costs of water fertilizer and fixed operation which are expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers are collected from the expert consultations survey questionnaires statistical yearbooks of uzbekistan and turkmenistan 2010 2015 and some publications khamzina et al 2008 singh 2015 electricity demand of per unit of water pumping and conveyance are collected from udias et al 2018 and adjusted according to local pumping facilities and topographical features the permissible electricity for irrigation is gained based on the share about 20 of total electricity consumption that is acquired from the statistical yearbooks https stat uz uz water demand of each crop as listed in table 3 is collected from the website of food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao http www fao org faostat these data are modified according to the local soil feature precipitation irrigation requirement and management policy water availability is estimated by subtracting the volume of water that downstream ecology needs qdown from streamflows of tuyamuyun hydrological station on the website of central asia water information http www cawater info net the calculation of qdown is based on the tenant method that indicates 30 of total water volumes are promised sun et al 2018 due to the random features statistical analysis is conducted to obtain the discretization values of water availability with selection of four candidate probability distributions e g normal gamma person iii and logistic according to test methods of the maximum likelihood and chi square gamma distribution with the most perfect performances is used for discretizing values of water availability under different violating probabilities as shown in fig 3 4 result analysis 4 1 uncertainty analysis fig 4 presents system benefits under 1080 scenarios which range from us 5 648 106 to us 11 545 106 the highest system benefit occurs under irrigation scheme 9 s9 when Œª 0 6 Œ≤ 0 and p 0 15 and the lowest system benefit corresponds to irrigation scheme 1 s1 when Œª 1 Œ≤ 1 p 0 01 in detail system benefit would decrease along with Œª level this is because Œª means decision maker s risk averse attitude to objective higher Œª level leads to decreased objective violation risk and descend system benefit system benefit would decrease with Œ≤ level high Œ≤ level would toward the decision maker s desire to achieve the maximized system benefit with low violation degree i e high satisfactory degree in soft constraints thus resulting in a strict electricity consumption control besides when Œª is 0 6 Œ≤ is 0 under s1 the system benefit would be us 5 892 106 under p 0 05 and us 10 792 106 under p 0 15 a higher p level associated with increased violation of risk results in a higher system benefit by varying the p level decision makers can acquire the compromise between system benefit and system failure risk in general higher p lower Œª and lower Œ≤ can lead to higher system benefit however this variation also corresponds to increased risk level i e declined system reliability fig 5 presents the total crop area in the lower reaches which indicates that total crop area is highly related to random water availability and decision maker s satisfactory degree to electricity consumption as shown in fig 5a under s1 when Œ≤ 0 the total crop area would be 565 103 ha under p 0 01 and 868 103 ha under p 0 15 meaning that higher p level results in an increased crop area due to ascended irrigation water availability besides when p 0 15 the total crop area would decrease from 868 103 ha Œ≤ 0 to 708 103 ha Œ≤ 1 higher Œ≤ means lower degree of violating electricity consumption constraint leading to less water being pumped and converted however when p levels are 0 01 and 0 05 total crop area would not be affected by Œ≤ level signifying that the predetermined lowest agricultural electricity consumption could fully satisfy pumping and conveyance when water availability is low 4 2 impacts of irrigation efficiency irrigation efficiency changes would alter crop area crop plating pattern and unit water benefit as shown in fig 5 the maximum total crop area would increase from 868 103 ha s1 to 1108 103 ha s9 in period 1 illustrating that irrigation efficiency promotion has a positive effect on crop area this is because irrigation efficiency promotion would reduce water demand of per unit land fig 6 presents the proportion of different crops under the nine irrigation schemes results indicate that enhancement of irrigation efficiency would impact cropping patterns for example when p 0 01 the proportion of vegetable and other crops would dramatically increase along with irrigation efficiency this is because water would be first delivered to vegetables and other crops due to their high profit and low water demand after the minimum area requirements of cotton and grain are met when p 0 15 cotton proportion would ascend from 24 0 to 46 2 in karakalpakstan and from 46 6 to 51 3 in dashoguz along with irrigation efficiency after irrigation scheme 6 irrigation efficiency is 0 62 the proportion change trends get slight results also imply that different districts should adopt varied irrigation schemes according to local economic conditions agricultural policies and irrigation infrastructures in a context of scarcity of land and water resources recognition of unit water benefit is one of the management alternatives in this study unit water benefit referring to the net system benefit produced by per unit water resources is evaluated under different irrigation schemes as shown in fig 7 unit water benefit ranges from 0 15 us m3 under s1 to 0 24 us m3 under s9 when Œ≤ 1 and p 0 01 meaning that advancement of irrigation modes e g sprinkle and drip has a positive effect on unit water benefit comparably when p 0 15 unit water benefit would change from 0 18 us m3 under s1 to 0 20 us m3 under s9 moreover unit water benefit would reduce with increased water resources availability when irrigation efficiency is greater than 0 61 i e s5 suggesting that advancement of irrigation modes are more effective under the condition of extreme water resources scarcity accordingly s5 is an effective option for pursuing balance among unit water benefit and water land allocation patterns in responding to changed water availabilities unit water benefit also shows relation to varied water availabilities and electricity consumptions which are corresponding to varied land and water allocation patterns generally comprehensive agricultural management strategies e g the advancement of irrigation modes as well as the optimization of water and land allocation patterns need to be implemented according to the real world conditions e g water availability and electricity consumption 4 3 water land nexus analysis fig 8 illustrates the water allocation alternatives for each region and crop results show that water resource allocation alternatives are closely related to cropping patterns in detail vegetables are of the highest priority to water resources after food security needs are met this is because vegetables possess higher prices and lower resources requirements in period 1 water resources allocated to vegetables and others are 667 106 m3 and 1806 106 m3 respectively in period 5 the two values would be 826 106 m3 and 1660 106 m3 water resources are then diverted to cotton to meet policy requirements results show that the volumes of water delivered to cotton are the largest in all regions implying that cotton keeps the major water consumer in the lower reaches of amu dray river basin comparably water resources allocated to grains heavily depends on the water availability even under the maximum system violation level corresponding to maximum water availability water demands of the maximum grain requirements still could not be met polices and strategies should be made not only to guarantee the basic food requirement but also to promote water saving measures especially for grains fig 9 depicts the effect of water availability on each crop area under s6 the results indicate that cropping pattern would vary across different water availabilities for example cotton in karakalpakstan at the end of planning horizon would increase from 53 103 ha p 0 01 to 144 103 ha p 0 15 illustrating that increasing water availability related to supply management strategy would be beneficial for land expansion moreover the impacts of water availability on crop area of khorezm are less obvious than that in other districts this may because water resources would be firstly delivered to khorezm due to its location upper stream and economic status possessing relatively completed agricultural infrastructures when water resources is very limited e g p is less than 0 05 the crop area may be far lower than the maximum requirements which may bring food crisis strategies should be implemented for mitigating the negative impacts such as using the groundwater conjunctively with good quality canal water adopting salt and drought tolerant crops and matching water supply more closely with demand 5 discussion results obtained demonstrated that variations of irrigation mode water availability and electricity consumption have obvious effects on water and land resources allocation patterns some other research works related to agricultural management also shown that cropping area would increase along with advancement of irrigation mode and increase of water availability bhaduri and manna 2014 das et al 2015 niu et al 2016 kisekka et al 2019 such consistence further validates the applicability of pfcp in exploring the impacts of irrigation efficiency on wlns management besides differences are avoidable due to the variations in data sources models and research objectives for example the optimized total crop area in the lower reaches of amu darya river basin ranges from 840 to 985 103 ha by bekchanov et al 2016 under normal water availability which is larger than that ranging from 418 to 696 103 ha by pfcp wlns under 15 of the cumulative distribution probability of water availability such difference can be reasoned by the variations in water availabilities and can be acceptable besides the system benefit is about 9100 106 us year in the whole amu darya river basin acquired by jalilov et al 2018 which is about 5 7 times larger than 1110 2300 106 us year by pfcp wlns only three districts are considered system benefit 250 510 106 us year by bekchanov et al 2016 shows smaller than that by pfcp wlns this is because raw cotton price is adopted by bekchanov et al 2016 which is about three times cheaper than that by pfcp wlns considering the fiber cotton price the differences in system benefit is mainly derived from diversified study area proposed models and inputted parameters comparably uncertainty analysis is conducted in this study which can effectively tackle subjectivity random features and vagueness in the system providing reliable information of agricultural system generally the results obtained are acceptable for supporting water land nexus system management pfcp wlns has provided useful insights on irrigation efficiency s impacts on water and land resources management solutions are valuable for generating alternatives and thus help decision makers to identify desired water land nexus management policies under multiple uncertainties however in amu darya river basin water land nexus management strategies may be impacted by soil salinization due to changed groundwater table salinity leaching is an important practice outside the crop growth season without consideration of which would leading to underestimation of the water demands and ignorance salinity s effect on crop yield therefore it is desired that water uses for salinity should be investigated in the future research works 6 conclusions in this study a possibilistic flexible chance constrained programming pfcp method has been developed through integrating possibilistic fuzzy programming flexible fuzzy programming and chance constrained programming within a general framework the developed pfcp method can i deal with uncertainties expressed as possibilistic distributions flexible variables and probabilistic distributions ii reflect decision makers risk averse attitude by introducing necessity degrees of the objective function and iii help examine the reliability of satisfying or risk of violating system constraints then a pfcp based water land nexus model has been formulated for managing water land nexus system of the lower reaches of amu darya river basin totally 1080 scenarios related to different irrigation schemes water availabilities electricity consumptions and risk reverse attitudes to objective have also been designed for examining irrigation efficiency s impacts on water land nexus system management solutions for system benefit crop area and water allocation alternatives have been generated under multiple uncertainties and irrigation schemes results show that i system benefit and total crop area increase along with water availability and electricity consumption accompanying with increased of system risk level ii water and land resources would be firstly allocated to vegetables after minimum food requirements are met due to its higher profit iii the lowest unit water benefit 0 15 us m3 and the maximum 0 24 us m3 both occur under the lowest water availability level p 0 01 implying that improvement of irrigation efficiency is more effective under the condition of extreme water resources scarcity iv irrigation mode with efficiency of about 0 61 is an effective option in adaptation to changed water availabilities which is beneficial for pursuing balance between water and land relationships as well as providing compromise between system benefit and risk level generally advancement of irrigation measures as well as optimization water and land allocation

land allocation patterns in responding to variations in water availability electricity consumption and market price keywords agricultural water land nexus amu darya river basin irrigation efficiency management multiple uncertainties 1 introduction 1 1 importance water and land are the two most critical resources for food production in recent years the land and water resources for agricultural activities are facing with a number of problems due to the rapid growth of population development of urbanization and spread of pollution das et al 2015 according to fao 2013 global per capita agricultural land is about 0 7 ha only 37 9 of per capital land area meanwhile global per capital freshwater withdrawal amounts to 552 1 m3 per year nearly 70 is attributed to agricultural use chen et al 2018 however only 50 of agricultural water resources is estimated to be consumed by crops the remainder is lost during storage conveyance and sub surface drainage after application al faraj et al 2016 especially water losses are more enormous as high as 60 in central asia because of outdated infrastructure and the dominance of highly inefficient flood and furrow irrigation techniques bekchanov et al 2016 in the real world problems agricultural water and land resources are intricately linked the utilization of them is significantly affected by specific limitations associated with individual conditions and the constraints imposed by their interactions on one hand water resources is a pre requisite for agricultural land uses requiring irrigation singh 2015 the amount of water resources would direct or indirect influence the areas of land cultivation and irrigation on the other hand agricultural land use expansion can alter water flow regime affect water availability and intensify water demand weatherhead and howden 2009 as a result extensive water withdrawal for agricultural land would result in water scarcity and enlarge the competition among different water users gheewala et al 2018 it is reported that agricultural production requirements of the burgeoning global population are expected to increase by about 50 in 2050 mcclymon et al 2019 this task seems to be challenging in the context of scarcity of land and water resources caused by speedy urbanization and severe climate change particularly in arid and semi arid regions e g central asia therefore it is desired to co manage water and land resources and plan water land nexus system wlns 1 2 literature review previously a number of research works focused on seeking sustainable solutions to wlns management increased water use efficiency seems to be a promising strategy nazari et al 2018 malek and verburg 2018 sun et al 2018 das et al 2015 developed a linear programming model for land and water resources allocation in eastern india with consideration of canal conveyance and field application efficiencies which suggested that irrigation efficiencies would largely influence resources allocation patterns fu et al 2018 investigated water saving potential of an irrigation area based on an evapotranspiration model results showed that irrigation efficiency was positively correlated with precipitation and negatively correlated with the net irrigation water volume malek and verburg 2018 developed a global land system model for exploring the significant adaptation options for land management with constraints of water availability results indicated that no or low irrigation efficiency improvements led to a reduction in irrigated areas mirshadiev et al 2018 advanced a strength weakness opportunity and threat framework for identifying the promising land management and water use practices where the impacts of different irrigation modes with varied efficiencies on crop yield were investigated the above studies show that improving water use efficiency are efficient practices for reducing the volume of water applied to agriculture and increasing crop yields koopman et al 2017 however most of these studies mainly focused on managing wlns in a deterministic framework there is a gap between the recognition of uncertainty s importance and its actual incorporation in models wlns is often associated with multiple resources e g water and land multiple irrigation modes e g furrow sprinkle and drip and multiple crops e g cotton vegetable and grain such a complex system as well as inextricable interactions among subsystems enlarges the difficulties for exploring irrigation efficiency s impact on wlns management the system is also plagued with uncertainties due to inexact information natural process and human subjectivity li et al 2009 for example available water resources are influenced by random events such as precipitation and evaporation which are represented as a probability distribution around the actual streamflow li et al 2017 all these uncertainties bring great challenges to decision makers for identifying efficient water land management strategies in response to such complexities and uncertainties more robust system analysis techniques are desired stochastic optimization methods were proposed for dealing with problems with known probability distributions in the agricultural management system guo et al 2014 khandelwal and dhiman 2018 singh 2015 developed a chance constrained programming ccp model for the seasonal optimal allocation of available land and water resources where the net irrigation demand was expressed as a random variable niu et al 2016 advanced an interactive two stage fuzzy stochastic programming model for crop planning in which multiple uncertainties in irrigational water availability were handled ccp is an effective tool for reflecting reliability of satisfying or risk of violating system constraints under uncertainty which permits an in depth analysis of tradeoffs between system benefit and water shortage risk such an analysis could provide more robust strategies for mitigating water shortage risk especially for some arid regions besides wlns management may be influenced by some subjective policies e g energy consumption limitation price uncertainty is high due to underdeveloped markets and the commodity processing sector burrell 2013 all these difficulties are beyond the capability of ccp flexible fuzzy programming ffp which can handle uncertainties in association with soft constraints of polices and flexibility on target value of goals is effective in reflecting the policy variations derived from decision makers pishvaee and khalaf 2016 possibilitic fuzzy programming pfp coping with imprecise input parameters or the lack of knowledge about parameters can effectively tackle the uncertainties of price of crop and cost for water pumping 1 3 contribution and novelty the contribution of this study is to develop a possiblilistic flexible chance constrained programming pfcp method through integrating techniques of pfp ffp and ccp into a general framework each technique offers a unique contribution towards the enhancement of pfcp capabilities of wlns management under multiple uncertainties the main novelty and contribution can be listed as i pfcp can be superior to the conventional optimization approaches e g ccp by introduction of pfp and ffp dealing with multiple uncertainties expressed as possibilistic distributions flexible variables and probabilistic distributions ii it can help gain in depth analysis the tradeoffs between system benefit and risk of violating system constraints iii pfcp will be effectively incorporated into wlns management for system uncertainty reflection and risk analysis iv irrigation efficiency will be explored in wlns management for identifying optimal water and land resources allocation patterns 1 4

violating system constraints suo et al 2017 a ccp model can be formulated as 1a max f i 1 m c i x i j 1 n d j y j subject to 1b a i x i b i i 1 2 3 m 1c p r t g j t y j h j t 1 p j j 1 2 3 n 1d x i y j 0 i j where xi and yj are decision variables hj t is a set of random elements defined on a probability space t t t the function pr represents the probability distribution of random variable hj t model 1c consists of fixing a certain level of probability p j 0 1 for each constraint j and imposing a condition that the constraint is satisfied with at least a probability of 1 pj when the left hand side coefficient gj t is determined and the right hand side coefficient hj t is a random variable an equivalent deterministic version can be defined as 2 g j t y j h j t p j j where h j t p j f 1 p j given the cumulative distribution function of hj t i e f hj t and the probability of violating constraint j i e p j the problem with model 2 can reflect the case when gj t is deterministic if both gj t and hj t are uncertain the set of feasible constraints may become more complicated and detailed transformation could refer to li et al 2009 simic and dabic ostojic 2017 li et al 2018 and khishandar 2019 moreover model 1 can only reflect the random features of variables which cannot fully reflect the ambiguous and vagueness in the objective and constraints due to the subjective judgements experience and insufficient data therefore fuzzy chance constrained programming is desired for solving such problems a fuzzy chance constrained programming model can be formulated as follows 3a max f i 1 m c i x i j 1 n d j y j subject to 3b a i x i b i i 1 2 3 m 3c p r t g j t y j h j t 1 p j j 1 2 3 n 3d x i y j 0 i j where ci dj are fuzzy coefficients represents fuzzy inequality which implies that right hand side of constraint is essentially larger than or similar to the left hand side value obviously model 3 can reflect uncertainties expressed as fuzzy sets in constraints and objective function flexible fuzzy programming ffp can support different kinds of fuzzy numbers as well as various fuzzy ranking methods in soft constraints to defuzzify uncertain parameters besides ffp is effective for dealing with soft constraints and flexibility on target of goals based on pishvaee and khalaf 2016 a fuzzy number Œæ can be used to show the violation of soft constraints as follows 4a max f i 1 m c i x i j 1 n d j y j subject to 4b a i x i b i Œæ i 1 Œ≤ i 1 2 3 m 4c p r t g j t y j h j t 1 p j j 1 2 3 n 4d x i y j 0 i j 4e 0 Œ≤ 1 where Œ≤ is indicator of minimum satisfaction level of flexible constraints which should be carried out subjectively by decision makers Œæ is a triangular fuzzy number which can be presented by their three prominent points i

defined as 6a œë Œæ i Œæ i 3 Œæ i 2 6b œë Œæ Œæ 2 Œæ 1 accordingly model 4 could be converted as 7a max f i 1 m c i x i j 1 n d j y j subject to 7b a i x i b i Œæ i 2 œë Œæ i œë Œæ i 3 1 Œ≤ i 1 2 3 m 7c p r t g j t y j h j t 1 p j j 1 2 3 n 7d x i y j 0 i j 7e 0 Œ≤ 1 the term of Œæ 2 œë Œæ œë Œæ 3 1 Œ≤ determines the possible violation of each flexible constraint and reflects the decision maker s preference however ffp cannot deal with the ambiguous information in decision making processes e g c i in the objective with subjective experience of decision makers fortunately the possibilistic fuzzy programming pfp is used to handle the lack of knowledge about the exact values of the model parameters that are modeled by possibilistic distributions with insufficient data and subjective knowledge experience of the decision maker zhou et al 2013 in the pfp a symmetric triangular fuzzy number c i can be determined by a center of c i c and a spread w c i represented as c i c w c i similarly d j can be presented as d j c w d j since the imprecise coefficients of the objective functions are all restricted by c i and d j the objective function is also fuzzy features and its function value f is also symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers based on the extension principle as follows inuiguchi and ramik 2000 8 f i 1 i c i c x i j 1 j d j c y j i 1 i w c i x i j 1 j w d j y j based on the assumption of uncertainty averse attitude from decision makers and possibility theory a fractile approach is proposed to tackle the above objective of maximizing the symmetric triangular fuzzy numbers f assume that the decision maker has a great interest in the expected profit i e f with high certainty degree maximization of the objective function at Œª fractile the value is u can be treated as max u 9 n e s i 1 m c i c x i j 1 m d j c y j i 1 n w c i x i j 1 n w d j y j u Œª where Œª means necessity fractile or necessity degree and ranges from 0 to 1 which reflects system benefit preference of decision makers and risk averse attitude selection of Œª level depends on decision makers preferences on imprecise objective however Œª 0 indicates risk of violating imprecise objective is the highest and objective would not be satisfied corresponding to unacceptable solution Œª 1 indicates risk of violating imprecise objective is the lowest and objective would be fully satisfied with all ambiguous parameters leading to completely acceptable solution in practical applications decision makers prefer that objective should be satisfied under high necessity degree in order to obtain a low objective violation risk and a high acceptable solution thus the necessity of the objective should be greater than 0 5 in practices zhou et al 2013 yu et al 2019 according to the fractile optimization model proposed by inuiguchi and ram√≠k 2000 model 9 can be converted to 10 i 1 m c i c x i i 1 m Œª w c i x i j 1 n d j c y i j 1 n Œª w d j y j u consequently a possiblistic flexible chance constrained programming pfcp model is formulated as follows 11a max f i 1 m c i c x i i 1 m Œª w c i x i j 1 n d j c y i j 1 n Œª w d j y j subject to 11b a i x i b i Œæ i 2 œë Œæ i œë Œæ i 3 1

possibility distributions and random probability distributions as well as coping with soften constraints and flexible target value of goals 3 case study 3 1 study area the amu darya river is a major tributary of area sea basin in central asia with length of 2400 km and annual mean streamflow of 97 4 km3 the streamflow is mainly discharged by glacier and snow melting during wet seasons from april to august the lower reaches of amu darya river basin divided by tuyamuyun reservoir contains three districts i e karakalpakstan and khorezm in uzbekistan and dashaoguz in turkmenistan as shown in fig 1 the lower reaches are dominated by plains and agriculture zones with elevation less than 200 m the region is characterized by dry continental climate with average temperature of 13 0 c throughout the year the mean annual precipitation is less than 100 mm and the potential evapotranspiration is as high as 1150 mm awan et al 2011 the economy in the lower reaches mainly relies on agricultural practices the scarce precipitation and excessive evaporation cause that crop cultivation is only feasible through irrigation cai et al 2009 since 1960 due to expansion of crop area and high water consumption of irrigation sharing about 90 of total water use water delivered to the area sea basin has sharply decreased leading to 75 of the surface area being disappeared flood and furrow irrigations are the most widespread types of irrigation in the lower reaches they are characterized by relatively low water use efficiency less than 50 and high waste of water resources bekchanov et al 2015 such irrigation modes not only have negative impacts on water availability but also could influence the groundwater table and lead to soil salinization land degradation caused by soil salinization has been widespread in this region where about 15 20 has become unsuitable for cropping djumaeva et al 2013 as food demand is increasing and water and land resources are continuing to decline improving water use efficiency is thus desired for both promoting unit water benefit and making irrigated land resources sustainably arable with less salinization agricultural wlns management in the study area is also subject to various sources of uncertainties and risks for example in recent decades both annual and seasonal agricultural water supplies have decreased crop market price is fluctuated with economic status and policies irrigation mainly relies on complicated pumps and canals electricity for irrigation shares about 25 of the total electricity consumption which is generated from hydropower that is influenced by random streamflow and changed infrastructure capacity djaniberkov and finger 2018 all these problems would further amplify the difficulties in wlns management 3 2 modeling formulation a pfcp based wlns management pfcp wln model is formulated that simultaneously allocates water and land resources the objective is to maximize system benefit subject to a series of constraints as shown in fig 2 the system benefit involves the gross crop incomes in addition to costs of fertilizer operation and water pumping the pfcp wln model is 12 max f i 1 4 j 1 3 t 1 5 p c i j

nine irrigation schemes under different irrigation modes flood furrow sprinkle and drip irrigations are designed corresponding to nine irrigation efficiency levels i e Œ∏ as shown in table 1 besides five Œª levels 0 6 0 7 0 8 0 9 and 1 six Œ≤ values 0 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 and 1 and four p levels 0 01 0 05 0 10 and 0 15 are considered leading to totally 1080 scenarios in practical implementation the solving process of the model can be summarized as 1 formulate the model 2 solve the model to obtain a global optimal solution under one Œª level 3 solve each model under the same Œª level to obtain a global solution under one Œ≤ level 4 solve each model under the same Œª and Œ≤ level to obtain a global solution under one p level 5 repeat steps 3 and 4 at each irrigation schemes and 6 analyze the outputs and provide useful information for decision makers the computational time for each scenario is less than 1 s on an intel r core tm i7 6700 3 40 ghz cpu with 8 0 gb of memory 3 3 data collection and analysis the planning horizon includes five periods with each of one year 2019 2023 data related to society economy agriculture water and land resources are obtained from the related literatures site investigation statistical yearbooks and websites for instance the prices of crops as shown in table 2 the costs of water fertilizer and fixed operation which are expressed as triangular fuzzy numbers are collected from the expert consultations survey questionnaires statistical yearbooks of uzbekistan and turkmenistan 2010 2015 and some publications khamzina et al 2008 singh 2015 electricity demand of per unit of water pumping and conveyance are collected from udias et al 2018 and adjusted according to local pumping facilities and topographical features the permissible electricity for irrigation is gained based on the share about 20 of total electricity consumption that is acquired from the statistical yearbooks https stat uz uz water demand of each crop as listed in table 3 is collected from the website of food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao http www fao org faostat these data are modified according to the local soil feature precipitation irrigation requirement and management policy water availability is estimated by subtracting the volume of water that downstream ecology needs qdown from streamflows of tuyamuyun hydrological station on the website of central asia water information http www cawater info net the calculation of qdown is based on the tenant method that indicates 30 of total water volumes are promised sun et al 2018 due to the random features statistical analysis is conducted to obtain the discretization values of water availability with selection of four candidate probability distributions e g normal gamma person iii and logistic according to test methods of the maximum likelihood and chi square gamma distribution with the most perfect performances is used for discretizing values of water availability under different violating probabilities as shown in fig 3 4 result analysis 4 1 uncertainty analysis fig 4 presents system benefits under 1080 scenarios which range from us 5 648 106 to us 11 545 106 the highest system benefit occurs under irrigation scheme 9 s9 when Œª 0 6 Œ≤ 0 and p 0 15 and the lowest system benefit corresponds to irrigation scheme 1 s1 when Œª 1 Œ≤ 1 p 0 01 in detail system benefit would decrease along with Œª level this is because Œª means decision maker s risk averse attitude to objective higher Œª level leads to decreased objective violation risk and descend system benefit system benefit would decrease with Œ≤ level high Œ≤ level would toward the decision maker s desire to achieve the maximized system benefit with low violation degree i e high satisfactory degree in soft constraints thus resulting in a strict electricity consumption control besides when Œª is 0 6 Œ≤ is 0 under s1 the system benefit would be us 5 892 106 under p 0 05 and us 10 792 106 under p 0 15 a higher p level associated with increased violation of risk results in a higher system benefit by varying the p level decision makers can acquire the compromise between system benefit and system failure risk in general higher p lower Œª and lower Œ≤ can lead to higher system benefit however this variation also corresponds to increased risk level i e declined system reliability fig 5 presents the total crop area in the lower reaches which indicates that total crop area is highly related to random water availability and decision maker s satisfactory degree to electricity consumption as shown in fig 5a under s1 when Œ≤ 0 the total crop area would be 565 103 ha under p 0 01 and 868 103 ha under p 0 15 meaning that higher p level results in an increased crop area due to ascended irrigation water availability besides when p 0 15 the total crop area would decrease from 868 103 ha Œ≤ 0 to 708 103 ha Œ≤ 1 higher Œ≤ means lower degree of violating electricity consumption constraint leading to less water being pumped and converted however when p levels are 0 01 and 0 05 total crop area would not be affected by Œ≤ level signifying that the predetermined lowest agricultural electricity consumption could fully satisfy pumping and conveyance when water availability is low 4 2 impacts of irrigation efficiency irrigation efficiency changes would alter crop area crop plating pattern and unit water benefit as shown in fig 5 the maximum total crop area would increase from 868 103 ha s1 to 1108 103 ha s9 in period 1 illustrating that irrigation efficiency promotion has a positive effect on crop area this is because irrigation efficiency promotion would reduce water demand of per unit land fig 6 presents the proportion of different crops under the nine irrigation schemes results indicate that enhancement of irrigation efficiency would impact cropping patterns for example when p 0 01 the proportion of vegetable and other crops would dramatically increase along with irrigation efficiency this is because water would be first delivered to vegetables and other crops due to their high profit and low water demand after the minimum area requirements of cotton and grain are met when p 0 15 cotton proportion would ascend from 24 0 to 46 2 in karakalpakstan and from 46 6 to 51 3 in dashoguz along with irrigation efficiency after irrigation scheme 6 irrigation efficiency is 0 62 the proportion change trends get slight results also imply that different districts should adopt varied irrigation schemes according to local economic conditions agricultural policies and irrigation infrastructures in a context of scarcity of land and water resources recognition of unit water benefit is one of the management alternatives in this study unit water benefit referring to the net system benefit produced by per unit water resources is evaluated under different irrigation schemes as shown in fig 7 unit water benefit ranges from 0 15 us m3 under s1 to 0 24 us m3 under s9 when Œ≤ 1 and p 0 01 meaning that advancement of irrigation modes e g sprinkle and drip has a positive effect on unit water benefit comparably when p 0 15 unit water benefit would change from 0 18 us m3 under s1 to 0 20 us m3 under s9 moreover unit water benefit would reduce with increased water resources availability when irrigation efficiency is greater than 0 61 i e s5 suggesting that advancement of irrigation modes are more effective under the condition of extreme water resources scarcity accordingly s5 is an effective option for pursuing balance among unit water benefit and water land allocation patterns in responding to changed water availabilities unit water benefit also shows relation to varied water availabilities and electricity consumptions which are corresponding to varied land and water allocation patterns generally comprehensive agricultural management strategies e g the advancement of irrigation modes as well as the optimization of water and land allocation patterns need to be implemented according to the real world conditions e g water availability and electricity consumption 4 3 water land nexus analysis fig 8 illustrates the water allocation alternatives for each region and crop results show that water resource allocation alternatives are closely related to cropping patterns in detail vegetables are of the highest priority to water resources after food security needs are met this is because vegetables possess higher prices and lower resources requirements in period 1 water resources allocated to vegetables and others are 667 106 m3 and 1806 106 m3 respectively in period 5 the two values would be 826 106 m3 and 1660 106 m3 water resources are then diverted to cotton to meet policy requirements results show that the volumes of water delivered to cotton are the largest in all regions implying that cotton keeps the major water consumer in the lower reaches of amu dray river basin comparably water resources allocated to grains heavily depends on the water availability even under the maximum system violation level corresponding to maximum water availability water demands of the maximum grain requirements still could not be met polices and strategies should be made not only to guarantee the basic food requirement but also to promote water saving measures especially for grains fig 9 depicts the effect of water availability on each crop area under s6 the results indicate that cropping pattern would vary across different water availabilities for example cotton in karakalpakstan at the end of planning horizon would increase from 53 103 ha p 0 01 to 144 103 ha p 0 15 illustrating that increasing water availability related to supply management strategy would be beneficial for land expansion moreover the impacts of water availability on crop area of khorezm are less obvious than that in other districts this may because water resources would be firstly delivered to khorezm due to its location upper stream and economic status possessing relatively completed agricultural infrastructures when water resources is very limited e g p is less than 0 05 the crop area may be far lower than the maximum requirements which may bring food crisis strategies should be implemented for mitigating the negative impacts such as using the groundwater conjunctively with good quality canal water adopting salt and drought tolerant crops and matching water supply more closely with demand 5 discussion results obtained demonstrated that variations of irrigation mode water availability and electricity consumption have obvious effects on water and land resources allocation patterns some other research works related to agricultural management also shown that cropping area would increase along with advancement of irrigation mode and increase of water availability bhaduri and manna 2014 das et al 2015 niu et al 2016 kisekka et al 2019 such consistence further validates the applicability of pfcp in exploring the impacts of irrigation efficiency on wlns management besides differences are avoidable due to the variations in data sources models and research objectives for example the optimized total crop area in the lower reaches of amu darya river basin ranges from 840 to 985 103 ha by bekchanov et al 2016 under normal water availability which is larger than that ranging from 418 to 696 103 ha by pfcp wlns under 15 of the cumulative distribution probability of water availability such difference can be reasoned by the variations in water availabilities and can be acceptable besides the system benefit is about 9100 106 us year in the whole amu darya river basin acquired by jalilov et al 2018 which is about 5 7 times larger than 1110 2300 106 us year by pfcp wlns only three districts are considered system benefit 250 510 106 us year by bekchanov et al 2016 shows smaller than that by pfcp wlns this is because raw cotton price is adopted by bekchanov et al 2016 which is about three times cheaper than that by pfcp wlns considering the fiber cotton price the differences in system benefit is mainly derived from diversified study area proposed models and inputted parameters comparably uncertainty analysis is conducted in this study which can effectively tackle subjectivity random features and vagueness in the system providing reliable information of agricultural system generally the results obtained are acceptable for supporting water land nexus system management pfcp wlns has provided useful insights on irrigation efficiency s impacts on water and land resources management solutions are valuable for generating alternatives and thus help decision makers to identify desired water land nexus management policies under multiple uncertainties however in amu darya river basin water land nexus management strategies may be impacted by soil salinization due to changed groundwater table salinity leaching is an important practice outside the crop growth season without consideration of which would leading to underestimation of the water demands and ignorance salinity s effect on crop yield therefore it is desired that water uses for salinity should be investigated in the future research works 6 conclusions in this study a possibilistic flexible chance constrained programming pfcp method has been developed through integrating possibilistic fuzzy programming flexible fuzzy programming and chance constrained programming within a general framework the developed pfcp method can i deal with uncertainties expressed as possibilistic distributions flexible variables and probabilistic distributions ii reflect decision makers risk averse attitude by introducing necessity degrees of the objective function and iii help examine the reliability of satisfying or risk of violating system constraints then a pfcp based water land nexus model has been formulated for managing water land nexus system of the lower reaches of amu darya river basin totally 1080 scenarios related to different irrigation schemes water availabilities electricity consumptions and risk reverse attitudes to objective have also been designed for examining irrigation efficiency s impacts on water land nexus system management solutions for system benefit crop area and water allocation alternatives have been generated under multiple uncertainties and irrigation schemes results show that i system benefit and total crop area increase along with water availability and electricity consumption accompanying with increased of system risk level ii water and land resources would be firstly allocated to vegetables after minimum food requirements are met due to its higher profit iii the lowest unit water benefit 0 15 us m3 and the maximum 0 24 us m3 both occur under the lowest water availability level p 0 01 implying that improvement of irrigation efficiency is more effective under the condition of extreme water resources scarcity iv irrigation mode with efficiency of about 0 61 is an effective option in adaptation to changed water availabilities which is beneficial for pursuing balance between water and land relationships as well as providing compromise between system benefit and risk level generally advancement of irrigation measures as well as optimization water and land allocation patterns are effective management strategies in responding to changed real world conditions e g water availability electricity consumption and market price these findings can help decision makers

11103,agriculture is exposed to climatic impacts especially in developing countries adaptation is the predominant practice that farming communities undertake to deal with these climate induced challenges while significant attention has been devoted to farmers adaptation strategies little is known about how innovative practices are associated with the improvement of rural livelihoods to address this gap the paper attempts to investigate how farmers lead the process of rural innovations that constitute successful forms of adaptation to address the mixed impacts of dyke policies and climate change in two distinct agro ecological zones i e flooding and salinity in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd drawing on qualitative information collected from focus group discussions and interviews across the case studies the paper argues that farmers are the key innovation actors who contribute to improving rural farming and water management practices the study suggests that the evolution of farmer led innovations is mainly attributed to the operation of various informal learning networks that provide important platforms for the generation and diffusion of effective innovative practices across farming communities it also highlights how farmers contribute their innovative knowledge to local adaptation policies from the policy perspective this study sees the development of rural innovation systems as the best practices of farmers adaptation which needs to be scaled out to better support agricultural water management in the delta keywords adaptation floods

potential of smallholder farmers in the caribbean countries lowitt et al 2015 in this study we used qualitative data gathered from focus group discussions fgds and in depth interviews to examine how rural innovations have emerged and developed in the flooding and salinity zones of the delta table 1 the main topics under study concern how farmers got involved in learning practices and how these processes led to the emergence of the innovations that benefit farmers livelihoods the exploration of how farmer based informal learning networks are associated with the evolution of the innovations provides important insights into how farmers contribute to rural development due to the poor knowledge of how rural innovations are derived from farmers adaptation practices in the vmd the application of the exploratory approach in this study is critically important household participants recruited for fgds in this study was based on the participatory approach in particular we coordinated with local government officials and farmer representatives to determine a set of criteria e g socio economic characteristics occupation from which household samples for fgds were built those who are engaged in farming activities e g rice farmers fish farmers were recruited because they are directly affected by the local environments in total nine fgds in the flooding and six fgds in the saline intrusion zones were respectively undertaken key questions concern the impacts of floods and saline intrusion on their livelihoods corresponding adaptation options and learning practices to address these environmental conditions this study involved the application of purposive sampling and snowball sampling methods to approach key informants liamputtong 2013 key informants included local government officials communal district provincial environmental scientists agricultural extension officials and senior farmers who have in depth understanding of flood and saline intrusion situations farmers livelihood conditions and their adaptation performance to environmental conditions overall thirty three interviews with key informants in the flooding and twenty four in the saline intrusion zones were undertaken respectively the data analysis strategy involved the application of thematic analysis assisted by nvivo software bazeley 2007 which assists the identification of themes emerged from the data following neuman√∂s 2011 approach the analysis was inductively implemented the exploratory technique eventually identified several key themes including farmers role in learning practices farmers innovation processes and the diffusion of rural innovations across geographical scales besides the thematic analysis of the primary data this study involved the content analysis of literature e g policy documents scientific reports relevant to rural adaptation policies and practices in the two agro ecological areas this complementary analysis yields important insights contributing substantially to enriching the understanding of the issues under study 4 results and discussion 4 1 dyke driven transformation of rural landscapes water control and irrigation constitute the key component for agricultural development in the vmd this was realized by the extensive construction of dykes and irrigation schemes spanning both upstream flooding and downstream salinity areas vo et al 2017 such development process has driven the substantial transformation of the physical landscapes in tandem with critical socio environmental impacts in the delta tran and james 2017 it was observed that incremental impacts of climate change e g droughts have added greater pressures to local hydrological regimes le et al 2007b kuenzer et al 2013 the complex interactions between flood regimes upstream and saline intrusion in coastal areas under these combined impacts have substantial implications for water based livelihoods of the rural populations hoang et al 2018 there exists the fragmentation of water control and irrigation systems in the delta this is attributed to various socio economic development priorities demanded by local governments given the high flooding conditions and the early success in prawn cultivation the government of phu thanh b finds it essential to maintain low dyke systems to foster flood based farming practices e g wild fish capture freshwater prawn cultivation this decision not only support better off farmers but provide important means of livelihood for poor counterparts in the flood season in the case of phu xuan the year round flood protection of the north vam nao scheme allows farmers to cultivate multiple rice crops e g 3 years 8 crops and short term cash crop systems scheme compartments allow the seasonal rotation of rice crops and provide rooms for flood retention in times of heavy rains or excessive flood flows upstream in the wet season in thoi hung commune the local government maximizes the benefits of using dyke systems to support integrated farming systems e g rice fish culture the state policy to promote rice based agricultural production realized by the extensive building of control projects including irrigation canals dyke systems and sluice gates during the 1990s chu et al 2003 k√§k√∂nen 2008 adds to environmental change in the coastal zones the shrimp market profitability since late 1990s had enabled the dramatic shift from rice based agricultural to aquacultural production which triggered the significant transformation of the coastal physical landscapes k√§k√∂nen 2008 ministry of science and technology mst 2016 in soc trang province for instance the anticipated profits of shrimp led to the extensive wreckage of built structural systems to direct the inflows of brackish water into rice fields cosslett and cosslett 2014 ministry of science and technology mst 2016 these actions contribute to a radical change in land use patterns natural resources and conficts between rice and shrimp farmers nguyen et al 2010 4 2 farming and water management innovation practices developing innovative livelihood practices is closely associated with farmers choice of farming patterns in response to the changed environmental conditions yohannes et al 2017 there are various innovative forms of agriculture and aquaculture based adaptation across the communes table 2 presents various innovative adaptation strategies undertaken by farmers in flooding and salinity zones in the floodplains farmers took advantage of structural systems dykes and abundant availability of floodwater to implement a variety of farming practices for instance farmers in phu thanh b shifted from snakehead fish to the freshwater giant prawn farming practice making creative use of the local high flooding systems in phu xuan commune farmers raised fish in field ditches or took the commune roadside sections to plant short term cash crops e g luffa some others raised eels and used trash fish 1 1 trash fish are of low value for this reason they are utilized as feeds for cultured fish in the delta captured in the flood season as feeds for cultured eels the irrigation system one bund two ditches makes it possible for farmers in thoi hung commune to implement a variety of integrated farming systems e g growing fish in rice fields or intercrop a variety of short term cash crops with mangoes fig 2 another study by berg 2002 found the similar results that this farming model provides a sustainable alternative to rice monoculture from both economic and ecological perspectives an informant in thoi hung described how the one bund two ditches system supports the rice fish farming as follows the ditch provides room for fish nurseries and acts as a refuge for fish when the field water level is low as the summer autumn rice is at the second month growth stage young fish are released into the rice field before rice harvesting water is drained to drive the fish back to the ditch the fish return when floodwaters are flushed into the rice fields reproductive rice 2 2 after the summer autumn rice crop is harvested the remaining stems continue to grow and reproduce rice grains known as reproductive rice l√∫a ch√©t in flooded fields rice grains fall into floodwaters and provide feeds for fish organic matter and nutrients available in the fields provide feeds for the fish interview 14 salinity is one of the key factors that constrains the production of cereal crops especially rice singh et al 2008 therefore farmers in the coastal communes implemented various innovative adaptation strategies to deal with the salinity impacts in particular they replaced rice with sugarcane which can better withstand in salinity affected soils farmers also shifted from single rice to multiple rice crop patterns growing rice in higher elevation areas was also one of key measures to deal with intense salinity results from in depth interviews with local informants revealed that fish farmers flexibly adjusted schedules to release fish to avoid risks of salinity to the survival of fish farmers selected the fingerlings of larger sizes for cultivation rural innovations are characterized by farmers enterprise and creativity in generating and adopting new production approaches that benefit themselves in the flooding areas the successful story of a freshwater prawn farmer in phu thanh b commune demonstrated his sustained efforts in conducting on farm experimentation and interactions with fellow farmers and with flooding environments equally important this illustrated his opportunistic perception of floods as resources rather than constraints whereby he took advantage of in the salinity areas farmers saw the integrated rice shrimp model as an alternative to the rice fish farming in response to harsh salinity conditions this strategy both helps increase the farm productivity and addresses the shortage of freshwater in the dry season similar to their counterparts in the flooding zones farmers in the coastal communes perceived salinity as both a constraint and a natural resource benefit chu et al 2003 this change in understanding enabled them to practice a variety of farming models to diversify sources of income during the dry season farmers play an important role in irrigation water management in their farm plots mutambara et al 2016 in soc trang province to minimize the salinity impacts farmers dug an internal ditch system across the rice field which serves as a channel to both drain out saltwater and store freshwater this innovative approach has proven effective to maintain soil moisture and prevent salt deposition in the farmlands farmers also pumped freshwater into canals or small ponds with a stretching canvas placed underneath fig 3 this provides a better means to store and use freshwater for crop irrigation in conditions of prolonged hot days or freshwater scarcity as expressed by a farmer in soc trang besides the rainwater stored during the rainy season i usually keep freshwater in ponds which is covered by a plastic canvas this helps me effectively deal with extensive salinity periods interview 6 the study identified numerous constraints faced by poor farmers during the adaptation process poor farmers in the flooding zones for the most part had limited access to resources e g land financial capital to maintain their traditional livelihoods or shift to alternative income generating activities they become increasingly dependent on local landowners for employment e g building field bunds weeding or spraying pesticides of which the wages are often low and unstable evidence suggested that the mechanization of agricultural production and declining agriculture based employment induced by dyke building constitute a driving force for the increasing migration of the poor to urban areas tran and james 2017 according to black et al 2011 this migration allowed people to diversify income and build resilience in response to stressors and contribute to rural poverty reduction huynh and le 2011 scheffran et al 2012 in the salinity zones poor farmers implemented off farm or self employment activities to earn a living including collecting scraps petty trading bricklaying and carpentry during saline intrusion periods they can also benefit from labor demands off farm activities from shrimp farmers to et al 2003 as pointed out by ovwigho 2014 off farm activities constitute a continuous stream of income to cater for exigencies of life especially for the poor 4 3 learning as a pathway for rural innovations the rural communities of practice in the vmd provides an open space for the generation of innovations tran et al 2018 farming innovations are often achieved through farmers collaborative learning wu and zhang 2013 and the process of knowledge exchange nooteboom 2000 our study suggests that the development of innovations was derived from learning through farmers acquisition and consolidation of experiential and experimental knowledge represented by their communication with others as a farmer in phu thanh b commune put it we friends treat each other very well my friends came over and provide useful prawn farming techniques i really appreciated that in the same way farmers in thoi hung commune articulated that maintaining regular communication with their fellow farmers and local traders enable them to adopt new farming technology and innovate crop patterns to meet emerging market demands from the perspective of social learning dessie et al 2013 claimed that innovation is not a sole effort of trying something new but a result of successfully integrating a new idea and networking and interactive learning with multiple actors additionally learning occurs through self reflection processes for instance farmers in soc trang province used their own experience in detecting the salinity level a fgd with local farmers suggested the experiential knowledge that if water reflects the star light at night it is indicative of high salinity rural innovations are socially constructed farmers play a key role in constructing and channeling innovations within their learning networks in this sense the innovative knowledge is built through formal interactions with local extension officials or agricultural experts at various learning platforms e g seminars training workshops and informal communication with their bonding networks neighbors relatives friends as similarly found in the flooding and salinity areas farmers communicate their experiences through farm visits convivial gathering e g tea coffee or anniversaries at home or working in the fields these everyday activities spontaneously form informal learning networks or communities of practice in which collaborative learning occurs tran et al 2018 these findings were consistent with chambers√∂s et al 1993 studies on how farmers contribute their empirical knowledge in the rural context in africa to some extent this challenges the domination of the science driven conventional knowledge ≈°≈´mane et al 2017 from the innovation perspective farmers are the key agents for rural change dolinska and d√∂aquino 2016 highlighting the role of farmers in this regard beckford 2002 argued that farmers views must be taken into account when accessing the usefulness of their innovations this study identified a strong connection between farmers and extension officials through shared learning practices these activities promoted the exchange between local and scientific knowledge enabling farmers to advance their local knowledge and extension officials to obtain practical understanding of farming innovations and consolidate their theoretical knowledge the findings corroborate the peruvian case of potato park on the collaborative learning between farmers and scientists in improving local innovations swiderska 2014 these linkages enabled local farming communities to share the knowledge system of conserving potato varieties and simultaneously negotiate broader access and benefit sharing agreements with scientists in this study the collaborative learning between farmers and extension officials on the one hand provided an empirical foundation for scientific acknowledgement and assert the validity of the farming innovations and facilitated the translation of farming innovations into the local adaptation policies on the other hand however it is equally recognized that while external interventions may present constraints to local natural environment conditions it would be necessary for decision makers to provide more room for famers to develop innovative practices to minimize negative impacts yohannes et al 2017 4 4 contribution of farmers innovations to local adaptation policies farmers innovations make an important contribution to the reframing of local development policies the success of the prawn farming model in phu thanh b entered into policy discourses which subsequently enabled institutional learning and adjustment of adaptation practices in thoi hung commune cash crop farming practices e g intercropping gained greater recognition by the local government as an essential means to generate seasonal income for farmers these insights correspond to leitgeb et al s 2011 study that cuban farmers contribute their experiments and innovative knowledge to the local agricultural innovation systems given the substantial evidence of farmers knowledge contribution to sustainable and resilient agriculture ≈°≈´mane et al 2017 called for the formal and equitable recognition of farmers as co authors of knowledge generation and practitioners in innovation processes in the adaptation context of the vmd the recognition of farmers contribution to the local farming innovation systems has been gradually improved contribution of farmers innovative farming models into the local adaptation practices represents a policy learning process eckerberg and joas 2004 as ingold and varone 2012 denoted this is an essential component of institutional change from the perspective of polycentric governance chu et al 2014a b emphasized that despite being bound in the context of strong state power an inclusive decision making process can occur the iterative interactions between government officials and farmers to some degree shape and reshape the rules of the game that meet their own needs chu et al 2014a b these farming innovation impacts indicate the greater recognition of the value and influence of locally based farming innovations which not only challenges the conventional technological approach but also complements the existing policy gaps in rural development and poverty reduction as the traditional top down decision making process is not adequate to provide appropriate solutions to local communities innovations suggest local efforts in promoting the development of local knowledge to bridge such gaps blanco 2006 enhanced recognition and promotion of farmers role in this regard provides a powerful stimulus for further development of rural innovations highlighting the contribution of farmers in this regard swiderska 2014 53 pointed out that the current top down approach of investing heavily in scientific innovation but ignoring small scale farmers not only misses the risks to farming communities stock of knowledge built up over generations but also actively erodes farmers ability to adapt to climate challenges 5 conclusions the evolution of rural innovations led by farmers in this study represents how farmers have learned to adapt to environmental changes in the vmd it suggests the ways farmers persistently explore and utilize their own experiences of local environments and develop innovative forms of knowledge supported by everyday communications and interactions with others this reflects the mixed values of what taylor 2001 terms a spirit of pioneering even of adventure held by rural farmers in response to environmental challenges learning is a key component to farmers development of farming and water management innovations various learning platforms e g casual gatherings in house training enable farmers to acquire a wide range of knowledge provided by fellow farmers and agricultural experts these processes consequently turned farmers as learners into innovative practitioners the case studies in the flooding and salinity zones demonstrate the significance of collaborative learning between farmers and extension officials contributing substantially to policy learning on the ground the policy change in adaptation suggests meaningful bottom up feedback that influences the reframing of the decision making process to address the environmental issues greater attention to this process not only helps sustain the continuing spirit of the rural communities to foster the development of rural innovation systems but also promote the institutionalization of innovative knowledge into rural development policy it is equally important that the local government should formalize facilitate and scale up collaborative networks to accelerate rural innovations on a larger scale and benefits the wider farming communities wu and zhang 2013 from the policy perspective this study sees the development of rural innovation systems as the best practices of farmers adaptation maintaining these efforts would make significant contribution to improving

11103,agriculture is exposed to climatic impacts especially in developing countries adaptation is the predominant practice that farming communities undertake to deal with these climate induced challenges while significant attention has been devoted to farmers adaptation strategies little is known about how innovative practices are associated with the improvement of rural livelihoods to address this gap the paper attempts to investigate how farmers lead the process of rural innovations that constitute successful forms of adaptation to address the mixed impacts of dyke policies and climate change in two distinct agro ecological zones i e flooding and salinity in the vietnamese mekong delta vmd drawing on qualitative information collected from focus group discussions and interviews across the case studies the paper argues that farmers are the key innovation actors who contribute to improving rural farming and water management practices the study suggests that the evolution of farmer led innovations is mainly attributed to the operation of various informal learning networks that provide important platforms for the generation and diffusion of effective innovative practices across farming communities it also highlights how farmers contribute their innovative knowledge to local adaptation policies from the policy perspective this study sees the development of rural innovation systems as the best practices of farmers adaptation which needs to be scaled out to better support agricultural water management in the delta keywords adaptation floods

government officials communal district provincial environmental scientists agricultural extension officials and senior farmers who have in depth understanding of flood and saline intrusion situations farmers livelihood conditions and their adaptation performance to environmental conditions overall thirty three interviews with key informants in the flooding and twenty four in the saline intrusion zones were undertaken respectively the data analysis strategy involved the application of thematic analysis assisted by nvivo software bazeley 2007 which assists the identification of themes emerged from the data following neuman√∂s 2011 approach the analysis was inductively implemented the exploratory technique eventually identified several key themes including farmers role in learning practices farmers innovation processes and the diffusion of rural innovations across geographical scales besides the thematic analysis of the primary data this study involved the content analysis of literature e g policy documents scientific reports relevant to rural adaptation policies and practices in the two agro ecological areas this complementary analysis yields important insights contributing substantially to enriching the understanding of the issues under study 4 results and discussion 4 1 dyke driven transformation of rural landscapes water control and irrigation constitute the key component for agricultural development in the vmd this was realized by the extensive construction of dykes and irrigation schemes spanning both upstream flooding and downstream salinity areas vo et al 2017 such development process has driven the substantial transformation of the physical landscapes in tandem with critical socio environmental impacts in the delta tran and james 2017 it was observed that incremental impacts of climate change e g droughts have added greater pressures to local hydrological regimes le et al 2007b kuenzer et al 2013 the complex interactions between flood regimes upstream and saline intrusion in coastal areas under these combined impacts have substantial implications for water based livelihoods of the rural populations hoang et al 2018 there exists the fragmentation of water control and irrigation systems in the delta this is attributed to various socio economic development priorities demanded by local governments given the high flooding conditions and the early success in prawn cultivation the government of phu thanh b finds it essential to maintain low dyke systems to foster flood based farming practices e g wild fish capture freshwater prawn cultivation this decision not only support better off farmers but provide important means of livelihood for poor counterparts in the flood season in the case of phu xuan the year round flood protection of the north vam nao scheme allows farmers to cultivate multiple rice crops e g 3 years 8 crops and short term cash crop systems scheme compartments allow the seasonal rotation of rice crops and provide rooms for flood retention in times of heavy rains or excessive flood flows upstream in the wet season in thoi hung commune the local government maximizes the benefits of using dyke systems to support integrated farming systems e g rice fish culture the state policy to promote rice based agricultural production realized by the extensive building of control projects including irrigation canals dyke systems and sluice gates during the 1990s chu et al 2003 k√§k√∂nen 2008 adds to environmental change in the coastal zones the shrimp market profitability since late 1990s had enabled the dramatic shift from rice based agricultural to aquacultural production which triggered the significant transformation of the coastal physical landscapes k√§k√∂nen 2008 ministry of science and technology mst 2016 in soc trang province for instance the anticipated profits of shrimp led to the extensive wreckage of built structural systems to direct the inflows of brackish water into rice fields cosslett and cosslett 2014 ministry of science and technology mst 2016 these actions contribute to a radical change in land use patterns natural resources and conficts between rice and shrimp farmers nguyen et al 2010 4 2 farming and water management innovation practices developing innovative livelihood practices is closely associated with farmers choice of farming patterns in response to the changed environmental conditions yohannes et al 2017 there are various innovative forms of agriculture and aquaculture based adaptation across the communes table 2 presents various innovative adaptation strategies undertaken by farmers in flooding and salinity zones in the floodplains farmers took advantage of structural systems dykes and abundant availability of floodwater to implement a variety of farming practices for instance farmers in phu thanh b shifted from snakehead fish to the freshwater giant prawn farming practice making creative use of the local high flooding systems in phu xuan commune farmers raised fish in field ditches or took the commune roadside sections to plant short term cash crops e g luffa some others raised eels and used trash fish 1 1 trash fish are of low value for this reason they are utilized as feeds for cultured fish in the delta captured in the flood season as feeds for cultured eels the irrigation system one bund two ditches makes it possible for farmers in thoi hung commune to implement a variety of integrated farming systems e g growing fish in rice fields or intercrop a variety of short term cash crops with mangoes fig 2 another study by berg 2002 found the similar results that this farming model provides a sustainable alternative to rice monoculture from both economic and ecological perspectives an informant in thoi hung described how the one bund two ditches system supports the rice fish farming as follows the ditch provides room for fish nurseries and acts as a refuge for fish when the field water level is low as the summer autumn rice is at the second month growth stage young fish are released into the rice field before rice harvesting water is drained to drive the fish back to the ditch the fish return when floodwaters are flushed into the rice fields reproductive rice 2 2 after the summer autumn rice crop is harvested the remaining stems continue to grow and reproduce rice grains known as reproductive rice l√∫a ch√©t in flooded fields rice grains fall into floodwaters and provide feeds for fish organic matter and nutrients available in the fields provide feeds for the fish interview 14 salinity is one of the key factors that constrains the production of cereal crops especially rice singh et al 2008 therefore farmers in the coastal communes implemented various innovative adaptation strategies to deal with the salinity impacts in particular they replaced rice with sugarcane which can better withstand in salinity affected soils farmers also shifted from single rice to multiple rice crop patterns growing rice in higher elevation areas was also one of key measures to deal with intense salinity results from in depth interviews with local informants revealed that fish farmers flexibly adjusted schedules to release fish to avoid risks of salinity to the survival of fish farmers selected the fingerlings of larger sizes for cultivation rural innovations are characterized by farmers enterprise and creativity in generating and adopting new production approaches that benefit themselves in the flooding areas the successful story of a freshwater prawn farmer in phu thanh b commune demonstrated his sustained efforts in conducting on farm experimentation and interactions with fellow farmers and with flooding environments equally important this illustrated his opportunistic perception of floods as resources rather than constraints whereby he took advantage of in the salinity areas farmers saw the integrated rice shrimp model as an alternative to the rice fish farming in response to harsh salinity conditions this strategy both helps increase the farm productivity and addresses the shortage of freshwater in the dry season similar to their counterparts in the flooding zones farmers in the coastal communes perceived salinity as both a constraint and a natural resource benefit chu et al 2003 this change in understanding enabled them to practice a variety of farming models to diversify sources of income during the dry season farmers play an important role in irrigation water management in their farm plots mutambara et al 2016 in soc trang province to minimize the salinity impacts farmers dug an internal ditch system across the rice field which serves as a channel to both drain out saltwater and store freshwater this innovative approach has proven effective to maintain soil moisture and prevent salt deposition in the farmlands farmers also pumped freshwater into canals or small ponds with a stretching canvas placed underneath fig 3 this provides a better means to store and use freshwater for crop irrigation in conditions of prolonged hot days or freshwater scarcity as expressed by a farmer in soc trang besides the rainwater stored during the rainy season i usually keep freshwater in ponds which is covered by a plastic canvas this helps me effectively deal with extensive salinity periods interview 6 the study identified numerous constraints faced by poor farmers during the adaptation process poor farmers in the flooding zones for the most part had limited access to resources e g land financial capital to maintain their traditional livelihoods or shift to alternative income generating activities they become increasingly dependent on local landowners for employment e g building field bunds weeding or spraying pesticides of which the wages are often low and unstable evidence suggested that the mechanization of agricultural production and declining agriculture based employment induced by dyke building constitute a driving force for the increasing migration of the poor to urban areas tran and james 2017 according to black et al 2011 this migration allowed people to diversify income and build resilience in response to stressors and contribute to rural poverty reduction huynh and le 2011 scheffran et al 2012 in the salinity zones poor farmers implemented off farm or self employment activities to earn a living including collecting scraps petty trading bricklaying and carpentry during saline intrusion periods they can also benefit from labor demands off farm activities from shrimp farmers to et al 2003 as pointed out by ovwigho 2014 off farm activities constitute a continuous stream of income to cater for exigencies of life especially for the poor 4 3 learning as a pathway for rural innovations the rural communities of practice in the vmd provides an open space for the generation of innovations tran et al 2018 farming innovations are often achieved through farmers collaborative learning wu and zhang 2013 and the process of knowledge exchange nooteboom 2000 our study suggests that the development of innovations was derived from learning through farmers acquisition and consolidation of experiential and experimental knowledge represented by their communication with others as a farmer in phu thanh b commune put it we friends treat each other very well my friends came over and provide useful prawn farming techniques i really appreciated that in the same way farmers in thoi hung commune articulated that maintaining regular communication with their fellow farmers and local traders enable them to adopt new farming technology and innovate crop patterns to meet emerging market demands from the perspective of social learning dessie et al 2013 claimed that innovation is not a sole effort of trying something new but a result of successfully integrating a new idea and networking and interactive learning with multiple actors additionally learning occurs through self reflection processes for instance farmers in soc trang province used their own experience in detecting the salinity level a fgd with local farmers suggested the experiential knowledge that if water reflects the star light at night it is indicative of high salinity rural innovations are socially constructed farmers play a key role in constructing and channeling innovations within their learning networks in this sense the innovative knowledge is built through formal interactions with local extension officials or agricultural experts at various learning platforms e g seminars training workshops and informal communication with their bonding networks neighbors relatives friends as similarly found in the flooding and salinity areas farmers communicate their experiences through farm visits convivial gathering e g tea coffee or anniversaries at home or working in the fields these everyday activities spontaneously form informal learning networks or communities of practice in which collaborative learning occurs tran et al 2018 these findings were consistent with chambers√∂s et al 1993 studies on how farmers contribute their empirical knowledge in the rural context in africa to some extent this challenges the domination of the science driven conventional knowledge ≈°≈´mane et al 2017 from the innovation perspective farmers are the key agents for rural change dolinska and d√∂aquino 2016 highlighting the role of farmers in this regard beckford 2002 argued that farmers views must be taken into account when accessing the usefulness of their innovations this study identified a strong connection between farmers and extension officials through shared learning practices these activities promoted the exchange between local and scientific knowledge enabling farmers to advance their local knowledge and extension officials to obtain practical understanding of farming innovations and consolidate their theoretical knowledge the findings corroborate the peruvian case of potato park on the collaborative learning between farmers and scientists in improving local innovations swiderska 2014 these linkages enabled local farming communities to share the knowledge system of conserving potato varieties and simultaneously negotiate broader access and benefit sharing agreements with scientists in this study the collaborative learning between farmers and extension officials on the one hand provided an empirical foundation for scientific acknowledgement and assert the validity of the farming innovations and facilitated the translation of farming innovations into the local adaptation policies on the other hand however it is equally recognized that while external interventions may present constraints to local natural environment conditions it would be necessary for decision makers to provide more room for famers to develop innovative practices to minimize negative impacts yohannes et al 2017 4 4 contribution of farmers innovations to local adaptation policies farmers innovations make an important contribution to the reframing of local development policies the success of the prawn farming model in phu thanh b entered into policy discourses which subsequently enabled institutional learning and adjustment of adaptation practices in thoi hung commune cash crop farming practices e g intercropping gained greater recognition by the local government as an essential means to generate seasonal income for farmers these insights correspond to leitgeb et al s 2011 study that cuban farmers contribute their experiments and innovative knowledge to the local agricultural innovation systems given the substantial evidence of farmers knowledge contribution to sustainable and resilient agriculture ≈°≈´mane et al 2017 called for the formal and equitable recognition of farmers as co authors of knowledge generation and practitioners in innovation processes in the adaptation context of the vmd the recognition of farmers contribution to the local farming innovation systems has been gradually improved contribution of farmers innovative farming models into the local adaptation practices represents a policy learning process eckerberg and joas 2004 as ingold and varone 2012 denoted this is an essential component of institutional change from the perspective of polycentric governance chu et al 2014a b emphasized that despite being bound in the context of strong state power an inclusive decision making process can occur the iterative interactions between government officials and farmers to some degree shape and reshape the rules of the game that meet their own needs chu et al 2014a b these farming innovation impacts indicate the greater recognition of the value and influence of locally based farming innovations which not only challenges the conventional technological approach but also complements the existing policy gaps in rural development and poverty reduction as the traditional top down decision making process is not adequate to provide appropriate solutions to local communities innovations suggest local efforts in promoting the development of local knowledge to bridge such gaps blanco 2006 enhanced recognition and promotion of farmers role in this regard provides a powerful stimulus for further development of rural innovations highlighting the contribution of farmers in this regard swiderska 2014 53 pointed out that the current top down approach of investing heavily in scientific innovation but ignoring small scale farmers not only misses the risks to farming communities stock of knowledge built up over generations but also actively erodes farmers ability to adapt to climate challenges 5 conclusions the evolution of rural innovations led by farmers in this study represents how farmers have learned to adapt to environmental changes in the vmd it suggests the ways farmers persistently explore and utilize their own experiences of local environments and develop innovative forms of knowledge supported by everyday communications and interactions with others this reflects the mixed values of what taylor 2001 terms a spirit of pioneering even of adventure held by rural farmers in response to environmental challenges learning is a key component to farmers development of farming and water management innovations various learning platforms e g casual gatherings in house training enable farmers to acquire a wide range of knowledge provided by fellow farmers and agricultural experts these processes consequently turned farmers as learners into innovative practitioners the case studies in the flooding and salinity zones demonstrate the significance of collaborative learning between farmers and extension officials contributing substantially to policy learning on the ground the policy change in adaptation suggests meaningful bottom up feedback that influences the reframing of the decision making process to address the environmental issues greater attention to this process not only helps sustain the continuing spirit of the rural communities to foster the development of rural innovation systems but also promote the institutionalization of innovative knowledge into rural development policy it is equally important that the local government should formalize facilitate and scale up collaborative networks to accelerate rural innovations on a larger scale and benefits the wider farming communities wu and zhang 2013 from the policy perspective this study sees the development of rural innovation systems as the best practices of farmers adaptation maintaining these efforts would make significant contribution to improving

mitigate negative effects of water deficit in physalis angulata plants improving photosynthetic rates maintenance of leaf water potential and growth keywords drought solanaceae unexploited species sodium nitroprusside stress mitigation 1 introduction abiotic stress is a major constraint for agricultural production all over the world and drought is the most important limiting factor asgher et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 especially in drylands that comprise approximately 40 of terrestrial globe schlaepfer et al 2017 under these conditions cultivated plants or native species may present morphological and physiological changes in response to water deficit on the other hand the lack of water in the soil during drought periods also causes an overproduction of reactive oxygen species ros such as hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen which are potentially harmful to all cellular components cechin et al 2015 to avoid potential damage caused by ros accumulation because of the highly cytotoxic and reactive nature their accumulation in plant tissues and intracellular compartments must be tightly controlled tanveer and shabala 2018 in this sense plants have developed strategies to combat these deleterious effects as increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes for ros scavenging and modulation of stress responsive genes expression siddiqui et al 2011 cai et al 2015 as well as nitric oxide production nitric oxide no is a signaling molecule in all plant cells and act as an antioxidant quenching ros during oxidative stress reducing lipid peroxidation and mediating photosynthesis and stomatal conductance hasanuzzaman et al 2018 no has a role on other physiological processes such as growth regulation sanz et al 2015 vegetative growth lozano juste and le√≥n 2011 chlorophyll biosynthesis zhang et al 2006 flowering he et al 2004 maturation leshem and pinchasov 2000 and senescence mishina et al 2007 some researchers have suggested that exogenous no is able to improve the alleviation of water deficit in crops such as tomato jangid and dwivedi 2017 sugarcane silveira et al 2016 sunflower cechin et al 2015 and rice cai et al 2015 in a scenario of climate changes and decreasing water resources the development of novel agriculture practices about water deficit tolerance is of utmost importance to improve crop yield and understand how plants cope with environmental challenges silveira et al 2016 however available research on exogenous no donors in wild species or landraces as physalis angulata solanaceae is still scarce this species is an important plant genetic resource of natural occurrence in the brazilian semi arid region and has attracted interest due to the production of compounds with pharmacological and antioxidant capacity leite et al 2018a and potential for fruticulture of small fruits nevertheless p angulata does not have established cultivation techniques which characterizes it as an underutilized species the use of underexploited plant genetic resources may enable agricultural production under unfavorable edaphoclimatic conditions as prolonged water deficit in addition to this understanding the exogenous nitric oxide effects on plants under these conditions becomes important on the selection of potential genotypes as well as in establishing crops there are no available studies related to the use of nitric oxide as a water deficit mitigator in p angulata some studies have evaluated the performance of this species under conditions of water deficit souza and amorim 2009 ozaslan et al 2016 leite et al 2018b as well as the characterization of the responses to the use of a possible mitigator of the afore mentioned abiotic stress that may contribute to the development of this undervalued crop as such this study aimed at assessing the influence of an exogenous nitric oxide donor application on the attenuation of water deficit symptoms in physalis angulata plants 2 materials and methods 2 1

the pots were saturated with distilled water sealed with a polyvinyl chloride pvc film and suspended to drain water excess after drainage 24 h the pots were weighed again and by weight difference the maximum water retention capacity of the soil in the pots was obtained according to bonfim silva et al 2011 the evapotranspiration of each pot was determined based on weight by using an electronic scale 5 g of precision and distilled water replenishment was performed according to the gravimetric method using daily weighing twice a day neglecting the daily increase in plants weight leite et al

performance and chlorophyll content gaseous exchanges and chlorophyll content were influenced by nitric oxide no exogenous supply in p angulata plants under water deficit fig 2 carbon assimilation a was reduced during low water availability period fig 2a although sodium nitroprusside snp supply at a concentration of 25 Œºm promoted an increase of 37 9 9 60 Œºmol co2 m 2 s 1 in comparison to plants in the same water conditions without snp application 6 96 Œºmol co2 m 2 s 1 for other evaluated concentrations a reduction in carbon assimilation was perceived stomatal conductance gs and transpiration e presented similar responses in plants under water deficit as a function of snp concentrations fig 2b and c under these conditions plants sprayed with 50 Œºm of snp presented highest values for gs and e corresponding to an increase of 59 40 and 39 5 respectively in relation to plants under water deficit without snp sub stomatal co2 concentration ci increased when the plants were submitted to water deficit fig 2d snp supply at 25 Œºmol promoted a slight reduction in internal carbon although this effect was not maintained at other concentrations water use efficiency wue reduction in plants under water deficit was reversed by spraying with 25 Œºmol of snp concentrations above that value promoted wue reduction fig 2e total chlorophyll content increased under water deficiency in presence or absence of snp compared to well watered plants the highest values for total chlorophyll chltotal were observed in plants sprayed with 75 Œºm and 100 Œºm obtaining 52 14 Œºg cm 2 and 50 05 Œºg cm 2 of chltotal respectively fig 2f 3 2 effects of water deficit and no on the plant water relations and sugars accumulation exogenous nitric oxide has influenced water relations and sugar accumulation in p angulata plants under water deficit fig 3 relative water content rwc decreased when the plants were submitted to water deficit and no exogenous application did not promote their attenuation fig 3a lower values than those observed for plants under water deficit without no supply were observed in plants sprayed with 75 Œºm and 100 Œºm snp presenting rwc of 69 33 and 64 49 respectively plants of all treatments under water deficit with or without snp had lower water potentials œàw foliar than well watered plants fig 3b however there was an increase in the mean of œàw foliar for plants sprayed with 25 Œºmol of snp the most negative potentials were observed at concentrations of 50 Œºm 75 Œºm and 100 Œºm with œàw foliar of 1 07 mpa 1 10 mpa and 1 20 mpa respectively the sugar content in leaves showed a similar tendency for œàw foliar fig 3c and d the lowest values for total soluble sugars and reducing sugars contents were determined in well watered plants followed by plants sprayed with 25 Œºm snp no supply at snp concentrations above 25 Œºm promoted a higher sugars accumulation in p angulata plants under low water availability 3 3 no mitigates the effects of water deficit on plant growth parameters the growth of plants cultivated under water deficit was influenced by the exogenous supply of no fig 4 plant height was reduced during water deficit period although snp supply at concentrations of 25 Œºm and 50 Œºm promoted an increase of 19 46 and 25 43 compared to plants under the same water deficit conditions without snp delivery fig 4a snp applications above these concentrations promoted the reduction of this variable stem diameter was also reduced with the presence of snp except for 25 Œºm where there was an increase of 2 39 in relation to plants with water deficit without snp fig 4 b leaf area reduction in plants under water deficit was reversed with application of 25 Œºm of snp which was 3 85 lower than that of well watered plants fig 4c other concentrations of snp in syrup spray did not promote increases on this variable shoot dry mass of plants under water deficit was increased at all evaluated snp concentrations although the highest mean value was observed when using 25 Œºm fig 4d the total dry mass presented a similar behavior for the same concentration with a 19 25 increase in relation to plants cultivated under water deficit without exogenous no fig 4e total fruit yield was reduced in all treatments under water deficit fig 4f 4 discussion nitric oxide is a lipophilic and bioactive free radical that acts as signaling molecule with different physiological functions wu et al 2011 with many evidences confirming that no promotes the mitigation of abiotic stress effects in plants cai et al 2015 cechin et al 2015 silveira et al 2016 jangid and dwivedi 2017 however the mechanisms of action are not yet fully elucidated because they depend on many factors such as species exogenous nitric oxide donor concentration pre treatment and duration of foliar application in this work exogenous no supply promoted the attenuation of water deficit on gas exchange water potential sugars accumulation and growth gas exchanges were reduced in p angulata plants due to water deficit notably carbon assimilation transpiration stomatal conductance and water use efficiency the effects of reducing water availability on photosynthetic rate were reported in some studies wang et al 2016a pazzagli et al 2016 though research shows that nitric oxide plays a role in improvement of photosynthetic performance silveira et al 2016 liu et al 2013 reduction of photosynthesis observed in plants under water deficit is related to stomatal closure and consequent reduction of co2 flux to carboxylation site bosco et al 2009 and biochemical limitations silva et al 2012 exogenous no supply by snp under low concentrations promoted improvement in a probably because snp is the only no donor that stimulates electron transport through photosystem ii proch√°zkov√° et al 2013 and increases the activity of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco fatma and khan 2014 stomatal conductance is closely associated with the osmotic status of plant cells and exogenous no also affects its regulation inducing stomatal opening hasanuzzaman et al 2018 plants treated with the lowest concentrations of snp maintained the transpiration at low levels and consequently promoted an improvement in wue fig 2 gupta et al 2017 also reported water use efficiency increases in plants supplemented with snp however the higher observed values for stomatal conductance and transpiration induced by nitric oxide are correlated to lower wue the exogenous no supply also promoted higher ci concentrations in plants under water deficit though ci increase was not associated with an increase in photosynthesis at higher snp concentrations p angulata plants under water deficit showed an increase in total chlorophyll content unlike other studies that report the degradation of chlorophyll in water deficit conditions deveci and celik 2016 and salinity rezende et al 2018 in p peruviana plants the increase in photosynthetic pigments concentration shows that the species presents a tolerant characteristic to water deficit aiming to an increase of photosynthetic assimilation of co2 in order to maintain its development moura et al 2016 which was further enhanced with no exogenous application exogenous nitric oxide promoted the increase of photosynthetic pigments in different species under abiotic stress as tomato manai et al 2014 rice habib et al 2013 and chickpea ahmad et al 2016 a maintenance of suboptimal soil water content influences plants water relations pu√©rtolas et al 2017 which was evidenced with p angulata through the reduction in relative water content rwc and water potential œàw foliar when cultivated under water deficit reductions in relative water content were observed in plants of the genus physalis souza and amorim 2009 segura monroy et al 2015 as well as reductions in water potential for other species under conditions of low soil water availability ronchi et al 2015 mota and cano 2016 the reduction observed in œàw foliar may be related to sugars accumulation in leaves which together with other physiological mechanisms such as stomatal closure

concentrations of snp used in this work reduce rwc in p angulata plants on the other hand exogenous no supply influenced leaf water potential with a direct relationship with sugars accumulation in plants the lowest values for total soluble sugars and reducing sugars contents were determined in well watered plants followed by plants sprayed with 25 Œºm snp it is still unclear how no acts on maintenance of water status in plants however it was reported that no could reduce the cellular solute potential and promote increase of water potential in plants under osmotic stress ke et al 2013

exogenous no donor was used in this study to evaluate the potential of no in water deficit mitigation in physalis angulata plants this species is a genetic resource underexploited in brazil but that has uses in traditional medicine and potential for growing of small fruits gaseous exchanges chlorophyll content water relations sugar accumulation and growth parameters were evaluated in this work despite water deficit influence on all variables exogenous application of nitric oxide promoted attenuation of symptoms on photosynthetic performance notably carbon assimilation water use efficiency and chlorophyll content relative water content seems not to be influenced by exogenous supply of no while direct relationship between sugars accumulation and leaf water potential promoted by exogenous no was observed similarly no reversed and or attenuated symptoms of water deficit on plant growth especially plant height dry matter accumulation and leaf area low concentrations of snp have shown to mitigate negative effects of water deficit in physalis angulata plants improving photosynthetic rates maintenance of leaf water potential and growth keywords drought solanaceae unexploited species sodium nitroprusside stress mitigation 1 introduction abiotic stress is a major constraint for agricultural production all over the world and drought is the most important limiting factor asgher et al 2017 hussain et al 2018 especially in drylands that comprise approximately 40 of terrestrial globe schlaepfer et al 2017 under these conditions cultivated plants or native species may present morphological and physiological changes in response to water deficit on the other hand the lack of water in the soil during drought periods also causes an overproduction of reactive oxygen species ros such as hydrogen peroxide and singlet oxygen which are potentially harmful to all cellular components cechin et al 2015 to avoid potential damage caused by ros accumulation because of the highly cytotoxic and reactive nature their accumulation in plant tissues and intracellular compartments must be tightly controlled tanveer and shabala 2018 in this sense plants have developed strategies to combat these deleterious effects as increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes for ros scavenging and modulation of stress responsive genes expression siddiqui et al 2011 cai et al 2015 as well as nitric oxide production nitric oxide no is a signaling molecule in all plant cells and act as an antioxidant quenching ros during oxidative stress reducing lipid peroxidation and mediating photosynthesis and stomatal conductance hasanuzzaman et al 2018 no has a role on other physiological processes such as growth regulation sanz et al 2015 vegetative growth lozano juste and le√≥n 2011 chlorophyll biosynthesis zhang et al 2006 flowering he et al 2004 maturation leshem and pinchasov 2000 and senescence mishina et al 2007 some researchers have suggested that exogenous no is able to improve the alleviation of water deficit in crops such as tomato jangid and dwivedi 2017 sugarcane silveira et al 2016 sunflower cechin et al 2015 and rice cai et al 2015 in a scenario of climate changes and decreasing water resources the development of novel agriculture practices about water deficit tolerance is of utmost importance to improve crop yield and understand how plants cope with environmental challenges silveira et al 2016 however available research on exogenous no donors in wild species or landraces as physalis angulata solanaceae is still scarce this species is an important plant genetic resource of natural occurrence in the brazilian semi arid region and has attracted interest due to the production of compounds with pharmacological and antioxidant capacity leite et al 2018a and potential for fruticulture of small fruits nevertheless p angulata does not have established cultivation techniques which characterizes it as an underutilized species the use of underexploited plant genetic resources may enable agricultural production under unfavorable edaphoclimatic conditions as prolonged water deficit in addition to this understanding the exogenous nitric oxide effects on plants under these conditions becomes important on the selection of potential genotypes as well as in establishing crops there are no available studies related to the use of nitric oxide as a water deficit mitigator in p angulata some studies have evaluated the performance of this species under conditions of water deficit souza and amorim 2009 ozaslan et al 2016 leite et al 2018b as well as the characterization of the responses to the use of a possible mitigator of the afore mentioned abiotic stress that may contribute to the development of this undervalued crop as such this study aimed at assessing the influence of an exogenous nitric oxide donor application on the attenuation of water deficit symptoms in physalis angulata plants 2 materials and methods 2 1

performance and chlorophyll content gaseous exchanges and chlorophyll content were influenced by nitric oxide no exogenous supply in p angulata plants under water deficit fig 2 carbon assimilation a was reduced during low water availability period fig 2a although sodium nitroprusside snp supply at a concentration of 25 Œºm promoted an increase of 37 9 9 60 Œºmol co2 m 2 s 1 in comparison to plants in the same water conditions without snp application 6 96 Œºmol co2 m 2 s 1 for other evaluated concentrations a reduction in carbon assimilation was perceived stomatal conductance gs and transpiration e presented similar responses in plants under water deficit as a function of snp concentrations fig 2b and c under these conditions plants sprayed with 50 Œºm of snp presented highest values for gs and e corresponding to an increase of 59 40 and 39 5 respectively in relation to plants under water deficit without snp sub stomatal co2 concentration ci increased when the plants were submitted to water deficit fig 2d snp supply at 25 Œºmol promoted a slight reduction in internal carbon although this effect was not maintained at other concentrations water use efficiency wue reduction in plants under water deficit was reversed by spraying with 25 Œºmol of snp concentrations above that value promoted wue reduction fig 2e total chlorophyll content increased under water deficiency in presence or absence of snp compared to well watered plants the highest values for total chlorophyll chltotal were observed in plants sprayed with 75 Œºm and 100 Œºm obtaining 52 14 Œºg cm 2 and 50 05 Œºg cm 2 of chltotal respectively fig 2f 3 2 effects of water deficit and no on the plant water relations and sugars accumulation exogenous nitric oxide has influenced water relations and sugar accumulation in p angulata plants under water deficit fig 3 relative water content rwc decreased when the plants were submitted to water deficit and no exogenous application did not promote their attenuation fig 3a lower values than those observed for plants under water deficit without no supply were observed in plants sprayed with 75 Œºm and 100 Œºm snp presenting rwc of 69 33 and 64 49 respectively plants of all treatments under water deficit with or without snp had lower water potentials œàw foliar than well watered plants fig 3b however there was an increase in the mean of œàw foliar for plants sprayed with 25 Œºmol of snp the most negative potentials were observed at concentrations of 50 Œºm 75 Œºm and 100 Œºm with œàw foliar of 1 07 mpa 1 10 mpa and 1 20 mpa respectively the sugar content in leaves showed a similar tendency for œàw foliar fig 3c and d the lowest values for total soluble sugars and reducing sugars contents were determined in well watered plants followed by plants sprayed with 25 Œºm snp no supply at snp concentrations above 25 Œºm promoted a higher sugars accumulation in p angulata plants under low water availability 3 3 no mitigates the effects of water deficit on plant growth parameters the growth of plants cultivated under water deficit was influenced by the exogenous supply of no fig 4 plant height was reduced during water deficit period although snp supply at concentrations of 25 Œºm and 50 Œºm promoted an increase of 19 46 and 25 43 compared to plants under the same water deficit conditions without snp delivery fig 4a snp applications above these concentrations promoted the reduction of this variable stem diameter was also reduced with the presence of snp except for 25 Œºm where there was an increase of 2 39 in relation to plants with water deficit without snp fig 4 b leaf area reduction in plants under water deficit was reversed with application of 25 Œºm of snp which was 3 85 lower than that of well watered plants fig 4c other concentrations of snp in syrup spray did not promote increases on this variable shoot dry mass of plants under water deficit was increased at all evaluated snp concentrations although the highest mean value was observed when using 25 Œºm fig 4d the total dry mass presented a similar behavior for the same concentration with a 19 25 increase in relation to plants cultivated under water deficit without exogenous no fig 4e total fruit yield was reduced in all treatments under water deficit fig 4f 4 discussion nitric oxide is a lipophilic and bioactive free radical that acts as signaling molecule with different physiological functions wu et al 2011 with many evidences confirming that no promotes the mitigation of abiotic stress effects in plants cai et al 2015 cechin et al 2015 silveira et al 2016 jangid and dwivedi 2017 however the mechanisms of action are not yet fully elucidated because they depend on many factors such as species exogenous nitric oxide donor concentration pre treatment and duration of foliar application in this work exogenous no supply promoted the attenuation of water deficit on gas exchange water potential sugars accumulation and growth gas exchanges were reduced in p angulata plants due to water deficit notably carbon assimilation transpiration stomatal conductance and water use efficiency the effects of reducing water availability on photosynthetic rate were reported in some studies wang et al 2016a pazzagli et al 2016 though research shows that nitric oxide plays a role in improvement of photosynthetic performance silveira et al 2016 liu et al 2013 reduction of photosynthesis observed in plants under water deficit is related to stomatal closure and consequent reduction of co2 flux to carboxylation site bosco et al 2009 and biochemical limitations silva et al 2012 exogenous no supply by snp under low concentrations promoted improvement in a probably because snp is the only no donor that stimulates electron transport through photosystem ii proch√°zkov√° et al 2013 and increases the activity of ribulose 1 5 bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase rubisco fatma and khan 2014 stomatal conductance is closely associated with the osmotic status of plant cells and exogenous no also affects its regulation inducing stomatal opening hasanuzzaman et al 2018 plants treated with the lowest concentrations of snp maintained the transpiration at low levels and consequently promoted an improvement in wue fig 2 gupta et al 2017 also reported water use efficiency increases in plants supplemented with snp however the higher observed values for stomatal conductance and transpiration induced by nitric oxide are correlated to lower wue the exogenous no supply also promoted higher ci concentrations in plants under water deficit though ci increase was not associated with an increase in photosynthesis at higher snp concentrations p angulata plants under water deficit showed an increase in total chlorophyll content unlike other studies that report the degradation of chlorophyll in water deficit conditions deveci and celik 2016 and salinity rezende et al 2018 in p peruviana plants the increase in photosynthetic pigments concentration shows that the species presents a tolerant characteristic to water deficit aiming to an increase of photosynthetic assimilation of co2 in order to maintain its development moura et al 2016 which was further enhanced with no exogenous application exogenous nitric oxide promoted the increase of photosynthetic pigments in different species under abiotic stress as tomato manai et al 2014 rice habib et al 2013 and chickpea ahmad et al 2016 a maintenance of suboptimal soil water content influences plants water relations pu√©rtolas et al 2017 which was evidenced with p angulata through the reduction in relative water content rwc and water potential œàw foliar when cultivated under water deficit reductions in relative water content were observed in plants of the genus physalis souza and amorim 2009 segura monroy et al 2015 as well as reductions in water potential for other species under conditions of low soil water availability
