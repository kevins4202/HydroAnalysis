11390,conventional free subsurface drainage practices in the moghan plan in northwest iran result in low irrigation efficiency and excessive volumes of drainage water causing extensive environmental problems controlled drainage cd is promoted to boost crop yields and reduce subsurface drainage flows and leaching of nutrients this study was conducted to test management options for cd in irrigated farmers fields in the moghan plain three options were tested subsurface drains at 2 m with free outflow fd controlled drainage at 70 cm below soil surface cd70 and controlled drainage with a varying depth depending on the crop stage cdch irrigation gifts were based on the daily measured soil water content and thus varied per drainage treatment in winter wheat and barley were grown followed by maize in summer for each crop and treatment three replicates were made the highest crop yields for all crops were found with cdch followed by cd70 for wheat the yields were respectively 27 and 41 higher in the cd70 and cdch compared to fd for barley these increase was respectively 23 cd70 and 34 cdch and for maize forage yields 19 cd70 and 25 cdch the same trends were observed in water use efficiencies wue compared to fd the wue was 26 in cd70 and 40 higher in cdch for barley these increases were respectively 19 cd70 and 32 cdch and for maize forage yields 30 cd70 and 44 cdch controlled drainage not only reduced subsurface drainage rates but also nitrate and phosphorous losses the average drain discharges with cdch were respectively 33 45 and 44 lower than fd for wheat barley and maize flow weighted no3 concentration in drainage discharge of cd70 and cdch were respectively 15 and 9 for wheat 9 and 13 for barley and 8 and 7 for maize lower than in fd soil salinity decreased in fd but slightly increased in the cd treatments thus although controlled drainage clearly has advantages above free drainage practices to optimize cd management options more research is needed on the long term effects of controlled drainage on soil salinity keywords controlled drainage leaching nutrients soil salinity crop yield 1 introduction the increasing global population is expected to reach 9 6 billion by 2050 un department of economic and social affairs population division 2015 providing environmentally safe food for this growing population is one of the biggest challenges we face now and in the future baker et al 2012 hanson 2013 to be able to meet this challenge and to banish hunger from the world food and feed production will need to be doubled in the coming 25 50 years molden 2007 yet there are limits to the amount of land available for agriculture therefore maintaining and increasing the productivity of existing agricultural areas is of paramount importance at present as much as 35 40 of the gross agricultural output comes from the just 22 about 299 mha of the arable and permanent cropped area worldwide that is irrigated international commission on irrigation and drainage icid 2017 irrigation often allows very significant increases in agricultural productivity however less than 25 of these irrigated lands are drained schultz et al 2007 consequently salinity and waterlogging problems now affect about 10 16 of the irrigated arable and permanent cropped areas worldwide salinity and waterlogging problems hinder and limit the productivity as there is not much scope for increasing the total irrigated area the majority of the increase in output from irrigated agriculture will have to come from investments in improved irrigation and drainage practices in existing agricultural areas schultz et al 2005 drainage of agricultural lands is an instrument for production growth a safeguard for sustainable investment in irrigation and a tool for conservation of land resources ritzema et al 2006 in arid and semi arid regions its primary function is to prevent irrigation induced waterlogging and salinization of the soil ritzema 2016 in regions with prevailing dry and high evaporative conditions increased salt concentrations and river depletion have become two inevitable collaterals of irrigated crop production the role of subsurface drainage in these regions has changed from a single purpose measure for controlling waterlogging and or salinity to an essential element of integrated water management under multiple land use scenarios that can better control water levels schultz et al 2007 vlotman et al 2007 conventional free outflow drainage systems are usually designed for the wettest period of the year however as drainage rates are not constant over the year the free outflow conditions may lead to excessive water and nutrient losses ballantine and tanner 2013 there are a number of approaches to manage these problems including the use of cover crops to immobilize and recycle soluble nutrients hoorman 2009 jones and jacobsen 2009 the use vegetated drainage ditches wetlands or the use of installation of reactive barriers to increase capture and transformation of soluble nutrients strock et al 2010 however the most promising practice is controlled drainage an approach that controls drainage outflow controlled drainage cd is a system for physically restricting discharge with adjustable gates installed at the outlet of the drain with in line control structures gilliam et al 1979 evans et al 1995 skaggs et al 2010 frey et al 2016 also known as drainage water management dwm it is a best management practice used to reduce drainage water volumes and nutrient loads to receiving streams gunn et al 2015 cd is a strategy to control water levels in the growing season and has been shown to increase crop production and drainage water quality fisher et al 1999 noory and liaghat 2009 environmental and agronomic benefits associated with controlled drainage such as yield increase and reduced drainage pollution to the environment are well documented woli et al 2010 skaggs et al 2012 sunoara et al 2014 jaynes and isenhart 2014 nash et al 2015 in iran excessive volumes of drainage water cause extensive environmental problems for example in the moghan plan in northwest iran low irrigation efficiency in combination with conventional free flowing subsurface drainage systems with drains at a depth of about 2 m has resulted in excessive drainage water volumes the deep drains also drain water from the deeper soil layers the drainage water is not only excessive in volume but also of low quality due to leaching of nutrients the huge amount of low quality drainage flows creates many problems for downstream farmers and negatively affects the quality of the water in the aras river while cd in the moghan plain and in other parts of iran has been studied as a method to reduce drainage volumes most research has been at the lysimetric scale field scale is research is hardly done therefore the objective of this study was to assess the performance of two types of controlled drainage at field scale on drainage flows nutrient leaching water and salt balances irrigation and water use efficiency and crop yields and to compare their performance to conventional drainage practices strock et al 2011 reported an average subsurface drainage volume reduction of 40 from a review of 15 peer reviewed studies sands et al 2008 measured an annual reduction in drainage outflow of 20 over a six year study in south central minnesota gunn et al 2015a quantified the effect of managed subsurface drainage on daily subsurface drainage volumes on a private field in north west ohio their results showed that controlled drainage water management effectively reduced daily subsurface drainage volumes by 40 to 100 depending on the location darzi naftchali and ritzema 2018 looked at the effect of three strategies for managing subsurface drainage systems i e free drainage fd midseason drainage msd and alternate wetting and drying awd and concluded that msd and awd resulted in significantly lower drainage rates salt loads and n losses compared to fd with msd having the lowest rates the effect of cd on water quality has also been studied sunohara et al 2016 looked at water quality benefits of controlled drainage in eastern ontario canada they used data from nine growing seasons of maize soybean and forage where controlled drainage and conventional drainage were practiced water quality parameters included nitrate ammonium and total phosphorus and dissolved reactive phosphorus they measure respectively 60 51 58 and 66 reductions in above drainage water fluxes and improvement water quality targets as a result of controlled drainage several other studies also reported reductions in flow rates and nitrogen n loads ranging from 18 to 80 evans et al 1989 drury et al 2009 adeuya et al 2012 cooke and verma 2012 helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 gunn et al 2015 however next to the ability of controlled drainage to reduce surface water nitrate loads controlled drainage can also have some potentially deleterious effects the higher water table has been found to increase the mobilization of phosphorus from within the soil profile valero et al 2007 and an increase in nutrient laden surface runoff has also been reported skaggs et al 2010 tan and zhang 2011 ball coelho et al 2012 other studies however show a reduction of phosphorus by controlled drainage wesstrom and messing 2007 riley et al 2009 show that differences in crop yield between conventional drainage and drainage water management can be inconsistent some studies report an increase in maize yield with 10 20 fisher et al 1999 and hunt et al 1993 while others e g ng et al 2002 observed an increase of 64 this variation in controlled drainage performance and degree of impact is influenced by factors such as climate conditions soil drainage design control structure management and field management practices skaggs et al 2010 2012 christianson and harmel 2015a 2015b negm et al 2017 as already noted current conventional drainage practices in the moghan plain of iran result in excessive volumes of low quality drainage water leading to downstream problems these problems threaten food production and water quality in this important agricultural region while controlled drainage is recognized as a potential strategy for better management of drainage volumes most studies on controlled drainage have been done in humid regions where drainage is needed to remove excess rainfall strock et al 2011 very little research however has been done for controlled drainage in irrigated areas where drainage is mainly needed to control salinity there is an urgent need to improve drainage management to reverse the negative trends in salinity build up in irrigated lands ritzema 2016 the objective of this study was to assess the performance of two types of controlled drainage at field level on drainage flows nutrient leaching water and salt balances irrigation and water use efficiency and crop yields and to compare their performance to conventional free flowing drainage practices 2 material and methods 2 1 study area experimental design and site descriptions the research was conducted in two fields about 32 ha located in the moghan plain ardabil province north iran 47 46 44 n 39 36 14 e in the moghan plain a relatively flat area with alluvium soils deposited by the aras river an irrigation and drainage network of about 90 000 ha was constructed in the 1970s the elevation of this area varies between 50 to 600 m msl the climate is semi arid and temperate with a long term 1985 2015 average annual precipitation of 275 mm with a maximum and minimum of respectively 386 mm and 111 mm average air temperature is 15 2 c with a maximum of 41 c in july and a minimum of 16 5 c in january and an average humidity of about 71 the fields have a heavy textured low permeability soil and need subsurface drainage for economically viable crop production they are relatively flat with an average slope of 0 5 which make these sites suitable for controlled drainage the physical and chemical properties of the soil profile from the surface to the depth of the drainpipes are presented in tables 1 the existing subsurface drainage system consist of parallel lateral subsurface drains perforated corrugated plastic pipe of 200 mm diameter installed perpendicular to a collector drain at an average depth of about 2 m spacing of 75 80 m length of 165 m and average slope of 0 2 the collector drain perforated cement pipe of 500 mm diameter discharges in to an open surface drain the research covered two growing seasons with wheat and barley in winter followed by maize in summer the research was conducted in nine plots wheat and barley at the same time and after that maize three plots for each crop included fd cd70 and cdch with three replicates for each treatment each plot approximately 5 3 ha had five lateral drains two at the sides as barriers between the plots and three in the plot itself fig 1 each plot was farmed as a single field and had identical farm management practices in terms of cropping tillage and fertilization before as well as during the study cultivation and management practices were the same for all plots and similar to the usual practices in the surrounding areas including crop types planting and harvesting dates soil type fertilizer and irrigation scheduling table 2 three drainage water management practices were studied 1 conventional or free drainage with free outflow conditions at drain level 1 8 2 m below ground level fd 2 controlled drainage with the water table controlled at 70 cm below ground level during the growing season cd70 3 changeable controlled drainage with varying water tables during the growing season cdch in the cdch treatment the water table at the beginning of the season was controlled at 40 cm below ground level then lowered to 70 cm following the increase in the root length of the crops and lowered again to 90 cm at the end of growing season the root depth was measured every three days at 10 locations and the average was used to select the control depth in the water level control structure based on the different rates of root growth the changes of the control depth varied per crop fig 2 water table management was done using an in line water level control structure that was specially built for this research fig 1 this metal structure 35 35 165 cm was built using steel sheets and equipped with an adjustable stop log system that enabled drainage when water levels in the field exceeded the height of the stop logs when the water level dropped below the stop logs no flow occurred in other words the outlet elevation of the managed plots was raised or lowered by inserting or removing stop logs in the control structure at recommended times during the year for cd70 treatments we have used one stop log with constant elevation and for cdch we have used three stop logs with different elevation irrigation gifts were based on the daily measured soil water content and thus varied per drainage treatment 2 2 data collection weather parameters such as precipitation and evaporation were obtained from pars abad weather station located less than 0 6 km from the site available water was allowed to deplete to a management allowed depletion mad of 50 before the next irrigation a washington state college wsc type iii flume was used to measure irrigation volumes at the top end of the furrows and the equation q 0 00372 h2 63 was used to calculate each irrigation gift in each plot 15 observation wells were installed to observe the fluctuation of water table fig 1 a total of 135 wells were installed for the three replicates of the three crops the wells were pvc pipes 5 cm in diameter and 2 m in length perforated at the bottom and covered with an envelope to allow easy movement of water into the pipes and avoid clogging by clay and fine particles the pipes were placed in the prepared auger holes to a depth of 180 cm and the residual 20 cm length of the pipe was left above the soil surface the water table fluctuation in the observation wells was measured daily using a sounder device cavelaars 1974 drain discharge rates were measured using a calibrated container and stopwatch two times every day that drain flow occurred water flowing from the drain lines was collected for a short time interval measured and converted to mm day 1 the average daily discharge rates were used in this study the nutrient concentration of the drain discharge was monitored simultaneously from the outlets for paired cd and fd fields water samples were taken by grab sampling the outflow on a weekly basis when there was drainage flow no3 n and phosphorous concentrations were measured at tehran university following the standard guidelines for conducting this type of experiment of the american public health association apha 1995 a sp 7900 spectrophotometer was used for measuring nitrate and phosphorous tp with concentrated sulphuric acid and h2o2 digestion ph and ec were measured with appropriate meters a linear interpolation was done between the weekly no3 n concentration sample data to estimate daily concentrations the resulting daily concentrations were multiplied by the daily flow volumes to estimate total no3 n and phosphorous losses from each drained plot soil volumetric water content between irrigations was measured manually daily and soil salinity ece was measured at different depths 0 15 0 45 0 75 1 05 and 1 5 at the beginning middle and end of the growing seasons with in situ salinity sensors delta t devices ltd uk yield data was collected at five spots 2 2 m2 randomly selected in each plot 3 plots for each crop all stalks were harvested manually and after measuring the wet weight on a digital scale placed in an oven for 48 h at 70 c after which the dry weight was measured for measuring the wheat and barley grains the plants were thrashed manually and the grain weight was measured on a digital scale 2 3 data analysis to assess the effect of controlled drainage vs free outflow drainage water productivity wp water use efficiency wue irrigation efficiency ie and the leaching fraction lf were used water productivity wp can be presented in various ways in this research it is defined as the ratio between crop produced y in kg and the amount of water involved in crop production actual evapotranspiration eta in m3 per ali and talukder 2008 1 w p y e t a there are many methodological difficulties in accurately calculating actual evapotranspiration eta through the water balance bluemling et al 2007 perry 2007 halsema and vincent 2012 we have calculated eta from the water balance as follows 2 e t a i p r d δ s where etaactual evapotranspiration mm iirrigation mm pprecipitation mm rpercolation mm ddrainage mm δschange in soil moisture content mm the water balance is often simplified by assuming that the percolation r and drainage d are negligible evapotranspiration is then equal to the sum of irrigation and rainfall minus the change in seasonal soil moisture storage oktem et al 2003 kamilov et al 2002 in reality however percolation r and drainage d are often not negligible but not including in the analysis because they are difficult to measure in a review of 24 recent publications on wue studies in wheat maize and rice only 7 publications provided enough data to reconstruct the water balance and of these only 2 resulted in a water balance in which the actual evapotranspiration could be correctly accounted for halsema and vincent 2012 in this study we measured irrigation drainage the change in soil moisture and precipitation data from nearest meteorological station for calculating the actual evapotranspiration we also needed to know the percolation r which was obtained from the salt balance equation van hoorn and van alphen 2006 3 i ci r cg d cg δz where c is the salt concentration ds m i and g suffices denoting respectively irrigation and ground water and δz is change in salt concentration in the soil the measurable parameters of eq 3 i e i ci d cg and δz were used to calculate percolation r by combining eqs 2 and 3 we calculated the actual evapotranspiration for each treatment and each crop and finally using eq 1 we could calculate wp as with wp water use efficiency wue can be presented in a number of different ways in this analysis we again use the definition of ali and talukder 2008 where wue in kg m 3 is the ratio between crop produced y in kg and the total volume of irrigation water delivered to the plot v in m3 4 w u e y v the denominator water applied is usually taken as irrigation water plus rainfall water applied in this sense represents the gross amount of water availability at field level of which an undetermined fraction is the actual crop evapotranspiration the irrigation water efficiency ie is defined as the ratio between the volume of irrigation water stored in the root zone and available for crop use vb in m3 and the total volume of irrigation water delivered to the plot vt in m3 burt et al 1997 5 i e v b v t where vb is the water beneficially used and vt the total water applied this is the traditional concept of efficiency in irrigation engineering israelson 1950 jensen 2007 it focuses on the amount of water released from a source to ensure beneficial uses are achieved both in terms of water consumption by crops and more recently allowances for agronomic needs to check if there was an increase in soil salinity over the growing seasons for the different crops the leaching fraction was used the leaching fraction lf is defined as the ratio between the net percolation and irrigation van hoorn and van alphen 2006 6 l f r d i e c i 2 e c e where eci is the irrigation water salinity in ds m and ece is the soil salinity in ds m this equation can be used to estimate the long term salinity level in the root zone assuming there is only one layer with complete mixing no saline seepage and no precipitation of salts 2 4 statistical analysis the normality of data distribution was examined first with log transformations conducted when necessary to obtain homogeneous variance statistical analyses were conducted using statistical analysis system software sas statistical analyses were performed at the significance level of p 0 05 in this study some of the data was randomized and some was not randomized complete blocks with three replicates per treatment could be used to determine the statistical significance of treatment effects on crop yield water productivity water use efficiency and irrigation efficiency because of the randomized arrangement of this data the mean comparison test method t test was used for performing statistical analysis for drainage outflow water table no3 n concentration and losses and p concentration and losses as this data was non randomized the mean of the observed data in the managed zone over the treatment periods was calculated as m using eq 7 where mi is the observed data from the managed zone over the treatment periods and n is the number of observations 7 m i n m i n the percent data change δc was calculated using eq 8 where ccd represents observed data from controlled drainage treatments and cfd represents observed data from free drainage clausen and spooner 1993 8 δ c c c d c f d c c d 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 drain discharges nitrate and phosphorous losses 3 1 1 drain discharges drain discharges in all controlled drainage treatments were significantly lower than under the free drainage conditions the average drain discharge under the fd treatment was 2 1 mm d for wheat 2 6 mm d for barley and 5 1 mm d for maize the average drain discharges with cdch were respectively 33 45 and 44 lower for wheat barley and maize respectively and 45 55 and 51 lower with cd70 the cd70 drainage rates were also significantly lower that the cdch rates by 17 wheat 18 barley and 13 maize which is surprising because both the average control levels in cdch treatments and average water table were almost the same the maximum drainage rates occurred in the fd treatment respectively 8 1 6 2 and 13 2 mm d for wheat barley and maize fig 3 the lowest discharges occurred at the beginning of the growing season in the cdch treatments when the control level in the drains was 40 cm fig 3 after the control level was lowered to 70 cm the drain discharge increased and was nearly the same as in the cd70 treatments at the end period of the growing season when the control level was lowered to 90 cm drainage discharges again increased but were still lower than those with fd drainage our results confirm that controlled drainage results in a major decrease in drainage rates as has already been reported in many studies fausey 2005 in a field experiment with maize and soybean on silty clay soils reported a 40 decrease in drainage discharges from the controlled drainage treatments compared to conventional drainage amenumey et al 2009 indicate that controlled drainage reduces subsurface drainage volumes by an average of 47 compared to conventional subsurface drainage the authors also found that an even bigger reduction in subsurface drainage rates is likely to occur in loamy sand soils up to 75 compared to 37 in clay loam soils they emphasize that soil type is a more important parameter than crops and climate skaggs et al 2010 and 2012 showed decrease in drainage water between 17 to 80 by controlled drainage sunohara et al 2015 looked at basin scale effects of controlled drainage and reported a decrease in drainage water other similar results have been reported from field studies in sweden wesstrom and messing 2007 ontario canada drury et al 2009 iowa helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 and the netherlands ritzema and stuyt 2015 rozemeijer et al 2016 our results clearly show that the use of controlled drainage in the moghan plain can be a key strategy to address the issue of excessive drainage water in this region 3 1 2 nitrate losses flow weighted no3 concentration mg l in drainage discharge from fd cd70 and cdch treatments were respectively 9 3 8 2 and 8 5 for wheat 10 6 9 7 and 9 4 for barley and 12 2 11 2 and 11 4 for maize table 3 the results indicate that the average concentration for free drainage is somewhat higher than controlled drainage treatments for all crops the difference between fd and cd treatments were significant at 1 percent level except fd and cd70 in wheat which was significant at the 5 percent level these results are in contrast to those of sands et al 2008 who found no difference in flow weighted no3 concentrations between shallow and conventional drainage the results are consistent however with many other studies such as mejia et al 2000 lalonde et al 1996 ng et al 2002 gunn et al 2015 and sunohara et al 2016 under controlled conditions anaerobic conditions occurred resulting in denitrification on the other hand when the soil organic carbon is high denitrification intensifies and reduces the transfer of nitrate another reason for the reduction in the concentration of nitrate in the controlled drainage treatments is the delay time of nitrate in the soil which increases the absorption by the root of the plants bohlen and villapando 2011 smith and kellman 2011 some researchers have described a reduction in the concentration of nitrate due to the potential for n2o to have a harmful effect on the environment as a dangerous process dalzell et al 2007 in this study the amount of n2o produced was estimated to be only 2 of the denitrification and the results showed that the soil water level had no effect on the percentage of n2o present in the atmosphere kliewer and gilliam 1995 average nitrate losses with the fd cd70 and cdch treatments were 0 24 0 15 and 0 18 kg ha for wheat 0 33 0 17 and 0 19 kg ha for barley and 0 63 0 31 and 0 34 kg ha for maize the largest nitrate losses occurred in the months that had the biggest drainage discharges for all crops and all treatments fig 4 compared to the fd treatment nitrate losses in cd70 and cdch were 37 and 25 lower respectively for wheat 48 and 42 lower for barley and 51 and 46 lower for maize these percentages are in line with the changes in drain discharges which is logical as the concentration in the different treatments were more or less the same thus there is a direct relationship between drain discharges and n losses fig 4 the reductions in no3 load with controlled drainage in this study are consistent with previous drainage water management research where the reduction in no3 load is attributed to a reduction in subsurface drainage volume rather than a reduction in no3 concentrations strock et al 2011 many other studies have reported similar results to the findings of this study including lalonde et al 1996 wesstrom and messing 2007 bonati and borin 2010 adeuya et al 2012 ale et al 2012 fang et al 2012 we conclude that these significant reductions in no3 loss were mainly caused by reductions in drainage flows as the effectiveness of controlled drainage in decreasing n losses in drainage water was nearly the same on a percentage basis as its effect in decreasing drain flows increased utilization of controlled drainage can therefore contribute to reducing the problem of low quality drainage water from the mogan plain 3 1 3 phosphorous losses concentration of phosphorous p in drainage discharge from cd treatments were slightly higher than in drainage from fd concentrations from fd cd70 and cdch plots were respectively 0 39 0 43 and 0 42 mg l for wheat 0 59 0 67 and 0 63 mg l for barley and 1 04 1 10 and 1 08 mg l for maize table 6 there was no significant difference in p concentration in all treatments for all crops except between the fd and cd70 treatments in barley table 4 although p concentrations in drainage discharge were slightly higher average p losses were lower with controlled drainage than with fd being respectively 9 14 5 69 and 6 21 g ha for wheat 13 1 8 4 and 9 6 g ha for barley and 46 8 28 5 and 30 1 g ha for maize in the controlled drainage treatments p losses decreased compared to fd by 38 in cd70 and 32 in cdch for wheat 36 and 27 respectively for barley and 39 and 36 respectively for maize in all cases these reductions were significant there is a direct relation between the amount of discharge drainage and the amount of p losses fig 5 unlike surface transfer of p control activities and waste of p are not well documented for subsurface drainage and controlling subsurface drainage losses of p remains a significant challenge the small increase in the amount of p in the controlled drainage treatments in this study may be due to the reduction of fe 2 and fe 3 under conditions of oxygen deficiency anaerobic conditions due to increased longevity of time which leads to increased soluble p and transfer of p surface waters through drainage the role of drainage in p transport has been discussed widely sims et al 1998 some regard it as unimportant skaggs et al 1994 whereas others have measured significant p losses via tile drainage and have identified drainage as a dominant p loss pathway to surface waters dils and heathwaite 1999 gelbrecht et al 2005 valero et al 2007 guo et al 2011 and kroger et al 2011 have also reported increasing concentrations of phosphorus controlled drainage system controlled drainage systems can help to reduce p losses p removal is predominantly a biogeochemical process reduction in p losses from subsurface controlled drainage systems will be mainly due to reduction in the loads of sediment as particles are retained in the soil profile due to the anoxic conditions p fractionation may change in the drainage system with p release from sediments resulting in a higher proportion of dissolved p in drainage outflow tan and zhang 2011 in a 5 year study observed that controlled drainage resulted in increased concentrations of p in surface runoff due to the increased soil moisture content which enhanced p release through desorption however due to reduced drainage flows the controlled drainage system still provided overall reductions in losses of p in drainage compared with the free draining system the effects of controlled drainage on p losses from soil also were examined in a 4 year field study in southern sweden by wesstrom and messing 2007 they found that the relative reduction in p loads in drain outflows were similar to the reduction in drainage outflow rates suggesting that controlled drainage reduced p losses on the other hand excessive use of phosphorus fertilizers will lead to an increase in the level of soil saturation from p and increase the risk of losses of p from the drainage system heathwaite and dils 2000 smith and kellman 2011 none the less controlled drainage shows promise for reducing p losses through the mechanism of reducing drainage discharges 3 2 overall water and salt balance percolation and actual evapotranspiration using the collected data on precipitation irrigation drainage changes in water content water table water and soil salinity the water and salt balances were calculated for the three crops and the three drainage treatments these balances were then used to calculate percolation and evapotranspiration under the assumption that the amount of salt lost through crop uptake and evaporation was negligible table 5 total irrigation gifts over the winter growing season for the three treatments were similar for wheat and barley in summer for corn irrigation gifts significantly increased for the fd treatment as did the drainage rate as well a clear indication of over irrigation the increasing trend in percolation for less control in drainage is in agreement with the average water table during the growing season which for all three crops was deeper for decreasing control table 6 this is in agreement with mejia et al 2000 who also reported higher water tables with controlled drainage than in conventionally drained plots over a two year field experiment in eastern ontario percolation was much higher in summer indicating that there was over irrigation in winter there was no percolation in the fd treatment but capillary rise indicating that the leaching was not enough to avoid salt build up in the root zone for all three crops actual evapotranspiration eta increased with increasing control in drainage table 7 which is in agreement with the decreasing trend in percolation there is not much difference in the total eta in mm between summer and winter mainly due to the differences in the length of the growing seasons 109 days for maize compared to 215 days for wheat and 180 days for barley for all three crops the daily values of the eta in the controlled drainage treatments cd70 cdch are comparable to the crop evapotranspiration etc calculated according to the fao guidelines allen et al 1998 in the free drainage treatment the eta was lower than the etc about 16 for the winter crops wheat and barley and 9 for the summer crop maize this indicates that there is water stress for the crops in the free drainage treatment but not in the controlled drainage treatments increased evapotranspiration by controlled drainage has also been reported by borin et al 2001 skaggs et al 2012 el ghannam et al 2016 and sunohara et al 2016 3 3 crop yield water use efficiency water productivity and irrigation efficiency 3 3 1 crop yield for all three crops yield was significantly higher in the controlled drainage treatments compared to the free drainage treatment table 7 for wheat the yields were respectively 27 and 41 higher in the cd70 and cdch treatments compared to the fd treatment for barley these increase were respectively 23 cd70 and 34 cdch and for maize forage yields 19 cd70 and 25 cdch yields in cdch treatment were also significantly higher than the cd70 12 for wheat 9 for barley and 5 for maize it is clear that a higher ground water table has a pronounced effect on an increase in eta and subsequently in the crop yield similar positive effects of controlled drainage have been reported for crop yields in maize and soybean in the us and canada for example ng et al 2002 observed an increase of 64 in maize yield for a controlled drained system compared with a free draining system borin et al 2001 observed higher plant biomass in crops under controlled rather than conventional drainage mejia et al 2000 reported higher crop yield maize and soybean with controlled drainage over a two year field experiment in eastern ontario additional examples of similar results can be found in noory and liaghat 2009 drury et al 2009 skaggs et al 2012 nash et al 2015 and sunohara et al 2016 among others these many other studies show that our results are not anomalies and that use of controlled drainage in the moghan plain can contribute to increased productivity in this important agricultural region 3 3 2 water use efficiency for all three crops the water use efficiency wue significantly increased with increasing drainage control table 7 for wheat the wue was 26 and 40 higher in respectively the cd70 and cdch treatments compared to the fd treatment for barley these increases were respectively 19 cd70 and 32 cdch and for maize forage yields 30 cd70 and 44 cdch wues in the cdch treatments were also significantly higher than the cd70 12 for wheat 11 for barley and 11 for maize the average wue for all treatments in winter 0 66 and 0 61 kg m3 for wheat and barley respectively was significantly lower than the average wue in summer 1 47 kg m3 for maize even with the increases from cd the values in winter are well below the range recommended by fao for a good commercial yield 0 8 1 6 kg m3 http www fao org land water databases and software crop information en this explains the relatively low crop yield for wheat especially under fd as the fao indicates that under irrigation a good commercial grain yield should be 6 to 9 ton ha for the recommended wue it is interesting to note that although the wue remains below the fao recommendations wheat yields with cd are in the fao s expected range in summer cd moved the wue for maize into the top of the range recommended by fao unfortunately the yield cannot be compared as the fao only gives a range for the grain yield and not for forage yield 3 3 3 water productivity the water productivity wp showed a similar trend to that seen with wue an increase with more control in drainage in winter the increase was again significant for wheat the wps were 17 and 24 higher in the cd70 and cdch treatments compared to the fd treatment and for barley these increases were respectively 9 cd70 and 14 cdch although the cdch treatments had slightly higher wp values compared to cd70 the differences were not significant for the summer crop maize the increases were not significant at all similar as the wue the wp in summer 3 1 kg m3 was significantly higher than in winter 1 24 and 1 00 kg m3 for respectively wheat and barley 3 3 4 irrigation efficiency the irrigation efficiency ie showed a similar trend as the wue and wp again an increase for more control in drainage in winter the increase was significant for both wheat and barley the ie were 8 and 13 higher in respectively the cd70 and cdch treatments compared to the fd treatment but the differences between the two control treatments cdch and cd70 were not significant for the summer crop maize the increases in ie was significant between all three treatments cdch had a 9 higher ie compared to cd70 and 28 compared to fd and cd had a 22 higher ie than fd the ie for maize in summer was the lowest 47 higher efficiencies were found in winter for wheat 53 and barley 63 the irrigation efficiency for the controlled drainage treatments which vary between 49 for maize to 65 for barley are in line with many studies that report similar positive effects of controlled drainage on irrigation efficiency mejia et al 2000 skaggs and youssef 2008 bonati and borin 2010 liu et al 2011 ramoska et al 2011 the improvement of ie is one of the most important benefits of the implementation of controlled drainage in moghan plain because it can contribute to huge water savings in this region 3 4 soil salinity and leaching 3 4 1 soil salinity in the fd treatments soil salinity decreased during the growing season for all three crops fig 6 in the cd treatments soil salinity was always higher at the end of the growing season than at the beginning although during the season there was some reduction observed over the course of the growing seasons soil salinity changed in depth with results indicating that higher increases were observed in the upper soil layers especially in the 30 60 cm and 60 90 cm layers 3 4 2 leaching soil salinity is an important aspect of sustainable agricultural practices so it is important to see the effect of cd on that to estimate of the long term salinity levels in the root zone the leaching fractions for the different treatments were calculated using these leaching fractions and assuming a one layered soil profile with complete mixing no saline seepage and no precipitation of salts the long term soil salinity levels were calculated the soil salinity levels vary between 1 0 1 4 ds m for maize 1 2 1 3 ds m for wheat to 1 6 1 8 ds m for barley all slightly higher than the initial values table 2 while the increase in soil salinity is a drawback associated with controlled drainage mitigation of its effects is in principle possible by implementing periods of leaching between periods of controlled drainage e g using free drainage to allow leaching after rainfall or during the first irrigation of the season hornbuckle et al 2005 this is an aspect of controlled drainage that needs further study considering the amount of water that can be saved through wider implementation of controlled drainage we are confident that even with periodic leaching needed to manage salinity there would be a net savings in water along with the other benefits from controlled drainage reported in this paper 4 conclusions conventional uncontrolled drainage can result in multiple problems for example in the mogan plain in northern iran it resulted in excessive volumes of low quality drainage water suboptimal yields and low water efficiencies in this study two controlled drainage treatments one with a constant level of 70 cm over the growing season cd70 and one with a changeable level cdch over the season were compared with conventional free drainage fd in two different growing seasons winter for two crops wheat and barley and summer for one crop maize the controlled drainage treatments significantly reduced both drainage rates and no3 and p losses major concerns in the mogan plain region the average drain discharges with cdch treatment were respectively 33 45 and 44 lower than fd treatment for wheat barley and maize respectively flow weighted no3 concentration in drainage discharge cd70 and cdch treatments were respectively 15 and 9 for wheat 9 and 13 for barley and 8 and 7 for maize lower than fd treatment there were some differences in effect between the cd70 and cdch systems indicating that the changeable drainage management is not yet optimized this is an area for further study in addition to reducing drainage rates and nutrient losses both cd70 and cdch resulted in significantly higher crop yields compared to the free drainage treatment respectively 27 41 for wheat 18 25 for barley and 19 25 for maize of which the cdch treatments had the highest yields the same trends were observed in the water use efficiency and water productivity irrigation efficiency was also higher in the controlled drainage plots for the winter crops wheat and barley between 8 and 13 and for the summer crop maize between 22 and 28 these results strongly suggest that controlled drainage can contribute to greater agricultural productivity and water savings in this area and perhaps other areas with similar conditions irrigation gifts in winter were more or less similar for all three treatments both for wheat and barley showing that the increase in irrigation efficiency can be attributed to the higher actual crop evapotranspiration and resulting crop yield in the controlled drainage plots in summer the total irrigation gifts to the free drainage plots was significantly higher than to the controlled plots although the actual crop evapotranspiration was lower in combination with the significantly higher drainage discharges this clearly indicated over irrigation under free drainage conditions something that can perhaps be adjusted even before controlled irrigation is more widely implemented this study indicates that controlled drainage can lead to some increase in soil salinity as compared to free drainage especially if the controlled level is fixed as in cd70 in the cdch treatments the control level was lowered to 90 cm at the end of growing season resulting in more leaching and less increase in soil salinity the study also shows that controlled drainage is very effective method to increase productivity in agricultural areas such as for the moghan plain or other areas with similar conditions that better management of drainage is a key opportunity for this justifies the need for more research to optimize the management options for controlled drainage to avoid problems with soil salinity 
11390,conventional free subsurface drainage practices in the moghan plan in northwest iran result in low irrigation efficiency and excessive volumes of drainage water causing extensive environmental problems controlled drainage cd is promoted to boost crop yields and reduce subsurface drainage flows and leaching of nutrients this study was conducted to test management options for cd in irrigated farmers fields in the moghan plain three options were tested subsurface drains at 2 m with free outflow fd controlled drainage at 70 cm below soil surface cd70 and controlled drainage with a varying depth depending on the crop stage cdch irrigation gifts were based on the daily measured soil water content and thus varied per drainage treatment in winter wheat and barley were grown followed by maize in summer for each crop and treatment three replicates were made the highest crop yields for all crops were found with cdch followed by cd70 for wheat the yields were respectively 27 and 41 higher in the cd70 and cdch compared to fd for barley these increase was respectively 23 cd70 and 34 cdch and for maize forage yields 19 cd70 and 25 cdch the same trends were observed in water use efficiencies wue compared to fd the wue was 26 in cd70 and 40 higher in cdch for barley these increases were respectively 19 cd70 and 32 cdch and for maize forage yields 30 cd70 and 44 cdch controlled drainage not only reduced subsurface drainage rates but also nitrate and phosphorous losses the average drain discharges with cdch were respectively 33 45 and 44 lower than fd for wheat barley and maize flow weighted no3 concentration in drainage discharge of cd70 and cdch were respectively 15 and 9 for wheat 9 and 13 for barley and 8 and 7 for maize lower than in fd soil salinity decreased in fd but slightly increased in the cd treatments thus although controlled drainage clearly has advantages above free drainage practices to optimize cd management options more research is needed on the long term effects of controlled drainage on soil salinity keywords controlled drainage leaching nutrients soil salinity crop yield 1 introduction the increasing global population is expected to reach 9 6 billion by 2050 un department of economic and social affairs population division 2015 providing environmentally safe food for this growing population is one of the biggest challenges we face now and in the future baker et al 2012 hanson 2013 to be able to meet this challenge and to banish hunger from the world food and feed production will need to be doubled in the coming 25 50 years molden 2007 yet there are limits to the amount of land available for agriculture therefore maintaining and increasing the productivity of existing agricultural areas is of paramount importance at present as much as 35 40 of the gross agricultural output comes from the just 22 about 299 mha of the arable and permanent cropped area worldwide that is irrigated international commission on irrigation and drainage icid 2017 irrigation often allows very significant increases in agricultural productivity however less than 25 of these irrigated lands are drained schultz et al 2007 consequently salinity and waterlogging problems now affect about 10 16 of the irrigated arable and permanent cropped areas worldwide salinity and waterlogging problems hinder and limit the productivity as there is not much scope for increasing the total irrigated area the majority of the increase in output from irrigated agriculture will have to come from investments in improved irrigation and drainage practices in existing agricultural areas schultz et al 2005 drainage of agricultural lands is an instrument for production growth a safeguard for sustainable investment in irrigation and a tool for conservation of land resources ritzema et al 2006 in arid and semi arid regions its primary function is to prevent irrigation induced waterlogging and salinization of the soil ritzema 2016 in regions with prevailing dry and high evaporative conditions increased salt concentrations and river depletion have become two inevitable collaterals of irrigated crop production the role of subsurface drainage in these regions has changed from a single purpose measure for controlling waterlogging and or salinity to an essential element of integrated water management under multiple land use scenarios that can better control water levels schultz et al 2007 vlotman et al 2007 conventional free outflow drainage systems are usually designed for the wettest period of the year however as drainage rates are not constant over the year the free outflow conditions may lead to excessive water and nutrient losses ballantine and tanner 2013 there are a number of approaches to manage these problems including the use of cover crops to immobilize and recycle soluble nutrients hoorman 2009 jones and jacobsen 2009 the use vegetated drainage ditches wetlands or the use of installation of reactive barriers to increase capture and transformation of soluble nutrients strock et al 2010 however the most promising practice is controlled drainage an approach that controls drainage outflow controlled drainage cd is a system for physically restricting discharge with adjustable gates installed at the outlet of the drain with in line control structures gilliam et al 1979 evans et al 1995 skaggs et al 2010 frey et al 2016 also known as drainage water management dwm it is a best management practice used to reduce drainage water volumes and nutrient loads to receiving streams gunn et al 2015 cd is a strategy to control water levels in the growing season and has been shown to increase crop production and drainage water quality fisher et al 1999 noory and liaghat 2009 environmental and agronomic benefits associated with controlled drainage such as yield increase and reduced drainage pollution to the environment are well documented woli et al 2010 skaggs et al 2012 sunoara et al 2014 jaynes and isenhart 2014 nash et al 2015 in iran excessive volumes of drainage water cause extensive environmental problems for example in the moghan plan in northwest iran low irrigation efficiency in combination with conventional free flowing subsurface drainage systems with drains at a depth of about 2 m has resulted in excessive drainage water volumes the deep drains also drain water from the deeper soil layers the drainage water is not only excessive in volume but also of low quality due to leaching of nutrients the huge amount of low quality drainage flows creates many problems for downstream farmers and negatively affects the quality of the water in the aras river while cd in the moghan plain and in other parts of iran has been studied as a method to reduce drainage volumes most research has been at the lysimetric scale field scale is research is hardly done therefore the objective of this study was to assess the performance of two types of controlled drainage at field scale on drainage flows nutrient leaching water and salt balances irrigation and water use efficiency and crop yields and to compare their performance to conventional drainage practices strock et al 2011 reported an average subsurface drainage volume reduction of 40 from a review of 15 peer reviewed studies sands et al 2008 measured an annual reduction in drainage outflow of 20 over a six year study in south central minnesota gunn et al 2015a quantified the effect of managed subsurface drainage on daily subsurface drainage volumes on a private field in north west ohio their results showed that controlled drainage water management effectively reduced daily subsurface drainage volumes by 40 to 100 depending on the location darzi naftchali and ritzema 2018 looked at the effect of three strategies for managing subsurface drainage systems i e free drainage fd midseason drainage msd and alternate wetting and drying awd and concluded that msd and awd resulted in significantly lower drainage rates salt loads and n losses compared to fd with msd having the lowest rates the effect of cd on water quality has also been studied sunohara et al 2016 looked at water quality benefits of controlled drainage in eastern ontario canada they used data from nine growing seasons of maize soybean and forage where controlled drainage and conventional drainage were practiced water quality parameters included nitrate ammonium and total phosphorus and dissolved reactive phosphorus they measure respectively 60 51 58 and 66 reductions in above drainage water fluxes and improvement water quality targets as a result of controlled drainage several other studies also reported reductions in flow rates and nitrogen n loads ranging from 18 to 80 evans et al 1989 drury et al 2009 adeuya et al 2012 cooke and verma 2012 helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 gunn et al 2015 however next to the ability of controlled drainage to reduce surface water nitrate loads controlled drainage can also have some potentially deleterious effects the higher water table has been found to increase the mobilization of phosphorus from within the soil profile valero et al 2007 and an increase in nutrient laden surface runoff has also been reported skaggs et al 2010 tan and zhang 2011 ball coelho et al 2012 other studies however show a reduction of phosphorus by controlled drainage wesstrom and messing 2007 riley et al 2009 show that differences in crop yield between conventional drainage and drainage water management can be inconsistent some studies report an increase in maize yield with 10 20 fisher et al 1999 and hunt et al 1993 while others e g ng et al 2002 observed an increase of 64 this variation in controlled drainage performance and degree of impact is influenced by factors such as climate conditions soil drainage design control structure management and field management practices skaggs et al 2010 2012 christianson and harmel 2015a 2015b negm et al 2017 as already noted current conventional drainage practices in the moghan plain of iran result in excessive volumes of low quality drainage water leading to downstream problems these problems threaten food production and water quality in this important agricultural region while controlled drainage is recognized as a potential strategy for better management of drainage volumes most studies on controlled drainage have been done in humid regions where drainage is needed to remove excess rainfall strock et al 2011 very little research however has been done for controlled drainage in irrigated areas where drainage is mainly needed to control salinity there is an urgent need to improve drainage management to reverse the negative trends in salinity build up in irrigated lands ritzema 2016 the objective of this study was to assess the performance of two types of controlled drainage at field level on drainage flows nutrient leaching water and salt balances irrigation and water use efficiency and crop yields and to compare their performance to conventional free flowing drainage practices 2 material and methods 2 1 study area experimental design and site descriptions the research was conducted in two fields about 32 ha located in the moghan plain ardabil province north iran 47 46 44 n 39 36 14 e in the moghan plain a relatively flat area with alluvium soils deposited by the aras river an irrigation and drainage network of about 90 000 ha was constructed in the 1970s the elevation of this area varies between 50 to 600 m msl the climate is semi arid and temperate with a long term 1985 2015 average annual precipitation of 275 mm with a maximum and minimum of respectively 386 mm and 111 mm average air temperature is 15 2 c with a maximum of 41 c in july and a minimum of 16 5 c in january and an average humidity of about 71 the fields have a heavy textured low permeability soil and need subsurface drainage for economically viable crop production they are relatively flat with an average slope of 0 5 which make these sites suitable for controlled drainage the physical and chemical properties of the soil profile from the surface to the depth of the drainpipes are presented in tables 1 the existing subsurface drainage system consist of parallel lateral subsurface drains perforated corrugated plastic pipe of 200 mm diameter installed perpendicular to a collector drain at an average depth of about 2 m spacing of 75 80 m length of 165 m and average slope of 0 2 the collector drain perforated cement pipe of 500 mm diameter discharges in to an open surface drain the research covered two growing seasons with wheat and barley in winter followed by maize in summer the research was conducted in nine plots wheat and barley at the same time and after that maize three plots for each crop included fd cd70 and cdch with three replicates for each treatment each plot approximately 5 3 ha had five lateral drains two at the sides as barriers between the plots and three in the plot itself fig 1 each plot was farmed as a single field and had identical farm management practices in terms of cropping tillage and fertilization before as well as during the study cultivation and management practices were the same for all plots and similar to the usual practices in the surrounding areas including crop types planting and harvesting dates soil type fertilizer and irrigation scheduling table 2 three drainage water management practices were studied 1 conventional or free drainage with free outflow conditions at drain level 1 8 2 m below ground level fd 2 controlled drainage with the water table controlled at 70 cm below ground level during the growing season cd70 3 changeable controlled drainage with varying water tables during the growing season cdch in the cdch treatment the water table at the beginning of the season was controlled at 40 cm below ground level then lowered to 70 cm following the increase in the root length of the crops and lowered again to 90 cm at the end of growing season the root depth was measured every three days at 10 locations and the average was used to select the control depth in the water level control structure based on the different rates of root growth the changes of the control depth varied per crop fig 2 water table management was done using an in line water level control structure that was specially built for this research fig 1 this metal structure 35 35 165 cm was built using steel sheets and equipped with an adjustable stop log system that enabled drainage when water levels in the field exceeded the height of the stop logs when the water level dropped below the stop logs no flow occurred in other words the outlet elevation of the managed plots was raised or lowered by inserting or removing stop logs in the control structure at recommended times during the year for cd70 treatments we have used one stop log with constant elevation and for cdch we have used three stop logs with different elevation irrigation gifts were based on the daily measured soil water content and thus varied per drainage treatment 2 2 data collection weather parameters such as precipitation and evaporation were obtained from pars abad weather station located less than 0 6 km from the site available water was allowed to deplete to a management allowed depletion mad of 50 before the next irrigation a washington state college wsc type iii flume was used to measure irrigation volumes at the top end of the furrows and the equation q 0 00372 h2 63 was used to calculate each irrigation gift in each plot 15 observation wells were installed to observe the fluctuation of water table fig 1 a total of 135 wells were installed for the three replicates of the three crops the wells were pvc pipes 5 cm in diameter and 2 m in length perforated at the bottom and covered with an envelope to allow easy movement of water into the pipes and avoid clogging by clay and fine particles the pipes were placed in the prepared auger holes to a depth of 180 cm and the residual 20 cm length of the pipe was left above the soil surface the water table fluctuation in the observation wells was measured daily using a sounder device cavelaars 1974 drain discharge rates were measured using a calibrated container and stopwatch two times every day that drain flow occurred water flowing from the drain lines was collected for a short time interval measured and converted to mm day 1 the average daily discharge rates were used in this study the nutrient concentration of the drain discharge was monitored simultaneously from the outlets for paired cd and fd fields water samples were taken by grab sampling the outflow on a weekly basis when there was drainage flow no3 n and phosphorous concentrations were measured at tehran university following the standard guidelines for conducting this type of experiment of the american public health association apha 1995 a sp 7900 spectrophotometer was used for measuring nitrate and phosphorous tp with concentrated sulphuric acid and h2o2 digestion ph and ec were measured with appropriate meters a linear interpolation was done between the weekly no3 n concentration sample data to estimate daily concentrations the resulting daily concentrations were multiplied by the daily flow volumes to estimate total no3 n and phosphorous losses from each drained plot soil volumetric water content between irrigations was measured manually daily and soil salinity ece was measured at different depths 0 15 0 45 0 75 1 05 and 1 5 at the beginning middle and end of the growing seasons with in situ salinity sensors delta t devices ltd uk yield data was collected at five spots 2 2 m2 randomly selected in each plot 3 plots for each crop all stalks were harvested manually and after measuring the wet weight on a digital scale placed in an oven for 48 h at 70 c after which the dry weight was measured for measuring the wheat and barley grains the plants were thrashed manually and the grain weight was measured on a digital scale 2 3 data analysis to assess the effect of controlled drainage vs free outflow drainage water productivity wp water use efficiency wue irrigation efficiency ie and the leaching fraction lf were used water productivity wp can be presented in various ways in this research it is defined as the ratio between crop produced y in kg and the amount of water involved in crop production actual evapotranspiration eta in m3 per ali and talukder 2008 1 w p y e t a there are many methodological difficulties in accurately calculating actual evapotranspiration eta through the water balance bluemling et al 2007 perry 2007 halsema and vincent 2012 we have calculated eta from the water balance as follows 2 e t a i p r d δ s where etaactual evapotranspiration mm iirrigation mm pprecipitation mm rpercolation mm ddrainage mm δschange in soil moisture content mm the water balance is often simplified by assuming that the percolation r and drainage d are negligible evapotranspiration is then equal to the sum of irrigation and rainfall minus the change in seasonal soil moisture storage oktem et al 2003 kamilov et al 2002 in reality however percolation r and drainage d are often not negligible but not including in the analysis because they are difficult to measure in a review of 24 recent publications on wue studies in wheat maize and rice only 7 publications provided enough data to reconstruct the water balance and of these only 2 resulted in a water balance in which the actual evapotranspiration could be correctly accounted for halsema and vincent 2012 in this study we measured irrigation drainage the change in soil moisture and precipitation data from nearest meteorological station for calculating the actual evapotranspiration we also needed to know the percolation r which was obtained from the salt balance equation van hoorn and van alphen 2006 3 i ci r cg d cg δz where c is the salt concentration ds m i and g suffices denoting respectively irrigation and ground water and δz is change in salt concentration in the soil the measurable parameters of eq 3 i e i ci d cg and δz were used to calculate percolation r by combining eqs 2 and 3 we calculated the actual evapotranspiration for each treatment and each crop and finally using eq 1 we could calculate wp as with wp water use efficiency wue can be presented in a number of different ways in this analysis we again use the definition of ali and talukder 2008 where wue in kg m 3 is the ratio between crop produced y in kg and the total volume of irrigation water delivered to the plot v in m3 4 w u e y v the denominator water applied is usually taken as irrigation water plus rainfall water applied in this sense represents the gross amount of water availability at field level of which an undetermined fraction is the actual crop evapotranspiration the irrigation water efficiency ie is defined as the ratio between the volume of irrigation water stored in the root zone and available for crop use vb in m3 and the total volume of irrigation water delivered to the plot vt in m3 burt et al 1997 5 i e v b v t where vb is the water beneficially used and vt the total water applied this is the traditional concept of efficiency in irrigation engineering israelson 1950 jensen 2007 it focuses on the amount of water released from a source to ensure beneficial uses are achieved both in terms of water consumption by crops and more recently allowances for agronomic needs to check if there was an increase in soil salinity over the growing seasons for the different crops the leaching fraction was used the leaching fraction lf is defined as the ratio between the net percolation and irrigation van hoorn and van alphen 2006 6 l f r d i e c i 2 e c e where eci is the irrigation water salinity in ds m and ece is the soil salinity in ds m this equation can be used to estimate the long term salinity level in the root zone assuming there is only one layer with complete mixing no saline seepage and no precipitation of salts 2 4 statistical analysis the normality of data distribution was examined first with log transformations conducted when necessary to obtain homogeneous variance statistical analyses were conducted using statistical analysis system software sas statistical analyses were performed at the significance level of p 0 05 in this study some of the data was randomized and some was not randomized complete blocks with three replicates per treatment could be used to determine the statistical significance of treatment effects on crop yield water productivity water use efficiency and irrigation efficiency because of the randomized arrangement of this data the mean comparison test method t test was used for performing statistical analysis for drainage outflow water table no3 n concentration and losses and p concentration and losses as this data was non randomized the mean of the observed data in the managed zone over the treatment periods was calculated as m using eq 7 where mi is the observed data from the managed zone over the treatment periods and n is the number of observations 7 m i n m i n the percent data change δc was calculated using eq 8 where ccd represents observed data from controlled drainage treatments and cfd represents observed data from free drainage clausen and spooner 1993 8 δ c c c d c f d c c d 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 drain discharges nitrate and phosphorous losses 3 1 1 drain discharges drain discharges in all controlled drainage treatments were significantly lower than under the free drainage conditions the average drain discharge under the fd treatment was 2 1 mm d for wheat 2 6 mm d for barley and 5 1 mm d for maize the average drain discharges with cdch were respectively 33 45 and 44 lower for wheat barley and maize respectively and 45 55 and 51 lower with cd70 the cd70 drainage rates were also significantly lower that the cdch rates by 17 wheat 18 barley and 13 maize which is surprising because both the average control levels in cdch treatments and average water table were almost the same the maximum drainage rates occurred in the fd treatment respectively 8 1 6 2 and 13 2 mm d for wheat barley and maize fig 3 the lowest discharges occurred at the beginning of the growing season in the cdch treatments when the control level in the drains was 40 cm fig 3 after the control level was lowered to 70 cm the drain discharge increased and was nearly the same as in the cd70 treatments at the end period of the growing season when the control level was lowered to 90 cm drainage discharges again increased but were still lower than those with fd drainage our results confirm that controlled drainage results in a major decrease in drainage rates as has already been reported in many studies fausey 2005 in a field experiment with maize and soybean on silty clay soils reported a 40 decrease in drainage discharges from the controlled drainage treatments compared to conventional drainage amenumey et al 2009 indicate that controlled drainage reduces subsurface drainage volumes by an average of 47 compared to conventional subsurface drainage the authors also found that an even bigger reduction in subsurface drainage rates is likely to occur in loamy sand soils up to 75 compared to 37 in clay loam soils they emphasize that soil type is a more important parameter than crops and climate skaggs et al 2010 and 2012 showed decrease in drainage water between 17 to 80 by controlled drainage sunohara et al 2015 looked at basin scale effects of controlled drainage and reported a decrease in drainage water other similar results have been reported from field studies in sweden wesstrom and messing 2007 ontario canada drury et al 2009 iowa helmers et al 2012 jaynes 2012 and the netherlands ritzema and stuyt 2015 rozemeijer et al 2016 our results clearly show that the use of controlled drainage in the moghan plain can be a key strategy to address the issue of excessive drainage water in this region 3 1 2 nitrate losses flow weighted no3 concentration mg l in drainage discharge from fd cd70 and cdch treatments were respectively 9 3 8 2 and 8 5 for wheat 10 6 9 7 and 9 4 for barley and 12 2 11 2 and 11 4 for maize table 3 the results indicate that the average concentration for free drainage is somewhat higher than controlled drainage treatments for all crops the difference between fd and cd treatments were significant at 1 percent level except fd and cd70 in wheat which was significant at the 5 percent level these results are in contrast to those of sands et al 2008 who found no difference in flow weighted no3 concentrations between shallow and conventional drainage the results are consistent however with many other studies such as mejia et al 2000 lalonde et al 1996 ng et al 2002 gunn et al 2015 and sunohara et al 2016 under controlled conditions anaerobic conditions occurred resulting in denitrification on the other hand when the soil organic carbon is high denitrification intensifies and reduces the transfer of nitrate another reason for the reduction in the concentration of nitrate in the controlled drainage treatments is the delay time of nitrate in the soil which increases the absorption by the root of the plants bohlen and villapando 2011 smith and kellman 2011 some researchers have described a reduction in the concentration of nitrate due to the potential for n2o to have a harmful effect on the environment as a dangerous process dalzell et al 2007 in this study the amount of n2o produced was estimated to be only 2 of the denitrification and the results showed that the soil water level had no effect on the percentage of n2o present in the atmosphere kliewer and gilliam 1995 average nitrate losses with the fd cd70 and cdch treatments were 0 24 0 15 and 0 18 kg ha for wheat 0 33 0 17 and 0 19 kg ha for barley and 0 63 0 31 and 0 34 kg ha for maize the largest nitrate losses occurred in the months that had the biggest drainage discharges for all crops and all treatments fig 4 compared to the fd treatment nitrate losses in cd70 and cdch were 37 and 25 lower respectively for wheat 48 and 42 lower for barley and 51 and 46 lower for maize these percentages are in line with the changes in drain discharges which is logical as the concentration in the different treatments were more or less the same thus there is a direct relationship between drain discharges and n losses fig 4 the reductions in no3 load with controlled drainage in this study are consistent with previous drainage water management research where the reduction in no3 load is attributed to a reduction in subsurface drainage volume rather than a reduction in no3 concentrations strock et al 2011 many other studies have reported similar results to the findings of this study including lalonde et al 1996 wesstrom and messing 2007 bonati and borin 2010 adeuya et al 2012 ale et al 2012 fang et al 2012 we conclude that these significant reductions in no3 loss were mainly caused by reductions in drainage flows as the effectiveness of controlled drainage in decreasing n losses in drainage water was nearly the same on a percentage basis as its effect in decreasing drain flows increased utilization of controlled drainage can therefore contribute to reducing the problem of low quality drainage water from the mogan plain 3 1 3 phosphorous losses concentration of phosphorous p in drainage discharge from cd treatments were slightly higher than in drainage from fd concentrations from fd cd70 and cdch plots were respectively 0 39 0 43 and 0 42 mg l for wheat 0 59 0 67 and 0 63 mg l for barley and 1 04 1 10 and 1 08 mg l for maize table 6 there was no significant difference in p concentration in all treatments for all crops except between the fd and cd70 treatments in barley table 4 although p concentrations in drainage discharge were slightly higher average p losses were lower with controlled drainage than with fd being respectively 9 14 5 69 and 6 21 g ha for wheat 13 1 8 4 and 9 6 g ha for barley and 46 8 28 5 and 30 1 g ha for maize in the controlled drainage treatments p losses decreased compared to fd by 38 in cd70 and 32 in cdch for wheat 36 and 27 respectively for barley and 39 and 36 respectively for maize in all cases these reductions were significant there is a direct relation between the amount of discharge drainage and the amount of p losses fig 5 unlike surface transfer of p control activities and waste of p are not well documented for subsurface drainage and controlling subsurface drainage losses of p remains a significant challenge the small increase in the amount of p in the controlled drainage treatments in this study may be due to the reduction of fe 2 and fe 3 under conditions of oxygen deficiency anaerobic conditions due to increased longevity of time which leads to increased soluble p and transfer of p surface waters through drainage the role of drainage in p transport has been discussed widely sims et al 1998 some regard it as unimportant skaggs et al 1994 whereas others have measured significant p losses via tile drainage and have identified drainage as a dominant p loss pathway to surface waters dils and heathwaite 1999 gelbrecht et al 2005 valero et al 2007 guo et al 2011 and kroger et al 2011 have also reported increasing concentrations of phosphorus controlled drainage system controlled drainage systems can help to reduce p losses p removal is predominantly a biogeochemical process reduction in p losses from subsurface controlled drainage systems will be mainly due to reduction in the loads of sediment as particles are retained in the soil profile due to the anoxic conditions p fractionation may change in the drainage system with p release from sediments resulting in a higher proportion of dissolved p in drainage outflow tan and zhang 2011 in a 5 year study observed that controlled drainage resulted in increased concentrations of p in surface runoff due to the increased soil moisture content which enhanced p release through desorption however due to reduced drainage flows the controlled drainage system still provided overall reductions in losses of p in drainage compared with the free draining system the effects of controlled drainage on p losses from soil also were examined in a 4 year field study in southern sweden by wesstrom and messing 2007 they found that the relative reduction in p loads in drain outflows were similar to the reduction in drainage outflow rates suggesting that controlled drainage reduced p losses on the other hand excessive use of phosphorus fertilizers will lead to an increase in the level of soil saturation from p and increase the risk of losses of p from the drainage system heathwaite and dils 2000 smith and kellman 2011 none the less controlled drainage shows promise for reducing p losses through the mechanism of reducing drainage discharges 3 2 overall water and salt balance percolation and actual evapotranspiration using the collected data on precipitation irrigation drainage changes in water content water table water and soil salinity the water and salt balances were calculated for the three crops and the three drainage treatments these balances were then used to calculate percolation and evapotranspiration under the assumption that the amount of salt lost through crop uptake and evaporation was negligible table 5 total irrigation gifts over the winter growing season for the three treatments were similar for wheat and barley in summer for corn irrigation gifts significantly increased for the fd treatment as did the drainage rate as well a clear indication of over irrigation the increasing trend in percolation for less control in drainage is in agreement with the average water table during the growing season which for all three crops was deeper for decreasing control table 6 this is in agreement with mejia et al 2000 who also reported higher water tables with controlled drainage than in conventionally drained plots over a two year field experiment in eastern ontario percolation was much higher in summer indicating that there was over irrigation in winter there was no percolation in the fd treatment but capillary rise indicating that the leaching was not enough to avoid salt build up in the root zone for all three crops actual evapotranspiration eta increased with increasing control in drainage table 7 which is in agreement with the decreasing trend in percolation there is not much difference in the total eta in mm between summer and winter mainly due to the differences in the length of the growing seasons 109 days for maize compared to 215 days for wheat and 180 days for barley for all three crops the daily values of the eta in the controlled drainage treatments cd70 cdch are comparable to the crop evapotranspiration etc calculated according to the fao guidelines allen et al 1998 in the free drainage treatment the eta was lower than the etc about 16 for the winter crops wheat and barley and 9 for the summer crop maize this indicates that there is water stress for the crops in the free drainage treatment but not in the controlled drainage treatments increased evapotranspiration by controlled drainage has also been reported by borin et al 2001 skaggs et al 2012 el ghannam et al 2016 and sunohara et al 2016 3 3 crop yield water use efficiency water productivity and irrigation efficiency 3 3 1 crop yield for all three crops yield was significantly higher in the controlled drainage treatments compared to the free drainage treatment table 7 for wheat the yields were respectively 27 and 41 higher in the cd70 and cdch treatments compared to the fd treatment for barley these increase were respectively 23 cd70 and 34 cdch and for maize forage yields 19 cd70 and 25 cdch yields in cdch treatment were also significantly higher than the cd70 12 for wheat 9 for barley and 5 for maize it is clear that a higher ground water table has a pronounced effect on an increase in eta and subsequently in the crop yield similar positive effects of controlled drainage have been reported for crop yields in maize and soybean in the us and canada for example ng et al 2002 observed an increase of 64 in maize yield for a controlled drained system compared with a free draining system borin et al 2001 observed higher plant biomass in crops under controlled rather than conventional drainage mejia et al 2000 reported higher crop yield maize and soybean with controlled drainage over a two year field experiment in eastern ontario additional examples of similar results can be found in noory and liaghat 2009 drury et al 2009 skaggs et al 2012 nash et al 2015 and sunohara et al 2016 among others these many other studies show that our results are not anomalies and that use of controlled drainage in the moghan plain can contribute to increased productivity in this important agricultural region 3 3 2 water use efficiency for all three crops the water use efficiency wue significantly increased with increasing drainage control table 7 for wheat the wue was 26 and 40 higher in respectively the cd70 and cdch treatments compared to the fd treatment for barley these increases were respectively 19 cd70 and 32 cdch and for maize forage yields 30 cd70 and 44 cdch wues in the cdch treatments were also significantly higher than the cd70 12 for wheat 11 for barley and 11 for maize the average wue for all treatments in winter 0 66 and 0 61 kg m3 for wheat and barley respectively was significantly lower than the average wue in summer 1 47 kg m3 for maize even with the increases from cd the values in winter are well below the range recommended by fao for a good commercial yield 0 8 1 6 kg m3 http www fao org land water databases and software crop information en this explains the relatively low crop yield for wheat especially under fd as the fao indicates that under irrigation a good commercial grain yield should be 6 to 9 ton ha for the recommended wue it is interesting to note that although the wue remains below the fao recommendations wheat yields with cd are in the fao s expected range in summer cd moved the wue for maize into the top of the range recommended by fao unfortunately the yield cannot be compared as the fao only gives a range for the grain yield and not for forage yield 3 3 3 water productivity the water productivity wp showed a similar trend to that seen with wue an increase with more control in drainage in winter the increase was again significant for wheat the wps were 17 and 24 higher in the cd70 and cdch treatments compared to the fd treatment and for barley these increases were respectively 9 cd70 and 14 cdch although the cdch treatments had slightly higher wp values compared to cd70 the differences were not significant for the summer crop maize the increases were not significant at all similar as the wue the wp in summer 3 1 kg m3 was significantly higher than in winter 1 24 and 1 00 kg m3 for respectively wheat and barley 3 3 4 irrigation efficiency the irrigation efficiency ie showed a similar trend as the wue and wp again an increase for more control in drainage in winter the increase was significant for both wheat and barley the ie were 8 and 13 higher in respectively the cd70 and cdch treatments compared to the fd treatment but the differences between the two control treatments cdch and cd70 were not significant for the summer crop maize the increases in ie was significant between all three treatments cdch had a 9 higher ie compared to cd70 and 28 compared to fd and cd had a 22 higher ie than fd the ie for maize in summer was the lowest 47 higher efficiencies were found in winter for wheat 53 and barley 63 the irrigation efficiency for the controlled drainage treatments which vary between 49 for maize to 65 for barley are in line with many studies that report similar positive effects of controlled drainage on irrigation efficiency mejia et al 2000 skaggs and youssef 2008 bonati and borin 2010 liu et al 2011 ramoska et al 2011 the improvement of ie is one of the most important benefits of the implementation of controlled drainage in moghan plain because it can contribute to huge water savings in this region 3 4 soil salinity and leaching 3 4 1 soil salinity in the fd treatments soil salinity decreased during the growing season for all three crops fig 6 in the cd treatments soil salinity was always higher at the end of the growing season than at the beginning although during the season there was some reduction observed over the course of the growing seasons soil salinity changed in depth with results indicating that higher increases were observed in the upper soil layers especially in the 30 60 cm and 60 90 cm layers 3 4 2 leaching soil salinity is an important aspect of sustainable agricultural practices so it is important to see the effect of cd on that to estimate of the long term salinity levels in the root zone the leaching fractions for the different treatments were calculated using these leaching fractions and assuming a one layered soil profile with complete mixing no saline seepage and no precipitation of salts the long term soil salinity levels were calculated the soil salinity levels vary between 1 0 1 4 ds m for maize 1 2 1 3 ds m for wheat to 1 6 1 8 ds m for barley all slightly higher than the initial values table 2 while the increase in soil salinity is a drawback associated with controlled drainage mitigation of its effects is in principle possible by implementing periods of leaching between periods of controlled drainage e g using free drainage to allow leaching after rainfall or during the first irrigation of the season hornbuckle et al 2005 this is an aspect of controlled drainage that needs further study considering the amount of water that can be saved through wider implementation of controlled drainage we are confident that even with periodic leaching needed to manage salinity there would be a net savings in water along with the other benefits from controlled drainage reported in this paper 4 conclusions conventional uncontrolled drainage can result in multiple problems for example in the mogan plain in northern iran it resulted in excessive volumes of low quality drainage water suboptimal yields and low water efficiencies in this study two controlled drainage treatments one with a constant level of 70 cm over the growing season cd70 and one with a changeable level cdch over the season were compared with conventional free drainage fd in two different growing seasons winter for two crops wheat and barley and summer for one crop maize the controlled drainage treatments significantly reduced both drainage rates and no3 and p losses major concerns in the mogan plain region the average drain discharges with cdch treatment were respectively 33 45 and 44 lower than fd treatment for wheat barley and maize respectively flow weighted no3 concentration in drainage discharge cd70 and cdch treatments were respectively 15 and 9 for wheat 9 and 13 for barley and 8 and 7 for maize lower than fd treatment there were some differences in effect between the cd70 and cdch systems indicating that the changeable drainage management is not yet optimized this is an area for further study in addition to reducing drainage rates and nutrient losses both cd70 and cdch resulted in significantly higher crop yields compared to the free drainage treatment respectively 27 41 for wheat 18 25 for barley and 19 25 for maize of which the cdch treatments had the highest yields the same trends were observed in the water use efficiency and water productivity irrigation efficiency was also higher in the controlled drainage plots for the winter crops wheat and barley between 8 and 13 and for the summer crop maize between 22 and 28 these results strongly suggest that controlled drainage can contribute to greater agricultural productivity and water savings in this area and perhaps other areas with similar conditions irrigation gifts in winter were more or less similar for all three treatments both for wheat and barley showing that the increase in irrigation efficiency can be attributed to the higher actual crop evapotranspiration and resulting crop yield in the controlled drainage plots in summer the total irrigation gifts to the free drainage plots was significantly higher than to the controlled plots although the actual crop evapotranspiration was lower in combination with the significantly higher drainage discharges this clearly indicated over irrigation under free drainage conditions something that can perhaps be adjusted even before controlled irrigation is more widely implemented this study indicates that controlled drainage can lead to some increase in soil salinity as compared to free drainage especially if the controlled level is fixed as in cd70 in the cdch treatments the control level was lowered to 90 cm at the end of growing season resulting in more leaching and less increase in soil salinity the study also shows that controlled drainage is very effective method to increase productivity in agricultural areas such as for the moghan plain or other areas with similar conditions that better management of drainage is a key opportunity for this justifies the need for more research to optimize the management options for controlled drainage to avoid problems with soil salinity 
11391,shortages of water resources and low soil fertility are two key factors that limit crop production in semiarid areas the ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting rfrh system is an effective method for enhancing the efficiency of rainfall water use and fertility in this study we conducted a field experiment over five years 2012 2016 to determine the effects of different fertilizer application rates on the soil water consumption properties water use efficiency and maize yield under rfrh we found that the evapotranspiration et maize dry matter dm water consumption strength cd and soil water use rate sp increased with the fertilizer application rate compared with the no fertilizer treatment rck et dm cd and sp increased significantly by 7 2 38 3 16 4 and 37 6 under high fertilizer rh treatment respectively by 6 7 35 8 18 0 and 39 1 with medium fertilizer rm treatment and by 5 5 31 1 16 1 and 32 6 with low fertilizer rl treatment rm achieved the highest average yield of 11 3 t ha 1 and the lowest coefficient of variation at 12 9 the yield dm and water use efficiency did not differ significantly between rh and rm regression analysis showed that the highest yield could be obtained by applying nitrogen at 265 0 kg ha 1 combined with p2o5 at 132 5 kg ha 1 the yield and water use efficiency were significantly higher under rl compared with rh and rm in wet year however in both normal and drought years the grain yield and water use efficiency was significantly higher under rm these results indicate that the rfrh system can promote crop use of fertilizers by regulating soil moisture the best fertilization strategy for planting maize with rfrh system was 265 0 kg ha 1 of pure nitrogen combined with 132 5 kg ha 1 of p2o5 in the semiarid area of the loess plateau in china keywords fertilizer rate maize yield ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting system semi arid area soil water consumption properties 1 introduction the semiarid region of northwestern china is a typical rain fed farming area with annual rainfall of 300 550 mm xiao and wang 2003 the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall can lead to a mismatch between the water supply and crop water demands thereby causing water deficits during the crop growth period which severely hinders the capacity to improve crop production in this area hu et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 in addition poor soil quality and low fertility are other key factors that limit crop production in semiarid areas liu and zhang 2007 dai et al 2015 film mulching is an effective agricultural treatment that is applied worldwide to improve the soil temperature and water conditions which can increase the crop yield and economic efficiency steinmetz et al 2016 the ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting rfrh system is widely used in the rain fed areas of northwestern china which it is an effective tillage measure for improving the rainfall use efficiency rue and crop yield in dry farming areas li et al 2000 zhang et al 2007a b hu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the rfrh system significantly improves the rhizosphere soil water conditions by guiding precipitation into furrows and suppressing the evaporation of water from the ridged soil li et al 2001 zhou et al 2009 li et al 2012 lian et al 2016 the rfrh system can enhance the growth of crop roots and improve the water use efficiency wue and fertilizer use efficiency thereby significantly increasing the plant height dry matter and economic yield ren et al 2008 wang et al 2009 especially in areas with rainfall of 230 440 mm where the effect on increasing the yield is most significant ren et al 2010 2016 since the 1980s the nutrients used in traditional agriculture in the northwestern region of china have gradually changed from a single application of manure to the use of various chemical fertilizers roelcke et al 2004 hao et al 2005 liu and zhang 2007 studies have shown that the application of appropriate fertilizers can increase the water retention capacity inhibit soil evaporation enhance the wue and improve crop yields hao et al 2005 dang et al 2006 however the application of excessive amounts of fertilizers can adversely affect the soil physics chemistry and biodiversity as well as leading to nitrate leaching and excessive soil water consumption perego et al 2012 yang et al 2017 lian et al 2016 thus it is very important to develop a scientific and reasonable fertilizer use strategy for the rfrh system in order to fully exploit its potential for increasing production in arid areas and reducing agricultural pollution where this is a key focus of dry land farming research the effects of soil water content and nutrients on crop growth and development are not irrelevant but interact with each other liu and zhang 2007 therefore using the special water regulation method of the rfrh system to formulate a fertilization scheme suitable for the system tapping the potential water uses efficiency is an important issue for crop cultivation and management in the arid area the previous research about the rfrh system were mainly focused on the effects of soil water content temperature covering materials ridges and furrows ratio and crop yields liu et al 2009 li et al 2013 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 ren et al 2017 however little is known about the appropriate fertilization strategy for the rfrh system we conducted a 5 year field experiment in order to 1 determine the effects of different nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application rates on the soil water consumption properties wue and maize yield under the rfrh system 2 investigate the relationship between nitrogen and phosphorus application rate and water consumption and maize yield under the rfrh system 3 provide a scientific basis for the sustainable development of the rfrh and provide an effective solution to alleviate the agro ecological problems caused by excessive application of chemical fertilizers in semiarid areas of the loess plateau in

the fertilizer treatments in the wet year 2013 and normal years 2012 and 2014 the rainfall basically met the water demand for maize where sp ranged between 0 0 and 19 4 and it improved gradually as the fertilizer rate application increased sws had major effects on maize growth in the drought year 2016 and in 2015 when the summer drought was very severe where sp ranged from 31 4 to 37 2 compared with rck sp increased by 9 0 p 0 05 11 3 p 0 05 and 9 9 p 0 05 under rh rm and rl respectively in the drought year sp increased by 7 0 p 0 05 and 3 5 p 0 05 under rm compared with rh and rl respectively sp was 3 6 p 0 05 higher under rl than rh 3 3 dry matter the dry matter increased with the fertilizer application rate fig 2 the dry matter increased significantly p 0 05 by 38 3 35 8 and

rl respectively in addition analysis of variance showed that year fertilizer rate and their interaction had a significant effect on maize yield table 4 regression analysis showed that the rainfall during growing period fertilizer rates and their interaction effect on the maize yield were significant r2 0 9109 p 0 01 the effects of rainfall and fertilizer rate clearly increased the maize yield where the effect of the fertilizer application rate t 1 95 was higher than that of rainfall t 5 06 due to the mismatch between water and fertilizer the interaction between rainfall and fertilizer was negative after calculating the partial derivative of the regression equation we found that the optimum rate for pure nitrogen was 265 0 kg ha 1 and that for p2o5 was 132 5 kg ha 1 fig 3 correlation analysis showed that there was a significant positive correlation between cd and the maize yield during the sowing v4 v8 vt and vt r3 stages in the r3 r6 stage the maize grain began to dehydrate and the demand for water decreased so there was a poor correlation between cd and the yield in this stage r2 0 248 table 5 3 5 water use efficiency and rainfall use efficiency as shown in table 6 year fertilizer rate and their interaction had a significant effect on wue and rue the grain wue increased significantly p 0 05 by 44 6 46 7 and 47 2 under rh rm and rl compared with rck respectively in each experimental year except 2013 the order of the wue under the fertilizer treatments was rm rh rl compared with rh and rl wue 5 year average increased by 4 5 and 2 0 under rm respectively wue was 3

in the normal years wue increased by 7 5 p 0 05 and 4 6 p 0 05 under rm compared with rl and rh respectively there was no significant difference between wue under rh and rl in the drought year there was no significant difference in wue under all of the treatments the five year average rue was higher under all the fertilizer treatments than rck thus compared with rck rue increased significantly p

rue was highest in the drought year compared with rh and rl rue increased by 11 5 p 0 05 and 5 2 p 0 05 under rm respectively rue was 6 4 higher under rh than rl p 0 05 there were no significant differences in rue under the fertilizer treatments during the wet year in the drought year rue was 6 3 p 0 05 and 7 4 p 0 05 higher under rm than rh and rl respectively rue did not differ significantly under rh and rl the effects of rainfall during growing period x1 fertilizer rate x2 and their interaction were significant on the grain wue r2 0 7033 p 0 01 and rue r2 0 7589 p 0 01 fig 4 the fertilizer rate had quadratic relationships with the wue and rue whereas the rainfall had linear relationships with the wue and rue 4 discussion 4 1 soil water consumption properties of rfrh system the et and nitrogen fertilizer application amount showed a quadratic curve relationship in the normal years and drought year and it showed linear relationship in the wet year fig 5 the changing trend of et in normal years and drought year is consistent with previous research results what showed that the water consumption does not increase further after the fertilizer application rate reaches a certain threshold zhou et al 2009 hunsaker et al 2000 the result of wet year is different from those obtained by zhou et al 2009 this difference may be explained by the high ratio of ineffective rainfall and the high intensity precipitation relative 15 5 to the total rainfall in the present study table 1 in addition the soil water use rate increased with the amount of fertilizer applied especially when there is drought during the growing season or less rainfall the soil water use rate exceed 31 0 leading a significant consumption of soil water table 2 this is because e the application of fertilizer can increase the accumulated dry matter and root growth as well as enhancing the water absorption capacity and it can also effectively increase the leaf area index and transpiration rate of crops thereby improving the soil water use rate rahman et al 2005 2005 zhong and shang 2014 4 2 yield effects of growth period rainfall in rfrh system the rfrh system can increase the yield and wue where it is influenced by the regional rainfall levels and other natural factors guo et al 2012 ren et al 2010 5 year consecutive field experiments shown that the low fertilizer treatment n 150 kg ha 1 p2o5 75 kg ha 1 obtained the highest yield 12 8 t ha 1 in the wet year yield of medium fertilizer treatment n 300 kg ha 1 p2o5 150 kg ha 1 was highest average 11 3 t ha 1 in normal years and drought year and the cv was lowest table 4 this result is consistent with that of li et al 2015 what showed that when the nitrogen application rate reached 300 kg ha 1 the maize yield was the highest the regression analysis showed fig 3 that there was a quadratic curve relationship between the growing period rainfall and yield and when the growing period rainfall was about 550 mm the maize yield was the highest the rainfall during the growth period in the range of 251 6 594 1 mm and the wue increased with the growing period rainfall fig 4a if the rainfall is uneven or insufficient during the growing season the crop yield can be enhanced by increasing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to an appropriate level zhong and shang 2014 4 3 yield effects of fertilizer rate in rfrh system the application of fertilizer can effectively improve the crop growth and increase the yield and wue in arid areas li and gong 2002 wang et al 2015 2016 zand parsa et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 numerous studies have shown that there is a parabolic relationship between the application of nitrogen fertilizer and the crop yield where the grain yield declines when the nitrogen application rate exceeds a certain threshold timsina et al 2001 morell et al 2011 lian et al 2016 under the rfrh system growing period rainfall fertilizer rates and their interaction effect on the maize yield r2 0 9101 p 0 001 and wue r2 0 7033 p 0 01 figs 3 and 4 when the fertilizer rate reached 265 0 kg ha 1 the maize yield reached the maximum and when the fertilization amount reached 430 kg ha 1 the wue began to decline in china based on a large number of fields in the early stages it was shown that the best fertilization rate for yield about 8 50 t ha 1 is 180 225 kg ha 1 guo et al 2008 zhang et al 2007a b our result is slightly higher than previous studies this indicates that the rfrh system can effectively coordinate the relationship between water and fertilizer promote the absorption and utilization of fertilizers by crops improves crop yield and water use efficiency 4 4 inhibition of excessive fertilization under the high fertilizers rate the yields wue and rue significantly show decreased trend with increasing the fertilizers rates tables 4 and 5 from 2014 onwards the growth of maize in high fertilizer treatment of was suppressed during the sowing v4 period and this inhibition continued until physiological maturity in 2015 2016 fig 1 this results are mainly caused by the application of fertilizer in successive years may have increased the nitrogen concentration in the soil solution to cause physiological drought by inhibiting water absorption via the root system zhong and shang 2014 thereby affecting the dry matter yield and water use efficiency of maize zhong and shang 2014 and reduces the increasing production effect ren et al 2010 payero et al 2009 teixeira et al 2014 moreover the reduction of rainfall in 2012 2016 is another reason for dry matter and yield are decreasing annually the mismatch between water availability and the application of fertilizer supply had a negative effect on the water fertilizer interaction 5 conclusions five years consecutive experiment showed that high fertilizers levels 300 kg ha 1 can cause excessive consumption of soil moisture in the wet year the low fertilizer level achieved the best yield and wue whereas the medium fertilizer level obtained the highest yields and wue in the normal years and the dry year regression analysis showed that the application of n at 265 0 kg ha 1 with p2o5 at 132 5 kg ha 1 could obtain the highest yield and wue under rfrh farming the rfrh system can effectively coordinate the relationship between water and fertilizer promote the absorption and utilization of fertilizers by crops and provide an effective solution to the problem of over application of chemical fertilizers in the semi arid regions of the loess plateau china funding this work

11391,shortages of water resources and low soil fertility are two key factors that limit crop production in semiarid areas the ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting rfrh system is an effective method for enhancing the efficiency of rainfall water use and fertility in this study we conducted a field experiment over five years 2012 2016 to determine the effects of different fertilizer application rates on the soil water consumption properties water use efficiency and maize yield under rfrh we found that the evapotranspiration et maize dry matter dm water consumption strength cd and soil water use rate sp increased with the fertilizer application rate compared with the no fertilizer treatment rck et dm cd and sp increased significantly by 7 2 38 3 16 4 and 37 6 under high fertilizer rh treatment respectively by 6 7 35 8 18 0 and 39 1 with medium fertilizer rm treatment and by 5 5 31 1 16 1 and 32 6 with low fertilizer rl treatment rm achieved the highest average yield of 11 3 t ha 1 and the lowest coefficient of variation at 12 9 the yield dm and water use efficiency did not differ significantly between rh and rm regression analysis showed that the highest yield could be obtained by applying nitrogen at 265 0 kg ha 1 combined with p2o5 at 132 5 kg ha 1 the yield and water use efficiency were significantly higher under rl compared with rh and rm in wet year however in both normal and drought years the grain yield and water use efficiency was significantly higher under rm these results indicate that the rfrh system can promote crop use of fertilizers by regulating soil moisture the best fertilization strategy for planting maize with rfrh system was 265 0 kg ha 1 of pure nitrogen combined with 132 5 kg ha 1 of p2o5 in the semiarid area of the loess plateau in china keywords fertilizer rate maize yield ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting system semi arid area soil water consumption properties 1 introduction the semiarid region of northwestern china is a typical rain fed farming area with annual rainfall of 300 550 mm xiao and wang 2003 the uneven spatial and temporal distribution of rainfall can lead to a mismatch between the water supply and crop water demands thereby causing water deficits during the crop growth period which severely hinders the capacity to improve crop production in this area hu et al 2014 zhao et al 2014 in addition poor soil quality and low fertility are other key factors that limit crop production in semiarid areas liu and zhang 2007 dai et al 2015 film mulching is an effective agricultural treatment that is applied worldwide to improve the soil temperature and water conditions which can increase the crop yield and economic efficiency steinmetz et al 2016 the ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting rfrh system is widely used in the rain fed areas of northwestern china which it is an effective tillage measure for improving the rainfall use efficiency rue and crop yield in dry farming areas li et al 2000 zhang et al 2007a b hu et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 the rfrh system significantly improves the rhizosphere soil water conditions by guiding precipitation into furrows and suppressing the evaporation of water from the ridged soil li et al 2001 zhou et al 2009 li et al 2012 lian et al 2016 the rfrh system can enhance the growth of crop roots and improve the water use efficiency wue and fertilizer use efficiency thereby significantly increasing the plant height dry matter and economic yield ren et al 2008 wang et al 2009 especially in areas with rainfall of 230 440 mm where the effect on increasing the yield is most significant ren et al 2010 2016 since the 1980s the nutrients used in traditional agriculture in the northwestern region of china have gradually changed from a single application of manure to the use of various chemical fertilizers roelcke et al 2004 hao et al 2005 liu and zhang 2007 studies have shown that the application of appropriate fertilizers can increase the water retention capacity inhibit soil evaporation enhance the wue and improve crop yields hao et al 2005 dang et al 2006 however the application of excessive amounts of fertilizers can adversely affect the soil physics chemistry and biodiversity as well as leading to nitrate leaching and excessive soil water consumption perego et al 2012 yang et al 2017 lian et al 2016 thus it is very important to develop a scientific and reasonable fertilizer use strategy for the rfrh system in order to fully exploit its potential for increasing production in arid areas and reducing agricultural pollution where this is a key focus of dry land farming research the effects of soil water content and nutrients on crop growth and development are not irrelevant but interact with each other liu and zhang 2007 therefore using the special water regulation method of the rfrh system to formulate a fertilization scheme suitable for the system tapping the potential water uses efficiency is an important issue for crop cultivation and management in the arid area the previous research about the rfrh system were mainly focused on the effects of soil water content temperature covering materials ridges and furrows ratio and crop yields liu et al 2009 li et al 2013 wang et al 2015 wu et al 2017 ren et al 2017 however little is known about the appropriate fertilization strategy for the rfrh system we conducted a 5 year field experiment in order to 1 determine the effects of different nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer application rates on the soil water consumption properties wue and maize yield under the rfrh system 2 investigate the relationship between nitrogen and phosphorus application rate and water consumption and maize yield under the rfrh system 3 provide a scientific basis for the sustainable development of the rfrh and provide an effective solution to alleviate the agro ecological problems caused by excessive application of chemical fertilizers in semiarid areas of the loess plateau in china 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the study was performed between 2012 and 2016 at the dry land agricultural experiment station pengyang city ningxia province china 35 51 e 106 48 n

the fertilizer treatments in the wet year 2013 and normal years 2012 and 2014 the rainfall basically met the water demand for maize where sp ranged between 0 0 and 19 4 and it improved gradually as the fertilizer rate application increased sws had major effects on maize growth in the drought year 2016 and in 2015 when the summer drought was very severe where sp ranged from 31 4 to 37 2 compared

system the et and nitrogen fertilizer application amount showed a quadratic curve relationship in the normal years and drought year and it showed linear relationship in the wet year fig 5 the changing trend of et in normal years and drought year is consistent with previous research results what showed that the water consumption does not increase further after the fertilizer application rate reaches a certain threshold zhou et al 2009 hunsaker et al 2000 the result of wet year is different from those obtained by zhou et al 2009 this difference may be explained by the high ratio of ineffective rainfall and the high intensity precipitation relative 15 5 to the total rainfall in the present study table 1 in addition the soil water use rate increased with the amount of fertilizer applied especially when there is drought during the growing season or less rainfall the soil water use rate exceed 31 0 leading a significant consumption of soil water table 2 this is because e the application of fertilizer can increase the accumulated dry matter and root growth as well as enhancing the water absorption capacity and it can also effectively increase the leaf area index and transpiration rate of crops thereby improving the soil water use rate rahman et al 2005 2005 zhong and shang 2014 4 2 yield effects of growth period rainfall in rfrh system the rfrh system can increase the yield and wue where it is influenced by the regional rainfall levels and other natural factors guo et al 2012 ren et al 2010 5 year consecutive field experiments shown that the low fertilizer treatment n 150 kg ha 1 p2o5 75 kg ha 1 obtained the highest yield 12 8 t ha 1 in the wet year yield of medium fertilizer treatment n 300 kg ha 1 p2o5 150 kg ha 1 was highest average 11 3 t ha 1 in normal years and drought year and the cv was lowest table 4 this result is consistent with that of li et al 2015 what showed that when the nitrogen application rate reached 300 kg ha 1 the maize yield was the highest the regression analysis showed fig 3 that there was a quadratic curve relationship between the growing period rainfall and yield and when the growing period rainfall was about 550 mm the maize yield was the highest the rainfall during the growth period in the range of 251 6 594 1 mm and the wue increased with the growing period rainfall fig 4a if the rainfall is uneven or insufficient during the growing season the crop yield can be enhanced by increasing the amount of nitrogen fertilizer applied to an appropriate level zhong and shang 2014 4 3 yield effects of fertilizer rate in rfrh system the application of fertilizer can effectively improve the crop growth and increase the yield and wue in arid areas li and gong 2002 wang et al 2015 2016 zand parsa et al 2006 zhou et al 2011 numerous studies have shown that there is a parabolic relationship between the application of nitrogen fertilizer and the crop yield where the grain yield declines when the nitrogen application rate exceeds a certain threshold timsina et al 2001 morell et al 2011 lian et al 2016 under the rfrh system growing period rainfall fertilizer rates and their interaction effect on the maize yield r2 0 9101 p 0 001 and wue r2 0 7033 p 0 01 figs 3 and 4 when the fertilizer rate reached 265 0 kg ha 1 the maize yield reached the maximum and when the fertilization amount reached 430 kg ha 1 the wue began to decline in china based on a large number of fields in the early stages it was shown that the best fertilization rate for yield about 8 50 t ha 1 is 180 225 kg ha 1 guo et al 2008 zhang et al 2007a b our result is slightly higher than previous studies this indicates that the rfrh system can effectively coordinate the relationship between water and fertilizer promote the absorption and utilization of fertilizers by crops improves crop yield and water use efficiency 4 4 inhibition of excessive fertilization under the high fertilizers rate the yields wue and rue significantly show decreased trend with increasing the fertilizers rates tables 4 and 5 from 2014 onwards the growth of maize in high fertilizer treatment of was suppressed during the sowing v4 period and this inhibition continued until physiological maturity in 2015 2016 fig 1 this results are mainly caused by the application of fertilizer in successive years may have increased the nitrogen concentration in the soil solution to cause physiological drought by inhibiting water absorption via the root system zhong and shang 2014 thereby affecting the dry matter yield and water use efficiency of maize zhong and shang 2014 and reduces the increasing production effect ren et al 2010 payero et al 2009 teixeira et al 2014 moreover the reduction of rainfall in 2012 2016 is another reason for dry matter and yield are decreasing annually the mismatch between water availability and the application of fertilizer supply had a negative effect on the water fertilizer interaction 5 conclusions five years consecutive experiment showed that high fertilizers levels 300 kg ha 1 can cause excessive consumption of soil moisture in the wet year the low fertilizer level achieved the best yield and wue whereas the medium fertilizer level obtained the highest yields and wue in the normal years and the dry year regression analysis showed that the application of n at 265 0 kg ha 1 with p2o5 at 132 5 kg ha 1 could obtain the highest yield and wue under rfrh farming the rfrh system can effectively coordinate the relationship between water and fertilizer promote the absorption and utilization of fertilizers by crops and provide an effective solution to the problem of over application of chemical fertilizers in the semi arid regions of the loess plateau china funding this work

11392,to quantitatively analyze the main driving factors of agricultural water use in different stages in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi decomposition method was employed to calculate the contribution of each driving factor to agricultural water use the crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency of different crops were chosen as representative factors of agricultural water use the study revealed that 1 from 1991 to 2015 agricultural water use exhibited a fluctuating growth trend that resulted in a 0 031 billion m3 increase in use from 1991 to 2001 agricultural water use increased by 0 069 billion m3 and from 2002 to 2015 it decreased by 0 038 billion m3 2 in each research period the expansion of the crop planting scale and unreasonable cropping patterns increased agricultural water use however decreases in irrigation quotas and improvements in irrigation efficiency decreased agricultural water use the contributions of these changes were 1 138 billion m3 0 109 billion m3 1 08 billion m3 and 0 136 billion m3 respectively from 1991 to 2015 comparing the period 1991 to 2001 with 2002 to 2015 the increase associated with the crop planting scale and the decrease related to irrigation quotas were prominent and dramatically changed agricultural water use 3 the effects of crops varied in different research periods from 1991 to 2001 the contribution of cash crops increase was 0 446 billion m3 which was more prominent than that of food crops decrease 3 78 billion m3 and from 2002 to 2015 the agricultural water use was decreased for all crops except maize in conclusion the best measures to decrease agricultural water use in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin are to control the crop planting scale and optimize the cropping pattern the results of this study indicate how diverse determinants affect agricultural water use and provide insight for local agricultural water savings keywords agricultural water use logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi factor decomposition middle reaches of the heihe river basin agricultural water management 1 introduction water resources are vital for agricultural production and agriculture is a sector responsible for most water use kang et al 2017 in 2014 the total water use in china was 609 5 billion m3 of which 63 5 was used for agriculture and approximately 90 of the water allocated for agriculture was used for farm irrigation the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2014 however rapid urbanization and population growth have increased the food demand which has increased the agricultural water use requirement in addition inefficient flood irrigation and unreasonable cropping patterns have caused serious water shortages and as a result threatened food production hence to develop suitable measures for decreasing agricultural water use and ensuring food security in china it is necessary to investigate the factors that influence agricultural water use in recent years many studies have focused on the factors that influence agricultural water use the main factors include area climate water intensities composition scale of production population the use of fertilizers the type of cultivation and the characteristics of the terrain etc hatfield et al 2001 sadras et al 2003 huang et al 2009 employed principal component analysis to study the influence of area production and climate on agricultural water consumption in beijing and found that their contributions are 44 1 35 2 and 17 1 respectively duarte et al 2014 used decomposition analysis to analyze the embodied water consumption in agricultural production and to investigate the forces contributing to this trend and their results showed that the main factor driving water consumption is the scale of production and changes in land use prevented the increase of embodied water in agricultural production cao et al 2015 calculated the agricultural water footprint awf in china and the main factors accounting for the total agricultural water footprint were population and per capita agricultural water footprint based on soil characteristics rodriguez et al 2015 used fertilizers for potato production to reduce the grey water footprint guo et al 2016 used an input output model to analyze embodied agricultural water trade and the awf in china their results showed that population urbanization water use efficiency internal industrial structure and external trade structure were the key factors influencing the chinese awf with remote sensing meteorological data and water balance applications yang et al 2016 concluded that in west liaohe plain china maize was an important part of agricultural water consumption and that the effects of maize sowing area on agricultural water consumption were associated with rainfall and groundwater recently ang 2004 2005 proposed the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi because of its profound theoretical foundation and high adaptability the index has been extensively used and considered a valid research method it has the advantages of eliminating residuals handling 0 and negative value problems in decomposition calculations adapting cross sectional time series of data and performing non positive data processing gao and wang 2007 the lmdi has been widely used to quantitatively identify the effects of different factors on energy consumption chung et al 2011 wang et al 2014 timma et al 2016 dai and gao 2016 wang and li 2016 sun et al 2016 and to determine the factors that influence co2 emissions timilsina and shrestha 2009 wang et al 2013 cui et al 2016 in the netherlands and west germany de bruyn 1997 analyzed the so2 emissions from 1980 to 1990 based on decomposition analysis moreover the lmdi method has been applied to grain production liu et al 2013 liu et al 2016 li et al 2016 the identification of significant industrial pollutants huang 2009 lei et al 2012 geng et al 2014 tursun et al 2015 and an analysis of the factors that drove changes in the water footprint wf of crop production in beijing between 1978 and 2012 xu et al 2015 however the lmdi model has not been extensively utilized in the field of water resources liu and bai 2012 zhang et al 2014 and shang et al 2016 used the lmdi in analyses of industrial water consumption and zhang et al 2015 employed the model to determine the main reason for changes in total water consumption in urumqi china from 1995 to 2012 furthermore zhao and chen 2014 explored the chinese awf and adopted the lmdi to determine the underlying factors associated with agricultural water between 1990 and 2009 although many researchers have investigated the degree of influence of different factors through causative analysis few studies have used the lmdi method to examine the quantitative contribution of each driving factor to agricultural water use additionally the stage characteristics which are important for developing policies to control water resource pressures have not been appropriately identified therefore to fill these research gaps we investigated the quantitative contributions of different factors to agricultural water use by decomposing the factors into the crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin china the specific objectives of the present study are 1 to analyze the overall trend of agricultural water use and its driving factors in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin 2 to apply the lmdi method to quantitatively define and decompose the factors that influence agricultural water use and 3 to quantitatively explain the contribution of each influencing factor to agricultural water use in different periods finally based on the results some suggestions are presented to improve policies and mitigate agricultural water use in a desirable way 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the heihe river basin is the second largest inland river basin in northwest china and is located in the middle of the hexi corridor fig 1 yingluoxia and zhengyixia divide the heihe river channel into the upper reach middle reach and lower reach the length of the middle river reach is 206 km the mean annual precipitation in the heihe river basin is 116 mm and the mean annual reference evapotranspiration can reach 1074 mm consequently there is a shortage of water resources in the basin the middle reaches of the heihe river basin comprise five counties or districts of zhangye city and the region is suitable for agricultural production due to the abundant solar thermal resources and flat topography therefore water is a key factor for agricultural development and ecosystem sustainability the crop planting scale in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin accounts for 95 of the total cultivated area and it is one of the top ten chinese regions for grain production here 94 of water resources are for agricultural water use of which 89 of the water is for irrigation purposes gansu province bureau of statistics 2015 in this study three counties districts including ganzhou linze and gaotai in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin comprised the study area the principal crops in the area are maize wheat fruit trees vegetables and oil bearing crops while other crops include maize for seed potato and cotton 2 2 data description the period from 1991 to 2015 is used for the decomposition analysis in this study to ensure ecological water use in the downstream region in 2001 the state council passed the heihe water diversion scheme whereby zhangye city must guarantee the amount of water to be released by conserving water and adjusting the economic structure to meet the water diversion target in 2002 zhangye city was chosen by the ministry of water resources as the first pilot city for developing a water saving society in china under the influence of the policy several changes have been made in agricultural water use to facilitate the analysis the duration is divided into two sub periods 1991 2001 and 2002 2015 which correspond to the new agricultural policy issued by the chinese government agricultural water use is calculated based on the following intrinsic factors crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency as such these factors were chosen as the impact factors for analyzing changes in agricultural water use the crop planting scale is the total area of all kinds of crops the cropping pattern is the proportion of the area of crop i to the crop planting scale crop area data for the middle reaches of the heihe river basin were obtained from the zhangye city statistical year book for the period 1991 2015 optimizing the planting scale and cropping pattern can fully tap the potential of agricultural water saving and ensure agricultural development the irrigation quota is the amount of water irrigated per unit area during crop growth and it is affected by climate change which influences crop water demand the irrigation quota data for wheat maize and oil bearing crops were taken from the zhangye city water resources management annual report and the irrigation quotas for vegetables fruit trees and other crops were estimated according to the ratio between the actual net irrigation water use and the crop planting area irrigation efficiency represents the efficiency of using irrigation water for crop use and is calculated as the product of water conveyance efficiency and water application efficiency water saving projects can affect the irrigation efficiency by improving irrigation facilities water conveyance methods and irrigation methods to reduce irrigation water losses thereby reducing agricultural water use the water conveyance efficiency and water application efficiency were extracted from the zhangye city water resources management annual report 2 3 decomposition of agricultural water use the index decomposition analysis method is used to analyze agricultural water use in the middle reach of the heihe river basin the basic idea of this approach is to decompose the target values into several main influencing factors based on mathematical identity transformation sinton and levine 1994 de bruyn 1997 the kaya identity is employed to evaluate the effects of driving factors that led to dramatic changes in total agricultural water use four factors were assumed in this study the crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency the index decomposition analysis of water use can be given by the following equations 1 w t σ i w i t σ i a t a i t i i t e t σ i a t a i t i i t c t 2 e t e c t e a t 100 3 e c t w f t w s t 100 4 e a t w c t w f t 100 where w t m3 denotes the total agricultural water use in year t w i t m3 is the agricultural water use of crop i in year t a t hm2 is the crop planting scale in year t a i t is the cropping pattern of crop i in year t i i t is the irrigation quota of crop i in year t e t is the irrigation efficiency in year t and c t 1 e t e c t is the water conveyance efficiency in year t e a t is the water application efficiency in year t w f t is the water delivered to the field in year t w s t m3 is the water diverted from the source in year t and w c t m3 is the water available for crop use in year t the lmdi is divided into multiplicative decomposition and additive decomposition both of which are equally valid and can be transformed into each other in contrast to the multiplicative case the decomposition results of the additive case are given as physical units rather than indexes making them easy to use and interpret in this way additive decomposition is used to decompose the agricultural water use the effects of the four factors that contribute to changes in agricultural water use over t years are represented by δ w a δ w a δ w i and δ w c the total change in agricultural water use from the base year to year t is as follows 5 δ w t o t w t w 0 δ w a δ w a δ w i δ w c where δ w t o t is the total change in agricultural water use w t and w 0 are the agricultural water used in years t and 0 respectively in the study area δ w a is the change in agricultural water use caused by changes in the crop planting scale δ w a is the change in agricultural water use caused by adjusting the cropping pattern δ w i is the change in agricultural water use caused by variations in irrigation quota and δ w c is the change in agricultural water use caused by improving the irrigation efficiency based on the additive decomposition model the general formulas for agricultural water decomposition can be summarized as follows 6 δ w a i w i t w i 0 ln w i t ln w i 0 ln a t a 0 7 δ w a i w i t w i 0 ln w i t ln w i 0 ln a i t a i 0 8 δ w i i w i t w i 0 ln w i t ln w i 0 ln i i t i i 0 9 δ w c i w i t w i 0 ln w i t ln w i 0 ln c t c 0 as shown in eqs 6 to 9 a positive value indicates that the factors increase agricultural water use by contrast a negative value indicates that the factors decrease agricultural water use 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in agricultural water use and their driving factors the agricultural water use crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency trends are shown in figs 2 to 6 as shown in fig 2 the overall trend of agricultural water use exhibited fluctuating growth in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin because of increases in the population and urbanization rate wu et al 2017 the total agricultural water use increased from 1 729 billion m3 in 1991 to 1 760 billion m3 in 2015 an increase of 0 031 billion m3 or growth of 1 79 with the increased acreage of maize the water use associated with maize was the largest and increased significantly by 209 4 this increase was the main factor that led to the change in agricultural water use the portions of other crops were also notable and accounted for 23 17 of the total agricultural water use this percentage accounted for a significant portion of the increase in agricultural water use in the middle reaches other water uses accounted for percentages smaller than that those discussed above and remained stable therefore they had virtually no effect on the total change in water use fig 3 shows that the crop planting scale in the middle reaches increased by 95 2 from 1991 to 2015 in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the net benefits per unit area were higher for maize and other crops than for wheat therefore farmers may have planted more maize and other crops accordingly the scales of maize and other crops were increased while that of wheat was decreased significant changes in the crop pattern can be observed in fig 4 the planting proportion of maize decreased from 1991 to 2001 and increased from 2001 to 2015 and the planting proportion of wheat significantly decreased since 2001 the maize area for seed has increased and it has been classified as other crops thus there was an abrupt change in the proportions of other crops in 2001 the planting proportions of maize and other crops significantly increased and accounted for a substantial portion of the total planting area with trends similar to that of the total crop planting scale hence they were the most important driving factors of the crop planting scale in the middle reaches the changes in the rest of the crops in the areas were stable and the areas of some crops even decreased thus they had little effect on the irrigated area in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin fig 5 indicates that because of the influence of water saving technologies the planting of new low water crops and increased precipitation most irrigation quotas decreased especially those of fruit trees and vegetables the irrigation efficiency is also a principal component that influences the amount of agricultural water use in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin fig 6 shows that from 1991 to 1998 the irrigation efficiency changed unsteadily and annually increased to approximately 0 56 in 1998 from 1998 to 2001 due to channel aging and serious frost heave the irrigation efficiency decreased in 2002 the first pilot city for societal water savings was established in zhangye city by the ministry of water resources the government installed a high standard canal lining which led to an increase in the irrigation efficiency and improved water resource management 3 2 decomposition of the change in agricultural water use during 1991 2015 to investigate the annual contribution of each driving factor to agricultural water use in the middle reaches the relevant factors were decomposed using equations 1 to 9 the annual change in agricultural water use between 1991 and 2015 was determined based on the lmdi as shown in fig 7 the overall trend of agricultural water use exhibited fluctuating growth in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin notably it increased by 0 031 billion m3 between 1991 and 2015 as shown in fig 3 the crop planting scale expanded considerably leading to an increase in agricultural water use of 1 138 billion m3 this total volume accounted for a 3701 3 increase in water use the cropping pattern was the second largest driver of the increase in agricultural water use the proportions of maize and other crops dramatically increased and that of wheat decreased fig 4 however the irrigation quotas of maize and other crops were more substantial than that of wheat therefore the cropping pattern showed an increase in agricultural water use of 0 109 billion m3 accounting for a 354 69 increase in water use as shown in fig 5 the irrigation quotas of most crops decreased recently which decreased agricultural water use by 1 08 billion m3 this change contributed to a 3512 64 change in agricultural water use improvements in the irrigation efficiency mitigated water consumption by irrigation feng et al 2017 but this contribution was weaker than that associated with decreasing the irrigation quotas specifically the contribution of irrigation efficiency was 0 136 billion m3 accounting for a 443 49 decrease in agricultural water use therefore the changes in the crop planting scale and cropping pattern led to increases in agricultural water use with the crop planting scale accounting for the most predominant contribution in contrast the change in irrigation quotas and the irrigation efficiency decreased agricultural water use in particular the irrigation quotas had the largest effect on decreasing agricultural water use in general because the positive factors offset the negative factors total agricultural water use exhibited an increasing trend from 1991 to 2015 3 3 decomposition of the change in agricultural water use during 1991 2001 and 2002 2015 to study the staged trend of agricultural water use in the middle reaches of the basin the study period was divided into two stages i e 1991 2001 and 2002 2015 based on the above equations the contributors of all factors were calculated through the lmdi as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 fig 8 shows that agricultural water use increased by 0 069 billion m3 from 1991 to 2001 considering the influential factors it can be inferred that the crop planting scale and cropping pattern were the main factors that increased agricultural water use and the irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency decreased agricultural water use in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the crop planting scale and irrigation quotas largely contributed to the change in agricultural water use with associated changes of approximately 0 302 billion m3 and 0 406 billion m3 respectively a detailed analysis of different crops showed that food crops including wheat and maize led to a decrease in agricultural water use wheat had the largest mitigating effect on water use with a contribution of approximately 0 243 billion m3 however cash crops including vegetables fruit trees and other crops except for oil bearing crops led to an increase in agricultural water use and other crops exhibited the most significant increase of 0 239 billion m3 specifically the crop planting scale of all types of crops should be controlled the effects of irrigation efficiency in wheat and the cropping pattern in vegetable fruit tree and other crops were 0 002 billion m3 0 141 billion m3 0 201 billion m3 and 0 262 billion m3 respectively which increased the agricultural water use the rest factors of crop decreased the agricultural water use finally the overall effect led to an increase in agricultural water use from 1991 to 2001 fig 9 shows that from 2002 to 2015 the agricultural water use in the study area decreased by 0 038 billion m3 a comparison of the four influential factors from 2002 to 2015 suggests that the crop planting scale and cropping pattern increased the agricultural water use specifically the contribution of the crop planting scale was 0 835 billion m3 and was more significant than that of the cropping pattern the irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency had mitigating effects on agricultural water use the contribution of irrigation quota i e 0 975 billion m3 was larger than that of the irrigation efficiency therefore the planting patterns and irrigation efficiency of crash crops played a relatively minor role in the decrease of agricultural water use in a detailed analysis of different crops it can be observed that maize increased the agricultural water use from 2002 to 2015 compared with that in 1991 2001 primarily due to the unreasonable cropping pattern the rest of crops were associated with decreases in agricultural water use in particular changes in fruit trees and other crops were the largest negative factors and these changes reduced agricultural water use by 0 282 billion m3 and 0 323 billion m3 respectively concretely the positive contribution of the crop planting scale has not decreased but rather increased dramatically the contribution of cropping pattern in maize and vegetables and the contribution of irrigation quota in oil bearing crops increased the agricultural water use the irrigation quota of vegetables fruit trees and other crops strongly reduced agricultural water use with contributions of 0 229 billion m3 0 247 billion m3 and 0 492 billion m3 respectively consequently the agricultural water use decreased from 2002 to 2015 zhangye is a well known commodity grain base in china in the early 21 st century given the economic development and intense population growth there has been higher demand for grain driven by the high benefits of maize for seed its planting area has expanded therefore the crop planting scale has expanded dramatically in recent years the precipitation in zhangye has increased coupled with the heihe water diversion scheme and the construction of a water saving society new crop varieties and new irrigation technologies have been popularized thus the irrigation quotas in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin have been significantly reduced as a result a comparison of the periods 1991 to 2001 and 2002 to 2015 indicates that the contributions to increasing the crop planting scale and the decrease in the irrigation quota were more dramatic in the latter than in the former furthermore the negative contributions of irrigation quota in cash crops and the negative contribution of irrigation efficiency in both food crops and cash crops have clearly improved compared to those in 1991 to 2001 this is due to the issue of water saving policy improvement in water saving technology and the change of citizen s lifestyle et al overall the modeling approach presented is proved to be reasonable 4 conclusions and recommendations understanding the driving forces of agriculture water use is essential for policy formulation and decomposition analysis is a useful approach for quantitatively determining changes in the predetermined factors that influence agricultural water use this study analyzes the overall trends of agricultural water use and the lmdi method is applied as an innovative measure to quantitatively determine the main driving factors of the agricultural water use of different crops in different time periods the driving factors of agricultural water use can be decomposed into crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quotas and irrigation efficiency these categories can allow us to further explore the inherent mechanisms influencing agricultural water use the conclusions regarding agricultural water use in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin correspond with the conditions of the location overall the modeling approach presented has proven to be both reasonable and convincing and it can therefore be utilized in other regions of the world considering the great agricultural water saving potential of crop planting scale and cropping pattern the government should control the crop planting scale within a reasonable range and should consider reducing the proportion of maize and vegetables at present the contribution of irrigation efficiency is not notable therefore the government should take measures such as increasing capital investment in agricultural irrigation facilities planting new crop varieties and installing high quality canal linings this study can provide a scientific basis for farmers and government officials to select crops and formulate policies which play important roles in guiding actual production although thorough evaluations have been performed based on these factors further studies are recommended to determine the reasonable range of the crop planting area and to adjust the cropping pattern to effectively reduce agricultural water use acknowledgments we are grateful for the grant support from the national key

decomposition method was employed to calculate the contribution of each driving factor to agricultural water use the crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency of

of the crop planting scale and unreasonable cropping patterns increased agricultural water use however decreases in irrigation quotas and improvements in irrigation efficiency decreased agricultural water use the contributions of these changes were 1 138 billion m3 0 109 billion m3 1 08 billion m3 and 0 136 billion m3 respectively from 1991 to 2015 comparing the period 1991 to 2001 with 2002 to 2015 the increase associated with the crop planting scale and the decrease related to irrigation quotas were prominent and dramatically changed agricultural water use 3 the effects of crops varied in different research periods from 1991 to 2001 the contribution of cash crops increase was 0 446 billion m3 which was more prominent than that of food crops decrease 3 78 billion m3 and from 2002 to 2015 the agricultural water use was decreased for all crops except maize in conclusion the best measures to decrease agricultural water use in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin are to control the crop planting scale and optimize the cropping pattern the results of this study indicate how diverse determinants affect agricultural water use and provide insight for local agricultural water savings keywords agricultural water use logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi factor decomposition middle reaches of the heihe river basin agricultural water management 1 introduction water resources are vital for agricultural production and agriculture is a sector responsible for most water use kang et al 2017 in 2014 the total water use in china was 609 5 billion m3 of which 63 5 was used for agriculture and approximately 90 of the water allocated for agriculture was used for farm irrigation the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china 2014 however rapid urbanization and population growth have increased the food demand which has increased the agricultural water use requirement in addition inefficient flood irrigation and unreasonable cropping patterns have caused serious water shortages and as a result threatened food production hence to develop suitable measures for decreasing agricultural water use and ensuring food security in china it is necessary to investigate the factors that influence agricultural water use in recent years many studies have focused on the factors that influence agricultural water use the main factors include area climate water intensities composition scale of production population the use of fertilizers the type of cultivation and the characteristics of the terrain etc hatfield et al 2001 sadras et al 2003 huang et al 2009 employed principal component analysis to study the influence of area production and climate on agricultural water consumption in beijing and found that their contributions are 44 1 35 2 and 17 1 respectively duarte et al 2014 used decomposition analysis to analyze the embodied water consumption in agricultural production and to investigate the forces contributing to this trend and their results showed that the main factor driving water consumption is the scale of production and changes in land use prevented the increase of embodied water in agricultural production cao et al 2015 calculated the agricultural water footprint awf in china and the main factors accounting for the total agricultural water footprint were population and per capita agricultural water footprint based on soil characteristics rodriguez et al 2015 used fertilizers for potato production to reduce the grey water footprint guo et al 2016 used an input output model to analyze embodied agricultural water trade and the awf in china their results showed that population urbanization water use efficiency internal industrial structure and external trade structure were the key factors influencing the chinese awf with remote sensing meteorological data and water balance applications yang et al 2016 concluded that in west liaohe plain china maize was an important part of agricultural water consumption and that the effects of maize sowing area on agricultural water consumption were associated with rainfall and groundwater recently ang 2004 2005 proposed the logarithmic mean divisia index lmdi because of its profound theoretical foundation and high adaptability the index has been extensively used and considered a valid research method it has the advantages of eliminating residuals handling 0 and negative value problems in decomposition calculations adapting cross sectional time series of data and performing non positive data processing gao and wang 2007 the lmdi has been widely used to quantitatively identify the effects of different factors on energy consumption chung et al 2011 wang et al 2014 timma et al 2016 dai and gao 2016 wang and li 2016 sun et al 2016 and to determine the factors that influence co2 emissions timilsina and shrestha 2009 wang et al 2013 cui et al 2016 in the netherlands and west germany de bruyn 1997 analyzed the so2 emissions from 1980 to 1990 based on decomposition analysis moreover the lmdi method has been applied to grain production liu et al 2013 liu et al 2016 li et al 2016 the identification of significant industrial pollutants huang 2009 lei et al 2012 geng et al 2014 tursun et al 2015 and an analysis of the factors that drove changes in the water footprint wf of crop production in beijing between 1978 and 2012 xu et al 2015 however the lmdi model has not been extensively utilized in the field of water resources liu and bai 2012 zhang et al 2014 and shang et al 2016 used the lmdi in analyses of industrial water consumption and zhang et al 2015 employed the model to determine the main reason for changes in total water consumption in urumqi china from 1995 to 2012 furthermore zhao and chen 2014 explored the chinese awf and adopted the lmdi to determine the underlying factors associated with agricultural water between 1990 and 2009 although many researchers have investigated the degree of influence of different factors through causative analysis few studies have used the lmdi method to examine the quantitative contribution of each driving factor to agricultural water use additionally the stage characteristics which are important for developing policies to control water resource pressures have not been appropriately identified therefore to fill these research gaps we investigated the quantitative contributions of different factors to agricultural water use by decomposing the factors into the crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin china the specific objectives of the present study are 1 to analyze the overall trend of agricultural water use and its driving factors in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin 2 to apply the lmdi method to quantitatively define and decompose the factors that influence agricultural water use and 3 to quantitatively explain the contribution of each influencing factor to agricultural water use in different periods finally based on the results some suggestions are presented to improve policies and mitigate agricultural water use in a desirable way 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the heihe river basin is the second largest inland river basin in northwest china and is located in the middle of the hexi corridor fig 1 yingluoxia and zhengyixia divide the heihe river channel into the upper reach middle reach and lower reach the length of the middle river reach is 206 km the mean annual precipitation in the heihe river basin is 116 mm and the mean annual reference evapotranspiration can reach 1074 mm consequently there is a shortage of water resources in the basin the middle reaches of the heihe river basin comprise five counties or districts of zhangye city and the region is suitable for agricultural production due to the abundant solar thermal resources and flat topography therefore water is a key factor for agricultural development and ecosystem sustainability the crop planting scale in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin accounts for 95 of the total cultivated area and it is one of the top ten chinese regions for grain production here 94 of water resources are for agricultural water use of which 89 of the water is for irrigation purposes gansu province bureau of statistics 2015 in this study three counties districts including ganzhou linze and gaotai in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin comprised the study area the principal crops in the area are maize wheat fruit trees vegetables and oil bearing crops while other crops include maize for seed potato and cotton 2 2 data description the period from 1991 to 2015 is used for the decomposition analysis in this study to ensure ecological water use in the downstream region in 2001 the state council passed the heihe water diversion scheme whereby zhangye city must guarantee the amount of water to be released by conserving water and adjusting the economic structure to meet the water diversion target in 2002 zhangye city was chosen by the ministry of water resources as the first pilot city for developing a water saving society in china under the influence of the policy several changes have been made in agricultural water use to facilitate the analysis the duration is divided into two sub periods 1991 2001 and 2002 2015 which correspond to the new agricultural policy issued by the chinese government agricultural water use is calculated based on the following intrinsic factors crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency as such these factors were chosen as the impact factors for analyzing changes in agricultural water use the crop planting scale is the total area of all kinds of crops the cropping pattern is the proportion of the area of crop i to the crop planting scale crop area data for the middle reaches of the heihe river basin were obtained from the zhangye city statistical year book for the period 1991 2015 optimizing the planting scale and cropping pattern can fully tap the potential of agricultural water saving and ensure agricultural development the irrigation quota is the amount of water irrigated per unit area during crop growth and it is affected by climate change which influences crop water demand the irrigation quota data for wheat maize and oil bearing crops were taken from the zhangye city water resources management annual report and the irrigation quotas for vegetables fruit trees and other crops were estimated according to the ratio between the actual net irrigation water use and the crop planting area irrigation efficiency represents the efficiency of using irrigation water for crop use and is calculated as the product of water conveyance efficiency and water application efficiency water saving projects can affect the irrigation efficiency by improving irrigation facilities water conveyance methods and irrigation methods to reduce irrigation water losses thereby reducing agricultural water use the water conveyance efficiency and water application efficiency were extracted from the zhangye city water resources management annual report 2 3 decomposition of agricultural water use the index decomposition analysis method is used to analyze agricultural water use in the middle reach of the heihe river basin the basic idea of this approach is to decompose the target values into several main influencing factors based on mathematical identity transformation sinton and levine 1994 de bruyn 1997 the kaya identity is employed to evaluate the effects of driving factors that led to dramatic changes in total agricultural water use four factors were assumed in this study the crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency the index decomposition analysis of water use can be given by the following equations 1 w t σ i w i t σ i a t a i t i i t e t σ i a t a i t i i t c t 2 e t e c t e a t 100 3 e c t w f t w s t 100 4 e a t w c t w f t 100 where w t m3 denotes the total agricultural water use in year t w i t m3 is the agricultural water use of crop i in year t a t hm2 is the crop planting scale in year t a i t is the cropping pattern of crop i in year t i i t is the irrigation quota of crop i in year t e t is the irrigation efficiency in year t and c t 1 e t e c t is the water conveyance efficiency in year t e a t is the water application efficiency in year t w f t is the water delivered to the field in year t w s t m3 is the water diverted from the source in year t and w c t m3 is the water available for crop use in year t the lmdi is divided into multiplicative decomposition and additive decomposition both of which are equally valid and can be transformed into each other in contrast to the multiplicative case the decomposition results of the additive case are given as physical units rather than indexes making them easy to use and interpret in this way additive decomposition is used to decompose the agricultural water use the effects of the four factors that contribute to changes in agricultural water use over t years are represented by δ w a δ w a δ w i and δ w c the total change in agricultural water use from the base year to year t is as follows 5 δ w t o t w t w 0 δ w a δ w a δ w i δ w c where δ w t o t is the total change in agricultural water use w t and w 0 are the agricultural water used in years t and 0 respectively in the study area δ w a is the change in agricultural water use caused by changes in the crop planting scale δ w a is the change in agricultural water use caused by adjusting the cropping pattern δ w i is the change in agricultural water use caused by variations in irrigation quota and δ w c is the change in agricultural water use caused by improving the irrigation efficiency based on the additive decomposition model the general formulas for agricultural water decomposition can be summarized as follows 6 δ w a i w i t w i 0 ln w i t ln w i 0 ln a t a 0 7 δ w a i w i t w i 0 ln w i t ln w i 0 ln a i t a i 0 8 δ w i i w i t w i 0 ln w i t ln w i 0 ln i i t i i 0 9 δ w c i w i t w i 0 ln w i t ln w i 0 ln c t c 0 as shown in eqs 6 to 9 a positive value indicates that the factors increase agricultural water use by contrast a negative value indicates that the factors decrease agricultural water use 3 results and discussion 3 1 changes in agricultural water use and their driving factors the agricultural water use crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency trends are shown in figs 2 to 6 as shown in fig 2 the overall trend of agricultural water use exhibited fluctuating growth in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin because of increases in the population and urbanization rate wu et al 2017 the total agricultural water use increased from 1 729 billion m3 in 1991 to 1 760 billion m3 in 2015 an increase of 0 031 billion m3 or growth of 1 79 with the increased acreage of maize the water use associated with maize was the largest and increased significantly by 209 4 this increase was the main factor that led to the change in agricultural water use the portions of other crops were also notable and accounted for 23 17 of the total agricultural water use this percentage accounted for a significant portion of the increase in agricultural water use in the middle reaches other water uses accounted for percentages smaller than that those discussed above and remained stable therefore they had virtually no effect on the total change in water use fig 3 shows that the crop planting scale in the middle reaches increased by 95 2 from 1991 to 2015 in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the net benefits per unit area were higher for maize and other crops than for wheat therefore farmers may have planted more maize and other crops accordingly the scales of maize and other crops were increased while that of wheat was decreased significant changes in the crop pattern can be observed in fig 4 the planting proportion of maize decreased from 1991 to 2001 and increased from 2001 to 2015 and the planting proportion of wheat significantly decreased since 2001 the maize area for seed has increased and it has been classified as other crops thus there was an abrupt change in the proportions of other crops in 2001 the planting proportions of maize and other crops significantly increased and accounted for a substantial portion of the total planting area with trends similar to that of the total crop planting scale hence they were the most important driving factors of the crop planting scale in the middle reaches the changes in the rest of the crops in the areas were stable and the areas of some crops even decreased thus they had little effect on the irrigated area in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin fig 5 indicates that because of the influence of water saving technologies the planting of new low water crops and increased precipitation most irrigation quotas decreased especially those of fruit trees and vegetables the irrigation efficiency is also a principal component that influences the amount of agricultural water use in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin fig 6 shows that from 1991 to 1998 the irrigation efficiency changed unsteadily and annually increased to approximately 0 56 in 1998 from 1998 to 2001 due to channel aging and serious frost heave the irrigation efficiency decreased in 2002 the first pilot city for societal water savings was established in zhangye city by the ministry of water resources the government installed a high standard canal lining which led to an increase in the irrigation efficiency and improved water resource management 3 2 decomposition of the change in agricultural water use during 1991 2015 to investigate the annual contribution of each driving factor to agricultural water use in the middle reaches the relevant factors were decomposed using equations 1 to 9 the annual change in agricultural water use between 1991 and 2015 was determined based on the lmdi as shown in fig 7 the overall trend of agricultural water use exhibited fluctuating growth in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin notably it increased by 0 031 billion m3 between 1991 and 2015 as shown in fig 3 the crop planting scale expanded considerably leading to an increase in agricultural water use of 1 138 billion m3 this total volume accounted for a 3701 3 increase in water use the cropping pattern was the second largest driver of the increase in agricultural water use the proportions of maize and other crops dramatically increased and that of wheat decreased fig 4 however the irrigation quotas of maize and other crops were more substantial than that of wheat therefore the cropping pattern showed an increase in agricultural water use of 0 109 billion m3 accounting for a 354 69 increase in water use as shown in fig 5 the irrigation quotas of most crops decreased recently which decreased agricultural water use by 1 08 billion m3 this change contributed to a 3512 64 change in agricultural water use improvements in the irrigation efficiency mitigated water consumption by irrigation feng et al 2017 but this contribution was weaker than that associated with decreasing the irrigation quotas specifically the contribution of irrigation efficiency was 0 136 billion m3 accounting for a 443 49 decrease in agricultural water use therefore the changes in the crop planting scale and cropping pattern led to increases in agricultural water use with the crop planting scale accounting for the most predominant contribution in contrast the change in irrigation quotas and the irrigation efficiency decreased agricultural water use in particular the irrigation quotas had the largest effect on decreasing agricultural water use in general because the positive factors offset the negative factors total agricultural water use exhibited an increasing trend from 1991 to 2015 3 3 decomposition of the change in agricultural water use during 1991 2001 and 2002 2015 to study the staged trend of agricultural water use in the middle reaches of the basin the study period was divided into two stages i e 1991 2001 and 2002 2015 based on the above equations the contributors of all factors were calculated through the lmdi as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 fig 8 shows that agricultural water use increased by 0 069 billion m3 from 1991 to 2001 considering the influential factors it can be inferred that the crop planting scale and cropping pattern were the main factors that increased agricultural water use and the irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency decreased agricultural water use in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin the crop planting scale and irrigation quotas largely contributed to the change in agricultural water use with associated changes of approximately 0 302 billion m3 and 0 406 billion m3 respectively a detailed analysis of different crops showed that food crops including wheat and maize led to a decrease in agricultural water use wheat had the largest mitigating effect on water use with a contribution of approximately 0 243 billion m3 however cash crops including vegetables fruit trees and other crops except for oil bearing crops led to an increase in agricultural water use and other crops exhibited the most significant increase of 0 239 billion m3 specifically the crop planting scale of all types of crops should be controlled the effects of irrigation efficiency in wheat and the cropping pattern in vegetable fruit tree and other crops were 0 002 billion m3 0 141 billion m3 0 201 billion m3 and 0 262 billion m3 respectively which increased the agricultural water use the rest factors of crop decreased the agricultural water use finally the overall effect led to an increase in agricultural water use from 1991 to 2001 fig 9 shows that from 2002 to 2015 the agricultural water use in the study area decreased by 0 038 billion m3 a comparison of the four influential factors from 2002 to 2015 suggests that the crop planting scale and cropping pattern increased the agricultural water use specifically the contribution of the crop planting scale was 0 835 billion m3 and was more significant than that of the cropping pattern the irrigation quota and irrigation efficiency had mitigating effects on agricultural water use the contribution of irrigation quota i e 0 975 billion m3 was larger than that of the irrigation efficiency therefore the planting patterns and irrigation efficiency of crash crops played a relatively minor role in the decrease of agricultural water use in a detailed analysis of different crops it can be observed that maize increased the agricultural water use from 2002 to 2015 compared with that in 1991 2001 primarily due to the unreasonable cropping pattern the rest of crops were associated with decreases in agricultural water use in particular changes in fruit trees and other crops were the largest negative factors and these changes reduced agricultural water use by 0 282 billion m3 and 0 323 billion m3 respectively concretely the positive contribution of the crop planting scale has not decreased but rather increased dramatically the contribution of cropping pattern in maize and vegetables and the contribution of irrigation quota in oil bearing crops increased the agricultural water use the irrigation quota of vegetables fruit trees and other crops strongly reduced agricultural water use with contributions of 0 229 billion m3 0 247 billion m3 and 0 492 billion m3 respectively consequently the agricultural water use decreased from 2002 to 2015 zhangye is a well known commodity grain base in china in the early 21 st century given the economic development and intense population growth there has been higher demand for grain driven by the high benefits of maize for seed its planting area has expanded therefore the crop planting scale has expanded dramatically in recent years the precipitation in zhangye has increased coupled with the heihe water diversion scheme and the construction of a water saving society new crop varieties and new irrigation technologies have been popularized thus the irrigation quotas in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin have been significantly reduced as a result a comparison of the periods 1991 to 2001 and 2002 to 2015 indicates that the contributions to increasing the crop planting scale and the decrease in the irrigation quota were more dramatic in the latter than in the former furthermore the negative contributions of irrigation quota in cash crops and the negative contribution of irrigation efficiency in both food crops and cash crops have clearly improved compared to those in 1991 to 2001 this is due to the issue of water saving policy improvement in water saving technology and the change of citizen s lifestyle et al overall the modeling approach presented is proved to be reasonable 4 conclusions and recommendations understanding the driving forces of agriculture water use is essential for policy formulation and decomposition analysis is a useful approach for quantitatively determining changes in the predetermined factors that influence agricultural water use this study analyzes the overall trends of agricultural water use and the lmdi method is applied as an innovative measure to quantitatively determine the main driving factors of the agricultural water use of different crops in different time periods the driving factors of agricultural water use can be decomposed into crop planting scale cropping pattern irrigation quotas and irrigation efficiency these categories can allow us to further explore the inherent mechanisms influencing agricultural water use the conclusions regarding agricultural water use in the middle reaches of the heihe river basin correspond with the conditions of the location overall the modeling approach presented has proven to be both reasonable and convincing and it can therefore be utilized in other regions of the world considering the great agricultural water saving potential of crop planting scale and cropping pattern the government should control the crop planting scale within a reasonable range and should consider reducing the proportion of maize and vegetables at present the contribution of irrigation efficiency is not notable therefore the government should take measures such as increasing capital investment in agricultural irrigation facilities planting new crop varieties and installing high quality canal linings this study can provide a scientific basis for farmers and government officials to select crops and formulate policies which play important roles in guiding actual production although thorough evaluations have been performed based on these factors further studies are recommended to determine the reasonable range of the crop planting area and to adjust the cropping pattern to effectively reduce agricultural water use acknowledgments we are grateful for the grant support from the national key

663 645 and 470 nm using a uv 160 a uv vis recording spectrometer shimadzu kyoto japan relative water content rwc was estimated according to hayat et al 2007 and calculated using the following formula r w c f m d m t m d m 100 where fm is the fresh mass tm is the turgid mass and dm is the dry mass membrane stability index msi was measured using the method of premchandra et al 1990 and calculated by the following equation where msi is the membrane stability index c1 is the electrical conductivity of the solution at 40 c and c2 is the electrical conductivity of the solution at100 c shoots fresh of plants were weighed and then placed in an oven at 70 2 c till a constant weight to measure their dry weights 2 5 sorghum yields seeds and forage and harvest index hi at harvesting ten guarded plants were taken at random from each plot and used to measure averages of the forage yield numbers of leaves plant height and seeds as well as harvest index hi seeds of all plants per plot were used to determine seed yield per hectare and 100 seed were weighted hi was determined as a ratio of seed yield to total biomass production on a dry mass basis 2 6 water use efficiencies water use efficiencies wue were calculated as i the ratio between above ground biomass and crop evapotranspiration i e forage wue f wue and ii the ratio between seed yield and crop evapotranspiration i e seed wue s wue 2 7 statistical analysis the collected data during the two years of experimental work were analyzed according to a split split plot arrangement in a randomized complete block design statistical analysis was performed through the glm procedure of gen stat the least significant difference lsd at 0 05 and 0 01 probability level was used as mean separation test 3 results and discussion 3 1 metrological conditions and volume of irrigation water applied the main weather parameters including air temperature relative humidity class a pan evaporation and wind speed were collected from a standard agro meteorological station located about 10 km from the experimental field the weather regime during two experimental seasons was shown in table 1 maximum daily temperature as average for two seasons was 38 45 c minimum daily temperature night was 23 32 45 c while air relative humidity was usually 38 68 the total amount of irrigation volumes applied as average for two years were 671 15 570 48 and 496 81 mm for well irrigated control 100 of etc moderate stress 85 of etc and severe water stress 70 of etc respectively 3 2 effect of organic compost oc application rates on some physical and chemical properties table 4 show the effect of c application on soil physico chemical of the studied soil the obtained results reflect that soil electrical conductivity ece and soil ph values decrease significantly p 0 05 with increasing oc level this attributed could be to the accumulation of active organic acids and the cation exchange capacity cec of oc which led to a reduction in soil ph values in addition the reduced ph of the oc 7 26 table 2 contributed to decrease the soil ph the reduction of ece values probably due to the occurrence of the charged sites i e coo accounts for the ability of organic compost oc to chelate and retain cation in non active forms addition of oc15 15 t ha 1 or oc30 30 t ha 1 to the soil significantly increased soil organic matter content compared with control treatment oc0 also data in table 4 show a gradual decrease in soil bulk values with increasing oc level where the highest level 30 t ha 1 gave the lowest soil bulk density value 1 39 g cm 3 this positive effect could be refer to the pronounced content of organic colloidal particles which plays an great role in modifying distribution pattern of pore spaces in the soil these findings are in agreement with those obtained by semida et al 2014 and abd el mageed and semida 2015b who mentioned that bulk density was closely linked to solid phase properties and pore spaces applied of oc possesses a positive effect for soil bulk density i e reduced its value therefore it leads to increase the total porosity of the soil in addition integrative application of oc15 or oc30 further increased soil water properties by 12 and 20 3 for water holding pores whp 8 5 and 14 6 for useful pores 2 9 and 6 4 for total porosity 12 2 and 17 9 for field capacity 17 and 26 for available water as compared with control oc0 the above mentioned case is more attributed to an increase in soil moisture content at field capacity table 4 however the addition of oc to soil encouraged the creation of medium and micro pores i e water holding capacity and useful pores between simple packing sand particles and in turn increasing capillary potential such organic substances of compost have high ability to retain a pronounced content of water askar et al 1994 these results are emphasized by cheng et al 1998 and rady et al 2016b who reported that active organic acids decreased the loss of soil moisture and in turn enhanced the water retention 3 3 leaf photosynthetic pigments table 6 report decreases content of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and total carotenoids in sorghum leaves as a result of water stress these photosynthetic pigment components were significantly reduced gradually with the gradual increase in di for both seasons however application of organic compost and mulching have been shown to increase leaf photosynthetic pigment concentration except for some fluctuations in both seasons m oc15 or oc30 i100 m oc15 or oc30 i85 or m oc15 or oc30 i70 treatment significantly increased the concentration of leaf photosynthetic pigments compared to i100 i80 or i60 treatment respectively the m oc15 or oc30 i70 treatment generated sorghum plants with the highest values of the leaf photosynthetic pigments at the concentration of which plants can overcome drought stress inhibition of photosynthesis in sorghum plants caused by water stress in our study could be due to the decreased content of chlorophylls and carotenoids table 6 the reduction in chlorophyll content due to osmotic stress has been ascribed to the strong damage and loss of chloroplast membranes kaiser et al 1981 the decrease in photosynthetic performance under water stress has also been observed by ben ahmed et al 2009 and habibi 2012 compost could have favored leaf growth and a new sink developed which would reduce soluble carbohydrates isopp et al 2000 rady et al 2016a 3 3 plant growth characteristics plant height cm number of leaves plant 1 leaf area plant 1 dm2 stem diameter cm and shoot dry weight plant 1 g were statistically analyzed as shown in table 5 all this traits were highly significant affected by irrigation quantity soil mulching and organic compost except shoot dry weight in second season all growth attributes were not significantly affected by interaction between organic compost and both irrigation and mulching treatments the highest values of all traits had been recorded when sorghum plants were subjected to full irrigation i100 and received 30 t ha 1 of organic compost oc30 and mulched with 10 t ha 1 of rice straw as average for two seasons however the lowest values were obtained under water deficit conditions i70 combined with 0 t ha 1 organic compost oc0 and with unmulched 0 t ha 1 treatment organic compost oc applications had clear effect on plant growth and biomass production the improved growth attributes of sorghum plants produced as a result of increased application rate of oc could be attributed to the increase decomposition of the oc and mineralization of nutrients ojo et al 2014 in addition the suggestion that oc has an effective role on metabolic of soil biota as soon as the dynamic of uptake of soil nutrients and physical soil properties reflecting in an enhancement of plant growth and productivity semida et al 2014 ouni et al 2014 and rady et al 2016b plant height stem diameter leaf area plant 1 and shoot dry weight plant 1 g were significantly p 0 05 decreased under stressed treatment however organic compost oc mulching influence on yield were more important under deficit irrigation conditions results indicated that dry matter of plant was negatively affected by deficit irrigation moreover dry weight of the whole plant as well as that of individual plants was higher in the control 100 of etc than i85 or i70 of etc this results also in agreement also with those obtained by wolka and melaku 2015 and mukhlis et al 2017 3 5 canopy temperature canopy temperature estimations are an important process and it is conceder a good indicator for plant water status monitoring when plants are undergoing drought stress the conductance of water through stomata on leaves decreases when water supply becomes limited to the plant roots and canopy temperature will be increased in this concern olivo et al 2009 reported that canopy temperature relative to ambient temperature changes as a result of stomatal conductance control of plant transpiration moreover transpiration decreases and plant temperature may exceed air temperature if plant water stress increases on the other hand well water plants will have canopy temperatures tc less than ambient air temperature ta particularly when vapour pressure deficit vpd is not greater than 4 kpa canopy temperature might increase 6 8 c tc ta table 7 under i70 and at flowering stage of sorghum compared to the well irrigated plants i100 the canopy temperature of plants was significantly and negatively correlated with seed yield linear with r2 0 92 in si 2016 and 0 78 in sii 2017 seasons fig 1 similar to what has been reported for other crops zhang et al 2007 rice reynolds et al 2001 wheat and abd el mageed et al 2016 for squash the results in table 5 reveal that lower irrigation quantity or sever di i70 would cause larger canopy air ambient temperature tc ta difference at the flowering stage and lead to lower seed yield therefore the canopy temperature of sorghum is closely correlated to the water quantity and could be used to monitor crop water status and would be regarded as one of the determinants for reasonable irrigation and drought analysis data in table 7 show that the canopy temperature was lower than air temperature and the irrigation treatment significantly affected on canopy temperature for both growing seasons turner et al 1986 and abd el mgeed and semida 2015a results in table 7 show that canopy air temperature differential tc ta at flowering was significantly affected by mulch treatments under m canopy air temperature tc ta was significantly decreased compared to with m in si 2016 and sii 2017 years table 7 these attributes may be due to an increases in soil moisture content at field capacity and then available water content increased under mulching debashis et al 2008 abd el mgeed et al 2016 3 6 relative water content rwc and membrane stability index msi responses of rwc and msi of sorghum plants for irrigation mulching and organic compost are presented in table 6 statistical analysis carried out on rwc and msi revealed a significant difference p 0 05 or and p 0 01 between irrigation mulching and organic compost treatments rwc and msi values were decreased with increasing of water stress the greatest values of rwc and msi 82 5 and 23 1 were obtained under 100 of etc compared to 71 85 and 18 1 70 of etc as the average for both seasons as compared to the control treatment oc0 0 t ha 1 plants treated by either 15 or 30 t oc h 1 revealed a significant increase p 0 05 or p 0 01 in dehydration tolerance in terms of increased rwc and msi table 6 the same trends were observed in both seasons the best results of these parameters were obtained under application of oc30 m i100 of etc according to sinclair and ludlow 1986 rwc is considered as a measure of plant water status and reflecting the metabolic activity in plant tissues application of higher rates of oc improved rwc and msi rady et al 2016a a relationship was observed between rwc and plant biomass dry weight under the interactive effect of water levels oc and m indicating that the water status in sorghum leaves is basically dependent on the respective shoot biomass table 5 according to kabir et al 2004 and rady et al 2016b plants having greater biomass can maintain higher water content in leaf leading to more tolerance to drought 3 7 harvest index forage and seed yields exhibited data in tables 7 and 8 illustrate that harvest index hi 100 seed weight g forage and seed yields t ha 1 were significantly affected by the irrigation quantity mulching and organic compost applications table 7 show that hi was significantly affected p 0 05 by the irrigation level and the greatest values were recorded under full irrigated treatment and they were 0 15 and 0 20 for si and sii respectively on the other hand the lowest values were recorded under i70 0 14 and 0 18 for si and sii the effects of mulching on hi was not significantly affected in first year si 2016 while it was significant in the second year sii 2017 concerning the effects of oc on hi results in table 7 show that the values of hi were significantly affected p 0 05 by oc rates and the heights were obtained under oc30 0 16 for si and 0 20 for sii moreover the highest hi was recorded when sorghum plants were subjected to full irrigation i100 and received 30 t ha 1 of oc and mulched with 10 t ha 1 for both seasons data in table 7 indicate that hi value was significantly affected by the interactions between oc rates m and irrigation level in two seasons the obtained results are found to be in agreement also with those obtained by ofosu anim and leitch 2009 and abdel mageed et al 2016 results presented in table 8 show that the values of 100 seed weight seed yield sy and forage yields fy were significantly affected by irrigation mulching and organic compost application the highest sy and fy 7 1 and 40 1 t ha 1 values were recorded under m 10 t ha 1 compared to 6 45 and 35 69 t ha 1 unmulched treatment m 0 t ha 1 as the average for both seasons this result is in line with that of abd el wahed and ali 2013 and abd el mageed et al 2016 they reported that the average of yields of maize and squash for mulched treatment were increased than unmulched treatment data introduced in tables 8 and 9 show that sy and fy values were significantly affected by the irrigation quantity the highest sy and fy 7 15 and 41 02 t ha 1 values were obtained under 100 of etc compared to 6 3 and 36 26 t ha 1 under 70 of etc as the average for both seasons 2016 and 2017 respectively these results are in agreement with those of amer 2011 regarding the effect of organic compost oc on sy and fy values obtained in table 8 show that sy and fy were significantly affected by the organic compost level application the average sy and fy values of oc30 7 8 and 41 41 t ha 1 were increased by 25 1 and 11 45 than those of oc0 6 2 and 37 16 t ha 1 for sy and fy respectively a similar trend was reported by abd el wahed and ali 2013 they added that this result is logic since the same treatment gained the highest seed yield which compensated the i100 the relationship between iwa and sy was curvilinear polynomial of 2nd order fig 2 and it could be expressed as follows sy 6e 07 x i wa2 0 0069 x iwa 13 84 r2 1 for si 2016 sy 1e 07x iwa2 0 0013 x iwa 2 26 r2 1 for sii 2017 where sy is the seed yield t ha 1 and iwa is irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 also the relationship between iwa and fy fig 3 could be expressed as follows fy 2e 06 iwa2 0 0226 iwa 31 26 r2 1 for si 2016 fy 7e 07 iwa2 0 009 iwa 11 32 r2 1 for si 2017 where fy is the forage yield t ha 1 and iwa is irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 data in table 8 indicated that fy was not significantly affected by the interactions between compost rates mulching and irrigation level in two seasons in contrast sy was significantly affected by the interactions between the tested treatments in both seasons 3 8 seed and forage water use efficiencies s wue and f wue results in table 8 demonstrate that s wue and f wue values were significantly affected by mulching irrigation and organic compost treatments as an average for two seasons the highest s wue and f wue 1 25 and 7 17 kg m 3 values were recorded under m 10 t ha 1 compared to 1 15 and 7 01 kg m 3 unmulched treatment m 0 t ha 1 this result due to the sorghum seed and forage yields obtained under m treatment 7 1 and 40 1 t ha 1 were higher than the corresponding sorghum yields seed and forage obtained under m treatment 6 45 and 35 69 t ha 1 by 10 1 and 12 4 under the same amount of irrigation water applied as average for two seasons table 8 the result is in line with that of kar and kumar 2007 abd el wahed and ali 2013 and abd el mageed et al 2016 they reported that the average of wue values of maize and squash for mulched treatment were increased than unmulched treatment table 8 show that s wue and f wue values were significantly affected by the irrigation quantity the highest s wue and f wue 1 35 and 8 0 m 3 values were obtained under i70 compared to 1 05 and 6 2 kg m 3 under i100 in both seasons respectively these results are in agreement with those of abd el mageed et al 2016 regarding the effect of organic compost oc on s wue and f wue table 8 show that s wue and f wue values were significantly affected by the organic compost application the average s wue and f wue values of oc30 7 8 and 41 41 t ha 1 were increased by 25 1 and 11 45 than those of oc0 6 2 and 37 16 t ha 1 for s wue and f wue respectively a similar trend was reported by abd el wahed and ali 2013 they added that this result is logic since the same treatment gained the highest grain yield which compensated the i100 as presented in fig 3 the relationship between iwa and s wue was curvilinear polynomial of 2nd order and it could be expressed as follows s wue 5e 08 iwa2 0 0007x iwa 3 555 r2 1 for si 2016 s wue

was significantly affected by the interactions between the tested treatments in both seasons 3 9 conclusion exposure of sorghum plants to drought stress resulted in decreases in plant growth attributes msi rwc leaf photosynthetic pigments harvest index seed and forage yields and increase canopy temperature overall the present study reflected that oc and m application could overcome the adverse effects of water stress by increasing plant water status chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b and enhancing plant growth and water use efficiencies in this instance oc appeared to be a viable substitute to decrease soil salinity ece soil ph and soil bulk density and increase field capacity water holding pores useful pores total porosity and soil organic matter content consequently oc and m application enhanced plant growth productivity water use efficiencies s wue and f wue results indicated that oc of 15 t ha 1 and 30 t ha 1 significantly p 0 05 increased seed yield by 5 6 and 25 8 also the forage yield increased by 8 7 and 11 45 with respect to control oc0 0 t ha 1 moreover soil mulching 10 t ha 1 increased sy and fy by 9 3 and 12 3 compared to unmulched treatment m 0 t ha 1 depending on the results of the present work it could be stated that the treatment i100 oc30 m10 is the most suitable for producing high sorghum yields under the conditions of the study area under limited irrigation water application of i85 oc30 m10 treatment was found to be favorable to save 15 of the applied irrigation water providing the same sorghum crop yields under newly reclaimed soil the combined practice of deficit irrigation and organic compost mulching with rice straw appears to be very promising in maximizing crop water productivity 
11393,supplying organic compost and mulching could be a practical solution to alleviate the negative effects of water stress on sorghum bicolor l moench in newly reclaimed soils for this purpose two field experiments were conducted during 2016 and 2017 seasons this investigation was conducted as split split experiments based on randomized complete blocks design with organic compost oc as a soil amendment at three levels 0 15 and 30 t ha 1 rice straw as a soil mulching m at two levels 0 and 10 t ha 1 and soil moisture at three levels 100 85 and 70 of etc using three replications sorghum yields forage and seed and forage and seed water use efficiencies f wue and s wue were significantly p 0 05 affected by irrigation quantity and by both compost and mulching application plant growth e i plant height shoot dry and leaf area leaf photosynthetic pigments plant water status canopy temperature relative water content rwc and harvest index hi were also significantly p 0 05 affected in two seasons the highest yields 41 41 and 7 8 t ha 1 for forage and seed yields as the average for both seasons were recorded under full irrigation 10 t ha 1 of m and 30 10 t ha 1 of oc it can be concluded that organic compost and soil mulching improved significantly seed and forage yield production under deficit irrigation conditions the results indicate that under scarcity water application of i85 oc30 m10 treatment was found to be favorable to save 15 of the applied irrigation water to produce not only the same yields approximately but also to save more of water as compared to i100 keywords sorghum moisture regimes wue plant water status morpho physiological attributes 1 introduction sorghum sorghum bicolor l moench is the fifth most important cereal crop in the world after wheat maize rice and barley fao stat 2012 sorghum is an important annual cereal crop grown for both grain and palatable green forage production additionally to sorghum as a food crop there are possibilities of other alternative uses of sorghum such as feed for dairy animals novel foods industrial uses processed foods starch beverages and ethanol taylor et al 2006 fresh water scarcity has become a worldwide serious problem especially in arid and semi arid area where irrigation is essential for crop production wei et al 2016 agricultural irrigation is vital to food production in many parts of the globe and a critical tool for ensuring food security liang et al 2016 more than 80 of water resources have been exploited for agricultural irrigation wang et al 2011 egypt in figures 2015 therefore it is necessary to develop strategies to optimize the efficiency of water use while maintaining the quantity and quality of the production pereira et al 2012 and nangare et al 2016 recently the challenge of irrigated agriculture is how to produce more crops from the limited water supply one way of tackling this challenge is the adoption of practices that help to improve water management especially at the field level the combined practice of deficit irrigation strategy topak et al 2016 mulching and organic matter appears to be very promising in achieving this goal abd el mageed and semida 2015a abd el mageed et al 2016 deficit irrigation di is commonly applied method in arid and semi arid regions to increase water productivity and water saving badal et al 2013 ballester et al 2014 and shahrokhnia and sepaskhah 2016 and defined as the application of water below full crop water requirements it is an important tool to achieve the goal of reducing irrigation water use fereres and soriano 2007 di aims to increase wue by eliminating irrigation events that have little impact on yield however this application can also have other benefits related with reducing the energy used during irrigations and decreasing nitrate leaching maximizing the competitiveness of the agricultural sector falagán et al 2015 reducing production costs and water consumption pulupol et al 1996 combine practice of deficit irrigation organic compost and mulching appear to be very promising among the water management practices for increasing wue especially at field scale mulching involves the use of organic materials or inorganic materials to the soil surface to provide one or several ecosystem services such as enriching or protecting the soil preventing pest establishment or enhancing crop yield quintanilla tornel et al 2016 mulching is a useful practice with the potential of reducing evaporation conserving moisture modifying soil temperature and improving aeration as well as releasing nutrients in the soil profile sharma et al 2005 ahmad et al 2007 dabney et al 2001 liu et al 2012 li et al 2013 straw mulch can conserve soil water and decrease temperature because it increases residue accumulation and reduces soil disturbance on the soil surface baumhardt and jones 2002 zhang et al 2011 and yaseen et al 2014 zhang et al 2005 and abd el wahed et al 2017 found that mulching with straw reduced soil evaporation loss and increased wue and grain yield organic matter inputs through organic amendments in addition to improve soil aggregation supplying nutrients and stimulate microbial diversity and activity carpenter boggs et al 2000 adding organic matter particularly compost increases soil water holding capacity under water deficit hirich et al 2014 numerous investigations were done on various crops to study the effect of the organic amendment on water holding capacity of soils and especially under arid and semi arid conditions and indicating that organic matter input improved field capacity fc soil water content ɵ and increased soil hydraulic conductivity ouattara et al 2006 wesseling et al 2009 organic matter combination in the soil has also a positive effect on plant growth productivity and yield ibrahim et al 2008 gopinath and mina 2011 supplying organic matter to the soil will improve the soil content nutrients after mineralization of the organic matter and will increase the availability of nutrients for plants subsequently the uptake of nutrients will be increased and the growth and productivity of plants will be improved hartley et al 2010 no studies have been conducted on the combined effects of mulch organic compost and deficit irrigation on sorghum production therefore this study was carried out in order to determine how organic compost and mulching improve sorghum productivity and growth under deficit irrigation and the combined effect of deficit irrigation mulching and organic compost on morphological physiological responses and plant water status of sorghum 2 methodology 2 1 experimental location two successive field experiments were conducted in summer growing seasons of 2016 and 2017 at the fayoum university

significantly p 0 05 with increasing oc level this attributed could be to the accumulation of active organic acids and the cation exchange capacity cec of oc which led to a reduction in soil ph values in addition the reduced ph of the oc 7 26 table 2 contributed to decrease the soil ph the reduction of ece values probably due to the occurrence of the charged sites i e coo accounts for the ability of organic compost oc to chelate and retain cation in non active forms addition of oc15 15 t ha 1 or oc30 30 t ha 1 to the soil significantly increased soil organic matter content compared with control treatment oc0 also data in table 4 show a gradual decrease in soil bulk values with increasing oc level where the highest level 30 t ha 1 gave the lowest soil bulk density value 1 39 g cm 3 this positive effect could be refer to the pronounced content of organic colloidal particles which plays an great role in modifying distribution pattern of pore spaces in the soil these findings are in agreement with those obtained by semida et al 2014 and abd el mageed and semida 2015b who mentioned that bulk density was closely linked to solid phase properties and pore spaces applied of oc possesses a positive effect for soil bulk density i e reduced its value therefore it leads to increase the total porosity of the soil in addition integrative application of oc15 or oc30 further increased soil water properties by 12 and 20 3 for water holding pores whp 8 5 and 14 6 for useful pores 2 9 and 6 4 for total porosity 12 2 and 17 9 for field capacity 17 and 26 for available water as compared with control oc0 the above mentioned case is more attributed to an increase in soil moisture content at field capacity table 4 however the addition of oc to soil encouraged the creation of medium and micro pores i e water holding capacity and useful pores between simple packing sand particles and in turn increasing capillary potential such organic substances of compost have high ability to retain a pronounced content of water askar et al 1994 these results are emphasized by cheng et al 1998 and rady et al 2016b who reported that active organic acids decreased the loss of soil moisture and in turn enhanced the water retention 3 3 leaf photosynthetic pigments table 6 report decreases content of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and total carotenoids in sorghum leaves as a result of water stress these photosynthetic pigment components were significantly reduced gradually with the gradual increase in di for both seasons however application of organic compost and mulching have been shown to increase leaf photosynthetic pigment concentration except for some fluctuations in both seasons m oc15 or oc30 i100 m oc15 or oc30 i85 or m oc15 or oc30 i70 treatment significantly increased the concentration of leaf photosynthetic pigments compared to i100 i80 or i60 treatment respectively the m oc15 or oc30 i70 treatment generated sorghum plants with the highest values of the leaf photosynthetic pigments at the concentration of which plants can overcome drought stress inhibition of photosynthesis in sorghum plants caused by water stress in our study could be due to the decreased content of chlorophylls and carotenoids table 6 the reduction in chlorophyll content due to osmotic stress has been ascribed to the strong damage and loss of chloroplast membranes kaiser et al 1981 the decrease in photosynthetic performance under water stress has also been observed by ben ahmed et al 2009 and habibi 2012 compost could have favored leaf growth and a new sink developed which would reduce soluble carbohydrates isopp et al 2000 rady et al 2016a 3 3 plant growth characteristics plant height cm number of leaves plant 1 leaf area plant 1 dm2 stem diameter cm and shoot dry weight plant 1 g were statistically analyzed as shown in table 5 all this traits were highly significant affected by irrigation quantity soil mulching and organic compost except shoot dry weight in second season all growth attributes were not significantly affected by interaction between organic compost and both irrigation and mulching treatments the highest values of all traits had been recorded when sorghum plants were subjected to full irrigation i100 and received 30 t ha 1 of organic compost oc30 and mulched with 10 t ha 1 of rice straw as average for two seasons however the lowest values were obtained under water deficit conditions i70 combined with 0 t ha 1 organic compost oc0 and with unmulched 0 t ha 1 treatment organic compost oc applications had clear effect on plant growth and biomass production the improved growth attributes of sorghum plants produced as a result of increased application rate of oc could be attributed to the increase decomposition of the oc and mineralization of nutrients ojo et al 2014 in addition the suggestion that oc has an effective role on metabolic of soil biota as soon as the dynamic of uptake of soil nutrients and physical soil properties reflecting in an enhancement of plant growth and productivity semida et al 2014 ouni et al 2014 and rady et al 2016b plant height stem diameter leaf area plant 1 and shoot dry weight plant 1 g were significantly p 0 05 decreased under stressed treatment however organic compost oc mulching influence on yield were more important under deficit irrigation conditions results indicated that dry matter of plant was negatively affected by deficit irrigation moreover dry weight of the whole plant as well as that of individual plants was higher in the control 100 of etc than i85 or i70 of etc this results also in agreement also with those obtained by wolka and melaku 2015 and mukhlis et al 2017 3 5 canopy temperature canopy temperature estimations are an important process and it is conceder a good indicator for plant water status monitoring when plants are undergoing drought stress the conductance of water through stomata on leaves decreases when water supply becomes limited to the plant roots and canopy temperature will be increased in this concern olivo et al 2009 reported that canopy temperature relative to ambient temperature changes as a result of stomatal conductance control of plant transpiration moreover transpiration decreases and plant temperature may exceed air temperature if plant water stress increases on the other hand well water plants will have canopy temperatures tc less than ambient air temperature ta particularly when vapour pressure deficit vpd is not greater than 4 kpa canopy temperature might increase 6 8 c tc ta table 7 under i70 and at flowering stage of sorghum compared to the well irrigated plants i100 the canopy temperature of plants was significantly and negatively correlated with seed yield linear with r2 0 92 in si 2016 and 0 78 in sii 2017 seasons fig 1 similar to what has been reported for other crops zhang et al 2007 rice reynolds et al 2001 wheat and abd el mageed et al 2016 for squash the results in table 5 reveal that lower irrigation quantity or sever di i70 would cause larger canopy air ambient temperature tc ta difference at the flowering stage and lead to lower seed yield therefore the canopy temperature of sorghum is closely correlated to the water quantity and could be used to monitor crop water status and would be regarded as one of the determinants for reasonable irrigation and drought analysis data in table 7 show that the canopy temperature was lower than air temperature and the irrigation treatment significantly affected on canopy temperature for both growing seasons turner et al 1986 and abd el mgeed and semida 2015a results in table 7 show that canopy air temperature differential tc ta at flowering was significantly affected by mulch treatments under m canopy air temperature tc ta was significantly decreased compared to with m in si 2016 and sii 2017 years table 7 these attributes may be due to an increases in soil moisture content at field capacity and then available water content increased under mulching debashis et al 2008 abd el mgeed et al 2016 3 6 relative water content rwc and membrane stability index msi responses of rwc and msi of sorghum plants for irrigation mulching and organic compost are presented in table 6 statistical analysis carried out on rwc and msi revealed a significant difference p 0 05 or and p 0 01 between irrigation mulching and organic compost treatments rwc and msi values were decreased with increasing of water stress the greatest values of rwc and msi 82 5 and 23 1 were obtained under 100 of etc compared to 71 85 and 18 1 70 of etc as the average for both seasons as compared to the control treatment oc0 0 t ha 1 plants treated by either 15 or 30 t oc h 1 revealed a significant increase p 0 05 or p 0 01 in dehydration tolerance in terms of increased rwc and msi table 6 the same trends were observed in both seasons the best results of these parameters were obtained under application of oc30 m i100 of etc according to sinclair and ludlow 1986 rwc is considered as a measure of plant water status and reflecting the metabolic activity in plant tissues application of higher rates of oc improved rwc and msi rady et al 2016a a relationship was observed between rwc and plant biomass dry weight under the interactive effect of water levels oc and m indicating that the water status in sorghum leaves is basically dependent on the respective shoot biomass table 5 according to kabir et al 2004 and rady et al 2016b plants having greater biomass can maintain higher water content in leaf leading to more tolerance to drought 3 7 harvest index forage and seed yields exhibited data in tables 7 and 8 illustrate that harvest index hi 100 seed weight g forage and seed yields t ha 1 were significantly affected by the irrigation quantity mulching and organic compost applications table 7 show that hi was significantly affected p 0 05 by the irrigation level and the greatest values were recorded under full irrigated treatment and they were 0 15 and 0 20 for si and sii respectively on the other hand the lowest values were recorded under i70 0 14 and 0 18 for si and sii the effects of mulching on hi was not significantly affected in first year si 2016 while it was significant in the second year sii 2017 concerning the effects of oc on hi results in table 7 show that the values of hi were significantly affected p 0 05 by oc rates and the heights were obtained under oc30 0 16 for si and 0 20 for sii moreover the highest hi was recorded when sorghum plants were subjected to full irrigation i100 and received 30 t ha 1 of oc and mulched with 10 t ha 1 for both seasons data in table 7 indicate that hi value was significantly affected by the interactions between oc rates m and irrigation level in two seasons the obtained results are found to be in agreement also with those obtained by ofosu anim and leitch 2009 and abdel mageed et al 2016 results presented in table 8 show that the values of 100 seed weight seed yield sy and forage yields fy were significantly affected by irrigation mulching and organic compost application the highest sy and fy 7 1 and 40 1 t ha 1 values were recorded under m 10 t ha 1 compared to 6 45 and 35 69 t ha 1 unmulched treatment m 0 t ha 1 as the average for both seasons this result is in line with that of abd el wahed and ali 2013 and abd el mageed et al 2016 they reported that the average of yields of maize and squash for mulched treatment were increased than unmulched treatment data introduced in tables 8 and 9 show that sy and fy values were significantly affected by the irrigation quantity the highest sy and fy 7 15 and 41 02 t ha 1 values were obtained under 100 of etc compared to 6 3 and 36 26 t ha 1 under 70 of etc as the average for both seasons 2016 and 2017 respectively these results are in agreement with those of amer 2011 regarding the effect of organic compost oc on sy and fy values obtained in table 8 show that sy and fy were significantly affected by the organic compost level application the average sy and fy values of oc30 7 8 and 41 41 t ha 1 were increased by 25 1 and 11 45 than those of oc0 6 2 and 37 16 t ha 1 for sy and fy respectively a similar trend was reported by abd el wahed and ali 2013 they added that this result is logic since the same treatment gained the highest seed yield which compensated the i100 the relationship between iwa and sy was curvilinear polynomial of 2nd order fig 2 and it could be expressed as follows sy 6e 07 x i wa2 0 0069 x iwa 13 84 r2 1 for si 2016 sy 1e 07x iwa2 0 0013 x iwa 2 26 r2 1 for sii 2017 where sy is the seed yield t ha 1 and iwa is irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 also the relationship between iwa and fy fig 3 could be expressed as follows fy 2e 06 iwa2 0 0226 iwa 31 26 r2 1 for si 2016 fy 7e 07 iwa2 0 009 iwa 11 32 r2 1 for si 2017 where fy is the forage yield t ha 1 and iwa is irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 data in table 8 indicated that fy was not significantly affected by the interactions between compost rates mulching and irrigation level in two seasons in contrast sy was significantly affected by the interactions between the tested treatments in both seasons 3 8 seed and forage water use efficiencies s wue and f wue results in table 8 demonstrate that s wue and f wue values were significantly affected by mulching irrigation and organic compost treatments as an average for two seasons the highest s wue and f wue 1 25 and 7 17 kg m 3 values were recorded under m 10 t ha 1 compared to 1 15 and 7 01 kg m 3 unmulched treatment m 0 t ha 1 this result due to the sorghum seed and forage yields obtained under m treatment 7 1 and 40 1 t ha 1 were higher than the corresponding sorghum yields seed and forage obtained under m treatment 6 45 and 35 69 t ha 1 by 10 1 and 12 4 under the same amount of irrigation water applied as average for two seasons table 8 the result is in line with that of kar and kumar 2007 abd el wahed and ali 2013 and abd el mageed et al 2016 they reported that the average of wue values of maize and squash for mulched treatment were increased than unmulched treatment table 8 show that s wue and f wue values were significantly affected by the irrigation quantity the highest s wue and f wue 1 35 and 8 0 m 3 values were obtained under i70 compared to 1 05 and 6 2 kg m 3 under i100 in both seasons respectively these results are in agreement with those of abd el mageed et al 2016 regarding the effect of organic compost oc on s wue and f wue table 8 show that s wue and f wue values were significantly affected by the organic compost application the average s wue and f wue values of oc30 7 8 and 41 41 t ha 1 were increased by 25 1 and 11 45 than those of oc0 6 2 and 37 16 t ha 1 for s wue and f wue respectively a similar trend was reported by abd el wahed and ali 2013 they added that this result is logic since the same treatment gained the highest grain yield which compensated the i100 as presented in fig 3 the relationship between iwa and s wue was curvilinear polynomial of 2nd order and it could be expressed as follows s wue 5e 08 iwa2 0 0007x iwa 3 555 r2 1 for si 2016 s wue 5e 08 x iwa2 0 0004 x iwa 0 54 r2 1 for sii 2017 where s wue is the seed water use efficiency kg m 3 and iwa is irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 also the relationship between iwa and f wue could be expressed as follows f wue 2e 07 iwa2 0 001 iwa 6 73 r2 1 for si 2016 f wue 5e 08 iwa2 0 0016 iwa 14 55 r2 1 for si 2017 where f wue is the forage water use efficiency kg m 3 and iwa is irrigation water applied m3 ha 1 data in table 8 indicated that f wue was not significantly affected by the interactions between compost rates mulching and irrigation level in two seasons on the other hand s wue was significantly affected by the interactions between the tested treatments in both seasons 3 9 conclusion exposure of sorghum plants to drought stress resulted in decreases in plant growth attributes msi rwc leaf photosynthetic pigments harvest index seed and forage yields and increase canopy temperature overall the present study reflected that oc and m application could overcome the adverse effects of water stress by increasing plant water status chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b and enhancing plant growth and water use efficiencies in this instance oc appeared to be a viable substitute to decrease soil salinity ece soil ph and soil bulk density and increase field capacity water holding pores useful pores total porosity and soil organic matter content consequently oc and m application enhanced plant growth productivity water use efficiencies s wue and f wue results indicated that oc of 15 t ha 1 and 30 t ha 1 significantly p 0 05 increased seed yield by 5 6 and 25 8 also the forage yield increased by 8 7 and 11 45 with respect to control oc0 0 t ha 1 moreover soil mulching 10 t ha 1 increased sy and fy by 9 3 and 12 3 compared to unmulched treatment m 0 t ha 1 depending on the results of the present work it could be stated that the treatment i100 oc30 m10 is the most suitable for producing high sorghum yields under the conditions of the study area under limited irrigation water application of i85 oc30 m10 treatment was found to be favorable to save 15 of the applied irrigation water providing the same sorghum crop yields under newly reclaimed soil the combined practice of deficit irrigation and organic compost mulching with rice straw appears to be very promising in maximizing crop water productivity 
11394,the installation of tilting angle solar panels above agricultural plots provides renewable energy and means of action to dampen some of the effects and hazards of climate change when the panels are properly operated their drop shadow reduces water consumption by the plants as a consequence of alternating shade and sun bands with a short term impact on the stomatal conductance and a global decrease of gas exchanges this urged the development of a new model for crop growth and water budget adapted here from existing literature to handle such transient conditions characterized by short term infra day fluctuations the main difficulty was to combine short term fluctuations in the climatic forcings radiation interception and rain redistribution by the panels and long term agronomic evaluation hence the coexistence of several calculation time steps in model structure all field experiments were conducted on purpose in the agrivoltaic plot of lavalette montpellier france specific adaptations consisted in describing the stomatal behavior of the plants for fluctuating solar radiations and varied water status aiming at improving both the piloting of the solar panels and water management i e the choice of irrigation amounts model simulations have been able to reproduce the expected benefits from agrivoltaic installations for example showing that it is possible to improve land use efficiency and water productivity at once by reducing irrigation amounts by 20 when tolerating a decrease of 10 in yield or alternatively a slight extension of the cropping cycle agrivoltaism appears a solution for the future when facing climate change and the food and energy challenges typically in the rural areas and the developing countries and especially if the procedure presented here proves relevant for other crops and contexts keywords agrivoltaic water budget aet stomatal conductance water productivity land use efficiency 1 introduction the massive use of fossil fuels forbids perpetuating energy production at the global level and contributes to the unequivocal climate change ipcc 2011 2014 1 1 ipcc intergovernmental panel on climate change iea 2015 2 2 international energy agency several scenarios of climate evolution explored by the ipcc 2013 show an increase of summer temperatures up to 4 or 5 c combined with a decrease of 20 of rain amounts during spring and summer in the mediterranean regions at the 2100 horizon as already established by the fao 3 3 food and agriculture organization turral et al 2011 the alarming consequences on the agricultural world consist in an increase of hard to meet water demands by the plants a decrease or a capping of crop yields and a decrease of water availability in regions where irrigation would be necessary or currently allows considerable benefits facing the energy and food challenges agrivoltaism appears as an innovating concept around the world marrou 2012 harinarayana et al 2014 ravi et al 2014 first outlined by goetzberger and zastrow 1982 this concept as defined by dupraz et al 2011 consists of the association on a same land area of agricultural and photovoltaic productions by means of solar panels pv located high enough above the crop to allow agricultural machinery to pass agrivoltaism av therefore deals with symbiotic electric and agricultural productions on the energetic front av may deliver a production of 150 wc per square meter of pv sun r 2014 pers comm on the agronomic front the experiments conducted by marrou 2012 insisted on i the maintenance of crop yield for lettuces irrigated with drip irrigation ii the increase of land use efficiency land equivalent ratio ler and iii the absence of noticeable modifications of the reigning micro meteorological conditions to the exception of radiation water consumption by the crop was reduced by 20 30 under east west pv rows responsible for strong radiative heterogeneities in the north south direction on the soil surface the modus operandi has now changed and the most recent experiments on the lavalette station of irstea 4 4 french national research institute of science and technology for environment and agriculture montpellier france involve tilting angle pv able to revolve around their horizontal rotation axis which finds itself in the north south direction to reduce the unwanted spatial heterogeneities in radiation the installation of such dynamic devices expectedly allows optimizing the shading conditions in function of soil water status weather forecasts plant needs and scheduled or possible irrigations but still this achievement cannot be reached without the derivation of a new model that would predict the effect of the short term fluctuations of climatic forcings radiation interception and rain redistribution by the panels on the long term crop development and agronomic valuation moreover such a model should probably be formulated in a simple enough way to fit within a meta model or a multi model global optimization procedure a first step in this direction was taken by valle et al 2017 who presented the avstudio model that describes the dynamics of the spatial distribution of radiation transmitted to the crops together with a calculation of electricity production from the morphologic adaptation of lettuces under fluctuating radiation conditions number thickness and surface of the leaves the same authors also provided an overall evaluation of agrivoltaic systems in the form of promising values of the ler indicator on the other side elamri et al 2017 have tackled the impact of the tilting angle of the pv on rain redistribution on the soil surface in developing the avrain model this demonstrated the merits of a real time piloting of the pv to reduce the spatial heterogeneities caused by rain interception by these pv this paper therefore aims at complementing the cited developments to remedy the lack of a model that i evaluates the impact of rain redistribution on crop growth yield and water consumption ii evaluates water use and land use efficiencies and iii allows optimizing the shading strategy from soil water status climatic conditions or other controls of interest to be identified later moreover there are clues that the advocated modelling framework should certainly include a description of stomatal conductance to do so this paper also takes advantage of the inaugural works by marrou et al 2013a who noticed the influence of the drop shadow of the pv on the stomatal behavior of the crop but did not consider the link between water availability and photosynthesis pearcy et al 1997 mcausland et al 2016 or stomatal conductance jones 1992 martorell et al 2015 bota et al 2016 the latter rather well documented in the literature see the review of damour et al 2010 numerous models indeed describe stomatal conductance gs in function of soil water status fraction of transpirable soil water and environmental data temperature pressure vapor deficit although acknowledging radiation as the key variable for an accurate prediction of gs however most models do not account for the short term high frequency fluctuations in radiation vialet chabrand 2013 inherent to agrivoltaic installations the aim of this paper is finally to model the water budget and crop growth of irrigated lettuces in agrivoltaic plots for different strategies in piloting the tilting angle pv in addition owing to the effect of a reduction of gaseous exchanges on both photosynthesis and water consumption by the plant stomatal conductance is selected as the key variable to account for the succession of sunny and shaded conditions in particular emphasis is placed on the influence of the pv on the decrease of water consumption by the crop this work is intended as a first step towards a multi variable optimisation piloting of the pv irrigation scheduling of agrivoltaic systems that starts with the derivation of the ad hoc though intended generic enough avirrig water budget and crop growth model adapted from optirrig cheviron et al 2016 2 material and methods 2 1 the agrivoltaic installation of lavalette the agrivoltaic av installation finds itself in the experimental platform of lavalette irstea montpellier france 43 6466 n 3 8715 e and covers a total area of 1720 m² next to a control plot cp of 1120 m² located immediately south of the av plot there is no influence of the solar panels pv on the control plot i e no drop shadow at any time of the day whatever the season the av plot has 4 a v devices fig 1 thus 4 shading methods in which the drop shadow corresponds to a decrease of the incoming solar radiation by 20 50 in average table 1 the two fixed devices half density hd and full density fd were built in 2010 and have been extensively described by marrou 2012 they consist of 0 8 x 1 6 m pv aligned in rows of 22 4 m length in the east west direction 79 n held at 4 m above the ground each row is tilted southwards with a fixed angle of 25 with respect to the horizontal on the fd device the distance between two rows is 1 6 m in the north south direction which was set to match the soil cover ratio or shading rate of traditional photovoltaic plants on the hd device only one row out of two remains and the distance between two rows is 3 2 m marrou 2012 suggested using tilting angle pv with a coverage ratio equivalent to that of the hd fixed device to homogenize radiation maps while the fd device was deemed too penalizing for crop growth either with fixed or tilting angle pv two new dynamic av devices were installed in 2014 termed solar tracking st and controlled tracking ct with the same shading rate as for the hd device installed on each side of the preexisting devices the pv are now 2 x 1 m located 5 m above the ground held by poles forming square arrays of 6 4 m side allowing access for agricultural machinery the length of a pv row is 19 m in the north south direction 369 n the tilting angle of the panels may currently be varied between 50 e and 50 w operated by electrically controlled jacks the st and ct devices are independent and they receive specific setpoint values for their tilting angles in time the st device was thought to maximize radiation interception and the production of electricity and thus the drop shadow on the soil surface by following the sun s course this shading strategy reduces by 35 the transmitted radiation this method of operation is termed tracking 1 axis quite differently the ct device minimizes radiation interception before noon then shades the crops beneath the structure during the hot hours between 9 and 14 h utc later on in the afternoon minimum radiation interception is sought again and the pv are operated to be as parallel to the sun rays as possible this strategy allows homogenization of the transmitted radiation with a reduction of about 20 complementary indications may be found in marrou et al 2013b and valle et al 2017 on the piloting of the pv and its effects on the microclimate with a focus on the transmitted radiation and on the temperature 2 2 crop management and monitoring the madelona variety of romaine lettuce has been tested to evaluate the impact of varying shading conditions in av installations lettuces have been chosen for their short cropping cycle 5 7 weeks allowing two consecutive cycles in spring and summer the choice of the variety has been discussed with local gardeners who advised madelona for its tolerance to the mediterranean climatic conditions and the morphology of its leaves flat leaves make measurement of gaseous exchanges easier the seedlings were planted out in the different av devices as indicated in fig 1 the results of marrou et al 2013c for the fd device suggested not to use this device because of its too restrictive shading rate 50 thought to prevent correct crop growth and development all lettuce beds are placed perpendicular to the pv and comprise 5 rows of lettuces with a distance of 0 3 m between rows fig 2 the beds are 6 3 m long 21 salads for the ct device versus 12 6 m 42 salads for the st and hd devices the installation of 6 beds per device was selected to be representative of each device by providing a sufficient number of salads but also to capture and quantify the north south heterogeneity of radiation reported for the fixed hd device dupraz et al 2011 marrou et al 2013b a block of 6 beds 12 6 m long was also installed as a control plot cp south of the st and hd devices the second one south of the ct device was not used due to soil compaction based on the analysis of soil nitrogen residues 90 nitrogen units were applied before planting out the seedlings the local soil is predominantly deep and silty with a field capacity of 0 27 cm3 cm3 and a wilting point of 0 17 cm3 cm3 hence a 100 mm m 1 storage capacity drip irrigation was used with one dripper 1 l h 1 per lettuce irrigation was daily scheduled so as to re fill the soil at field capacity this permitted to have identical water status for partial harvests and gaseous exchanges measurements two cropping cycles were followed in 2016 under spring and summer conditions table 2 the planting out of lettuces took place in april 20th and july 21st for the sake of the present study four plant characteristics are taken into account and followed to identify whether the fluctuating shading conditions impact them or not root system dynamics of biomass production total matter at harvest and stomatal conductance nine soil samplings 0 30 0 30 x 0 40 m were analyzed 13 days after planting out for the st device 3 samples under pv and 3 between pv and in the cp 3 samples for the summer cropping cycle after rinsing with water the aerial and root biomasses were weighted to indicate their fresh mass and dry mass components root profiles were also made on other lettuces for the st device and in the cp counting roots in the cells of a 2 5 cm grid to identify the rooting depth and width weekly samplings were made for each of the followed devices and in the cp to search for differences in the dynamics of biomass production between the plots these samplings were made at night between 1 and 5 a m far in time from the possible impacts of radiation fluctuations the day before and also to allow equilibrium conditions that is the equalization of the hydric potential between lettuce roots and the nearby soil region sixty lettuces were taken for each sampling for the st device 40 on the cp and for the hd device the sampled lettuces were weighted to have the fresh biomass then taken to the drying oven 60 c during 48 to 72 h to have the dry biomass the remaining lettuces were harvested at 2 dates by sampling systematically 1 plant out of 2 so avoiding to take adjacent plants for each cropping cycle the first harvest took place when maturity was reached on the cp then the second one occurred one week later so that the lettuces cultivated under av devices had also reached maturity all harvests were made at night and weighted as for weekly samples in accordance an indicator of agronomic performance was calculated as the ratio between the number of lettuces whose fresh biomass is above 400 g and the total number of lettuces to gain indications on the proportion of marketable lettuces thicoïpé et al 1997 in the region this ratio usually lies in

radiative and water stresses detailed later in the model construction part the selected expressions are 2 m e t e t 0 k c 3 a e t m e t k s where kc is the crop coefficient and ks is a coefficient that accounts for both the radiative and water stresses through their effects on stomatal conductance see section 2 5 3 the use of cp values in eq 1 seemed relevant since marrou et al 2013b showed there was no significant difference in climatic forcings to the exception of radiation within the av installations the argument is assumed here to be valid for all av installations that are small enough to prevent significant aerodynamic effects to occur and create specific local conditions the transmitted global radiation rg on the whole av plot of fig 1 was simulated by the avstudio model developed by the sun r society and presented by valle 2017 2 3 2 soil water status the measurements presented here aim at the parameterisation of the processes taking part in the water budget of the crop to derive an adapted agrivoltaic version of the optirrig model see section 2 5 2 these measurements also help deciding the irrigation strategy as previously mentioned in section 2 2 data acquisition was performed at a 10 minute time step on 8 lettuces for the solar tracking st device and 5 lettuces for the control plot cp two tensiometric probes watermark 253 l soil matric potential sensor campbell scientific were used for each lettuce at 15 and 30 cm depths together with 3 fdr 5 5 fdr frequency domain reflectometry probes cs650 campbell scientific allowing estimations of soil water content at 5 15 and 25 cm depths to complement this continuous monitoring discrete occasional measurements were made several times a week with neutron probes 503dr hydroprobe cpn international to provide reference estimations of soil water content from 0 to 100 cm with a spatial step of 10 cm for that each of the followed av devices was equipped with aluminum tubes as guides for the neutron probes 4 in the st plot 4 in the ct plot 2 in the hd plot and 4 in the cp the calibration of the neutron probe used since many years on the experimental platform of lavalette was verified by a gravimetric method when the tubes were installed 2 4 performance evaluation for agrivoltaic installations 2 4 1 water productivity water productivity wp was defined by pereira et al 2012 and will be used here at the smallest possible scale that of each lettuce water productivity is sometimes defined as the ratio of fresh matter fm to the total actual evapotranspiration aet since we wish to evaluate the potential of water saving through control strategies irrigation and panel orientation during rainfalls section 2 5 3 we preferred to relate the crop yield to the total amount of water rain and irrigation total water used twu molden et al 2010 this leads to the indicator wp as defined by eq 4 a second indicator wpirrig eq 5 relates the fresh matter to the irrigation water used only iwu 4 w p f m t w u 5 w p i r r i g f m i w u where wp g mm 1 serves to compare the average fresh biomass of lettuces fm to the total water used twu mm or to the irrigation water used iwu mm different wp values correspond to different levels of water valuation by the crops rathore et al 2017 under or outside the pv for as many shading conditions in the following wp and wpirrig are calculated either for equal durations of the cropping cycles or when lettuces biomass has reached 400 g in average 2 4 2 land equivalent ratio ler agrivoltaic installations aim at improving land use efficiency which may be evaluated through the values of the land equivalent ratio ler classically used for associated production systems mead et al 1980 chimonyo et al 2016 and especially in agroforestry dupraz 1998 sereke et al 2015 the ler represents the ratio between the area of the av installation and the sum of the areas that would be necessary to match the agricultural and electric productions of the av installation ler values greater than 1 are therefore sought 6 l e r f m a v f m c p e a v e p v where fmav and fmcp represent here the fresh biomass in the av installation and on the cp control plot while eav and epv account for the electric production of the av installation and for that of a classical photovoltaic installation of equivalent technology e g fixed panels for the hd device and tracking 1 axis for the st device for identical shading rates in the following ler values are calculated either for equal durations of the cropping cycles or when lettuces biomass has reached 400 g in average the electric productions have been estimated with the avstudio model 2 5 derivation of the avirrig model 2 5 1 modelling approach in absence of dedicated validated crop models pertaining to av contexts the principle of parsimony prevailed in the choice of this exploratory modelling approach this required using as many adaptations as needed to account for the main specificities of av contexts while avoiding any risk of overparameterization the choice of degrees days rules to govern crop growth and account for climatic effects at once satisfies this need and so does the option to rely on the existing optirrig model for its simplicity at the necessity to add a procedure that accounts for stomatal conductance variations recognized as a key crop variable in av contexts 2 5 2 stomatal conductance the model presented by jarvis 1976 simplified and used by olioso et al 1996 guilioni 2000 and marrou 2012 was retained to evaluate the effect of the incoming radiation on the stomatal conductance because it describes the mass and energy exchanges involved in the plant atmosphere interactions with a level of complexity affordable here that is with measurable state variables in addition as strong spatial heterogeneities in soil water content are expected to occur in av installations as a consequence of rain redistribution or sheltering by the panels elamri et al 2017 the associated water deficits and their effects on the stomatal conductance should also be taken into account the selected formulation for the stomatal conductance gs is thus that of marrou 2012 to which a linear reduction of gs values has been applied when the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw is below the kftsw threshold 7 g s g s m g s m g s m 1 exp r g k r g min 1 f t s w k f t s w where gs mmol m 2 s 1 is the stomatal conductance whose lower and upper boundaries are gsm and gsm respectively krg is a constant that controls the magnitude of the response low krg values indicate a stronger sensitivity to changes in radiation show clear adaptations even for small changes in rg values and kftsw is the threshold of ftsw values beyond which a reduction of gs has been observed ftsw is the ratio between the available water of the current day and the available water capacity however the above equation is a static model in which no temporal aspect is included the gs stomatal conductance simply appears as a function of rg and ftsw thus with the implicit hypothesis that equilibrium conditions have been reached this is why the dynamics of stomatal conductance modeled by vialet chabrand 2013 have also been included in avirrig especially to account for the short term variations characteristic of av installations the cited model was originally intended to study water use efficiency in oak trees but has then be used to evaluate the stomatal dynamics in assimilating co2 in response to changes in incoming radiation for 13 species among which wheat tomato sorghum and maize mcausland et al 2016 this makes stomatal conductance a function of time 8 g s t g s g s 0 g s e x p t τ where gs mmol m 2 s 1 is the dynamic stomatal conductance t s is time gs0 mmol m 2 s 1 is the previous equilibrium state level of the stomatal conductance gs mmol m 2 s 1 is the target level corresponding to a change in radiation according to eq 7 and τ s is a time constant the exponential term rules the temporal dynamics species characterized by small τ values will quickly respond to changes in the setpoint conductance while delayed and damped responses may be expected for large τ values the choices leading to eqs 7 and 8 were taken to reinforce the operational side of the model because only measurable variables are included rg and ftsw and both the water and radiative stresses are accounted for it should be noted though that eq 8 has to be evaluated at the discrete times of measurement only 2 5 3 calculation loop adapted from the optirrig model the avirrig model suitable for agrivoltaic installations fig 3 leans on the existing optirrig model cheviron et al 2016 and acknowledges its principle of parsimony few parameters are required to run the model which thus may easily fit in external calculation procedures or larger meta models optirrig was adapted from the pilote model mailhol et al 1997 2011 khaledian et al 2009 and built for the generation and optimization of irrigation scenarios e g playing on irrigation amounts decision rules and authorized periods the climatic forcings and key state variables of the model are all measurable quantities forcings rain radiation air temperature reference evapotranspiration variables soil water reserves leaf area index dry matter agricultural yield and the model runs at a daily time step among its main seasonal predictions are the total irrigation amount crop yield the irrigation water use efficiency and a financial evaluation of the irrigation strategy whose comparison allows the multi objective constrained optimization of irrigation scenarios initially devoted to field crops optirrig uses the leaf area index lai as the main descriptor of crop development which was not suitable for the case of lettuces the fraction cover fc was used here instead together with an exponential degrees days rule to describe the evolution of fc with thermal time instead of the logistic like curve used for the lai in pilote and optirrig the formulation selected for fc in function of the tt temperature sum with a base temperature of 3 5 c hypothesizes the existence of a point of symmetry for the fc tt curve whose coordinates are tt0 fc0 in the tt fc plane the fc tt curve is constructed as follows which gives it the symmetrical shape of a tilted s for tt values above tt0 the increase of fc with tt is described with a three parameter model formally the same as for the charge of the capacitor 9 f c t t f c 0 f c m f c 0 1 e x p t t t t 0 τ t in which fc is the fraction cover tt c is the sum of temperature fc0 is the starting value of fc when the sum of temperature is tt0 c and fcm is the maximal setpoint value of fc the curvature of the fc tt curve is controlled by τt c and increases with it on the contrary small τt values result in nearly linear shapes for fc tt the hypothesis of central symmetry with respect to the tt0 fc0 point yields the expression for the fc tt curve for tt values under tt0

parameter for the maximum rooting depth and pr min m is the starting rooting depth immediately after the planting out of the seedlings the daily production of fresh biomass is based on fc d but

for photothermal stresses and ks for the radiative and water stresses through their effects on the dynamics of stomatal conductance both kptr and ks are thus corrective terms to quantify how the fm values in the agrivoltaic plots differ from these in the control plots the formulation of kptr hypothesizes the existence of a reference value for the daily photothermal index obtained in natural conditions on the control plot and penalizes the absolute difference to this value obtained in the artificial av conditions 13 k p t r d 1 p t r d p t r c p p t r c p where ptr mj m 2 c 1 is the

from data collected on the control plot kptr values lie in the 0 1 interval with average values of 0 72 in spring and 0 62 in summer the formulation of ks accounts for the dynamics of stomatal conductance by comparing the integration possibly approximated by a discrete sum of short term variations in the agrivoltaic plots to the daily average of stomatal conductance in the control plots 14

campaign with average values of 0 84 in spring and 0 82 in summer avirrig is a reservoir model that assumes only three reservoirs are present the surface reservoir r1 whose depth is known at planting out then fixed the root zone reservoir r2 whose depth increases with root deepening and the deep reservoir r3 whose initial depth is given by a model parameter that indicates the maximal rooting depth classically for such models r3 progressively vanishes as r2 increases in depth the three reservoirs only communicate by drainage d1 from r1 to r2 d2 from r2 to r3 and d3 for deep drainage lost by the profile as no capillary rise is accounted for r1 is filled up by irrigation i or rain p and rain redistribution by the solar panels ppv is described by avrain elamri et al 2017 the partition between crop transpiration demand and soil evaporation demand is first calculated from the reference evapotranspiration et0 and the fraction cover fc 15 e s 0 1 f c e t 0 where es0 mm is soil evaporation

maximal value of fc and kc min and kc max are respectively the minimal and maximal values of kc 2 5 4 strategic evaluations with avirrig avirrig was intended as the specific adaptation of optirrig for the av installations accounting for the impact of fluctuating shading conditions on crop development and assuming stomatal conductance was the relevant variable to do so avirrig encompasses avrain that describes rain redistribution by the solar panels in function of their piloting strategies e g held flat facing the wind back to the wind or operated in rain avoidance strategies to decrease the spatial heterogeneity of rain amounts on the ground see elamri et al 2017 avirrig may thus be used for strategic assessments that would involve both the decision rules used for irrigation and the algorithms used to operate the solar panels with implications on stomatal conductance on the one side and on rain redistribution on the other side table 3 irrigation and rainfall management this section therefore gives examples of how to use avirrig for ex post evaluations i e for the diagnostic of management practices in the studied av installation which is not yet a proper real time optimisation of the av installations in the course of the cropping seasons the climatic data of summer 2016 were used irrigations were decided from the values of ftsw soon as ftsw fell under 0 6 a given day either from field measurements in scenario 1 or from model predictions in scenarios 2 to 4 an irrigation took place the day after its purpose was to refill r1 and r2 through successive cycles of 3 mm 15 min irrigations two strategies of rain redistribution were also tested the first one was the avoidance strategy that limits the spatial heterogeneity of rain amounts on the ground the second one was to tilt the panels from one extreme position to the opposite extreme position each 6 mm of rain threshold strategy scenario 1 is the reproduction of the experimental 2016 campaign while scenarios 2 3 and 4 rely on an automated piloting of the irrigations to evaluate the associated water savings and heterogeneity in rain redistribution scenario 3 adds the avoidance strategy for rain management for a clear comparison with scenario 2 scenarios 4 adds the threshold strategy for rain management for clear comparisons with scenario 2 the results of all scenarios will be given for 4 positions in the av installation between panels bp under panels up near the aplomb of the west side of the panels pew near the aplomb of their east side pee the target variables for the assessment of all scenarios will be the irrigation amounts and water productivity 3 results 3 1 observations and measurements 3 1 1 radiation and reference evapotranspiration the spatial patterns of radiation rg and reference evapotranspiration et0 were the same in the av installation eq 1 fig 4 the average daily decrease of rg with respect to the control plot cp was 33 for the solar tracking device st 30 for the half density device hd 49 for the full density device fd and 23 for the controlled tracking device ct the expected strong heterogeneity of rg in the north south direction for hd and fd represented 30 of the average rg value versus 5 only for the dynamic devices st ct very close results were obtained for et0 table 4 3 1 2 water consumption and crop development soil water potential was followed by tensiometers fig 5 a down to the maximum rooting depth of the crop 0 3 m for the st device in the bp and up positions with similar results and the cp a larger water consumption was observed in the cp fig 5b coherent by a quicker decrease in soil water potential that fell under 40 kpa possibly responsible for necrosis without incidence on the production of fresh mass bressoud 1997 as expected the partial shading for the st device resulted in less water consumption the estimates of actual evapotranspiration aet based on water consumption the difference in soil water reserve between two consecutive days in the 0 35 cm depth from fdr probes in absence of drainage and knowing capillary rise is very limited show daily averaged decreases of 22 st 26 hd and 19 ct plotted in fig 6 in comparison with rg simulated by avstudio and et0 calculated from eq 1 the decrease in aet values estimated from measurements is coherent with these of rg and et0 for the hd and ct devices which is not exactly the case for the st device where the variations in water reserve have been approximately the same as for the ct device in spite of noticeable differences in the transmitted radiation 67 for st 77 for ct possible explanations are of two kinds there is an impact of some of the fluctuating shading conditions i on the development of the root system or ii on the dynamics of stomatal conductance which in both cases may impact root water uptake the former hypothesis was discarded after root profiles showed very similar rooting depths of about 15 cm 13 days after planting out for the st device and on cp as well as identical ratios 25 between root biomass and the total fresh biomass fig 7 shows the results of weekly samplings for all devices in the av installation also allowing comparisons between the spring and summer cropping cycles on the cp the dynamics are similar between seasons in the sense of roughly similar slopes for the curves in spite of a difference of about 100 degrees days at harvest acquired early in the cropping cycle this similarity may be explained by the occurrence of strong thermal stresses in the summer cycle prone to limit the slope in summer conditions an interesting feature of fig 7 is that the dynamics of biomass production for the ct device resembles these of the hd then st devices successively in accordance with the shading conditions selected for the ct device this seems to outline the adaptation of the crop to varied shading intensities in the course of the cropping cycle as the st device offers 35 less radiation than on the cp 4 shadow bands and periods each day against 20 and 1 shadow band for the ct device finally this physiological adaptation capacity may explain the weak difference in fresh mass between shading strategies at least for short cropping cycles by contrast a significant difference appears in fresh mass between the st hd and ct devices on one side and the cp on the other side for thermal times above 250 degrees days in spring and 450 degrees days in summer error risk 5 associated with delays in crop maturation of about 5 and 7 days in the last days before harvest this is consistent with the decrease of global radiation received by the lettuces table 5 gathers biomass data obtained at the 4 harvest dates 2 in spring and 2 in summer for the cropping cycles of 2016 no significant difference in water content of the lettuces about 95 in all cases was observed in spring a significant decrease in biomass was observed between the agrivoltaic plots and the control plot the average difference was 24 in summer differences also existed between the st ct and hd devices the decrease was 16 for st and ct against 31 for hd with respect to the fresh biomass harvested in the cp the fraction of marketable lettuces stayed roughly constant for st between spring and summer for the second harvest while it decreased by 5 for ct and by 30 for hd the average fresh mass for st ct and hd for the second harvest was approximately the same as the fresh mass on cp for the first harvest date i e maturity reached on the control plot a slight delay takes place between the agrivoltaic installation and the control plot this delay is calculated between days when fm overreaches 450 g in st or ct vs cp which corresponds to a commercial weight of about 400 g the trimming is 50 g measurements perpendicular to the panel rows for the st device have put forward the impact of a decrease in radiation on the values of the stomatal conductance gs fig 8 a complementary measurements made after irrigation had been stopped on a part of the cp have also indicated a linear decrease of gs for ftsw values lower than the threshold kftsw value introduced in eq 7 taken as kftsw 0 55 fig 8b the simulation of gs values from eq 7 where gs was a function of the radiation level only were deemed appropriate on cp fig 9 a a 1 03 r² 0 81 by contrast eq 8 where the dynamics are accounted for was needed for the st device with fluctuating shading conditions fig 9b a 0 89 r² 0 35 3 1 3 performances of the local agrivoltaic installation table 6 gathers water productivity wp scores obtained for the final harvest dates which erases the effect of the 5 7 day maturity delay in the av installation with respect to the cp a complementary evaluation was made by comparing wp scores for similar fresh masses of the lettuces thus for different harvest dates first harvest on the cp second harvest for the av devices st hd and ct when the cropping cycles had the same length harvest 2 section of table 6 irrigation was reduced by 9 st 9 hd and 4 ct in comparison with the cp and the corresponding losses in fresh mass were 18 st 26 hd and 20 ct however as developed later in the discussion the decrease in fresh mass and in aet were of comparable magnitudes and larger than the decrease in irrigation amounts which is a clue that the irrigation strategy was far from optimal in the av installation the reason is that water comfort was ensured most of the times for the st hd and ct devices which was not always the case in the cp however for the present case and not aiming at the optimisation of the irrigation strategy wp was slightly higher on the cp than in the av installation even if lettuces would not support pronounced water deficit it could be possible to play on light water stress conditions to exhibit differences between devices this kind of optimization of the irrigation strategy slightly decreasing irrigation amounts and compensating this decrease with better application rules will better be tested on more stress tolerant crops for similar fresh masses near or above the marketable threshold of 400 g per lettuce in average the relative increases of irrigation amounts were 1 st 1 hd and 6 ct for relative increases of 15 4 and 12 in fm with respect to cp and assuming a 5 7 delay for crop maturity this delay may seem a drawback but can also be seen as a control on crop growth allowing for example to damp the effect of heat periods and limit their impact on the overall production finally for both cropping seasons and all devices tested in the av installation wp values were lower than wpirrig values which may indicate rain amounts were imperfectly accounted for in the design of the irrigation strategy a clear evidence is that comparable irrigation amounts were used in spring and summer in spite of large differences in rain amounts 101 6 vs 36 5 mm but again the purpose was rather to ensure satisfying experimental conditions e g equal water comfort for all devices prior to stomatal conductance measurements than to optimize the irrigation strategy using tensiometers or the predictive capacities of a crop model whatever the cropping season and the tested device the land equivalent ratio ler values were all greater than 1 table 7 this simply indicates that the relative decrease in agricultural production stays smaller than the relative decrease in photovoltaic production due to the tested dimensioning and operation of the panels relative to the classic standards given the weak impact of its shading conditions on crop development and judging from the ler values only see the discussion section on this point the st device offers the best performances slightly before the hd device the latter has lower agricultural performances in summer than in spring despite similar agricultural yields ct does not seem as interesting as st from the ler point of view because of the loss of photovoltaic production associated with the cautious strategy that consists in favoring radiation transmission to the crop the ct device minimizes radiation interception before noon then shades the crops beneath the structure during the hot hours between 9 and 14 h utc the average fm value of lettuces in the av installation matches that of the cp after five to seven days table 5 which results in ler values of 1 50 st and hd and 1 29 ct when averaging over both cropping cycles however the delay of maturity is silenced in this classical use of the ler in spite of possible impacts not always negative though on the short term cropping and marketing strategy as well as on the longer term of cropping rotations this questions the genericity thus relevance of the ler to quantify the performances of av installations at least when used alone as the only indicator for example when only withholding the marketable lettuces at the second harvest date i e 70 of the lettuces on cp the averaged ler values were 1 48 st 1 27 hd and 1 14 ct which still makes st the best strategy judging from the ler values only hd has better performances than ct though clearly less relevant for summer than spring 3 2 modelling results 3 2 1 water budget and crop growth accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of rain redistribution by the solar panels on one side and for the impact of fluctuating shading conditions on stomatal conductance on the other side avirrig yielded satisfying results for soil water budget from planting out to harvest fig 10 a the mean absolute error mae of the model is about 3 mm 8 5 of soil water capacity and the linear correlation coefficients are above 0 9 however the daily step of the model caused temporal errors for rainfalls or irrigations that occurred late in the day a finer discretization time step coupled with a 2 d formulation of the avrain model could circumvent such limitations at the cost of additional development efforts a complementary direction would be to add a description of soil surface status e g crusting to better address the spatial and temporal dynamics of rain redistribution on the soil surface runoff then in the soil ponding especially after strong rain events avirrig simulated biomass production well fig 10b and 10c in the various devices of the av installation slope of regression line between 0 94 and 1 05 mae between 7 and 23 g thanks to the inclusion of the dynamics of stomatal conductance in model structure 3 2 2 performance evaluation for agrivoltaic installations table 8 gathers all simulation results for the management scenarios 1 to 4 see table 3 combining strategies for irrigation and rain redistribution the purpose here is also to initiate the definition of good practices and the search for generic indicators in the evaluation of management scenarios applied to the av installations in a wider sense the present analysis is limited to several of the mattering objective variables i e the total irrigation amount and water productivity wp as the recognized indicator of the appropriateness of water management these are calculated for several positions with respect to the aplomb of the solar panels between panels bp near the west side of panels edge pew near the east side of panels edge pee or under panels up as table 6 table 8 allows two points of view i equivalent durations ed of the cropping cycles in the av installation and on the cp the upper part of table 8 and ii equivalent agricultural yields i e fresh mass fm the lower part of table 8 identical total irrigation amounts of 170 mm were used when applying the default experimental practices or simulating the automated piloting of irrigation on the cp by contrast the variations in irrigation column in table 8 for equivalent fresh masses show multiple different cases depending both on the scenarios 1 to 4 and on the position relative to the panels bp pew up pee the far lower irrigation amounts needed to achieve the same agricultural production in the av installation than in the cp tend to indicate that too much water was delivered to the cp in field experiments and that the threshold level to trigger irrigation was not severe enough in the modelling part scenario 4 consists in the addition of a thresholded rain redistribution strategy to scenario 2 reducing the coefficient of variation that qualifies the spatial heterogeneity of rain amounts under the av structure cv decreased from 0 22 to 0 15 which was not the case in scenario 3 cv increased to 0 32 with a no threshold short term rain avoidance strategy high cv values may have serious implications with respect to the irrigation strategy or soil conservation in the worst cases local runoff and erosion figures 4 discussion 4 1 water consumption for fluctuating shading conditions lettuces grown in the av installation of lavalette irstea montpellier france were never exposed to water stresses throughout the cropping cycles however when precision irrigation e g drip irrigation is possible and in absence of thermal stresses one may expect a larger tolerance of the crop to deficit irrigation strategies for the various av devices than for cp due to decreased aet values caused by the drop shadows of the pv it would be possible then to better face the critical periods heat waves droughts or water deficit by implementing less demanding irrigation strategies while maintaining acceptable yield levels however more stress tolerant crops would be better candidates for such experimentations for the st device the drop shadow of the panels reduced by 33 the et0 level applying the fao 56 procedure eq 1 which was not coherent with estimations drawn from field aet measurements after which the reduction was of about 20 the difference lies in the stomatal conductance of the crop under fluctuating shading conditions at far smaller time scales than that of a day the avirrig model for water budget and crop growth in av installations simulates the soil plant atmosphere exchanges and biomass production with enough accuracy to fit the experimental data combining the effects of rain redistribution by the panels avrain model and these of the fraction of the global radiation transmitted under the panels avstudio model the generation and analysis of multiple rain and irrigation management scenarios with avirrig indicates a 15 20 reduction in irrigation amounts although avirrig was built to be as generic as possible assuming model structure will stay suitable or easily adaptable for other crops field crops and perennial crops the model was only tested in the parameterisation adequate for the vegetative phase of lettuces however it is believed that the crucial features of avirrig are the inclusion of photothermal stresses and that of the dynamics of stomatal conductance and these will be kept for future applications 4 2 crop growth and development panels operation algorithms st and ct resulted in radiation losses of about 35 and 20 for the crop respectively have either led to a significant in the sense of the wilcoxon test loss in agricultural yield or to a delay of a few days for equivalent yields the latter has interesting implications this delay may not be a drawback for strategic commercial reasons and also because it is the counterpart of possibly reduced irrigation amounts and or strategies to attenuate the effects of critical periods e g heat waves on crop development and health although the dynamics of stomatal conductance have received attention here and seem to offer a valuable proxy for crop adaptations i e a descriptor that is closely related to relatively easily measurable quantities and especially soil water status the fine physiological details of crop adaptations to fluctuating shading conditions should be sought among several non modeled processes responsible for example for the number size thickness of the leaves and their specific leaf area the ratio of leaf area to dry mass see marrou et al 2013c valle et al 2017 leaf thickness in particular showed interesting signs of adaptation to the fluctuating shading conditions for example the solar tracking device offered the best performances in the first weeks after the planting out whereas the controlled tracking device necessitated three to four weeks of adaptation to the artificial radiation conditions created see fig 7 the ct curve in summer conditions this suggests that the use of agrivoltaic installations for perennial crops would result in adaptations starting at the budburst when leaves begin to grow if true this is expected then to reduce the delay between maturity in the control plot and maturity in the agrivoltaic installation and also to reduce crop water demands this comes in straight line with the arguments developed by hannah et al 2013 which emphasize agrivoltaism is an appropriate answer to climate change especially for the menaced crops and production basins 4 3 global optimisation of the agrivoltaic installations the implementation of av installations provides multiple challenges and degrees of freedom for a better water management in connection with rain redistribution by the panels and agricultural yield in interplay with the production of photovoltaic energy there is on the one hand the irrigation strategy amounts triggers authorized periods quota and on the other hand the variations in time of the tilting angle of the panels which is the key control exerted on the av installation the control that decides rain redistribution and the fraction of solar radiation transmitted to the crop the optimisation problem is constrained by the climatic forcings and the existence of several variables of interest also with constraints upon them typically the agricultural yield should be y ymin the total irrigation amount should be i imax and the overall strategy should be profitable financial expectations f fmin the future inclusion of avirrig in such optimisation procedures requires further evaluation of its operational abilities the exploratory approach seems enough to captivate at least the first order effects these that should not be missed in describing the physical processes at play while coping with objectives of parsimony this work should be complemented by a thorough sensitivity analysis relying on multiple piloting strategies of the pv and irrigation schemes for example seeking if avirrig is able to discriminate cases in which little differences in system management produce large modifications in commercialization strategy for the final products a sensitivity analysis would relate these changes to the sensitivity of the model to the tilting angle of the panels with time seen through the modeled dynamics of stomatal conductance and related to the sensitivity and accuracy of the associated parameters the avirrig model was built as generic as possible and with such perspectives of global optimisation in mind in particular its deterministic approach makes it compatible with external procedures or meta models that could run avirrig as a slave model however even if the genericity and robustness of avirrig still need to be established and assessed for example through uncertainty and sensitivity analyses the preliminary results gathered in this study could be used as guidelines or starting points for instance the model could be used to estimate the achievable gain on water consumption in the experiments irrigation depth was always sufficient to avoid water stress but considering the ability of avirrig to simulate water uptake by the crops it is possible to adjust the irrigation depth for a given panel operation strategy or to decide both in interplay the ability to simulate also the effect of rain distribution opens the possibility to design and simulate more advanced irrigation strategies however considering that panels could be oriented in real time to minimize heterogeneity after rainfall events elamri et al 2018 it seems easier for farmers to adopt a uniform irrigation depth on the whole plot in an even wider sense the global optimisation of agrivoltaic installations could start with the dimensioning of the installation panels size height and spacing their coverage rate and the position of the panel rows with respect to the crop rows and the assessment of possible options involving the avirrig model in the design procedure as well as base case scenarios for the climatic forcings water and crop management then the global optimisation would certainly involve real time decisions multiple temporal horizons and the several listed variables still including avirrig in the procedure 5 conclusion the recent experimentations conducted on the lavalette platform of irstea montpellier france in 2016 consisted in the association of agricultural lettuces and photovoltaic productions by means of an agrivoltaic installation this installation is termed dynamic as the solar panels may be tilted on purpose around their axis of fixation which allows defining piloting strategies for the panels these rain redistribution operating the panels so as to limit the spatial heterogeneities inherent to rain redistribution by the panels strategies have been crossed with irrigation strategies in simulation ways which resulted in all cases in slightly increased and more uniform water productivity the former is a classical evaluation of agricultural water management while the latter quantified as the ler land equivalent ratio addresses the performances of agrivoltaic installations by summing the ratio of agricultural yield in the agrivoltaic installation to that on the control plots and the ratio of photovoltaic energy produced in the agrivoltaic installation to that of a classic photovoltaic installation of equivalent technology averaging over all tested cases and cropping seasons the ensemble ler value was 1 21 which may be interpreted as 1 21 times the area of the agrivoltaic installation would have been needed to achieve the same agricultural and electric productions if these had been conducted on separated areas however a possible opening of this work is the formulation of a wider agrivoltaic index that could also assess the relevance of water management and crop management options the effect of fluctuating shading conditions on crop growth and development was mainly accounted for through the dynamics of stomatal conductance explicitly included in the derivation of the avirrig model a present limitation is that only the vegetative phase of lettuces was modeled not the reproductive phase stomatal conductance was assumed a relevant proxy of several non modeled plant adaptations since it is measurable closely linked to soil water status and elements already existed in the literature to describe the temporal variations of stomatal conductance in response to changes in climatic conditions somehow the characteristic time of the studied specie in relatively simple terms for some of the tested cases a noticeable physiological adaptation was leaves thickening the mean overall effects of the tested artificial shading conditions were a reduction of plant water demands by 20 a delay in maturity of about 5 7 days in the agrivoltaic installation with respect to the control plot or a decrease of agricultural yield by 15 to 25 both effects were not encountered at once and the delay may not be a drawback as first it could considered as a strategic commercial element and second it is counterbalanced by the possibility offered by agrivoltaic installations to efficiently attenuate the effects of heat waves or drought periods in a wider view and for future research the dynamic agrivoltaic installations if properly operated possibly through global management optimisation procedures seem relevant for crops menaced by climate change and climatic hazards including perennial crops providing direct sheltering against radiation in excess and offering indirect services among these such installations are prone to increase the spatial uniformity of the production and to decrease the water demands of the crops with the associated possibility to maintain agricultural activities in otherwise hostile contexts for such purposes the avirrig model can be used i to help in the dimensioning of agrivoltaic installations ii to decipher appropriate piloting strategies for solar panels and iii for irrigation optimisation knowing a global optimisation of agrivoltaic installation will certainly require all three points plus the inclusion of avirrig in

11394,the installation of tilting angle solar panels above agricultural plots provides renewable energy and means of action to dampen some of the effects and hazards of climate change when the panels are properly operated their drop shadow reduces water consumption by the plants as a consequence of alternating shade and sun bands with a short term impact on the stomatal conductance and a global decrease of gas exchanges this urged the development of a new model for crop growth and water budget adapted here from existing literature to handle such transient conditions characterized by short term infra day fluctuations the main difficulty was to combine short term fluctuations in the climatic forcings radiation interception and rain redistribution by the panels and long term agronomic evaluation hence the coexistence of several calculation time steps in model structure all field experiments were conducted on purpose in the agrivoltaic plot of lavalette montpellier france specific adaptations consisted in describing the stomatal behavior of the plants for fluctuating solar radiations and varied water status aiming at improving both the piloting of the solar panels and water management i e the choice of irrigation amounts model simulations have been able to reproduce the expected benefits from agrivoltaic installations for example showing that it is possible to improve land use efficiency and water productivity at once by reducing irrigation amounts by 20 when tolerating a decrease of 10 in yield or alternatively a slight extension of the cropping cycle agrivoltaism appears a solution for the future when facing climate change and the food and energy challenges typically in the rural areas and the developing countries and especially if the procedure presented here proves relevant for other crops and contexts keywords agrivoltaic water budget aet stomatal conductance water productivity land use efficiency 1 introduction the massive use of fossil fuels forbids

in the mediterranean regions at the 2100 horizon as already established by the fao 3 3 food and agriculture organization turral et al 2011 the alarming consequences on the agricultural world consist in an increase of hard to meet water demands by the plants a decrease or a capping of crop yields and a decrease of water availability in regions where irrigation would be necessary or currently allows considerable benefits facing the energy and food challenges agrivoltaism appears as an innovating concept around the world marrou 2012 harinarayana et al 2014 ravi et al 2014 first outlined by goetzberger and zastrow 1982 this concept as defined by dupraz et al 2011 consists of the association on a same land area of agricultural and photovoltaic productions by means of solar panels pv located high enough above the crop to allow agricultural machinery to pass agrivoltaism av therefore deals with symbiotic electric and agricultural productions on the energetic front av may deliver a production of 150 wc per square meter of pv sun r 2014 pers comm on the agronomic front the experiments conducted by marrou 2012 insisted on i the maintenance of crop yield for lettuces irrigated with drip irrigation ii the increase of land use efficiency land equivalent ratio ler and iii the absence of noticeable modifications of the reigning micro meteorological conditions to the exception of radiation water consumption by the crop was reduced by 20 30 under east west pv rows responsible for strong radiative heterogeneities in the north south direction on the soil surface the modus operandi has now changed and the most recent experiments on the lavalette station of irstea 4 4 french national research institute of science and technology for environment and agriculture montpellier france involve tilting angle pv able to revolve around their horizontal rotation axis which finds itself in the north south direction to reduce the unwanted spatial heterogeneities in radiation the installation of such dynamic devices expectedly allows optimizing the shading conditions in function of soil water status weather forecasts plant needs and scheduled or possible irrigations but still this achievement cannot be reached without the derivation of a new model that would predict the effect of the short term fluctuations of climatic forcings radiation interception and rain redistribution by the panels on the long term crop development and agronomic valuation moreover such a model should probably be formulated in a simple enough way to fit within a meta model or a multi model global optimization procedure a first step in this direction was taken by valle et al 2017 who presented the avstudio model that describes the dynamics of the spatial distribution of radiation transmitted to the crops together with a calculation of electricity production from the morphologic adaptation of lettuces under fluctuating radiation conditions number thickness and surface of the leaves the same authors also provided an overall evaluation of agrivoltaic systems in the form of promising values of the ler indicator on the other side elamri et al 2017 have tackled the impact of the tilting angle of the pv on rain redistribution on the soil surface in developing the avrain model this demonstrated the merits of a real time piloting of the pv to reduce the spatial heterogeneities caused by rain interception by these pv this paper therefore aims at complementing the cited developments to remedy the lack of a model that i evaluates the impact of rain redistribution on crop growth yield and water consumption ii evaluates water use and land use efficiencies and iii allows optimizing the shading strategy from soil water status climatic conditions or other controls of interest to be identified later moreover there are clues that the advocated modelling framework should certainly include a description of stomatal conductance to do so this paper also takes advantage of the inaugural works by marrou et al 2013a who noticed the influence of the drop shadow of the pv on the stomatal behavior of the crop but did not consider the link between water availability and photosynthesis pearcy et al 1997 mcausland et al 2016 or stomatal conductance jones 1992 martorell et al 2015 bota et al 2016 the latter rather well documented in the literature see the review of damour et al 2010 numerous models indeed describe stomatal conductance gs in function of soil water status fraction of transpirable soil water and environmental data temperature pressure vapor deficit although acknowledging radiation as the key variable for an accurate prediction of gs however most models do not account for the short term high frequency fluctuations in radiation vialet chabrand 2013 inherent to agrivoltaic installations the aim of this paper is finally to model the water budget and crop growth of irrigated lettuces in agrivoltaic plots for different strategies in piloting the tilting angle pv in addition owing to the effect of a reduction of gaseous exchanges on both photosynthesis and water consumption by the plant stomatal conductance is selected as the key variable to account for the succession of sunny and shaded conditions in particular emphasis is placed on the influence of the pv on the decrease of water consumption by the crop this work is intended as a first step towards a multi variable optimisation piloting of the pv irrigation scheduling of agrivoltaic systems that starts with the derivation of the ad hoc though intended generic enough avirrig water budget and crop growth model adapted from optirrig cheviron et al 2016 2 material and methods 2 1 the agrivoltaic installation of lavalette the agrivoltaic av installation finds itself in the experimental platform of lavalette irstea montpellier france 43 6466 n 3 8715 e and covers a total area of 1720 m² next to a control plot cp of 1120 m² located immediately south of the av plot there is no influence of the solar panels pv on the control plot i e no drop shadow at any time of the day whatever the season the av plot has 4 a v devices fig 1 thus 4 shading methods in which the drop shadow corresponds to a decrease of the incoming solar radiation by 20 50 in average table 1 the two fixed devices half density hd and full density fd were built in 2010 and have been extensively described by marrou 2012 they consist of 0 8 x 1 6 m pv aligned in rows of 22 4 m length in the east west direction 79 n held at 4 m above the ground each row is tilted southwards with a fixed angle of 25 with respect to the horizontal on the fd device the distance between two rows is 1 6 m in the north south direction which was set to match the soil cover ratio or shading rate of traditional photovoltaic plants on the hd device only one row out of two remains and the distance between two rows is 3 2 m marrou 2012 suggested using tilting angle pv with a coverage ratio equivalent to that of the hd fixed device to homogenize radiation maps while the fd device was deemed too penalizing for crop growth either with fixed or tilting angle pv two new dynamic av devices were installed in 2014 termed solar tracking st and controlled tracking ct with the same shading rate as for the hd device installed on each side of the preexisting devices the pv are now 2 x 1 m located 5 m above the ground held by poles forming square arrays of 6 4 m side allowing access for agricultural machinery the length of a pv row is 19 m in the north south direction 369 n the tilting angle of the panels may currently be varied between 50 e and 50 w operated by electrically controlled jacks the st and ct devices are independent and they receive specific setpoint values for their tilting angles in time the st device was thought to maximize radiation interception and the production of electricity and thus the drop shadow on the soil surface by following the sun s course this shading strategy reduces by 35 the transmitted radiation this method of operation is termed tracking 1 axis quite differently the ct device minimizes radiation interception before noon then shades the crops beneath the structure during the hot hours between 9 and 14 h utc later on in the afternoon minimum radiation interception is sought again and the pv are operated to be as parallel to the sun rays as possible this strategy allows homogenization of the transmitted radiation with a reduction of about 20 complementary indications may be found in marrou et al 2013b and valle et al 2017 on the piloting of the pv and its effects on the microclimate with a focus on the transmitted radiation and on the temperature 2 2 crop management and monitoring the madelona variety of romaine lettuce has been tested to evaluate the impact of varying shading conditions in av installations lettuces have been chosen for their short cropping cycle 5 7 weeks allowing two consecutive cycles in spring and summer the choice of the variety has been discussed with local gardeners who advised madelona for its tolerance to the mediterranean climatic conditions and the morphology of its leaves flat leaves make measurement of gaseous exchanges easier the seedlings were planted out in the different av devices as indicated in fig 1 the results of marrou et al 2013c for the fd device suggested not to use this device because of its too restrictive shading rate 50 thought to prevent correct crop growth and development all lettuce beds are placed perpendicular to the pv and comprise 5 rows of lettuces with a distance of 0 3 m between rows fig 2 the beds are 6 3 m long 21 salads for the ct device versus 12 6 m 42 salads for the st and hd devices the installation of 6 beds per device was selected to be representative of each device by providing a sufficient number of salads but also to capture and quantify the north south heterogeneity of radiation reported for the fixed hd device dupraz et al 2011 marrou et al 2013b a block of 6 beds 12 6 m long was also installed as a control plot cp south of the st and hd devices the second one south of the ct device was not used due to soil compaction based on the analysis of soil nitrogen residues 90 nitrogen units were applied before planting out the seedlings the local soil is predominantly deep and silty with a field capacity of 0 27 cm3 cm3 and a wilting point of 0 17 cm3 cm3 hence a 100 mm m 1 storage capacity drip irrigation was used with one dripper 1 l h 1 per lettuce irrigation was daily scheduled so as to re fill the soil at field capacity this permitted to have identical water status for partial harvests and gaseous exchanges measurements two cropping cycles were followed in 2016 under spring and summer conditions table 2 the planting out of lettuces took place in april 20th and july 21st for the sake of the present study four plant characteristics are taken into account and followed to identify whether the fluctuating shading conditions impact them or not root system dynamics of biomass production total matter at harvest and stomatal conductance nine soil samplings 0 30 0 30 x 0 40 m were analyzed 13 days after planting out for the st device 3 samples under pv and 3 between pv and in the cp 3 samples for the summer cropping cycle after rinsing with water the aerial and root biomasses were weighted to indicate their fresh mass and dry mass components root profiles were also made on other lettuces for the st device and in the cp counting roots in the cells of a 2 5 cm grid to identify the rooting depth and width weekly samplings were made for each of the followed devices and in the cp to search for differences in the dynamics of biomass production between the plots these samplings were made at night between 1 and 5 a m far in time from the possible impacts of radiation fluctuations the day before and also to allow equilibrium conditions that is the equalization of the hydric potential between lettuce roots and the nearby soil region sixty lettuces were taken for each sampling for the st device 40 on the cp and for the hd device the sampled lettuces were weighted to have the fresh biomass then taken to the drying oven 60 c during 48 to 72 h to have the dry biomass the remaining lettuces were harvested at 2 dates by sampling systematically 1 plant out of 2 so avoiding to take adjacent plants for each cropping cycle the first harvest took place when maturity was reached on the cp then the second one occurred one week later so that the lettuces cultivated under av devices had also reached maturity all harvests were made at night and weighted as for weekly samples in accordance an indicator of agronomic performance was calculated as the ratio between the number of lettuces whose fresh biomass is above 400 g and the total number of lettuces to gain indications on the proportion of marketable lettuces thicoïpé et al 1997 in the region this ratio usually lies in the 0 7 0 8 range chambre d agriculture languedoc roussillon 2012 the fluctuations of the stomatal conductance of the crop have received attention as they are intended to be essential in the modelling part the purpose here is to quantify the impact of varied shading conditions on the water status of the crop in particular guilioni et al 2000 and on its growth in general chazdon et al 1986 way et al

that accounts for both the radiative and water stresses through their effects on stomatal conductance see section 2 5 3 the use of cp values in eq 1 seemed relevant since marrou et al 2013b showed there was no significant difference in climatic forcings to the exception of radiation within the av installations the argument is assumed here to be valid for all av installations that are small enough to prevent significant aerodynamic effects to occur and create specific local conditions the transmitted global radiation rg on the whole av plot of fig 1 was simulated by the avstudio model developed by the sun r society and presented by valle 2017 2 3 2 soil water status the measurements presented here aim at the parameterisation of the processes taking part in the water budget of the crop to derive an adapted agrivoltaic version of the optirrig model see section 2 5 2 these measurements also help deciding the irrigation strategy as previously mentioned in section 2 2 data acquisition was performed at a 10 minute time step on 8 lettuces for the solar tracking st device and 5 lettuces for the control plot cp two tensiometric probes watermark 253 l soil matric potential

gravimetric method when the tubes were installed 2 4 performance evaluation for agrivoltaic installations 2 4 1 water productivity water productivity wp was defined by pereira et al 2012 and will be used here at the smallest possible scale that of each lettuce water productivity is sometimes defined as the ratio of fresh matter fm to the total actual evapotranspiration aet since we wish to

for equal durations of the cropping cycles or when lettuces biomass has reached 400 g in average 2 4 2 land equivalent ratio ler agrivoltaic installations aim at improving land use efficiency which may be evaluated through the values of the land equivalent ratio ler classically used for associated production systems mead et al 1980 chimonyo et al 2016 and especially in agroforestry dupraz 1998 sereke et al 2015 the ler represents the ratio between the area of the av installation and the sum of the areas that would be necessary to match the agricultural and electric productions of the av installation ler values greater than 1 are therefore sought 6 l e r f m a v f m c p e a v e p v where fmav and fmcp represent here the fresh biomass in the av installation and on the cp control plot while eav and epv account for the electric production of the av installation and for that of a classical photovoltaic installation of equivalent technology e g fixed panels for the hd device and tracking 1 axis for the st device for identical shading rates in the following ler values are calculated either for equal durations of the cropping cycles or when lettuces biomass has reached 400 g in average the electric productions have been estimated with the avstudio model 2 5 derivation of the avirrig model 2 5 1 modelling approach in absence of dedicated validated crop models pertaining to av contexts the principle of parsimony prevailed in the choice of this exploratory modelling approach this required using as many adaptations as needed to account for the main specificities of av contexts while avoiding any risk of overparameterization the choice of degrees days rules to govern crop growth and account for climatic effects at once satisfies this need and so does the option to rely on the existing optirrig model for its simplicity at the necessity to add a procedure that accounts for stomatal conductance variations recognized as a key crop variable in av contexts 2 5 2 stomatal conductance the model presented by jarvis 1976 simplified and used by olioso et al 1996 guilioni 2000 and marrou 2012 was retained to evaluate the effect of the incoming radiation on the stomatal conductance because it describes the mass and energy exchanges involved in the plant atmosphere interactions with a level of complexity affordable here that is with measurable state variables in addition as strong spatial heterogeneities in soil water content are expected to occur in av installations as a consequence of rain redistribution or sheltering by the panels elamri et al 2017 the associated water deficits and their effects on the stomatal conductance should also be taken into account the selected formulation for the stomatal conductance gs is thus that of marrou 2012 to which a linear reduction of gs values has been applied when the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw is below the kftsw threshold 7 g s g s m g s m g s m 1 exp r g k r g min 1 f t s w k f t s w where gs mmol m 2 s 1 is the stomatal conductance whose lower and upper boundaries are gsm and gsm respectively krg is a constant that controls the magnitude of the response low krg values indicate a stronger sensitivity to changes in radiation show clear adaptations even for small changes in rg values and kftsw is the threshold of ftsw values beyond which a reduction of gs has been observed ftsw is the ratio between the available water of the current day and the available water capacity however the above equation is a static model in which no temporal aspect is included the gs stomatal conductance simply appears as a function of rg and ftsw thus with the implicit hypothesis that equilibrium conditions have been reached this is why the dynamics of stomatal conductance modeled by vialet chabrand 2013 have also been included in avirrig especially to account for the short term variations characteristic of av installations the cited model was originally intended to study water use efficiency in oak trees but has then be used to evaluate the stomatal dynamics in assimilating co2 in response to changes in incoming radiation for 13 species among which wheat tomato sorghum and maize mcausland et al 2016 this makes stomatal conductance a function of time 8 g s t g s g s 0 g s e x p t τ where gs mmol m 2 s 1 is the dynamic stomatal conductance t s is time gs0 mmol m 2 s 1 is the previous equilibrium state level of the stomatal conductance gs mmol m 2 s 1 is the target level corresponding to a change in radiation according to eq 7 and τ s is a time constant the exponential term rules the temporal dynamics species characterized by small τ values will quickly respond to changes in the setpoint conductance while delayed and damped responses may be expected for large τ values the choices leading to eqs 7 and 8 were taken to reinforce the operational side of the model because only measurable variables are included rg and ftsw and both the water and radiative stresses are accounted for it should be noted though that eq 8 has to be evaluated at the discrete times of measurement only 2 5 3 calculation loop adapted from the optirrig model the avirrig model suitable for agrivoltaic installations fig 3 leans on the existing optirrig model cheviron et al 2016 and acknowledges its principle of parsimony few parameters are required to run the model which thus may easily fit in external calculation procedures or larger meta models optirrig was adapted from the pilote model mailhol et al 1997 2011 khaledian et al 2009 and built for the generation and optimization of irrigation scenarios e g playing on irrigation amounts decision rules and authorized periods the climatic forcings and key state variables of the model are all measurable quantities forcings rain radiation air temperature reference evapotranspiration variables soil water reserves leaf area index dry matter agricultural yield and the model runs at a daily time step among its main seasonal predictions are the total irrigation amount crop yield the irrigation water use efficiency and a financial evaluation of the irrigation strategy whose comparison allows the multi objective constrained optimization of irrigation scenarios initially devoted to field crops optirrig uses the leaf area index lai as the main descriptor of crop development which was not suitable for the case of lettuces the fraction cover fc was used here instead together with an exponential degrees days rule to describe the evolution of fc with thermal time instead of the logistic like curve used for the lai in pilote and optirrig the formulation selected for fc in function of the tt temperature sum with a base temperature of 3 5 c hypothesizes the existence of a point of symmetry for the fc tt curve whose coordinates are tt0 fc0 in the tt fc plane the fc tt curve is constructed as follows which gives it the symmetrical shape of a tilted s for tt values above tt0 the increase of fc with tt is described with a three parameter model formally the same as for the charge of the capacitor 9 f c t t f c 0 f c m f c 0 1 e x p t t t t 0 τ t in which fc is the fraction cover tt c is the sum of temperature fc0 is the starting value of fc when the sum of temperature is tt0 c and fcm is the maximal setpoint value of fc the curvature of the fc tt curve is controlled by τt c and increases with it on the contrary small τt values result in nearly linear shapes for fc tt the hypothesis of central symmetry with respect to the tt0 fc0 point yields the expression for the fc tt curve for tt values under tt0

for photothermal stresses and ks for the radiative and water stresses through their effects on the dynamics of stomatal conductance both kptr and ks are thus corrective terms to quantify how the fm values in the agrivoltaic plots differ from these in the control plots the formulation of kptr hypothesizes the existence of a reference value for the daily photothermal index obtained in natural conditions on the control plot and penalizes the absolute difference to this value obtained in the artificial av conditions 13 k p t r d 1 p t r d p t r c p p t r c p where ptr mj m 2 c 1 is the

out then fixed the root zone reservoir r2 whose depth increases with root deepening and the deep reservoir r3 whose initial depth is given by a model parameter that indicates the maximal rooting depth classically for such models r3 progressively vanishes as r2 increases in depth the three reservoirs only communicate by drainage d1 from r1 to r2 d2 from r2 to r3 and d3 for deep drainage lost by the profile as no capillary rise is accounted for r1 is filled up by irrigation i or rain p and rain redistribution by the solar panels ppv is described by avrain elamri et al 2017 the partition between

the av installations accounting for the impact of fluctuating shading conditions on crop development and assuming stomatal conductance was the relevant variable to do so avirrig encompasses avrain that describes rain redistribution by the solar panels in function of their piloting strategies e g held flat facing the wind back to the wind or operated in rain avoidance strategies to decrease the spatial heterogeneity of rain amounts on the ground see elamri et al 2017 avirrig may thus be used for strategic assessments that would involve both the decision rules used for irrigation and the algorithms used to operate the solar panels with implications on stomatal conductance on the one side and on rain redistribution on the other side table 3 irrigation and rainfall management this section therefore gives examples of how to use avirrig for ex post evaluations i e for the diagnostic of management practices in the studied av installation which is not yet a proper real time optimisation of the av installations in the course of the cropping seasons the climatic data of summer 2016 were used irrigations were decided from the values of ftsw soon as ftsw fell under 0 6 a given day either from field measurements in scenario 1 or from model predictions in scenarios 2 to 4 an irrigation took place the day after its purpose was to refill r1 and r2 through successive cycles of 3 mm 15 min irrigations two strategies of rain redistribution were also tested the first one was the avoidance strategy that limits the spatial heterogeneity of rain amounts on the ground the second one was to tilt the panels from one extreme position to the opposite extreme position each 6 mm of rain threshold strategy scenario 1 is the reproduction of the experimental 2016 campaign while scenarios 2 3 and 4 rely on an automated piloting of the irrigations to evaluate the associated water savings and heterogeneity in rain redistribution scenario 3 adds the avoidance strategy for rain management for a clear comparison with scenario 2 scenarios 4 adds the threshold strategy for rain management for clear comparisons with scenario 2 the results of all scenarios will be given for 4 positions in the av installation between panels bp under panels up near the aplomb of the west side of the panels pew near the aplomb of their east side pee the target variables for the assessment of all scenarios will be the irrigation amounts and water productivity 3 results 3 1 observations and measurements 3 1 1 radiation and reference evapotranspiration the spatial patterns of radiation rg and reference evapotranspiration et0 were the same in the av installation eq 1 fig 4 the average daily decrease of rg with respect to the control plot cp was 33 for the solar tracking device st 30 for the half density device hd 49 for the full density device fd and 23 for the controlled tracking device ct the expected strong heterogeneity of rg in the north south direction for hd and fd represented 30 of the average rg value versus 5 only for the dynamic devices st ct very close results were obtained for et0 table 4 3 1 2 water consumption and crop development soil water potential was followed by tensiometers fig 5 a down to the maximum rooting depth of the crop 0 3 m for the st device in the bp and up positions with similar results and the cp a larger water consumption was observed in the cp fig 5b coherent by a quicker decrease in soil water potential that fell under 40 kpa possibly responsible for necrosis without incidence on the production of fresh mass bressoud 1997 as expected the partial shading for the st device resulted in less water consumption the estimates of actual evapotranspiration aet based on water consumption the difference in soil water reserve between two consecutive days in the 0 35 cm depth from fdr probes in absence of drainage and knowing capillary rise is very limited show daily averaged decreases of 22 st 26 hd and 19 ct plotted in fig 6 in comparison with rg simulated by avstudio and et0 calculated from eq 1 the decrease in aet values estimated from measurements is coherent with these of rg and et0 for the hd and ct devices which is not exactly the case for the st device where the variations in water reserve have been approximately the same as for the ct device in spite of noticeable differences in the transmitted radiation 67 for st 77 for ct possible explanations are of two kinds there is an impact of some of the fluctuating shading conditions i on the development of the root system or ii on the dynamics of stomatal conductance which in both cases may impact root water uptake the former hypothesis was discarded after root profiles showed very similar rooting depths of about 15 cm 13 days after planting out for the st device and on cp as well as identical ratios 25 between root biomass and the total fresh biomass fig 7 shows the results of weekly samplings for all devices in the av installation also allowing comparisons between the spring and summer cropping cycles on the cp the dynamics are similar between seasons in the sense of roughly similar slopes for the curves in spite of a difference of about 100 degrees days at harvest acquired early in the cropping cycle this similarity may be explained by the occurrence of strong thermal stresses in the summer cycle prone to limit the slope in summer conditions an interesting feature of fig 7 is that the dynamics of biomass production for the ct device resembles these of the hd then st devices successively in accordance with the shading conditions selected for the ct device this seems to outline the adaptation of the crop to varied shading intensities in the course of the cropping cycle as the st device offers 35 less radiation than on the cp 4 shadow bands and periods each day against 20 and 1 shadow band for the ct device finally this physiological adaptation capacity may explain the weak difference in fresh mass between shading strategies at least for short cropping cycles by contrast a significant difference appears in fresh mass between the st hd and ct devices on one side and the cp on the other side for thermal times above 250 degrees days in spring and 450 degrees days in summer error risk 5 associated with delays in crop maturation of about 5 and 7 days in the last days before harvest this is consistent with the decrease of global radiation received by the lettuces table 5 gathers biomass data obtained at the 4 harvest dates 2 in spring and 2 in summer for the cropping cycles of 2016 no significant difference in water content of the lettuces about 95 in all cases was observed in spring a significant decrease in biomass was observed between the agrivoltaic plots and the control plot the average difference was 24 in summer differences also existed between the st ct and hd devices the decrease was 16 for st and ct against 31 for hd with respect to the fresh biomass harvested in the cp the fraction of marketable lettuces stayed roughly constant for st between spring and summer for the second harvest while it decreased by 5 for ct and by 30 for hd the average fresh mass for st ct and hd for the second harvest was approximately the same as the fresh mass on cp for the first harvest date i e maturity reached on the control plot a slight delay takes place between the agrivoltaic installation and the control plot this delay is calculated between days when fm overreaches 450 g in st or ct vs cp which corresponds to a commercial weight of about 400 g the trimming is 50 g measurements perpendicular to the panel rows for the st device have put forward the impact of a decrease in radiation on the values of the stomatal conductance gs fig 8 a complementary measurements made after irrigation had been stopped on a part of the cp have also indicated a linear decrease of gs for ftsw values lower than the threshold kftsw value introduced in eq 7 taken as kftsw 0 55 fig 8b the simulation of gs values from eq 7 where gs was a function of the radiation level only were deemed appropriate on cp fig 9 a a 1 03 r² 0 81 by contrast eq 8 where the dynamics are accounted for was needed for the st device with fluctuating shading conditions fig 9b a 0 89 r² 0 35 3 1 3 performances of the local agrivoltaic installation table 6 gathers water productivity wp scores obtained for the final harvest dates which erases the effect of the 5 7 day maturity delay in the av installation with respect to the cp a complementary evaluation was made by comparing wp scores for similar fresh masses of the lettuces thus for different harvest dates first harvest on the cp second harvest for the av devices st hd and ct when the cropping cycles had the same length harvest 2 section of table 6 irrigation was reduced by 9 st 9 hd and 4 ct in comparison with the cp and the corresponding losses in fresh mass were 18 st 26 hd and 20 ct however as developed later in the discussion the decrease in fresh mass and in aet were of comparable magnitudes and larger than the decrease in irrigation amounts which is a clue that the irrigation strategy was far from optimal in the av installation the reason is that water comfort was ensured most of the times for the st hd and ct devices which was not always the case in the cp however for the present case and not aiming at the optimisation of the irrigation strategy wp was slightly higher on the cp than in the av installation even if lettuces would not support pronounced water deficit it could be possible to play on light water stress conditions to exhibit differences between devices this kind of optimization of the irrigation strategy slightly decreasing irrigation amounts and compensating this decrease with better application rules will better be tested on more stress tolerant crops for similar fresh masses near or above the marketable threshold of 400 g per lettuce in average the relative increases of irrigation amounts were 1 st 1 hd and 6 ct for relative increases of 15 4 and 12 in fm with respect to cp and assuming a 5 7 delay for crop maturity this delay may seem a drawback but can also be seen as a control on crop growth allowing for example to damp the effect of heat periods and limit their impact on the overall production finally for both cropping seasons and all devices tested in the av installation wp values were lower than wpirrig values which may indicate rain amounts were imperfectly accounted for in the design of the irrigation strategy a clear evidence is that comparable irrigation amounts were used in spring and summer in spite of large differences in rain amounts 101 6 vs 36 5 mm but again the purpose was rather to ensure satisfying experimental conditions e g equal water comfort for all devices prior to stomatal conductance measurements than to optimize the irrigation strategy using tensiometers or the predictive capacities of a crop model whatever the cropping season and the tested device the land equivalent ratio ler values were all greater than 1 table 7 this simply indicates that the relative decrease in agricultural production stays smaller than the relative decrease in photovoltaic production due to the tested dimensioning and operation of the panels relative to the classic standards given the weak impact of its shading conditions on crop development and judging from the ler values only see the discussion section on this point the st device offers the best performances slightly before the hd device the latter has lower agricultural performances in summer than in spring despite similar agricultural yields ct does not seem as interesting as st from the ler point of view because of the loss of photovoltaic production associated with the cautious strategy that consists in favoring radiation transmission to the crop the ct device minimizes radiation interception before noon then shades the crops beneath the structure during the hot hours between 9 and 14 h utc the average fm value of lettuces in the av installation matches that of the cp after five to seven days table 5 which results in ler values of 1 50 st and hd and 1 29 ct when averaging over both cropping cycles however the delay of maturity is silenced in this classical use of the ler in spite of possible impacts not always negative though on the short term cropping and marketing strategy as well as on the longer term of cropping rotations this questions the genericity thus relevance of the ler to quantify the performances of av installations at least when used alone as the only indicator for example when only withholding the marketable lettuces at the second harvest date i e 70 of the lettuces on cp the averaged ler values were 1 48 st 1 27 hd and 1 14 ct which still makes st the best strategy judging from the ler values only hd has better performances than ct though clearly less relevant for summer than spring 3 2 modelling results 3 2 1 water budget and crop growth accounting for the spatial heterogeneity of rain redistribution by the solar panels on one side and for the impact of fluctuating shading conditions on stomatal conductance on the other side avirrig yielded satisfying results for soil water budget from planting out to harvest fig 10 a the mean absolute error mae of the model is about 3 mm 8 5 of soil water capacity and the linear correlation coefficients are above 0 9 however the daily step of the model caused temporal errors for rainfalls or irrigations that occurred late in the day a finer discretization time step coupled with a 2 d formulation of the avrain model could circumvent such limitations at the cost of additional development efforts a complementary direction would be to add a description of soil surface status e g crusting to better address the spatial and temporal dynamics of rain redistribution on the soil surface runoff then in the soil ponding especially after strong rain events avirrig simulated biomass production well fig 10b and 10c in the various devices of the av installation slope of regression line between 0 94 and 1 05 mae between 7 and 23 g thanks to the inclusion of the dynamics of stomatal conductance in model structure 3 2 2 performance evaluation for agrivoltaic installations table 8 gathers all simulation results for the management scenarios 1 to 4 see table 3 combining strategies for irrigation and rain redistribution the purpose here is also to initiate the definition of good practices and the search for generic indicators in the evaluation of management scenarios applied to the av installations in a wider sense the present analysis is limited to several of the mattering objective variables i e the total irrigation amount and water productivity wp as the recognized indicator of the appropriateness of water management these are calculated for several positions with respect to the aplomb of the solar panels between panels bp near the west side of panels edge pew near the east side of panels edge pee or under panels up as table 6 table 8 allows two points of view i equivalent durations ed of the cropping cycles in the av installation and on the cp the upper part of table 8 and ii equivalent agricultural yields i e fresh mass fm the lower part of table 8 identical total irrigation amounts of 170 mm were used when applying the default experimental practices or simulating the automated piloting of irrigation on the cp by contrast the variations in irrigation column in table 8 for equivalent fresh masses show multiple different cases depending both on the scenarios 1 to 4 and on the position relative to the panels bp pew up pee the far lower irrigation amounts needed to achieve the same agricultural production in the av installation than in the cp tend to indicate that too much water was delivered to the cp in field experiments and that the threshold level to trigger irrigation was not severe enough in the modelling part scenario 4 consists in the addition of a thresholded rain redistribution strategy to scenario 2 reducing the coefficient of variation that qualifies the spatial heterogeneity of rain amounts under the av structure cv decreased from 0 22 to 0 15 which was not the case in scenario 3 cv increased to 0 32 with a no threshold short term rain avoidance strategy high cv values may have serious implications with respect to the irrigation strategy or soil conservation in the worst cases local runoff and erosion figures 4 discussion 4 1 water consumption for fluctuating shading conditions lettuces grown in the av installation of lavalette irstea montpellier france were never exposed to water stresses throughout the cropping cycles however when precision irrigation e g drip irrigation is possible and in absence of thermal stresses one may expect a larger tolerance of the crop to deficit irrigation strategies for the various av devices than for cp due to decreased aet values caused by the drop shadows of the pv it would be possible then to better face the critical periods heat waves droughts or water deficit by implementing less demanding irrigation strategies while maintaining acceptable yield levels however more stress tolerant crops would be better candidates for such experimentations for the st device the drop shadow of the panels reduced by 33 the et0 level applying the fao 56 procedure eq 1 which was not coherent with estimations drawn from field aet measurements after which the reduction was of about 20 the difference lies in the stomatal conductance of the crop under fluctuating shading conditions at far smaller time scales than that of a day the avirrig model for water budget and crop growth in av installations simulates the soil plant atmosphere exchanges and biomass production with enough accuracy to fit the experimental data combining the effects of rain redistribution by the panels avrain model and these of the fraction of the global radiation transmitted under the panels avstudio model the generation and analysis of multiple rain and irrigation management scenarios with avirrig indicates a 15 20 reduction in irrigation amounts although avirrig was built to be as generic as possible assuming model structure will stay suitable or easily adaptable for other crops field crops and perennial crops the model was only tested in the parameterisation adequate for the vegetative phase of lettuces however it is believed that the crucial features of avirrig are the inclusion of photothermal stresses and that of the dynamics of stomatal conductance and these will be kept for future applications 4 2 crop growth and development panels operation algorithms st and ct resulted in radiation losses of about 35 and 20 for the crop respectively have either led to a significant in the sense of the wilcoxon test loss in agricultural yield or to a delay of a few days for equivalent yields the latter has interesting implications this delay may not be a drawback for strategic commercial reasons and also because it is the counterpart of possibly reduced irrigation amounts and or strategies to attenuate the effects of critical periods e g heat waves on crop development and health although the dynamics of stomatal conductance have received attention here and seem to offer a valuable proxy for crop adaptations i e a descriptor that is closely related to relatively easily measurable quantities and especially soil water status the fine physiological details of crop adaptations to fluctuating shading conditions should be sought among several non modeled processes responsible for example for the number size thickness of the leaves and their specific leaf area the ratio of leaf area to dry mass see marrou et al 2013c valle et al 2017 leaf thickness in particular showed interesting signs of adaptation to the fluctuating shading conditions for example the solar tracking device offered the best performances in the first weeks after the planting out whereas the controlled tracking device necessitated three to four weeks of adaptation to the artificial radiation conditions created see fig 7 the ct curve in summer conditions this suggests that the use of agrivoltaic installations for perennial crops would result in adaptations starting at the budburst when leaves begin to grow if true this is expected then to reduce the delay between maturity in the control plot and maturity in the agrivoltaic installation and also to reduce crop water demands this comes in straight line with the arguments developed by hannah et al 2013 which emphasize agrivoltaism is an appropriate answer to climate change especially for the menaced crops and production basins 4 3 global optimisation of the agrivoltaic installations the implementation of av installations provides multiple challenges and degrees of freedom for a better water management in connection with rain redistribution by the panels and agricultural yield in interplay with the production of photovoltaic energy there is on the one hand the irrigation strategy amounts triggers authorized periods quota and on the other hand the variations in time of the tilting angle of the panels which is the key control exerted on the av installation the control that decides rain redistribution and the fraction of solar radiation transmitted to the crop the optimisation problem is constrained by the climatic forcings and the existence of several variables of interest also with constraints upon them typically the agricultural yield should be y ymin the total irrigation amount should be i imax and the overall strategy should be profitable financial expectations f fmin the future inclusion of avirrig in such optimisation procedures requires further evaluation of its operational abilities the exploratory approach seems enough to captivate at least the first order effects these that should not be missed in describing the physical processes at play while coping with objectives of parsimony this work should be complemented by a thorough sensitivity analysis relying on multiple piloting strategies of the pv and irrigation schemes for example seeking if avirrig is able to discriminate cases in which little differences in system management produce large modifications in commercialization strategy for the final products a sensitivity analysis would relate these changes to the sensitivity of the model to the tilting angle of the panels with time seen through the modeled dynamics of stomatal conductance and related to the sensitivity and accuracy of the associated parameters the avirrig model was built as generic as possible and with such perspectives of global optimisation in mind in particular its deterministic approach makes it compatible with external procedures or meta models that could run avirrig as a slave model however even if the genericity and robustness of avirrig still need to be established and assessed for example through uncertainty and sensitivity analyses the preliminary results gathered in this study could be used as guidelines or starting points for instance the model could be used to estimate the achievable gain on water consumption in the experiments irrigation depth was always sufficient to avoid water stress but considering the ability of avirrig to simulate water uptake by the crops it is possible to adjust the irrigation depth for a given panel operation strategy or to decide both in interplay the ability to simulate also the effect of rain distribution opens the possibility to design and simulate more advanced irrigation strategies however considering that panels could be oriented in real time to minimize heterogeneity after rainfall events elamri et al 2018 it seems easier for farmers to adopt a uniform irrigation depth on the whole plot in an even wider sense the global optimisation of agrivoltaic installations could start with the dimensioning of the installation panels size height and spacing their coverage rate and the position of the panel rows with respect to the crop rows and the assessment of possible options involving the avirrig model in the design procedure as well as base case scenarios for the climatic forcings water and crop management then the global optimisation would certainly involve real time decisions multiple temporal horizons and the several listed variables still including avirrig in the procedure 5 conclusion the recent experimentations conducted on the lavalette platform of irstea montpellier france in 2016 consisted in the association of agricultural lettuces and photovoltaic productions by means of an agrivoltaic installation this installation is termed dynamic as the solar panels may be tilted on purpose around their axis of fixation which allows defining piloting strategies for the panels these rain redistribution operating the panels so as to limit the spatial heterogeneities inherent to rain redistribution by the panels strategies have been crossed with irrigation strategies in simulation ways which resulted in all cases in slightly increased and more uniform water productivity the former is a classical evaluation of agricultural water management while the latter quantified as the ler land equivalent ratio addresses the performances of agrivoltaic installations by summing the ratio of agricultural yield in the agrivoltaic installation to that on the control plots and the ratio of photovoltaic energy produced in the agrivoltaic installation to that of a classic photovoltaic installation of equivalent technology averaging over all tested cases and cropping seasons the ensemble ler value was 1 21 which may be interpreted as 1 21 times the area of the agrivoltaic installation would have been needed to achieve the same agricultural and electric productions if these had been conducted on separated areas however a possible opening of this work is the formulation of a wider agrivoltaic index that could also assess the relevance of water management and crop management options the effect of fluctuating shading conditions on crop growth and development was mainly accounted for through the dynamics of stomatal conductance explicitly included in the derivation of the avirrig model a present limitation is that only the vegetative phase of lettuces was modeled not the reproductive phase stomatal conductance was assumed a relevant proxy of several non modeled plant adaptations since it is measurable closely linked to soil water status and elements already existed in the literature to describe the temporal variations of stomatal conductance in response to changes in climatic conditions somehow the characteristic time of the studied specie in relatively simple terms for some of the tested cases a noticeable physiological adaptation was leaves thickening the mean overall effects of the tested artificial shading conditions were a reduction of plant water demands by 20 a delay in maturity of about 5 7 days in the agrivoltaic installation with respect to the control plot or a decrease of agricultural yield by 15 to 25 both effects were not encountered at once and the delay may not be a drawback as first it could considered as a strategic commercial element and second it is counterbalanced by the possibility offered by agrivoltaic installations to efficiently attenuate the effects of heat waves or drought periods in a wider view and for future research the dynamic agrivoltaic installations if properly operated possibly through global management optimisation procedures seem relevant for crops menaced by climate change and climatic hazards including perennial crops providing direct sheltering against radiation in excess and offering indirect services among these such installations are prone to increase the spatial uniformity of the production and to decrease the water demands of the crops with the associated possibility to maintain agricultural activities in otherwise hostile contexts for such purposes the avirrig model can be used i to help in the dimensioning of agrivoltaic installations ii to decipher appropriate piloting strategies for solar panels and iii for irrigation optimisation knowing a global optimisation of agrivoltaic installation will certainly require all three points plus the inclusion of avirrig in
