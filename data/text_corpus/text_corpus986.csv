4930,frozen depth has a great significance for the foundation engineering in cold regions always showing a high correlation with some attendant engineering phenomena including water aggregation frost heave and salt accumulation to study the heat water dynamics and frozen depth characteristics during the freezing process soils in western jilin province of china a typical seasonal frozen region were selected for investigation a coupled heat and water model was proposed to describe the water heat coupling process during freezing with full consideration of the unfrozen water variation the ice layer formation and the interaction among different elements then the dynamics of the heat water and frozen depth were simulated based on the boundary conditions of temperature variation with reference to the meteorological data the in situ monitoring data from the whole winter were used to analyse the model performance the results show that water content and temperature data match the test data and the root mean square error rmse values of the temperatures within 2 c at different depths were acceptable indicating that the water heat dynamics can predict the maximum frozen depth well in addition the temperature of the soil profile varies rapidly in the first 60 days of winter and the frozen depth continues to increase even though the temperature starts to rise after freezing for 80 days the moisture transfers upwards with the effect of heat flow and the formation of ice occurred mainly at a depth of 1 5 m heat conduction plays an important role in modelling predominantly leading to the hysteresis in the frozen depth variation during freezing this new method can provide a reference for water heat movement and the prediction of the frozen depth during freezing in the saline soil regions keywords freezing saline soil maximum frozen depth mfd water and heat coupling unfrozen water content 1 introduction approximately 35 of the ground worldwide is seasonally frozen xu et al 2010 the soil in permafrost and seasonally frozen ground is a multiphase system which always involves some engineering diseases in geology and the environment tang et al 2018 water a common solvent that can transport different ions and nutrient substances is a key ingredient for life not limited to vegetation such as nitrifiers sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 in some arid and cold regions water is a scarce resource and is always considered for reuse sepehri et al 2020 in recent years increasing attention has been paid to the water and heat coupling in frozen ground engineering the engineering project duration is always limited by the frozen depth of the soil in the seasonally frozen ground some efforts have been made in examining frozen depth monitoring and its relationship with soil climate change ghias et al 2018 perreault and shur 2016 studies assessing the maximum frozen depth mfd have noted that the frozen depth is always affected by the variation in the soil surface temperature chen et al 2019 however the long term monitoring of the seasonally frozen depth in the soil or the active layer thickness in the permafrost region is always limited by the cost of direct measurements thus it is necessary to develop and improve the methods that estimate the frozen depth variations at a certain place using available parameters three types of methods can be used for the determination of frozen depth and simulation of the freezing thawing process namely semiempirical analytical and numerical approaches semiempirical and empirical models relate mfd to some indexes that can be obtained by the experimental coefficients anisimov et al 2002 quinton 2001 the accumulated thermal index method atim hereafter is most commonly used in the semiempirical approach the soil parameters are not required in the algorithm of the atim method whereas the empirical parameters need to be calibrated with site investigation of the mfd resulting in a limitation on temporal and spatial transferability analytical solution schemes always involving soil water content latent heat of water and even the soil properties zhang et al 2008 can be used to evaluate the variation in the thickness of the active layer at a high latitude of permafrost regions and the mfd of seasonally frozen ground regions these methods are always applied with the assistance of a heat transfer equation and the ground temperature zhou et al 2021 the typical analytical methods to predict the frozen depth are the stefan stefan 1891 and derivates solution qin et al 2018 the stefan solution is used in homogeneous ground with certain assumptions based on the stefan solution some efforts and modifications have been made to broaden the applicability hayashi et al 2007 woo et al 2004 apart from the deterministic method of the analytical solution schemes another approach is the stochastic method which has been widely accepted for uncertainty analysis such as the bayesian framework chen and dickens 2009 dai et al 2017 liu et al 2017 however application of the analytical approach requires sufficient evaluation of the site conditions against the original assumption romanovsky and osterkamp 1997 and the coefficient modifications under the complex conditions hayashi et al 2007 moreover a defect existing in most analytical methods is that the hydraulic and thermal parameters used are set as constant carey and woo 2005 woo et al 2004 yi et al 2006 as is the ground temperature or the monthly temperature for instance in a validation of the field sites based on the modified stefan s algorithm the unfrozen water content was adjusted to 5 carey and woo 2005 however the tested result of the unfrozen water content in the field sites had a value range from 0 to 20 rather than a constant value overduin et al 2006 quinton et al 2005 romanovsky and osterkamp 2000 thus the analytical models always ignore the effect of temporal variations and cannot consider freeze thaw dynamics a numerical method is always applied to simulate the water and heat variation of the land surface a soil profile of temperature can always be obtained using the equation of heat transfer in which the conduction is considered basically during the coupled process water migrates in the soil leading to a heat transfer namely convection previous research proved that heat convection is rather important in some cases with sufficient water huang et al 2018 kane et al 2001 and evaporation during freezing and thawing may also play an important role in certain cases wu et al 2016 while many geothermal models do not take soil water into consideration kane et al 2001 ling and zhang 2004 in this study the soil is assumed to be isotropic and the soil water profile is simulated another item that always needs to be considered is the latent heat consumed or released in the process of phase transformation and previous research studies have reported that the latent heat can be treated by two distinct methods ① decoupled energy conservation parameterisation shoop and bigl 1997 zhang et al 2008 this method is always used in ground surface models dai et al 2003 ② apparent heat capacity parameterisation in which the heat capacity is adjusted into the apparent heat capacity and the latent heat can always be expressed using temperature and unfrozen water content nicolsky et al 2007 smirnova et al 2000 this method is always applied in geothermal models moreover different soils have different latent heat during the freezing process and some soil cannot release sufficient heat to affect temperature variation han et al 2018 for the water heat coupled process simulation the unfrozen water content and the heat conductivity of the soil are the basic parameters for both analytical and numerical algorithms in this paper the parameterisation of heat conductivity is referred to as the johansen s parameterisation that is widely used woo et al 2004 yi et al 2006 zhang et al 2018b the importance of the unfrozen water to soil freezing thawing and the soil freezing simulation has been widely reported osterkamp and romanovsky 1997 romanovsky and osterkamp 2000 the unfrozen water content is always assigned as constant in analytical calculations some relationships between the subfreezing soil temperature and unfrozen water content are proposed and can be used in soil numerical simulation such as the power function xu et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 water potential freezing point depression function niu and yang 2006 romanovsky and osterkamp 2000 and segmented linear function zhang et al 2003 since these methods have semiempirical characteristics the specific calibration of the empirical parameters is critical the details of the parameters of unfrozen water content are provided in section 3 as the unfrozen water content is related to the subfreezing soil temperature during freezing a universal method of prediction of unfrozen water content is also applied in this paper which is to directly test the minus temperature that refers to the stabilisation stage on the cooling curve during freezing this value is called the initial freezing point during freezing the soil temperature variation can be divided into several stages fig 1 1 cooling stage in this stage water molecules accumulate under the thermal equilibrium of energy until the first ice crystal is formed the corresponding temperature is tc 2 jumping stage the process of ice crystal formation obeys the law of conservation of energy thus the latent heat of the phase change leads to temperature increases as line ① shows in fig 1 however for some special soils the jumping stage is not obvious shown as line ② 3 stabilization stage ice crystals grow and increase then temperature tends to be stable during the growth of ice dt dt 0 and the corresponding temperature is the frozen temperature t f also called the initial freezing point the initial freezing point can be used to determine the unfrozen water content through the prediction model which is applied in the analysis of this paper 4 degradation stage with temperature decreasing loosely bound water will slip the leash of the soil grains and supply the pore water the supplied water becomes ice again resulting in the attenuation of the bound water film in this stage the released energy is less than stage 3 and the temperature decreases gradually to provide a method to simulate the field water heat movement maximum frozen depth and coupling process for the seasonally frozen saline soil ground this study considered the heat convection induced by the water migration and the latent heat referred to the meteorological temperature data and proposed a coupled heat and water model in addition the unfrozen water content is predicted through a thermometry method and validated by the measured data the model proposed can also determine the frozen depth of the studied area with assistance of the soil texture the results of this paper can provide guidelines for an appropriate model that can implement maximum frozen depth prediction and water heat simulation in the seasonally frozen saline soil ground 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and experimental site the study area is in the centre of the northeast region of china which has a wide plain poor groundwater runoff and shallow underground depth fig 2 according to the characteristics of geological structure the study area had experienced continental sedimentation of the cretaceous and the lacustrine deposits of the quaternary thus soils in the study area show a clayey consistency and silty soil that have the characteristics of sedimentary facies therefore the soil of the profile has similar properties this region has a temperate continental climate including a long dry winter and a torrid summer the meteorological station is representative of the air temperature precipitation evaporation etc of the region the maximum and minimum annual air temperature of the past 30 years are 22 4 c and 20 c respectively the average annual precipitation is 499 mm and the maximum level of precipitation occurs in july the average annual evaporation is 1102 7 mm and the maximum value is in april since this value is influenced by the strong wind in spring soil freezes begin in late october or the beginning of november the maximum frozen depth in the study area is approximately 1 7 1 8 m with a complete thaw in late may gu 2007 zhang 2018 2 2 description of soil features the site sampling and experiment were carried out in the middle of may a typical point of the study area was selected and thereafter a rectangular sampling tank was excavated which is shown in fig 2 b previous research has indicated that the soil studied was silty clay zhang et al 2018b and the soil mineral component within the depth of 2 m is similar since the soil consists of lacustrine deposits hydrometer and sieving methods were applied to determine the soil grain size distribution and the result is shown in table 1 for the soils studied other physical and chemical properties including the physical properties and chemical components wu et al 2020 were also tested as shown in table 2 moreover the soil is classified as lean clay cl on the basis of the unified soil classification system uscs astm 2011 for the soil profile the water content varies with depth considering that the maximum frozen depth of the study area is approximately 1 7 m the water movement at a depth of 1 8 m in the soil profile was explored including at 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 110 130 150 170 and 180 cm during sampling the soil saturation at different depths was evaluated with the assistance of water content soil grain density and void ratio the data indicate that the soils can be divided at the depth of 30 cm as the soil saturation above this position is 80 or less and the saturation of the soil below this position is higher than almost 85 the saturation of the soil sample increases with the depth previous literature reported that the soil can be considered as saturated when the saturation is over 80 thus the soils of the profile are considered saturated when the soil depth is over 30 cm in addition the silt particles of the soil above 30 cm are relatively higher than the silt particles of the soil below 30 cm and more details of the soil profile features can be found in zhang 2018 in addition to investigate the frozen depth the temperatures at several depths 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 m of the sampling point were monitored as well as the frozen depth 2 3 freezing curve of the soil samples as the study area is situated in a typical seasonally frozen region the soil will undergo a typical freezing process every year which results in the seasonal heat water dynamics consequently the soil temperature variation during the freezing process was investigated with a thermometry experiment indoors the experiment was conducted in self designed equipment named integrated simulation platform for freeze thaw test of rock and soil in an integrated environment and the appearance is shown in fig 3 d which can provide the cold regimes before the experiment the soil used was first air dried then ground to obtain the dried soil powders then the soil powders were divided into three parts and then humidified with different amounts of distilled water 20 22 and 30 respectively static compaction was applied for the soil samples remoulding after hermetically mellowing for 18 h as is shown in fig 3 a the final dimensions of the soil sample are 10 cm in height and 8 cm in diameter with the dry density ρ d 1 5 g cm 3 then the soil samples were cured in one temperature chamber at a temperature of 10 1 c for 24 h the chamber is shown in fig 3 d after curing the temperature chamber was adjusted to 15 1 c the experimental setup for measuring the frozen temperature of the soil was guided based on the process proposed by xu et al 2010 before adjusting temperature a soil temperature probe was inserted from the top of each soil column to monitor the soil temperature variation then all the soil columns were put into the temperature chamber which is shown in fig 3 d the probe in fig 3 b is connected to the data recorder as shown in fig 3 c which can record the data automatically consequently the freezing curves are obtained as shown in fig 3 e combined with fig 1 the soil curve characteristic falls into line ① as introduced previously in the stabilization stage ice crystals grow and increase then the temperature tends to be stable during ice growth dt dt 0 and the corresponding temperature is the freezing point t f consequently the freezing points for the soil samples with initial water content of 20 22 and 30 are respectively 3 2 c 2 5 c and 1 5 c kozlowski 2009 had reported that the jumping stage is a macroscopic expression of the sufficient latent heat releases the experimental data indicated that the studied soil could release sufficient latent heat during the freezing process therefore the influence of latent heat on the temperature variation cannot be ignored for the studied soil in the water heat transfer analysis 3 methodology 3 1 soil component idealization soil in the arid land which consists of a solid particle skeleton a liquid phase and a vapor phase is a multiphase geomaterial during freezing phase changes of moisture may occur during freezing to study the dynamic the components were first idealized fig 4 shows the relative contents of different components of the freezing saline soil according to the volume relative relationship if the volume of the soil particles in the soil is 1 the soil void ratio is e the unfrozen water volume is θ u 1 e and the ice volume is e θ u 1 e in addition in frozen soil the mass volume relationship of different components can also be obtained that is e v i v w v s ω u m u m s ρ d m s v ρ s m s v s ρ m v where ρ ρ d ρ s are the density of the soil the density of dry soil and the density of the soil grain respectively e and n are the pore ratio and the porosity respectively m ms mu represent the total soil mass soil particle mass and unfrozen water mass respectively v v w v i and v s represent the volume of the soil mass the volume of the water the volume of ice and the volume of the soil grain ω u is the unfrozen water content moreover θ u is the volumetric content of unfrozen water 3 2 determination of unfrozen water content during the freezing process unfrozen water content is the main factor that is related to the heat water dynamics as mentioned previously the freezing point is related to the unfrozen water content characteristics of a certain soil sample the freezing point of collected soil samples is measured in the laboratory by the temperature method and the equation describing unfrozen water content and the temperature can be derived previous research mainly involved two kinds of empirical functions to determine the ice content and the unfrozen water content respectively the formations of the two functions can be given in eqs 1 and 2 both of which are related to the soil temperature during freezing 1 ω u a t b 2 η i 1 1 t t f α where ω u is the unfrozen water content a and b are experimental parameters and these two parameters are related to the soil texture and can reflect the salt type and salt content η i represents the ratio of ice volume to total pore volume t represents temperature α is an experimental parameter which was suggested as 5 in this study eq 1 was suggested to be used to reflect the soil containing solute therefore determining the unfrozen water content function turns into determining the parameters a and b for that purpose a thermometry experiment was carried out in a cooling process based on the freezing curves these two parameters can be determined in this paper the soil with initial water content of 20 and 30 is used for plotting the line of soil initial water content versus frozen temperature in a log log coordinate the slope of the line was determined by the soil samples with initial water content 20 and 30 then the parameter b is the absolute value of the line slope which can be expressed as the following equation 3 b ln ω u 1 l n ω u 2 ln t f 2 l n t f 1 where ω u 1 and ω u 2 are respectively corresponding to the soil samples with the initial water content of 20 and 30 t f 1 and t f 2 are respectively the corresponding frozen temperature tested in the soil samples the calculation result is b 0 79 according to the recommendation by xu 2010 the parameter a can be determined by α ω 0 t f b substituting this equation into eq 4 gives 4 α ω 0 t f b t b where ω 0 is the initial water content thus for the soil with initial water content of 22 the parameter a 22 t f 22 b 45 53 and b 0 79 thus the unfrozen water content function of temperature can be obtained for heat water dynamic analysis which is given in eq 5 5 ω 0 45 53 t 0 79 to verify the derived equation for unfrozen water content and ensure that the equation can be successfully applied in the coupling analysis the characteristic curve of unfrozen water content with corresponding initial water content was also tested with nuclear magnetic resonance nmr methods the detail about the test can be found in watanabe and mizoguchi 2002 3 3 method for heat water coupling analysis previous researches have indicated that the depth of the frozen ground is determined by the multiphases system coupled soil water heat on the basis of the coupling relationship of heat and water during freezing a novel method for frozen depth prediction is proposed as follows to analyze the soil subjected to freezing a representative elementary volume which is abbreviated as rev hereafter is selected to establish the model for the freezing direction of seasonally frozen soil is from soil surface to the deep it is assumed as vertical one dimensional rev that is the water heat transfer is only considered vertically as is shown in fig 4 the following issues need to be addressed when building a model that is ① the model is assumed to be reasonable and needs to strictly reflect the actual physical process ② select the appropriate variables and make rational use of the equilibrium relationship ③ the model derivation process should be theoretically rigorous ④ the model can ensure the validity and correctness of the simulation calculation therefore before building the model the basic assumptions of the model should be addressed firstly 1 soil in the study area is isotropic homogeneous medium and is considered saturated 2 soil grains is considered as rigid body and their volume cannot change 3 water migration conforms to darcy s law 4 heat is transferred by heat conduction and convection regardless of heat radiation 5 energy transfer media contains soil mineral particles ice and water 6 the salt transport is not considered in the water heat transfer 3 3 1 moisture movement the vertical direction is defined as z coordinate axis then water and heat can only transfer in vertical direction the rev area in the horizontal direction can be difined as da d x d y da d x d y this implies that water can only cross through the top and bottom of rev assuming that the water flux at bottom is q the water flux at a certain position can be expressed as q f z this means that the outflow flux can be obtained by using taylor expansion as following 6 q f z f z f z z d z 2 f z 2 z d z 2 3 f z 3 z d z 3 in which the higher order infinitesimal terms are neglected then it can be expressed as q q f z z d z the mass of water inflow and outflow can be expressed respectively thus water mass variation in the vertical rev is obtained as follows 7 δ m m z i n m z o u t ρ w q z z d z d a δ t according to the conservation law of mass the variation of water mass in unit time is equal to the difference between the inflow and outflow in unit soil thus the equilibrium equation of water flow can be expressed as 8 m t δ t ρ w q z z d z d a δ t in addition the moisture movement consists of water and ice thus 9 m t δ t m i m w t δ t ρ w v w x d z d a δ t in which q z k φ x φ is the water head from the phase compositions diagram the mass of liquid water and ice can be expressed by the volume dv d z d a void ratio e and the unfrozen water volumetric content θ u therefore the corresponding mass of the ice and liquid water can be obtained m i ρ i e θ u 1 e 1 e d z d a m w ρ w θ u d v ρ w θ u d z d a according to the assumptions relation between soil particle volume and the soil volume is v 1 e v s in the rev it can be expressed differential form as follows 10 dv d z d a 1 e d v s 1 e d z s d a in which d z s represents the height of soil particle and da is considered as a constant thus eq 10 can be rearranged as dz 1 e d z s developed on previous model for the saturated soil zhang et al 2018b the phase change was taken into consideration substitute the relative volumes of the soil components into eq 9 the equation of the water movement is given as following 11 ρ w θ u 1 e d z s d a ρ i e θ u 1 e d z s d a t ρ w z k φ z z 1 e d z s d a 3 3 2 heat transfer during the process of freezing in the study area the heat transfer is mainly in vertical direction thus the heat flux in the horizontal direction is ignored and the heat transfer from the bottom to the top is considered which is mainly composed of heat conduction and heat convection as introduced previously the migrated water will be frozen into ice during cooling and latent heat was released in moisture phase transformation the rev is also selected as the micro element within the time of δ t the heat storage change of the vertical rev can be expressed as c t t d z d a δ t and a heat equation can be obtained by the law of conservation of energy as follows 12 c t t d z d a δ t δ q 1 δ q 2 δ q 3 where δ q 1 z λ t z d z d a δ t represents the amount of heat change affected by heat conduction in the vertical rev dv δ q 2 c w k φ z t z d z d a δ t represents amount of heat change that caused by the convective action in the vertical rev δ q 3 l i m i t δ t represents the latent heat amount of ice phase change therefore the heat conservation equation can be written as follows 13 c t t d z d a δ t z λ t z d z d a δ t c w k φ z t z d z d a δ t l i m i t δ t according to the basic assumption of the model the soil grain cannot be compressed thus we can obtain the relationship 14 dv d z d a 1 e d v s 1 e d z s d a substituting eq 14 and relative volume relations into eq 13 and rearranging gives 15 c t t 1 e z λ t x 1 e c w k φ z t z 1 e l z ρ i e θ u 1 e in which λ represents coefficient of thermal conductivity and c represents specific heat capacity of soil these two coefficients are weighted by the different components of the soil body which is related to the relative volume component of the different components of soil the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are suggested to be weighted result lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2018b that is 16 λ λ w θ u λ s 1 1 e λ i e θ u 1 e 1 e c θ u c w 1 1 e c s e θ u 1 e 1 e c i where λw λs λi represent the thermal conductivities of the liquid water soil skeleton particles and the ice respectively kjh 1m 1k 1 cw cs and ci represent the specific heat capacities of liquid water soil skeleton particles and ice respectively kj m3 k 3 3 3 supplementary equations the water transfer is dominated by the driving force for this mixed material which is composed of water vapor water and ice during freezing clapeyron equation is brought in which is used to describe the relation between the temperature and pore pressure thus the driving force induced by heat variation can be comprehensively expressed as the form of pore water pressure zhang et al 2018b zhou and li 2012 as is shown in eq 17 17 u w 1 χ ρ w ρ i p 0 1 χ ρ i ρ w l t t 0 ρ w u 1 χ ρ i χ ρ w in which t 0 is the freezing temperature degrees kelvin l is the phase change latent heat p 0 is the atmospheric pressure pore pressure of soil u χ u w 1 χ u i is the weighted result of pore water pressure uw and pore ice pressure ui and χ θ u 1 e e 1 5 is a function of unfrozen water content the details can be found can be found in o neill and miller 1985 then the driving force in water head formation is as follows 18 φ u w ρ w g for the frozen soil and partly frozen soil it is totally different and difficult to measure the permeability coefficient the value will change with matric suction in unsaturated unfrozen soil which was suggested by gilpin 1980 the calculating formula of permeability coefficient is given as k 0 1 t t 0 β when temperature is below the freezing point in which k 0 is the normal permeability coefficient of the unfrozen soil considering the attendant phenomenon of the seasonal frozen soil during in situ sampling such as ice layer formation the hydraulic conductivity will be influenced because when the ice lenses are mostly formed horizontally in the soil layer which can hinder the water upwards migration and the ice layers formation in this paper referred previous experimental and numerical studies on the ice lenses formation zhang et al 2018b zhou and li 2012 consequently the permeability coefficient is zero when the ice layer is formed thus the permeability coefficient during freezing is given comprehensively as follows 19 k k 0 1 t t 0 β freezing 0 ice layers formed where k 0 is the coefficient of permeability on unfrozen condition β is an empirical coefficient and the ice layers formation can be judged by the void ratio e 3 3 4 numerical implementation as previous researches have indicated that the temperature plays a most important role during water migration process the freezing effect was considered in this research to investigate the maximum frozen depth and process of water heat transfer then subzero section of the air temperature for the study area is sort out as the beginning according to the meteorological data and the data is fitted into a function which is shown in fig 5 all the parameters value calculating the heat water dynamics are listed in table 3 therefore the boundary condition of the soil surface temperature is a variable related to the freezing time the best performance function should be sine function considering the seasonal periodic variation besides the meteorological data indicated that the annual mean daily maximum temperature is 27 8 c while the annual mean daily maximum temperature is 23 4 c to precisely simulate the heat and water transfer process the boundary temperature function is expressed using the unit of day and the fitting function is calculated within 365 days therefore a piecewise function was used in the simulation as is shown in eq 20 20 f t 23 4 s i n π 144 t t 144 d 27 8 s i n π 221 t 77 144 d t 365 d 4 simulation results and discussion 4 1 testing and simulation results as introduced previously unfrozen water content is the most important parameter for frozen soil and the unfrozen water content was determined by testing the soil freezing point the soil freezing points of various initial water contents can be found in fig 3 e fig 6 is composed of two curves one curve is the unfrozen water content curve with the minus temperature tested by the nmr method and the other curve is the prediction curve based on the indoor thermometry experiment the predicted curve fits the testing data well when the temperature is lower than 3 c when the unfrozen water content is over 3 c the unfrozen water can be presumed to be a constant which is equal to the initial soil water content the prediction performance can be evaluated using the root mean square error rmse hereafter and r square r2 the result of rmse is calculated as 1 5 c and r2 0 99 which is acceptable therefore the prediction model of the power function can successfully predict unfrozen water content of the soils in the saline area to simulate the process of soil freezing in the study area and estimate the maximum frozen depth the negative temperature range was applied as the upper boundary condition of temperature the temperature has decreased since november and reaches the lowest value on 16 january in the following year the lowest temperature is almost 23 4 c after approximately the 17th of january the temperature increases gradually and reaches 0 c on the 24th of march moreover previous research reported that the maximum frozen depth of the study area is approximately 1 7 m gu 2007 previous research addressed that the groundwater depth is approximately 3 m thus the simulation height of the model is adjusted to 3 m the physicochemical properties of the soil presented previously indicated that the saturation of soil is higher than 85 when the depth is over 10 cm and for some soils the saturation is even over 90 thus the gas effect on the heat transfer was ignored in the simulation process and the soil mass is assumed to be saturated during freezing the initial condition and boundary condition are simplified and summarized as follows initial conditions the initial temperature was adjusted to 5 c 278 15 k and the initial ice content was zero before the coming winter the initial water content of the soil profile was adjusted to 22 according to the average water content the corresponding void ratio was 0 6 during freezing the top temperature of the soil column is a dynamic temperature boundary that follows eq 20 the bottom boundary of temperature is a dirichlet boundary condition which is 5 c 278 15 k at the beginning of freezing the surficial soil will freeze rapidly resulting in a volume increment of 9 thus the initial void ratio is 0 654 the bottom will not freeze during the whole process and its void ratio is 0 6 freezing depth is defined as the depth at the position of 0 c which is determined by temperature transfer and water migration by solving the model transient temperature distributions of the soil profile at different times are obtained by solving the coupled model of water and heat the temperature of the soil layer at different freezing times is obtained and is given in fig 7 in the freezing process the upper boundary temperature varies with lapsing time resulting in the variation soil temperature distribution as the bottom boundary temperature is assumed to be constant the soil temperature within the 3 m depth varies gradually the temperature of the soil profile can be divided into stages during freezing namely temperature decreasing and temperature increasing as shown in fig 5 upon comparing the surface temperature of the different curves the surface soil temperature decreases first and reaches less than 20 c after approximately 80 days the temperature of the surface increases to 0 c an inflection point can be seen at each curve which divides the curve into two parts see fig 7 the upper zone is the frozen part whereas the deeper zone is the unfrozen part this point can reflect the interface between frozen and unfrozen parts namely reflects the maximum frozen depth at a certain time the temperature gradient of the frozen part is higher than the temperature gradient of the unfrozen part during the decrease in the surface temperature the temperature gradient is lower than the temperature gradient of the unfrozen part after freezing for 140 days moreover the frozen depth is not the maximum even the surface temperature reaches the lowest value after 80 days but the surface temperature increases until the surface temperature reaches 0 c because the heat transfer will consume time leading to a temperature change lag as a result the temperature of the soil profile has hysteresis and the deeper the depth is the more hysteretic the soil temperature is fig 8 shows the water distribution versus depth water in the unfrozen zone migrates up to the frozen part of the soil profile under the temperature difference therefore the water content in the unfrozen part of the soil profile decreases but the water content in the frozen part increases since the unfrozen water content θu is the piecewise function of the temperature t which is affected by the phase change consequently the water content distribution curve is unsmooth the increased position of the water content is the boundary between the frozen part and the unfrozen part namely the freezing front which can reflect the frozen depth after freezing for 100 days massive water migrates to the depth between 1 3 and 1 5 m because the freezing front moves slowly after 100 days resulting in enough time so that water can migrate to the frozen part during the soil vertical sampling process the ice crystals were observed at the depth of approximately 1 5 m see fig 8 because the intensive water migration occurred in this position and formed ice lenses 4 2 model validation and discussion soil parameters including heat conductivity coefficient specific heat and unfrozen water content were first determined the water field and temperature field had been simulated in a previous section in addition the maximum frozen depth was detected in the simulation to verify the correctness of the model field investigations of water content and temperature in the soil profile were conducted the frozen depth data gu 2007 which is monitored by the research fellow in our research group are applied to compare with the simulated results fig 9 shows the water distribution in the simulation and in the experiment after the water was frozen after freezing soil water content within the 1 8 m depth was tested and the water content within the depth of 0 3 1 5 m shows excellent agreement with the simulated results the test data for the water content of the soil sample has a big difference at a depth of 1 5 m the reason for this phenomenon may be that we collect the soil samples by hand excavation and it was difficult to strictly obtain soil involved ice lenses which may lead to the total water content at 1 5 m depth being low however we have seen an ice lens phenomenon at a depth of approximately 1 5 m which confirms that the soil sample with a depth of approximately 1 5 m has the highest water content the water content at the depth of 1 7 1 8 m is lower than the water content of the frozen part because the maximum frozen depth is 1 68 m and the water under this position will migrate upwards resulting in a water content decrement of the unfrozen part in fig 9 some difference between the tested and simulated results within the depth of 30 cm is seen which is induced by the evaporation more details about the evaporation effect of the soil texture and soil water retention can be found in zhang 2018 consequently this model simulated the water heat dynamic well when the depth was deeper than the evaporation influenced depth which was not considered in this modelling however the maximum frozen depth can be successfully obtained based on the water heat coupling process indicating that the frozen depth was predominantly influenced by heat conduction rather than heat convection regardless of the soils at the surface that are affected by the evaporation the soil water content at 40 cm or deeper is used to verify the calculated results the rmse of the water content is 5 8 the difference between simulated results and experimental results is minimal therefore the results of the water content measurement are acceptable temperatures at five typical positions of the soil profile were monitored including the depth of 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m 2 0 m and 2 5 m since the sampling point is far away from the city the data were obtained from november 1 to march 1 by manual observation and the measured data are shown in fig 10 a the continuous data by simulation show good agreement with the measurement the closer that the position is to the soil surface the larger the variation amplitude is while in the deeper position such as 2 5 m the amplitude of the temperature variation is obviously small at the depth of 0 5 m the temperature reaches the lowest on the 41st day in fig 10 a while the temperature almost reaches the lowest on the 83rd day at the position of 1 5 m and the temperature continuously decreases within the whole monitoring period because the temperature variation of the deeper soil has hysteresis resulting from the heat transfer as mentioned above fig 10 b gives the measured and simulated values that are plot along the 1 1 line at the depth ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 m the simulated temperature of the soil compares well with the measured temperature however for the superficial soil layer 0 5 m for instance there is an obvious deviation between the measured and the simulated t as shown in fig 10 the measured t is higher than the simulated t at the depth of 0 5 m a possible explanation about the lower accuracy of the simulated results for the superficial layer of soil is the uncertainty associated with the moisture evaporation salt transport and the corresponding heat transfer which would result in a considerable deviation in the determination of t as reported by li et al 2012 the soil evaporation was estimated by the shaw model but the temperature curve and the water retention also have a certain deviation as reported by zhang et al 2018a the heat convection plays a significant role in the temperature variation when and only if the water content is high in this study the soil in the sampling site was considered as approximately saturated during the simulation therefore at a depth above 50 cm most simulations are slightly below the measured values as shown in fig 10 b from the comparison of the soil at different depths we can deduce that the heat conduction which depends mainly on the relative volume content of the soil grain and moisture plays an important role when the coupled model is applied in soil temperature simulation and mfd prediction in addition the results have shown that the average rmse and r square of the temperature are respectively 2 c and 0 903 therefore the simulation data show good agreement with the measured data thus using the coupled model proposed in this paper to predict the frozen depth is reliable according to the temperature inflection points of the different freezing times in fig 7 the frozen depth of a different time was obtained which is shown in fig 11 a the frozen depth increased as time lapsed within 72 days the frozen depth curve in fig 11 a can be divided into three sections the first section is a rapidly increasing stage in this stage the frozen depth increase shows almost linear growth the second section is a slowly increasing stage the increasing rate of the frozen depth slows gradually and stabilizes after almost 125 days the third section is a bidirectional melting stage in this stage two frozen depths exist in the soil profile induced by an air temperature increment and the heat transfer of the underground water compared with fig 5 the lowest air temperature is at the 72nd day however the frozen depth at the 72nd day is 1 27 m which is not the maximum frozen depth after 72 days the frozen depth continues to increase until the freezing time reaches 144 days this characteristic also introduced in fig 7 is induced by the heat transport and water migration of the soil profile using the model proposed previously the frozen depth during soil thawing can also be obtained and is given in fig 11 a from the third stage the bidirectional frozen depths during melting are calculated and were confirmed in the field investigation gu 2007 li et al 2012 had similar results in their numerical analysis the measured data for the freezing depth throughout the winter were obtained by monitoring the drilled hole and the details can be found in zhang 2018 all measured data are compared with the simulated frozen depths which are mentioned above the simulated and measured data are plotted in fig 11 c along with the 1 1 line after comparing the measured value with the simulated value we can get a 3 average absolute percentage deviation mapd the error may be caused by field measurement the simulated frozen depth compared well to the measured frozen depth in addition the coupled model can also predict frozen depths well during the thawing process the rmse provides useful information regarding the extent of error and evaluating the model performance thus the simulated temperature of the soil at different depths and the frozen depths are verified according to the rmses in table 4 at the depth between 0 5 m and 2 5 m the coupled model can predict soil temperature within 1 5 c rmse for all depths of soils except for the soils above 0 5 m thus the applicability of the coupled model is limited for the soils when the depth is over 0 5 m mainly because the evaporation induced by the solar radiation and the corresponding latent heat transfer of water vapor and salt within 0 5 m depth become increasingly complicated due to the phase state microstructure changing effect zhang et al 2017 suggested that the microstructure and phase change play an important role in the heat water transfer process and salt transport also affects the soil components although the void ratio is considered in this model it reflects partly the microstructure of the soil the pore size distribution is affected by the component variation and the evaporation therefore we believe that the performance of the coupled model could be further improved by better consideration of the microstructure and effect of progressively complicated evaporation moreover the salt content and the associated content variation effect are needed for further improvements of the model moreover to determine the performance of the frozen depth prediction rmse and r squares are also applied the results show that the rmse and r square of the temperature are 0 075 m and 0 985 respectively therefore the simulation data show good agreement with the measured data thus using the coupled model proposed to predict the frozen depth in the saline soil region is reliable 5 conclusions the unfrozen water content of the soil is studied in this paper indicating that the unfrozen water content is influenced by the initial water content and temperature the salt content affects the unfrozen water content significantly the unfrozen water content of the soil is studied in this paper the nmr test result indicated that some water remains in the liquid phase during freezing even if the temperature reaches minus 20 by using the thermometry method the unfrozen water content of the soil with salt can be predicted successfully which proves that the unfrozen water content of the saline soil is a power function of the minus temperature the frozen depth and the movement of the freezing front are affected by both heat transfer and water migration the model proposed in this paper can predict the frozen depth reliably as well as the water heat distribution along the soil profile the model accurately embodies the water heat coupling mechanism the measured data and the simulated data provide a novel theory for frozen depth evaluation considering the heat conduction as well as the heat convection induced by water migration the model was successfully applied in the determination of the water and heat balance simulation of the freezing soil system in the western jilin china saline soil area which includes frozen depth as well as water heat flux the frozen depth is reflected by the freezing front and determined by the temperature inflection point the temperature variation of the soil profile has hysteresis compared with the soil surface temperature variation as a result the frozen depth increases continuously even when the surface temperature reaches the lowest level this study can also provide a reference for studying the mechanism of solute transport and the engineering construction during winter freezing credit authorship contribution statement xudong zhang conceptualization project administration data

4930,frozen depth has a great significance for the foundation engineering in cold regions always showing a high correlation with some attendant engineering phenomena including water aggregation frost heave and salt accumulation to study the heat water dynamics and frozen depth characteristics during the freezing process soils in western jilin province of china a typical seasonal frozen region were selected for investigation a coupled heat and water model was proposed to describe the water heat coupling process during freezing with full consideration of the unfrozen water variation the ice layer formation and the interaction among different elements then the dynamics of the heat water and frozen depth were simulated based on the boundary conditions of temperature variation with reference to the meteorological data the in situ monitoring data from the whole winter were used to analyse the model performance the results show that water content and temperature data match the test data and the root mean square error rmse values of the temperatures within 2 c at different depths were acceptable indicating that the water heat dynamics can predict the maximum frozen depth well in addition the temperature of the soil profile varies rapidly in the first 60 days of winter and the frozen depth continues to increase even though the temperature starts to rise after freezing for 80 days the moisture transfers upwards with the effect of heat flow and the formation of ice occurred mainly at a depth of 1 5 m heat conduction plays an important role in modelling predominantly leading to the hysteresis in the frozen depth variation during freezing this new method can provide a reference for water heat movement and the prediction of the frozen depth during freezing in the saline soil regions keywords freezing saline soil maximum frozen depth mfd water and heat coupling unfrozen water content 1 introduction approximately 35 of the ground worldwide is seasonally frozen xu et al 2010 the soil in permafrost and seasonally frozen ground is a multiphase system which always involves some engineering diseases in geology and the environment tang et al 2018 water a common solvent that can transport different ions and nutrient substances is a key ingredient for life not limited to vegetation such as nitrifiers sepehri and sarrafzadeh 2018 in some arid and cold regions water is a scarce resource and is always considered for reuse sepehri et al 2020 in recent years increasing attention has been paid to the water and heat coupling in frozen ground engineering the engineering project duration is always limited by the frozen depth of the soil in the seasonally frozen ground some efforts have been made in examining frozen depth monitoring and its relationship with soil climate change ghias et al 2018 perreault and shur 2016 studies assessing the maximum frozen depth mfd have noted that the frozen depth is always affected by the variation in the soil surface temperature chen et al 2019 however the long term monitoring of the seasonally frozen depth in the soil or the active layer thickness in the permafrost region is always limited by the cost of direct measurements thus it is necessary to develop and improve the methods that estimate the frozen depth variations at a certain place using available parameters three types of methods can be used for the determination of frozen depth and simulation of the freezing thawing process namely semiempirical analytical and numerical approaches semiempirical and empirical models relate mfd to some indexes that can be obtained by the experimental coefficients anisimov et al 2002 quinton 2001 the accumulated thermal index method atim hereafter is most commonly used in the semiempirical approach the soil parameters are not required in the algorithm of the atim method whereas the empirical parameters need to be calibrated with site investigation of the mfd resulting in a limitation on temporal and spatial transferability analytical solution schemes always involving soil water content latent heat of water and even the soil properties zhang et al 2008 can be used to evaluate the variation in the thickness of the active layer at a high latitude of permafrost regions and the mfd of seasonally frozen ground regions these methods are always applied with the assistance of a heat transfer equation and the ground temperature zhou et al 2021 the typical analytical methods to predict the frozen depth are the stefan stefan 1891 and derivates solution qin et al 2018 the stefan solution is used in homogeneous ground with certain assumptions based on the stefan solution some efforts and modifications have been made to broaden the applicability hayashi et al 2007 woo et al 2004 apart from the deterministic method of the analytical solution schemes another approach is the stochastic method which has been widely accepted for uncertainty analysis such as the bayesian framework chen and dickens 2009 dai et al 2017 liu et al 2017 however application of the analytical approach requires sufficient evaluation of the site conditions against the original assumption romanovsky and osterkamp 1997 and the coefficient modifications under the complex conditions hayashi et al 2007 moreover a defect existing in most analytical methods is that the hydraulic and thermal parameters used are set as constant carey and woo 2005 woo et al 2004 yi et al 2006 as is the ground temperature or the monthly temperature for instance in a validation of the field sites based on the modified stefan s algorithm the unfrozen water content was adjusted to 5 carey and woo 2005 however the tested result of the unfrozen water content in the field sites had a value range from 0 to 20 rather than a constant value overduin et al 2006 quinton et al 2005 romanovsky and osterkamp 2000 thus the analytical models always ignore the effect of temporal variations and cannot consider freeze thaw dynamics a numerical method is always applied to simulate the water and heat variation of the land surface a soil profile of temperature can always be obtained using the equation of heat transfer in which the conduction is considered basically during the coupled process water migrates in the soil leading to a heat transfer namely convection previous research proved that heat convection is rather important in some cases with sufficient water huang et al 2018 kane et al 2001 and evaporation during freezing and thawing may also play an important role in certain cases wu et al 2016 while many geothermal models do not take soil water into consideration kane et al 2001 ling and zhang 2004 in this study the soil is assumed to be isotropic and the soil water profile is simulated another item that always needs to be considered is the latent heat consumed or released in the process of phase transformation and previous research studies have reported that the latent heat can be treated by two distinct methods ① decoupled energy conservation parameterisation shoop and bigl 1997 zhang et al 2008 this method is always used in ground surface models dai et al 2003 ② apparent heat capacity parameterisation in which the heat capacity is adjusted into the apparent heat capacity and the latent heat can always be expressed using temperature and unfrozen water content nicolsky et al 2007 smirnova et al 2000 this method is always applied in geothermal models moreover different soils have different latent heat during the freezing process and some soil cannot release sufficient heat to affect temperature variation han et al 2018 for the water heat coupled process simulation the unfrozen water content and the heat conductivity of the soil are the basic parameters for both analytical and numerical algorithms in this paper the parameterisation of heat conductivity is referred to as the johansen s parameterisation that is widely used woo et al 2004 yi et al 2006 zhang et al 2018b the importance of the unfrozen water to soil freezing thawing and the soil freezing simulation has been widely reported osterkamp and romanovsky 1997 romanovsky and osterkamp 2000 the unfrozen water content is always assigned as constant in analytical calculations some relationships between the subfreezing soil temperature and unfrozen water content are proposed and can be used in soil numerical simulation such as the power function xu et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 water potential freezing point depression function niu and yang 2006 romanovsky and osterkamp 2000 and segmented linear function zhang et al 2003 since these methods have semiempirical characteristics the specific calibration of the empirical parameters is critical the details of the parameters of unfrozen water content are provided in section 3 as the unfrozen water content is related to the subfreezing soil temperature during freezing a universal method of prediction of unfrozen water content is also applied in this paper which is to directly test the minus temperature that refers to the stabilisation stage on the cooling curve during freezing this value is called the initial freezing point during freezing the soil temperature variation can be divided into several stages fig 1 1 cooling stage in this stage water molecules accumulate under the thermal equilibrium of energy until the first ice crystal is formed the corresponding temperature is tc 2 jumping stage the process of ice crystal formation obeys the law of conservation of energy thus the latent heat of the phase change leads to temperature increases as line ① shows in fig 1 however for some special soils the jumping stage is not obvious shown as line ② 3 stabilization stage ice crystals grow and increase then temperature tends to be stable during the growth of ice dt dt 0 and the corresponding temperature is the frozen temperature t f also called the initial freezing point the initial freezing point can be used to determine the unfrozen water content through the prediction model which is applied in the analysis of this paper 4 degradation stage with temperature decreasing loosely bound water will slip the leash of the soil grains and supply the pore water the supplied water becomes ice again resulting in the attenuation of the bound water film in this stage the released energy is less than stage 3 and the temperature decreases gradually to provide a method to simulate the field water heat movement maximum frozen depth and coupling process for the seasonally frozen saline soil ground this study considered the heat convection induced by the water migration and the latent heat referred to the meteorological temperature data and proposed a coupled heat and water model in addition the unfrozen water content is predicted through a thermometry method and validated by the measured data the model proposed can also determine the frozen depth of the studied area with assistance of the soil texture the results of this paper can provide guidelines for an appropriate model that can implement maximum frozen depth prediction and water heat simulation in the seasonally frozen saline soil ground 2 study area and data 2 1 study area and experimental site the study area is in the centre of the northeast region of china which has a wide plain poor groundwater runoff and shallow underground depth fig 2 according to the characteristics of geological structure the study area had experienced continental sedimentation of the cretaceous and the lacustrine deposits of the quaternary thus soils in the study area show a clayey consistency and silty soil that have the characteristics of sedimentary facies therefore the soil of the profile has similar properties this region has a temperate continental climate including a long dry winter and a torrid summer the meteorological station is representative of the air temperature precipitation evaporation etc of the region the maximum and minimum annual air temperature of the past 30 years are 22 4 c and 20 c respectively the average annual precipitation is 499 mm and the maximum level of precipitation occurs in july the average annual evaporation is 1102 7 mm and the maximum value is in april since this value is influenced by the strong wind in spring soil freezes begin in late october or the beginning of november the maximum frozen depth in the study area is approximately 1 7 1 8 m with a complete thaw in late may gu 2007 zhang 2018 2 2 description of soil features the site sampling and experiment were carried out in the middle of may a typical point of the study area was selected and thereafter a rectangular sampling tank was excavated which is shown in fig 2 b previous research has indicated that the soil studied was silty clay zhang et al 2018b and the soil mineral component within the depth of 2 m is similar since the soil consists of lacustrine deposits hydrometer and sieving methods were applied to determine the soil grain size distribution and the result is shown in table 1 for the soils studied other physical and chemical properties including the physical properties and chemical components wu et al 2020 were also tested as shown in table 2 moreover the soil is classified as lean clay cl on the basis of the unified soil classification system uscs astm 2011 for the soil profile the water content varies with depth considering that the maximum frozen depth of the study area is approximately 1 7 m the water movement at a depth of 1 8 m in the soil profile was explored including at 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 110 130 150 170 and 180 cm during sampling the soil saturation at different depths was evaluated with the assistance of water content soil grain density and void ratio the data indicate that the soils can be divided at the depth of 30 cm as the soil saturation above this position is 80 or less and the saturation of the soil below this position is higher than almost 85 the saturation of the soil sample increases with the depth previous literature reported that the soil can be considered as saturated when the saturation is over 80 thus the soils of the profile are considered saturated when the soil depth is over 30 cm in addition the silt particles of the soil above 30 cm are relatively higher than the silt particles of the soil below 30 cm and more details of the soil profile features can be found in zhang 2018 in addition to investigate the frozen depth the temperatures at several depths 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 and 2 5 m of the sampling point were monitored as well as the frozen depth 2 3 freezing curve of the soil samples as the study area is situated in a typical seasonally frozen region the soil will undergo a typical freezing process every year which results in the seasonal heat water dynamics consequently the soil temperature variation during the freezing process was investigated with a thermometry experiment indoors the experiment was conducted in self designed equipment named integrated simulation platform for freeze thaw test of rock and soil in an integrated environment and the appearance is shown in fig 3 d which can provide the cold regimes before the experiment the soil used was first air dried then ground to obtain the dried soil powders then the soil powders were divided into three parts and then humidified with different amounts of distilled water 20 22 and 30 respectively static compaction was applied for the soil samples remoulding after hermetically mellowing for 18 h as is shown in fig 3 a the final dimensions of the soil sample are 10 cm in height and 8 cm in diameter with the dry density ρ d 1 5 g cm 3 then the soil samples were cured in one temperature chamber at a temperature of 10 1 c for 24 h the chamber is shown in fig 3 d after curing the temperature chamber was adjusted to 15 1 c the experimental setup for measuring the frozen temperature of the soil was guided based on the process proposed by xu et al 2010 before adjusting temperature a soil temperature probe was inserted from the top of each soil column to monitor the soil temperature variation then all the soil columns were put into the temperature chamber which is shown in fig 3 d the probe in fig 3 b is connected to the data recorder as shown in fig 3 c which can record the data automatically consequently the freezing curves are obtained as shown in fig 3 e combined with fig 1 the soil curve characteristic falls into line ① as introduced previously in the stabilization stage ice crystals grow and increase then the temperature tends to be stable during ice growth dt dt 0 and the corresponding temperature is the freezing point t f consequently the freezing points for the soil samples with initial water content of 20 22 and 30 are respectively 3 2 c 2 5 c and 1 5 c kozlowski 2009 had reported that the jumping stage is a macroscopic expression of the sufficient latent heat releases the experimental data indicated that the studied soil could release sufficient latent heat during the freezing process therefore the influence of latent heat on the temperature variation cannot be ignored for the studied soil in the water heat transfer analysis 3 methodology 3 1 soil component idealization soil in the arid land which consists of a solid particle skeleton a liquid phase and a vapor phase is a multiphase geomaterial during freezing phase changes of moisture may occur during freezing to study the dynamic the components were first idealized fig 4 shows the relative contents of different components of the freezing saline soil according to the volume relative relationship if the volume of the soil particles in the soil is 1 the soil void ratio is e the unfrozen water volume is θ u 1 e and the ice volume is e θ u 1 e in addition in frozen soil the mass volume relationship of different components can also be obtained that is e v i v w v s ω u m u m s ρ d m s v ρ s m s v s ρ m v where ρ ρ d ρ s are the density of the soil the density of dry soil and the density of the soil grain respectively e and n are the pore ratio and the porosity respectively m ms mu represent the total soil mass soil particle mass and unfrozen water mass respectively v v w v i and v s represent the volume of the soil mass the volume of the water the volume of ice and the volume of the soil grain ω u is the unfrozen water content moreover θ u is the volumetric content of unfrozen water 3 2 determination of unfrozen water content during the freezing process unfrozen water content is the main factor that is related to the heat water dynamics as mentioned previously the freezing point is related to the unfrozen water content characteristics of a certain soil sample the freezing point of collected soil samples is measured in the laboratory by the temperature method and the equation describing unfrozen water content and the temperature can be derived previous research mainly involved two kinds of empirical functions to determine the ice content and the unfrozen water content respectively the formations of the two functions can be given in eqs 1 and 2 both of which are related to the soil temperature during freezing 1 ω u a t b 2 η i 1 1 t t f α where ω u is the unfrozen water content a and b are experimental parameters and these two parameters are related to the soil texture and can reflect the salt type and salt content η i represents the ratio of ice volume to total pore volume t represents temperature α is an experimental parameter which was suggested as 5 in this study eq 1 was suggested to be used to reflect the soil containing solute therefore determining the unfrozen water content function turns into determining the parameters a and b for that purpose a thermometry experiment was carried out in a cooling process based on the freezing curves these two parameters can be determined in this paper the soil with initial water content of 20 and 30 is used for plotting the line of soil initial water content versus frozen temperature in a log log coordinate the slope of the line was determined by the soil samples with initial water content 20 and 30 then the parameter b is the absolute value of the line slope which can be expressed as the following equation 3 b ln ω u 1 l n ω u 2 ln t f 2 l n t f 1 where ω u 1 and ω u 2 are respectively corresponding to the soil samples with the initial water content of 20 and 30 t f 1 and t f 2 are respectively the corresponding frozen temperature tested in the soil samples the calculation result is b 0 79 according to the recommendation by xu 2010 the parameter a can be determined by α ω 0 t f b substituting this equation into eq 4 gives 4 α ω 0 t f b t b where ω 0 is the initial water content thus for the soil with initial water content of 22 the parameter a 22 t f 22 b 45 53 and b 0 79 thus the unfrozen water content function of temperature can be obtained for heat water dynamic analysis which is given in eq 5 5 ω 0 45 53 t 0 79 to verify the derived equation for unfrozen water content and ensure that the equation can be successfully applied in the coupling analysis the characteristic curve of unfrozen water content with corresponding initial water content was also tested with nuclear magnetic resonance nmr methods the detail about the test can be found in watanabe and mizoguchi 2002 3 3 method for heat water coupling analysis previous researches have indicated that the depth of the frozen ground is determined by the multiphases system coupled soil water heat on the basis of the coupling relationship of heat and water during freezing a novel method for frozen depth prediction is proposed as follows to analyze the soil subjected to freezing a representative elementary volume which is abbreviated as rev hereafter is selected to establish the model for the freezing direction of seasonally frozen soil is from soil surface to the deep it is assumed as vertical one dimensional rev that is the water heat transfer is only considered vertically as is shown in fig 4 the following issues need to be addressed when building a model that is ① the model is assumed to be reasonable and needs to strictly reflect the actual physical process ② select the appropriate variables and make rational use of the equilibrium relationship ③ the model derivation process should be theoretically rigorous ④ the model can ensure the validity and correctness of the simulation calculation therefore before building the model the basic assumptions of the model should be addressed firstly 1 soil in the study area is isotropic homogeneous medium and is considered saturated 2 soil grains is considered as rigid body and their volume cannot change 3 water migration conforms to darcy s law 4 heat is transferred by heat conduction and convection regardless of heat radiation 5 energy transfer media contains soil mineral particles ice and water 6 the salt transport is not considered in the water heat transfer 3 3 1 moisture movement the vertical direction is defined as z coordinate axis then water and heat can only transfer in vertical direction the rev area in the horizontal direction can be difined as da d x d y da d x d y this implies that water can only cross through the top and bottom of rev assuming that the water flux at bottom is q the water flux at a certain position can be expressed as q f z this means that the outflow flux can be obtained by using taylor expansion as following 6 q f z f z f z z d z 2 f z 2 z d z 2 3 f z 3 z d z 3 in which the higher order infinitesimal terms are neglected then it can be expressed as q q f z z d z the mass of water inflow and outflow can be expressed respectively thus water mass variation in the vertical rev is obtained as follows 7 δ m m z i n m z o u t ρ w q z z d z d a δ t according to the conservation law of mass the variation of water mass in unit time is equal to the difference between the inflow and outflow in unit soil thus the equilibrium equation of water flow can be expressed as 8 m t δ t ρ w q z z d z d a δ t in addition the moisture movement consists of water and ice thus 9 m t δ t m i m w t δ t ρ w v w x d z d a δ t in which q z k φ x φ is the water head from the phase compositions diagram the mass of liquid water and ice can be expressed by the volume dv d z d a void ratio e and the unfrozen water volumetric content θ u therefore the corresponding mass of the ice and liquid water can be obtained m i ρ i e θ u 1 e 1 e d z d a m w ρ w θ u d v ρ w θ u d z d a according to the assumptions relation between soil particle volume and the soil volume is v 1 e v s in the rev it can be expressed differential form as follows 10 dv d z d a 1 e d v s 1 e d z s d a in which d z s represents the height of soil particle and da is considered as a constant thus eq 10 can be rearranged as dz 1 e d z s developed on previous model for the saturated soil zhang et al 2018b the phase change was taken into consideration substitute the relative volumes of the soil components into eq 9 the equation of the water movement is given as following 11 ρ w θ u 1 e d z s d a ρ i e θ u 1 e d z s d a t ρ w z k φ z z 1 e d z s d a 3 3 2 heat transfer during the process of freezing in the study area the heat transfer is mainly in vertical direction thus the heat flux in the horizontal direction is ignored and the heat transfer from the bottom to the top is considered which is mainly composed of heat conduction and heat convection as introduced previously the migrated water will be frozen into ice during cooling and latent heat was released in moisture phase transformation the rev is also selected as the micro element within the time of δ t the heat storage change of the vertical rev can be expressed as c t t d z d a δ t and a heat equation can be obtained by the law of conservation of energy as follows 12 c t t d z d a δ t δ q 1 δ q 2 δ q 3 where δ q 1 z λ t z d z d a δ t represents the amount of heat change affected by heat conduction in the vertical rev dv δ q 2 c w k φ z t z d z d a δ t represents amount of heat change that caused by the convective action in the vertical rev δ q 3 l i m i t δ t represents the latent heat amount of ice phase change therefore the heat conservation equation can be written as follows 13 c t t d z d a δ t z λ t z d z d a δ t c w k φ z t z d z d a δ t l i m i t δ t according to the basic assumption of the model the soil grain cannot be compressed thus we can obtain the relationship 14 dv d z d a 1 e d v s 1 e d z s d a substituting eq 14 and relative volume relations into eq 13 and rearranging gives 15 c t t 1 e z λ t x 1 e c w k φ z t z 1 e l z ρ i e θ u 1 e in which λ represents coefficient of thermal conductivity and c represents specific heat capacity of soil these two coefficients are weighted by the different components of the soil body which is related to the relative volume component of the different components of soil the thermal conductivity and specific heat capacity are suggested to be weighted result lai et al 2014 zhang et al 2018b that is 16 λ λ w θ u λ s 1 1 e λ i e θ u 1 e 1 e c θ u c w 1 1 e c s e θ u 1 e 1 e c i where λw λs λi represent the thermal conductivities of the liquid water soil skeleton particles and the ice respectively kjh 1m 1k 1 cw cs and ci represent the specific heat capacities of liquid water soil skeleton particles and ice respectively kj m3 k 3 3 3 supplementary equations the water transfer is dominated by the driving force for this mixed material which is composed of water vapor water and ice during freezing clapeyron equation is brought in which is used to describe the relation between the temperature and pore pressure thus the driving force induced by heat variation can be comprehensively expressed as the form of pore water pressure zhang et al 2018b zhou and li 2012 as is shown in eq 17 17 u w 1 χ ρ w ρ i p 0 1 χ ρ i ρ w l t t 0 ρ w u 1 χ ρ i χ ρ w in which t 0 is the freezing temperature degrees kelvin l is the phase change latent heat p 0 is the atmospheric pressure pore pressure of soil u χ u w 1 χ u i is the weighted result of pore water pressure uw and pore ice pressure ui and χ θ u 1 e e 1 5 is a function of unfrozen water content the details can be found can be found in o neill and miller 1985 then the driving force in water head formation is as follows 18 φ u w ρ w g for the frozen soil and partly frozen soil it is totally different and difficult to measure the permeability coefficient the value will change with matric suction in unsaturated unfrozen soil which was suggested by gilpin 1980 the calculating formula of permeability coefficient is given as k 0 1 t t 0 β when temperature is below the freezing point in which k 0 is the normal permeability coefficient of the unfrozen soil considering the attendant phenomenon of the seasonal frozen soil during in situ sampling such as ice layer formation the hydraulic conductivity will be influenced because when the ice lenses are mostly formed horizontally in the soil layer which can hinder the water upwards migration and the ice layers formation in this paper referred previous experimental and numerical studies on the ice lenses formation zhang et al 2018b zhou and li 2012 consequently the permeability coefficient is zero when the ice layer is formed thus the permeability coefficient during freezing is given comprehensively as follows 19 k k 0 1 t t 0 β freezing 0 ice layers formed where k 0 is the coefficient of permeability on unfrozen condition β is an empirical coefficient and the ice layers formation can be judged by the void ratio e 3 3 4 numerical implementation as previous researches have indicated that the temperature plays a most important role during water migration process the freezing effect was considered in this research to investigate the maximum frozen depth and process of water heat transfer then subzero section of the air temperature for the study area is sort out as the beginning according to the meteorological data and the data is fitted into a function which is shown in fig 5 all the parameters value calculating the heat water dynamics are listed in table 3 therefore the boundary condition of the soil surface temperature is a variable related to the freezing time the best performance function should be sine function considering the seasonal periodic variation besides the meteorological data indicated that the annual mean daily maximum temperature is 27 8 c while the annual mean daily maximum temperature is 23 4 c to precisely simulate the heat and water transfer process the boundary temperature function is expressed using the unit of day and the fitting function is calculated within 365 days therefore a piecewise function was used in the simulation as is shown in eq 20 20 f t 23 4 s i n π 144 t t 144 d 27 8 s i n π 221 t 77 144 d t 365 d 4 simulation results and discussion 4 1 testing and simulation results as introduced previously unfrozen water content is the most important parameter for frozen soil and the unfrozen water content was determined by testing the soil freezing point the soil freezing points of various initial water contents can be found in fig 3 e fig 6 is composed of two curves one curve is the unfrozen water content curve with the minus temperature tested by the nmr method and the other curve is the prediction curve based on the indoor thermometry experiment the predicted curve fits the testing data well when the temperature is lower than 3 c when the unfrozen water content is over 3 c the unfrozen water can be presumed to be a constant which is equal to the initial soil water content the prediction performance can be evaluated using the root mean square error rmse hereafter and r square r2 the result of rmse is calculated as 1 5 c and r2 0 99 which is acceptable therefore the prediction model of the power function can successfully predict unfrozen water content of the soils in the saline area to simulate the process of soil freezing in the study area and estimate the maximum frozen depth the negative temperature range was applied as the upper boundary condition of temperature the temperature has decreased since november and reaches the lowest value on 16 january in the following year the lowest temperature is almost 23 4 c after approximately the 17th of january the temperature increases gradually and reaches 0 c on the 24th of march moreover previous research reported that the maximum frozen depth of the study area is approximately 1 7 m gu 2007 previous research addressed that the groundwater depth is approximately 3 m thus the simulation height of the model is adjusted to 3 m the physicochemical properties of the soil presented previously indicated that the saturation of soil is higher than 85 when the depth is over 10 cm and for some soils the saturation is even over 90 thus the gas effect on the heat transfer was ignored in the simulation process and the soil mass is assumed to be saturated during freezing the initial condition and boundary condition are simplified and summarized as follows initial conditions the initial temperature was adjusted to 5 c 278 15 k and the initial ice content was zero before the coming winter the initial water content of the soil profile was adjusted to 22 according to the average water content the corresponding void ratio was 0 6 during freezing the top temperature of the soil column is a dynamic temperature boundary that follows eq 20 the bottom boundary of temperature is a dirichlet boundary condition which is 5 c 278 15 k at the beginning of freezing the surficial soil will freeze rapidly resulting in a volume increment of 9 thus the initial void ratio is 0 654 the bottom will not freeze during the whole process and its void ratio is 0 6 freezing depth is defined as the depth at the position of 0 c which is determined by temperature transfer and water migration by solving the model transient temperature distributions of the soil profile at different times are obtained by solving the coupled model of water and heat the temperature of the soil layer at different freezing times is obtained and is given in fig 7 in the freezing process the upper boundary temperature varies with lapsing time resulting in the variation soil temperature distribution as the bottom boundary temperature is assumed to be constant the soil temperature within the 3 m depth varies gradually the temperature of the soil profile can be divided into stages during freezing namely temperature decreasing and temperature increasing as shown in fig 5 upon comparing the surface temperature of the different curves the surface soil temperature decreases first and reaches less than 20 c after approximately 80 days the temperature of the surface increases to 0 c an inflection point can be seen at each curve which divides the curve into two parts see fig 7 the upper zone is the frozen part whereas the deeper zone is the unfrozen part this point can reflect the interface between frozen and unfrozen parts namely reflects the maximum frozen depth at a certain time the temperature gradient of the frozen part is higher than the temperature gradient of the unfrozen part during the decrease in the surface temperature the temperature gradient is lower than the temperature gradient of the unfrozen part after freezing for 140 days moreover the frozen depth is not the maximum even the surface temperature reaches the lowest value after 80 days but the surface temperature increases until the surface temperature reaches 0 c because the heat transfer will consume time leading to a temperature change lag as a result the temperature of the soil profile has hysteresis and the deeper the depth is the more hysteretic the soil temperature is fig 8 shows the water distribution versus depth water in the unfrozen zone migrates up to the frozen part of the soil profile under the temperature difference therefore the water content in the unfrozen part of the soil profile decreases but the water content in the frozen part increases since the unfrozen water content θu is the piecewise function of the temperature t which is affected by the phase change consequently the water content distribution curve is unsmooth the increased position of the water content is the boundary between the frozen part and the unfrozen part namely the freezing front which can reflect the frozen depth after freezing for 100 days massive water migrates to the depth between 1 3 and 1 5 m because the freezing front moves slowly after 100 days resulting in enough time so that water can migrate to the frozen part during the soil vertical sampling process the ice crystals were observed at the depth of approximately 1 5 m see fig 8 because the intensive water migration occurred in this position and formed ice lenses 4 2 model validation and discussion soil parameters including heat conductivity coefficient specific heat and unfrozen water content were first determined the water field and temperature field had been simulated in a previous section in addition the maximum frozen depth was detected in the simulation to verify the correctness of the model field investigations of water content and temperature in the soil profile were conducted the frozen depth data gu 2007 which is monitored by the research fellow in our research group are applied to compare with the simulated results fig 9 shows the water distribution in the simulation and in the experiment after the water was frozen after freezing soil water content within the 1 8 m depth was tested and the water content within the depth of 0 3 1 5 m shows excellent agreement with the simulated results the test data for the water content of the soil sample has a big difference at a depth of 1 5 m the reason for this phenomenon may be that we collect the soil samples by hand excavation and it was difficult to strictly obtain soil involved ice lenses which may lead to the total water content at 1 5 m depth being low however we have seen an ice lens phenomenon at a depth of approximately 1 5 m which confirms that the soil sample with a depth of approximately 1 5 m has the highest water content the water content at the depth of 1 7 1 8 m is lower than the water content of the frozen part because the maximum frozen depth is 1 68 m and the water under this position will migrate upwards resulting in a water content decrement of the unfrozen part in fig 9 some difference between the tested and simulated results within the depth of 30 cm is seen which is induced by the evaporation more details about the evaporation effect of the soil texture and soil water retention can be found in zhang 2018 consequently this model simulated the water heat dynamic well when the depth was deeper than the evaporation influenced depth which was not considered in this modelling however the maximum frozen depth can be successfully obtained based on the water heat coupling process indicating that the frozen depth was predominantly influenced by heat conduction rather than heat convection regardless of the soils at the surface that are affected by the evaporation the soil water content at 40 cm or deeper is used to verify the calculated results the rmse of the water content is 5 8 the difference between simulated results and experimental results is minimal therefore the results of the water content measurement are acceptable temperatures at five typical positions of the soil profile were monitored including the depth of 0 5 m 1 0 m 1 5 m 2 0 m and 2 5 m since the sampling point is far away from the city the data were obtained from november 1 to march 1 by manual observation and the measured data are shown in fig 10 a the continuous data by simulation show good agreement with the measurement the closer that the position is to the soil surface the larger the variation amplitude is while in the deeper position such as 2 5 m the amplitude of the temperature variation is obviously small at the depth of 0 5 m the temperature reaches the lowest on the 41st day in fig 10 a while the temperature almost reaches the lowest on the 83rd day at the position of 1 5 m and the temperature continuously decreases within the whole monitoring period because the temperature variation of the deeper soil has hysteresis resulting from the heat transfer as mentioned above fig 10 b gives the measured and simulated values that are plot along the 1 1 line at the depth ranging from 0 5 to 2 5 m the simulated temperature of the soil compares well with the measured temperature however for the superficial soil layer 0 5 m for instance there is an obvious deviation between the measured and the simulated t as shown in fig 10 the measured t is higher than the simulated t at the depth of 0 5 m a possible explanation about the lower accuracy of the simulated results for the superficial layer of soil is the uncertainty associated with the moisture evaporation salt transport and the corresponding heat transfer which would result in a considerable deviation in the determination of t as reported by li et al 2012 the soil evaporation was estimated by the shaw model but the temperature curve and the water retention also have a certain deviation as reported by zhang et al 2018a the heat convection plays a significant role in the temperature variation when and only if the water content is high in this study the soil in the sampling site was considered as approximately saturated during the simulation therefore at a depth above 50 cm most simulations are slightly below the measured values as shown in fig 10 b from the comparison of the soil at different depths we can deduce that the heat conduction which depends mainly on the relative volume content of the soil grain and moisture plays an important role when the coupled model is applied in soil temperature simulation and mfd prediction in addition the results have shown that the average rmse and r square of the temperature are respectively 2 c and 0 903 therefore the simulation data show good agreement with the measured data thus using the coupled model proposed in this paper to predict the frozen depth is reliable according to the temperature inflection points of the different freezing times in fig 7 the frozen depth of a different time was obtained which is shown in fig 11 a the frozen depth increased as time lapsed within 72 days the frozen depth curve in fig 11 a can be divided into three sections the first section is a rapidly increasing stage in this stage the frozen depth increase shows almost linear growth the second section is a slowly increasing stage the increasing rate of the frozen depth slows gradually and stabilizes after almost 125 days the third section is a bidirectional melting stage in this stage two frozen depths exist in the soil profile induced by an air temperature increment and the heat transfer of the underground water compared with fig 5 the lowest air temperature is at the 72nd day however the frozen depth at the 72nd day is 1 27 m which is not the maximum frozen depth after 72 days the frozen depth continues to increase until the freezing time reaches 144 days this characteristic also introduced in fig 7 is induced by the heat transport and water migration of the soil profile using the model proposed previously the frozen depth during soil thawing can also be obtained and is given in fig 11 a from the third stage the bidirectional frozen depths during melting are calculated and were confirmed in the field investigation gu 2007 li et al 2012 had similar results in their numerical analysis the measured data for the freezing depth throughout the winter were obtained by monitoring the drilled hole and the details can be found in zhang 2018 all measured data are compared with the simulated frozen depths which are mentioned above the simulated and measured data are plotted in fig 11 c along with the 1 1 line after comparing the measured value with the simulated value we can get a 3 average absolute percentage deviation mapd the error may be caused by field measurement the simulated frozen depth compared well to the measured frozen depth in addition the coupled model can also predict frozen depths well during the thawing process the rmse provides useful information regarding the extent of error and evaluating the model performance thus the simulated temperature of the soil at different depths and the frozen depths are verified according to the rmses in table 4 at the depth between 0 5 m and 2 5 m the coupled model can predict soil temperature within 1 5 c rmse for all depths of soils except for the soils above 0 5 m thus the applicability of the coupled model is limited for the soils when the depth is over 0 5 m mainly because the evaporation induced by the solar radiation and the corresponding latent heat transfer of water vapor and salt within 0 5 m depth become increasingly complicated due to the phase state microstructure changing effect zhang et al 2017 suggested that the microstructure and phase change play an important role in the heat water transfer process and salt transport also affects the soil components although the void ratio is considered in this model it reflects partly the microstructure of the soil the pore size distribution is affected by the component variation and the evaporation therefore we believe that the performance of the coupled model could be further improved by better consideration of the microstructure and effect of progressively complicated evaporation moreover the salt content and the associated content variation effect are needed for further improvements of the model moreover to determine the performance of the frozen depth prediction rmse and r squares are also applied the results show that the rmse and r square of the temperature are 0 075 m and 0 985 respectively therefore the simulation data show good agreement with the measured data thus using the coupled model proposed to predict the frozen depth in the saline soil region is reliable 5 conclusions the unfrozen water content of the soil is studied in this paper indicating that the unfrozen water content is influenced by the initial water content and temperature the salt content affects the unfrozen water content significantly the unfrozen water content of the soil is studied in this paper the nmr test result indicated that some water remains in the liquid phase during freezing even if the temperature reaches minus 20 by using the thermometry method the unfrozen water content of the soil with salt can be predicted successfully which proves that the unfrozen water content of the saline soil is a power function of the minus temperature the frozen depth and the movement of the freezing front are affected by both heat transfer and water migration the model proposed in this paper can predict the frozen depth reliably as well as the water heat distribution along the soil profile the model accurately embodies the water heat coupling mechanism the measured data and the simulated data provide a novel theory for frozen depth evaluation considering the heat conduction as well as the heat convection induced by water migration the model was successfully applied in the determination of the water and heat balance simulation of the freezing soil system in the western jilin china saline soil area which includes frozen depth as well as water heat flux the frozen depth is reflected by the freezing front and determined by the temperature inflection point the temperature variation of the soil profile has hysteresis compared with the soil surface temperature variation as a result the frozen depth increases continuously even when the surface temperature reaches the lowest level this study can also provide a reference for studying the mechanism of solute transport and the engineering construction during winter freezing credit authorship contribution statement xudong zhang conceptualization project administration data

4931,to achieve sustainable development ecological water diversion has been implemented as a management tool to recover degraded oasis ecosystems in arid endorheic basins aiming to explore oasis response and identify appropriate objectives for oasis restoration this study used a conceptual lumped ecohydrological model qingtu oasis in the shiyang river basin northwest china was used as a case study to test this model the model coupled groundwater budget oasis response and evapotranspiration dynamic modules the model structure was clear and reasonable and the calculation was of low cost the application in qingtu oasis verified the model s effectiveness the model was able to effectively capture the ecohydrological response attributed to the recovering of qingtu oasis in response to ecological water diversions occurring during the last decade combined with scenario analysis the simulation indicated that qingtu oasis was fragile and largely dependent on ecological water diversion ecological responses were positive and non linearly correlated with water input resulting in an optimal water input that produced maximum water benefit by minimum water consumption the ideal point method was useful in identifying this cost effective water volume for oasis restoration for qingtu oasis the optimal water diversion was 45 million m3 which would recover the oasis to 29 16 km2 with an ndvi of 0 41 the current oasis conditions approach the optimal status and ecological water diversion was suggested to continue and maintain the current oasis status the volume of 45 million m3 could be taken as an upper threshold of water diversion because above this threshold water consumption would not result in water benefits effectively this study proposed a practical tool for ecohydrological process simulation keywords conceptual lumped ecohydrological model ecohydrological dynamics ecological water diversion oasis restoration shiyang river arid endorheic basins 1 introduction endorheic basins cover about 11 4 of the global land area and are mainly located in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2018 because of rapid socio economic development that in many cases results in overexploitation of water resources many endorheic basins have suffered from the environmental and ecological crisis in terms of land degradation desertification loss of biodiversity enhanced sandstorms and drying up of terminal lakes zhu et al 2016 for example the degeneration of the riparian ecosystem along the lower tarim river the land degradation over the middle lower heihe river basin and the loss of the terminal lake of the shiyang river in northwest china have motivated special ecological restoration efforts aimed to sustainable development chunyu et al 2019 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 ecological water diversion which is the reallocation of water resources between engineered and natural systems is one method used to restore deteriorated ecosystems shen and ma 2020 ecological water diversion projects have been used in areas such as in the tarim heihe and shiyang river basins bao et al 2017 chunyu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 understanding the complicated ecohydrological responses to ecological water diversion is critically important for improving the scientific basis and practical management of oasis restoration and conservation tian et al 2015 numerous studies have described riparian ecosystems in arid inland river basins as groundwater dependent ecosystems that benefit from the replenishment of the shallow groundwater system this due to ecological water diversion projects used to help with oasis restoration huang et al 2019b research on the correlation between ecological water diversion groundwater recharge and oasis restoration has shown that rises in shallow groundwater level in response to ecological water diversion inputs help mitigate water stress and increase water availability for vegetation bao et al 2017 hao and li 2014 li et al 2013 ling et al 2017 liu et al 2014 ma et al 2015 wu and tang 2010 xu et al 2007 ye et al 2009 yu et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 previous studies have shown that oasis restoration is sensitive to ecological water diversion however little attention has been paid to the appropriate target of ecological water diversion needed for oasis restoration larger oasis areas and better vegetation growth require more water diversion resulting in a water conflict between natural and socio economic systems because of the natural scarcity of water resources in arid endorheic basins it is usually unrealistic to restore an oasis to its original status a reasonable restoration target has a strong practical guiding significance in water resources management and environmental conservation zhang et al 2019 models that characterize the interactions between hydrological and ecological processes can be useful to assess and predict ecological water diversion impacts on oasis restoration for example an ecohydrological evolution model on riparian vegetation in arid regions was proposed by coupling groundwater movement and vegetation dynamics groundwater movement was modeled using the boussinesq equation and vegetation dynamics were modeled using the colonization and mortality functions liu et al 2012 also a fully distributed ecohydrological model was constructed by combining the modified modflow with a vegetation dynamic module han et al 2015 in these ecohydrological models the depth to the water table served as a critical variable that determined vegetation colonization and mortality as feedback depth to water table was affected by vegetation transpiration and shallow aquifer recharge caused by ecological water diversion contributions han et al 2015 liu et al 2012 the simulation domain was discretized into grids within which the interactions between hydrological and ecological dynamics were well recognized han et al 2015 liu et al 2012 however because these models were partially physically based and spatially distributed the model structure was relatively complex resulting in a complicated calculation furthermore these models did not link the oasis area to ecological water diversion directly and did not facilitate the simulation of overall oasis restoration conceptual models provide a good candidate to address these issues given they are less complex than physically based models and because of their capability in describing overall ecohydrological processes viola et al 2014 to pursue sustainable development quantifying the impact of ecological water diversion on oasis restoration is fundamentally important this study aimed to construct a conceptual lumped ecohydrological model which was driven by ecological water diversion the model integrated the processes of groundwater recharge oasis expansion vegetation growth and evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration consumed groundwater and provided feedback to groundwater storage and oasis restoration the model was applied in qingtu oasis which is the terminal oasis of the shiyang river basin in the arid region of northwest china the shiyang river basin is a typical arid inland river basin where the terminal lake had been dry for several decades due to the overexploitation of water resources in the last decade an ecological water diversion project was implemented to address the environmental problems and restore the dried up lake back to an oasis a model developed in this study was used to explore the impact of ecological water diversion on hydrological and ecological processes and their interactions based on which a reasonable restoration target was investigated this case study is representative of arid inland river basin systems and can be used as a reference for oasis restoration in other arid endorheic basins the results from this study can provide important information for stakeholders and policymakers to rationally manage oasis restoration and water resource allocation in arid endorheic basins 2 case study site and data 2 1 study area shiyang river originates in the southern part of qilian mountain and ends at the qingtu oasis between the badain jaran and tengger deserts fig 1 the whole basin is located at the middle part of gansu province in northwest china and lies between longitudes 101 41 104 16 e and latitudes 36 29 39 27 n with a catchment area of 41 600 km2 ma et al 2008 qilian mountain in the south reaches 5150 m above sea level masl the middle plain region lies between 1400 and 2000 masl and the lower basin in the north is between 1256 and 1400 masl due to differences in topography the basin exhibits typical semiarid to arid climatic features from south to north with annual precipitation of 600 50 mm and annual pan evaporation of 700 2600 mm ma et al 2008 qingtu oasis is located at the lowest reach of shiyang river and near the edge of the desert where annual precipitation is 50 mm and annual pan evaporation is 2600 mm ma et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 the basin is ecologically fragile because of limited water resources high population density and a high level of water resources utilization gu et al 2016 during the last half century anthropogenic activities have caused a series of detrimental environmental impacts especially vegetation degeneration and land desertification wang et al 2002 shiyang river once had a natural terminal lake named qingtu lake the lake had shrunken continuously throughout the historical period attributed to the overexploitation of water resources due to agricultural development since the han dynasty 110 bce irrigation had been consuming more and more water resulting in less water drainage into qingtu lake rapid population growth has exacerbated the lake shrinkage and the lake area shrunk to 120 km2 in the early 20th century and to 40 km2 by the 1940s the impoundment of the hongyashan reservoir almost cut off the inflow into the lake which completely dried up in 1959 zhu and li 2014 the natural oasis surrounding qingtu lake disappeared since the lake dried up accelerating the desertification of the lower basin the dried up lake had created a negative impact on the stability and sustainability of the shiyang river basin a general restoration plan of the shiyang river basin was implemented to address environmental and ecological issues affecting its sustainability at the original qingtu lake the objective was to preserve shallow groundwater for building a new oasis instead of trying to recover the natural lake zhu and li 2014 since september 2010 ecological water has been transferred annually through artificial channels from the hongyashan reservoir to the oasis gu et al 2016 by the end of 2018 the total volume of water diversion had reached 0 25 billion m3 the ecological water diversion formed seasonally inundated areas and shallow lakes small ponds and contributed to local groundwater recharge through deep percolation the improved water supply fostered vegetation growth and produced a new qingtu oasis though the precipitation is an important water source for vegetation water uptake it is so scarce that it cannot provide adequate water for vegetation growth instead groundwater is the main water source for vegetation growth and groundwater depth is a critical environmental factor affecting landscape dynamics huang et al 2019a at qingtu oasis groundwater depth increases in a gradient from the central oasis to the desert edge correspondingly the vegetation community changes from hygrophytes to xerophytes chunyu et al 2019 local vegetation includes phragmitesaustralis suaedaglauca haloxylonammodendron kalidiumfoliatum and nitrariatangutorum along which phragmitesaustralis a typical hygrophyte and nitrariatangutorum a typical xerophyte the ecological water diversion to qingtu oasis serves as a good prototype experiment on the evolution of a hydrological and ecological interacting system the dominant ecohydrological processes in oasis recovery have been identified by previous studies hence the development and verification of the conceptual lumped ecohydrological model in qingtu oasis is feasible han et al 2015 liu et al 2012 2 2 materials this study used yearly water diversion data from 2010 to 2018 in the analysis and modeling of the ecohydrological evolution of qingtu oasis the ecological water is usually diverted in the next half year when irrigation consumes less water in this case groundwater was mainly recharged by the water diversion of last year when modeling the ecohydrological dynamics the water diversion of a year was set as the input for driving oasis restoration for the next year for example the water diversion in 2010 was used as input into the water balance analysis of 2011 groundwater level data were obtained from a hydrometric station located at the northeast edge of qingtu oasis managed by the hydrology bureau of gansu province fig 1c annual mean groundwater depth data from 2010 to 2019 were used to assess the impact of ecological water diversion on groundwater recovery to assess the impact of ecological water diversion on vegetation restoration the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used given it is a widely applied indicator to estimate vegetation coverage and leaf area index bhanja et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 ndvi data of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis have been well recognized and utilized in the environmental impact assessment of arid inland river basins liu et al 2012 sun et al 2011 ndvi data from modis terra mod13q1 products which have a spatial resolution of 250 m and a temporal resolution of 16 days were used in this study because the ecohydrological dynamics were simulated with an annual time step yearly maximum ndvi data were used as vegetation surrogates representing ecological responses to groundwater variations the ndvi data spanned from 2000 to 2019 among which the pre impact period of 2000 2009 provided criterion for analyzing the ndvi changes during 2010 2019 the study area covered a total of 899 pixels with 31 rows and 29 columns visual inspection was practical and exercisable to identify the restored areas and the time when a pixel started to recover fig 2 shows the ndvi variations along three sample lines the pixels at the center responded first to ecological water diversion and the pixels away from the center responded later indicating the oasis expansion was driven by ecological water diversion the ndvi of pixels at the two sides fluctuated slightly indicating that these pixels were not affected by water diversion whose impact was restrained within a limited area 3 model description 3 1 ecohydrological mechanisms and assumptions ecological water diverted to qingtu oasis is impounded on low land where produces seasonal shallow lakes namely seasonally inundated areas surface water recharges groundwater through infiltration elevating the local water table groundwater storage increases within a limited space of the aquifer groundwater tank due to the lateral movement of groundwater the elevated water table improves soil moisture levels surrounding vegetation roots and alleviates water stress for vegetation to grow resulting in oasis recovery both the oasis area and vegetation coverage increase with the reduced groundwater depth which is a practically observable indicator characterizing the shallow groundwater regime jointly affected by land topography and depth to the water table the groundwater is shallower at the oasis center and goes deeper with the distance further away from the center in this context the oasis covers the sites where vegetation can use groundwater effectively so that the oasis area and vegetation condition is highly correlated with groundwater depth huang et al 2020 the vegetation consumes groundwater for transpiration and provides feedback to groundwater storage and groundwater depth evapotranspiration is positively correlated with groundwater depth oasis area and vegetation condition groundwater consumption further provides feedback to oasis restoration in general the ecohydrological processes driven by ecological water diversion are composed of groundwater recharge oasis recovery groundwater consumption and its feedback to oasis recovery fig 3 groundwater depth is an important index which characterizes the change in groundwater storage controls the water supply for vegetation growth and links the hydrological and ecological interactions besides ecological water diversion water inputs for the oasis include precipitation and groundwater inflow water output includes evapotranspiration and groundwater outflow the water is stored as groundwater soil water and surface water coupling ecological water diversion and natural hydrological cycle the local water balance embedded in ecohydrological processes for a time step of one year can be expressed as 1 w e p g in e t g out δ g δ s δ l where w e is the volume of ecological water diversion p is precipitation g in and g out is groundwater inflow and outflow respectively e t is evapotranspiration δ g δ s and δ l is the change in groundwater storage soil water storage and seasonal lake storage respectively to reduce complexity the model structure is simplified with a focus on the key ecohydrological processes wagener et al 2001 the model has three assumptions 1 spatial homogeneity and lumped parameters lumped models describe the watershed as a single entity and provide hydrological results in a spatially averaged way these models have been widely applied because of their validity reliability simplicity and low time cost charizopoulos et al 2017 tran et al 2018 with an emphasis on simplicity and effectiveness the proposed model assumes spatial homogeneity and represents the affected area as a single homogeneous unit the simulation uses lumped parameters and disregards spatial variability in physical properties such as groundwater depth and evapotranspiration 2 simplified water budget ecological water diversion is a key driving factor for groundwater recovery and oasis restoration therefore it must be considered in the water budget the precipitation amount is so scarce that it is assumed to be consumed by evapotranspiration almost completely its impact on groundwater is marginal compared with the contribution of ecological water diversion in this context precipitation is negligible in the water balance equation the difference between g in and g out is denoted as w g which indicates the impact of local groundwater processes on the water budget evapotranspiration is a dominant component of groundwater consumption the movement of soil water is simplified as a transition process from groundwater to evapotranspiration the soil water movement and the change in soil water storage are disregarded liu et al 2012 ecological water diversion produces seasonal ponds with limited water impoundment and marginal storage change the water balance equation is simplified and transformed as 2 δ g w e w g e t 3 static natural hydrological conditions because of an emphasis on the impact of ecological water diversion the natural hydrological conditions are assumed to be static the inter annual fluctuations in meteorological conditions are ignored resulting in steady pan evaporation e p levels in this study multi year mean pan evaporation of 2600 mm was used as e p before the ecological water diversion e t consumed groundwater dominantly δ g was assumed to be zero and there was a balance between e g and w g the evaporation of groundwater e g can be estimated by the averyanov equation 3 e g a 1 h h max b e p where a and b are empirical parameters and h max is maximum groundwater depth that restrains groundwater evaporation a and b were 0 76 and 1 53 respectively h max was 5 m chen et al 2014 in 2010 h 3 91 m combined with e p 2600 mm resulting in w g e g 192 mm the inter annual fluctuations in w g are ignored resulting in static local groundwater conditions 3 2 model structure and equations based on the aforementioned assumptions the model structure is simplified and the model is constituted by a hydrological module and an ecological module and the interactions between hydrological and ecological processes are characterized by the dynamics of groundwater carrying capacity fig 4 the main model input is ecological water diversion the outputs include groundwater depth oasis area and vegetation condition the hydrological module simulates a evapotranspiration that consumes groundwater and b groundwater depth that responds to the change in groundwater storage and drives ecological processes the connections between ecological dynamics and groundwater depth are determined by groundwater carrying capacity functions in the ecological module the ecological response is described by the oasis area and vegetation condition which are controlled by the area dynamic function and the vegetation dynamic function respectively oasis area and vegetation condition are input variables for calculating evapotranspiration which affects groundwater storage and triggers the following ecohydrological processes groundwater depth is calculated based on the water balance eq 2 the change in the vegetated area is proportional to the difference between groundwater carrying capacity and vegetated area at a certain time with a certain groundwater depth similarly the change in spatial mean ndvi of the vegetated area is proportional to the difference between groundwater carrying capacity and ndvi at a certain time with a certain groundwater depth muneepeerakul et al 2008 verhulst 1838 the model includes three differential equations 4 d h d t θ δ g a r 5 d a d t β a a gcc a 6 d v d t β v v gcc v 7 δ g w e 10 3 w g a r 10 3 e t a 10 3 e g a r a where h is groundwater depth in m t indicates time every one year step δ g

and vegetation condition respectively unit 1 year and a gcc and v gcc is groundwater carrying capacity gcc of the oasis area and vegetation condition respectively the dominant impact of the climate system on ecohydrological processes is through potential evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration is highly correlated with groundwater depth and vegetation condition mcmahon et al 2013 8 e t 1 k e v

describes the steepness of the groundwater carrying capacity curves unit m in essence the two groundwater carrying capacity functions describe the empirical relations of groundwater depth to oasis area and ndvi respectively table 1 summarizes all the variables and parameters used in the ecohydrological model 3 3 performance evaluation the simulation and forecasting accuracy is mainly determined by the quality of model parameters the hydrological and ecological data should be separated into two parts one part for calibration and the other for validation usually 60 70 of data are used for calibration and 30 40 of data are used for validation kan et al 2019 therefore the data of 2010 2015 and the data of 2016 2019 were used for calibration and validation respectively the agreement between simulated and observed data was evaluated by correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse which are commonly used performance evaluators han et al 2015 naseem et al 2016 viola et al 2014 the bayesian inference approach was used for parameter estimation because this approach is a well established and coherent methodology for statistical inference schaefli and kavetski 2017 when performing the bayesian inference because the posterior distribution is often highly dimensional and analytically intractable the analytical expression is substituted by sampling techniques based upon the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method haario et al 2006 2001 the bayesian methodology coupling with the mcmc approach has been widely applied in science and engineering to reconcile earth system models with data including prediction in space and time assimilation of observations and inference of model parameters vrugt 2016 the full matlab codes of the mcmc algorithm are available from github https github com mjlaine mcmcstat git in the application of the mcmc approach as the parameter estimation started from non optimized values the chain needs some time to find the location of the posterior therefore the chain with one hundred thousand samples was conducted by three runs starting from the values of the previous run the mean value of the last running chain was taken as the estimation of model parameters 3 4 application for scenario analysis using the ecohydrological model a scenario analysis was implemented to assess the impacts of changes in ecological water diversion on oasis evolution the multi year mean volume of water diversion from 2010 to 2019 was 30 million m3 three scenarios were assumed for 2020 to 2029 a ecological water diversion stopped due to water depletion b ecological water diversion continued and the annual volume remained 30 million m3 and c stronger efforts were made in ecological restoration and more water was diverted with the annual volume increased to 60 million m3 double of the volume during the last decade the correlation between water benefit and water consumption was investigated to identify the appropriate target of oasis restoration the water benefit was defined as the ecological outputs of water diversion and the water consumption was defined as the water loss caused by evapotranspiration the appropriate target of oasis restoration corresponds to a reasonable volume of ecological water diversion which produces a larger oasis area and ndvi with less water loss the simulation spanned from 2010 to 2029 until the oasis reached a stable status a total of 24 scenarios were modeled the annual volume of ecological water diversion was 5 10 15 110 115 and 120 million m3 with a unique interval of 5 million m3 for each scenario the evolutions of oasis area ndvi and evapotranspiration were simulated to get the final stable values for the stable statuses of different scenarios water benefits and water consumption were compared and an ideal point method ipm was used to analyze the appropriate target of oasis restoration shang 2008 the water benefit w b was defined as the spatial sum of ndvi values 12 w b a v where larger a and v result in larger w b the water consumption w c was defined as the difference between total evapotranspiration and basic evapotranspiration the basic evapotranspiration equals to w g 13 w c e t a e g a r a a r w g where shallower groundwater has a positive impact on e g e t and a resulting in both larger w c and w b in oasis management there is a trade off between ecological restoration and water savings it is a multiple criteria decision making problem including two contradictory objectives a maximum w b with largest oasis area and best vegetation condition and b minimum w c with least water loss the two objectives are incompatible and there is usually no optional solution at which both objectives reach their optimal values an optimal value of each objective can be obtained disregarding the other objective these optimal values form a supposed point that is called the ideal point the ipm ranks the options in terms of their distance to the ideal point and the option closest to the ideal point can be taken as the pareto solutions of the multi objective problem shang 2008 to eliminate the potential impact of relative scaling of w b and w c dimensionless values were used in the ipm analysis both w b and w c were normalized and expressed as proportions of their maximum values resulting in normalized water benefit n w b and normalized water consumption n w c if the oasis restoration is the only objective under consideration it is preferred to increase ecological water diversion and the extreme scenario is n w b n w c 1 on the other hand if the water saving is the only objective under consideration it is preferred to stop ecological water diversion and the extreme scenario is n w b n w c 0 to solve the multiple criteria problem of maximum n w b and minimum n w c a supposed scenario with n w b 1 and n w c 0 was taken as the ideal point the distances between each of the 24 scenarios and the supposed ideal point were calculated using the euclidean distance the scenario with minimum distance to the ideal point was taken as the optimization of oasis restoration corresponding to an appropriate oasis area ndvi and ecological water requirement 3 5 practical framework fig 5 synthesizes the methodologies mentioned above into a framework for ecohydrological simulation and potential application in oasis restoration in arid endorheic basins commonly found worldwide data monitoring and preparation provide the basis for ecohydrological simulation which requires ground truth data and remote sensing data such as the volume of water diversion groundwater depth and ndvi to mention a few mechanism analysis is necessary for a reasonable model structure and should focus on the critical interaction between hydrological and ecological processes the analysis results provide references for model simplification and assumptions which are mainly determined by the ecohydrological characteristics and data availability of a specific research area the premises of the simplified water budget and static natural hydrological conditions are applicable in the qingtu oasis and can also be revised for applicability in other case studies with variable ecohydrological conditions for example in the case that ecological water diversion produces a perennial lake where the change in lake storage is significant the simplified water balance eq 2 can be revised as 14 δ g w e w g e t δ l the change in groundwater storage δ g can be analyzed using the complete water balance eq 1 if necessary the observation and estimation of the variables in eq 1 depend on the specific hydrogeological features of different study sites three differential equations characterize the ecohydrological interaction and constitute the model the bayesian methodology coupling with the mcmc approach is useful in the inference of model parameters after calibration and validation the model can be applied for scenario simulation which results in the oasis status corresponding to specific volumes of water diversion and provides the data for optimum analysis the correlation analysis of water benefit and water consumption indicates the incompatibility between the two objectives maximum oasis recovery and minimum water cost the ipm methodology helps to identify the pareto solutions of this multi objective problem the oasis recovery target and ecological water requirement provide critical information for water resource managers and policymakers for adequately establishing ecological water diversion goals the continuous data collection at the hydrometric monitoring station in the years to come provides an opportunity for constant re evaluation and refining of the model model re calibration and re validation would help to improve the model accuracy and reduce the uncertainty of parameter estimation 4 results and discussion 4 1 ecohydrological recovery of qingtu oasis fed by ecological water diversion for a decade qingtu oasis has recovered in terms of the elevated water table expanded area and improved vegetation condition fig 6 annual mean groundwater depth experienced a substantial decreasing tendency with a total reduction of about 1 m the oasis expanded continuously and reached an area of 24 75 km2 in 2019 the oasis area was highly correlated r 0 95 with groundwater depth at a level of significance of p 0 05 the spatially averaged ndvi of the recovered area experienced a significantly increasing tendency indicating a better vegetation condition induced by ecological water diversion the oasis ndvi was also highly correlated r 0 94 with groundwater depth vegetation growth is affected by environmental factors such as soil texture water supply nutrients temperature and solar radiation to mention a few in arid inland river basins water availability is the principal limiting factor for vegetation growth because of low precipitation supply and high evaporation capacity liu et al 2012 vegetation roots obtain water from the phreatic aquifer and or the unsaturated soil zone where soil water is supplied by groundwater through capillary rising huang et al 2019b the observed significant correlation between oasis area ndvi and groundwater depth corroborated the rationale of using groundwater depth as a driving variable to simulate ecological responses 4 2 model calibration and validation the conceptual lumped ecohydrological model encompasses eleven parameters table 2 the evaluators of model performance are displayed in table 3 all r values were significant with p 0 05 rmse values were small and met the accuracy requirement fig 7 illustrates the model performance during calibration and validation the scatters distributed closely around the 1 1 line indicating that the simulated values matched well with the observed values the results verified the model capability to simulate the ecohydrological dynamics driven by ecological water diversion conceptual models are common tools in the ecohydrological simulation and the model parameters are usually calibrated to obtain a good fit between observed and simulated outputs engeland et al 2005 however the estimation of model parameters is a challenging task because of the highly non linear nature of ecohydrological processes and the fact that different parameter vectors driving models describing the physical processes might have the same effect on the model outputs bardossy and singh 2008 on the other hand data for model calibration and validation are typically observations taken from both satellite and in situ systems given that model inputs are subject to errors these errors will affect the estimation of model parameters and contribute to the uncertainty of the model outputs bastin et al 2013 in this context when applying this conceptual lumped ecohydrological model re evaluation of the model performance using the updated high quality data is necessary to improve the parameter estimation and model accuracy 4 3 oasis responses to changes in ecological water diversion results from the three different model scenarios used to predict oasis response to changes in ecological water diversion are shown in fig 8 the oasis dynamics from 2010 to 2019 were further simulated using the observed data and estimated parameters the results indicated a good consistency between the simulated and observed data verifying the model capability to capture oasis dynamics responding to ecological water diversion from 2020 to 2029 three different scenarios of ecological water diversion were analyzed and results showed that the oasis dynamics responded in various patterns a common feature was that the oasis reached relative stability after several years of evolution because of the balance between water input and water consumption groundwater depth oasis area and ndvi reached relatively stable values in 2029 the differences were mainly reflected in the tendency and range of oasis responses when ecological water diversion was interrupted due to water scarcity the oasis lacked external water supply and consumed local groundwater bringing down the water table and resulting in water deficit the increased groundwater depth decreased water availability for vegetation and caused oasis degradation in terms of reduced vegetated area and ndvi therefore it is assumed that qingtu oasis would again disappear if its ecological water requirement was not satisfied when ecological water diversion maintained the status quo the oasis largely held its current status groundwater depth was relatively stable due to the balance between recharge and evapotranspiration as a result the oasis area and ndvi fluctuated slightly because they had been gradually approaching groundwater carrying capacity for the current groundwater depth when more efforts were made in ecological restoration and the volume of water diversion was doubled the oasis dynamics responded positively the increased water diversion caused water surplus first then groundwater depth continued declining for several years until gradually reached a relatively stable level resulting in a new status of water balance correspondingly the oasis area and ndvi increased for several years due to the enhanced groundwater carrying capacity both the oasis area and ndvi remained relatively stable when they reached the groundwater carrying capacity level besides the differences in the tendency of oasis response the range of oasis response to the changes in ecological water diversion was also different comparing the stable status of scenarios a and b when ecological water diversion increased from 0 to 30 million m3 groundwater depth decreased by 1 08 m oasis area increased by 22 84 km2 and ndvi increased by 0 19 comparing the stable status of scenarios b and c when ecological water diversion further increased from 30 to 60 million m3 groundwater depth decreased by 0 85 m oasis area increased by 4 92 km2 and ndvi increased by 0 11 the same increment in ecological water diversion of 30 million m3 caused different oasis response the increase from 0 to 30 million m3 water induced more ecological benefits than the increase from 30 to 60 million m3 water in terms of larger increment of both oasis area and ndvi in arid endorheic basins where water resources are very scarce it is preferred to use less water to produce more ecological benefits and increase the effectiveness of the ecological water diversion the oasis response to changes in ecological water diversion provided the following implications for managers and policymakers first in the viewing of the oasis responses to the decrease of ecological water diversion the current oasis was fragile and dependent on external water input significantly the project should continue to satisfy the ecological water requirement and sustain the recovered vegetation community second the oasis recovery was positively correlated with the volume of ecological water diversion however the relationship was non linear the ecological benefit of unit water input during the early stages of oasis recovery was greater than the ecological benefit when the oasis had been restored near the maximum groundwater carrying capacity on the other hand when oasis had been recovered to some extent the further restoration required more water diversion and increased water cost therefore both ecological benefit and water cost should be considered in designing the strategies of ecological water diversion an appropriate objective of oasis restoration is necessary to determine a cost effective volume of water diversion given that the current qingtu oasis conditions are fragile and dependent on ecological water diversions it is necessary to maintain or increase watershed groundwater recovery to enhance oasis resilience groundwater overexploitation typically results in a drop down of the water table and it is a primary cause of environmental degradation in arid endorheic basins based on the water balance eq 2 the increase in δ g would benefit from arise in both w e and w g the restored natural groundwater regime is fundamental for regional ecological restoration in this context groundwater recovery is the ultimate target of watershed groundwater management policies in january 2006 the chinese central government launched a watershed groundwater restoration policy named the comprehensive treatment program of the shiyang river basin to restore the water table in the lower reaches hao et al 2017 the policy primarily aims to increase surface water supply control excessive groundwater exploitation promote water saving technologies and establish water user associations that function within the new water resources management framework however since the watershed groundwater recovery is a long slow and continuously changing dynamic process aarnoudse et al 2012 favorable management institutions reasonable farming strategies and supportive capital investments are all necessary to ensure the smooth implementation of the intended policy changes hao et al 2017 4 4 optimization of oasis restoration a total of 24 scenarios were simulated to investigate the correlation between oasis restoration and ecological water diversion results showed the ecohydrological evolution of the oasis was similar for all scenarios tested and that the oasis recovered gradually and reached a relatively stable status fig 9 with the increase in water diversion volume groundwater depth decreased substantially indicating ecological water diversion helped to recharge local groundwater effectively the improved water supply was conducive to vegetation growth and oasis expansion jointly affected by the elevated groundwater level and recovered vegetation evapotranspiration was strengthened significantly with the increased water volume of diversion the increasing rates of oasis area and ndvi slowed down when water input kept going up yet evapotranspiration increased continually and significantly in this case the ecological benefit decreased while water cost increased fig 10 shows the correlation between water benefit and water consumption the water benefit characterized ecological restoration and the water consumption characterized water loss caused by evapotranspiration the water benefit increased non linearly with water consumption when the water volume of diversion was relatively small the increment in water consumption produced a relatively large increase in water benefit indicating that water benefit was sensitive to water consumption conversely when the water volume of diversion was relatively large the sensitivity of water benefit to water consumption was lower and the same increment in water consumption produced a relatively small increase in water benefit the theoretical ideal point referred to the scenario that produced maximum water benefit using minimum water consumption hence the optimal scenario was the one closest to this ideal point the analysis of distance to the ideal point indicated that a water volume of 45 million m3 was the most cost effective scenario in this optimal scenario groundwater depth was 2 34 m oasis area was recovered to 29 16 km2 and ndvi increased to 0 41 in 2019 qingtu oasis covered an area of 24 75 km2 with ndvi of 0 36 close to the status of the optimal scenario the optimization analysis of oasis restoration provided the following implications for managers and policymakers it is important to recognize that more water diversion did not lead to equally better ecological restoration an appropriate objective of ecological restoration existed this objective corresponded to a threshold of water volume above which water benefit was limited but water consumption was high the optimal volume of water diversion for qingtu oasis was 45 million m3 which would result in the largest water benefit with the least water consumption the current status of oasis recovery has approached closely to this optimal scenario future efforts should be made to maintain the current status in order to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources the water volume of 45 million m3 was suggested to be taken as an upper threshold of water resource allocation for ecological water requirement 4 5 advantages limitations and future research this research proposed a conceptual lumped ecohydrological model addressing the linkage between ecological water diversion and oasis responses the model structure was simplified by focusing on the key hydrological and ecological processes including groundwater recharge and discharge oasis area and ndvi dynamics and evapotranspiration processes though the model had a simple structure and a small number of equations it successfully captured the main components of ecohydrological processes driven by ecological water diversion and showed good performance overall for the case study of qingtu oasis northwest china compared with ecohydrological models applied in the lower tarim river northwest china the advantages of this study relied on the model simplicity and effectiveness which required low cost of calculation han et al 2015 liu et al 2012 furthermore the proposed model linked ecological water diversion to oasis area and ndvi directly facilitated the simulation of overall oasis recovery figured out how much water was required for balancing groundwater recharge and discharge and provided the basis for optimization analysis of oasis restoration huang et al 2020 through scenario analysis using the conceptual lumped ecohydrological model this research added insights into the mechanisms behind ecohydrological responses to ecological water diversion for a scenario with certain water diversion ecohydrological processes of oasis evolved gradually for several years and approached a relatively stable status when the water input and water consumption was balanced for different scenarios with different volumes of water diversion the stable status of the oasis had different groundwater depth oasis area ndvi and evapotranspiration corresponding to various water benefit and water consumption based on the correlation analysis of water benefit and water consumption this research used the ipm approach to investigate the optimal scenario and suggested the appropriate objective of oasis restoration for managers though this study had the advantages mentioned above it also had some limitations one of which was due to model uncertainty the model uncertainty and errors usually source from the observational data used to drive and evaluate the model model parameters and the structure that is associated with the model s mechanisms and assumptions engeland et al 2005 liu and gupta 2007 the conceptual lumped ecohydrological model developed in this study required data such as the volume of water diversion groundwater depth and ndvi the intrinsic uncertainty in a given measurement e g in situ monitoring and remote sensing due to noise in the electronics of the sensor systems is an essential source of uncertainty in modeling bastin et al 2013 model parameters are usually difficult to be measured directly still they can be inferred by calibration that adjusts the parameter values to closely match the input output behavior of the model to the real ecohydrological processes the errors in data as well as the epistemic errors in model structure account for parametric uncertainty which reflects the inability to specify exact values of model parameters teweldebrhan et al 2018 the model structure is a critical component for ecohydrological modeling systems which are abstractions and simplifications of the complex reality they aim to represent but not a perfect representation of reality bastin et al 2013 the underlying assumptions and simplifications in the model formulation usually result in structural uncertainty teweldebrhan et al 2018 model performance is strongly dependent on the model structure which can be improved based on a more in depth analysis of the ecohydrological mechanisms being studied uncertainty analysis of ecohydrological models is a complex research area on its own the key to which is to understand quantify and reduce the uncertainty involved in the models in a cohesive systematic manner liu and gupta 2007 comprehensive research and discussion on this topic are outside of the scope of this paper and future efforts will be made to address this issue the limitations of this study also include the incompleteness of model application and verification only one case study was implemented to test the conceptual lumped ecohydrological model more case studies in other arid endorheic basins are required to verify the model practicability and reliability further because the present model applied in qingtu oasis was data hungry the parameters generated from the bayesian inference approach should be updated with new data the assumptions of a simplified water budget and static natural hydrological conditions can be relaxed by improving the monitoring network to gather more data which can be examined in future research 5 conclusions in many arid endorheic basins worldwide ecological water diversion can be effective for restoring deteriorated oasis ecosystems the implementation of this management practice in the shiyang river basin northwest china indicates that ecological water diversion contributed to restoring lost ecohydrological functions by establishing a new terminal qingtu oasis successfully during the last decade a total of 0 25 billion m3 water were diverted to help to restore qingtu oasis that now covers an area of 24 75 km2 and has a spatially averaged ndvi of 0 36 ecological water diversion recharged local groundwater effectively and elevated the water table by 1 m playing a critical role in fostering vegetation growth and oasis expansion qingtu oasis provided a good prototype study for testing an ecohydrological model driven by ecological water diversion to characterize how ecological water diversion affected hydrological and ecological processes of the recovered oasis a conceptual lumped ecohydrological model that incorporated the simulation of groundwater budget oasis responses and evapotranspiration dynamics was developed the model structure was clear and reasonable and the simulation was effective and reliable the model successfully simulated the evolution processes of groundwater depth oasis area and ndvi that were driven by ecological water diversion combined with scenario analysis the simulation of oasis responses to changes in ecological water diversion indicated that qingtu oasis was fragile and largely dependent on external water input the ecological water diversion was critically important for sustaining qingtu oasis and was suggested to continue the ecohydrological processes of the oasis were sensitive to the volume of water diversion in general more water input resulted in shallower groundwater depth larger oasis area and ndvi and greater evapotranspiration however the correlation between water consumption and water benefit was non linear an optimal volume of water diversion existed which was the most cost effective by using minimum water consumption to produce maximum water benefit the ideal point method was effective in identifying this optimal scenario the optimal water volume was 45 million m3 which would recover the oasis to 29 16 km2 with an ndvi of 0 41 this water volume was suggested to be taken as an upper threshold of water diversion because above this threshold the increase in water consumption would not increase water benefit effectively the improvement and advantage of this research were mainly reflected in a the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed conceptual lumped ecohydrological model and b the optimization analysis of oasis restoration using this model the main limitation was the parameter uncertainty due to limited data availability despite its limitations the model combined with scenario analysis had great potential in characterizing ecohydrological responses of oasis to ecological water diversion and it was an effective and practical tool for environmental conservation and water resource management ongoing research would help to relax the assumptions of the simplified water budget and static natural hydrological conditions further testing using additional information from the study site but also from other case studies are required to

4931,to achieve sustainable development ecological water diversion has been implemented as a management tool to recover degraded oasis ecosystems in arid endorheic basins aiming to explore oasis response and identify appropriate objectives for oasis restoration this study used a conceptual lumped ecohydrological model qingtu oasis in the shiyang river basin northwest china was used as a case study to test this model the model coupled groundwater budget oasis response and evapotranspiration dynamic modules the model structure was clear and reasonable and the calculation was of low cost the application in qingtu oasis verified the model s effectiveness the model was able to effectively capture the ecohydrological response attributed to the recovering of qingtu oasis in response to ecological water diversions occurring during the last decade combined with scenario analysis the simulation indicated that qingtu oasis was fragile and largely dependent on ecological water diversion ecological responses were positive and non linearly correlated with water input resulting in an optimal water input that produced maximum water benefit by minimum water consumption the ideal point method was useful in identifying this cost effective water volume for oasis restoration for qingtu oasis the optimal water diversion was 45 million m3 which would recover the oasis to 29 16 km2 with an ndvi of 0 41 the current oasis conditions approach the optimal status and ecological water diversion was suggested to continue and maintain the current oasis status the volume of 45 million m3 could be taken as an upper threshold of water diversion because above this threshold water consumption would not result in water benefits effectively this study proposed a practical tool for ecohydrological process simulation keywords conceptual lumped ecohydrological model ecohydrological dynamics ecological water diversion oasis restoration shiyang river arid endorheic basins 1 introduction endorheic basins cover about 11 4 of the global land area and are mainly located in arid and semiarid regions li et al 2018 because of rapid socio economic development that in many cases results in overexploitation of water resources many endorheic basins have suffered from the environmental and ecological crisis in terms of land degradation desertification loss of biodiversity enhanced sandstorms and drying up of terminal lakes zhu et al 2016 for example the degeneration of the riparian ecosystem along the lower tarim river the land degradation over the middle lower heihe river basin and the loss of the terminal lake of the shiyang river in northwest china have motivated special ecological restoration efforts aimed to sustainable development chunyu et al 2019 li et al 2013 zhang et al 2018 ecological water diversion which is the reallocation of water resources between engineered and natural systems is one method used to restore deteriorated ecosystems shen and ma 2020 ecological water diversion projects have been used in areas such as in the tarim heihe and shiyang river basins bao et al 2017 chunyu et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 understanding the complicated ecohydrological responses to ecological water diversion is critically important for improving the scientific basis and practical management of oasis restoration and conservation tian et al 2015 numerous studies have described riparian ecosystems in arid inland river basins as groundwater dependent ecosystems that benefit from the replenishment of the shallow groundwater system this due to ecological water diversion projects used to help with oasis restoration huang et al 2019b research on the correlation between ecological water diversion groundwater recharge and oasis restoration has shown that rises in shallow groundwater level in response to ecological water diversion inputs help mitigate water stress and increase water availability for vegetation bao et al 2017 hao and li 2014 li et al 2013 ling et al 2017 liu et al 2014 ma et al 2015 wu and tang 2010 xu et al 2007 ye et al 2009 yu et al 2012 zhao et al 2018 previous studies have shown that oasis restoration is sensitive to ecological water diversion however little attention has been paid to the appropriate target of ecological water diversion needed for oasis restoration larger oasis areas and better vegetation growth require more water diversion resulting in a water conflict between natural and socio economic systems because of the natural scarcity of water resources in arid endorheic basins it is usually unrealistic to restore an oasis to its original status a reasonable restoration target has a strong practical guiding significance in water resources management and environmental conservation zhang et al 2019 models that characterize the interactions between hydrological and ecological processes can be useful to assess and predict ecological water diversion impacts on oasis restoration for example an ecohydrological evolution model on riparian vegetation in arid regions was proposed by coupling groundwater movement and vegetation dynamics groundwater movement was modeled using the boussinesq equation and vegetation dynamics were modeled using the colonization and mortality functions liu et al 2012 also a fully distributed ecohydrological model was constructed by combining the modified modflow with a vegetation dynamic module han et al 2015 in these ecohydrological models the depth to the water table served as a critical variable that determined vegetation colonization and mortality as feedback depth to water table was affected by vegetation transpiration and shallow aquifer recharge caused by ecological water diversion contributions han et al 2015 liu et al 2012 the simulation domain was discretized into grids within which the interactions between hydrological and ecological dynamics were well recognized han et al 2015 liu et al 2012 however because these models were partially physically based and spatially distributed the model structure was relatively complex resulting in a complicated calculation furthermore these models did not link the oasis area to ecological water diversion directly and did not facilitate the simulation of overall oasis restoration conceptual models provide a good candidate to address these issues given they are less complex than physically based models and because of their capability in describing overall ecohydrological processes viola et al 2014 to pursue sustainable development quantifying the impact of ecological water diversion on oasis restoration is fundamentally important this study aimed to construct a conceptual lumped ecohydrological model which was driven by ecological water diversion the model integrated the processes of groundwater recharge oasis expansion vegetation growth and evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration consumed groundwater and provided feedback to groundwater storage and oasis restoration the model was applied in qingtu oasis which is the terminal oasis of the shiyang river basin in the arid region of northwest china the shiyang river basin is a typical arid inland river basin where the terminal lake had been dry for several decades due to the overexploitation of water resources in the last decade an ecological water diversion project was implemented to address the environmental problems and restore the dried up lake back to an oasis a model developed in this study was used to explore the impact of ecological water diversion on hydrological and ecological processes and their interactions based on which a reasonable restoration target was investigated this case study is representative of arid inland river basin systems and can be used as a reference for oasis restoration in other arid endorheic basins the results from this study can provide important information for stakeholders and policymakers to rationally manage oasis restoration and water resource allocation in arid endorheic basins 2 case study site and data 2 1 study area shiyang river originates in the southern part of qilian mountain and ends at the qingtu oasis between the badain jaran and tengger deserts fig 1 the whole basin is located at the middle part of gansu province in northwest china and lies between longitudes 101 41 104 16 e and latitudes 36 29 39 27 n with a catchment area of 41 600 km2 ma et al 2008 qilian mountain in the south reaches 5150 m above sea level masl the middle plain region lies between 1400 and 2000 masl and the lower basin in the north is between 1256 and 1400 masl due to differences in topography the basin exhibits typical semiarid to arid climatic features from south to north with annual precipitation of 600 50 mm and annual pan evaporation of 700 2600 mm ma et al 2008 qingtu oasis is located at the lowest reach of shiyang river and near the edge of the desert where annual precipitation is 50 mm and annual pan evaporation is 2600 mm ma et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 the basin is ecologically fragile because of limited water resources high population density and a high level of water resources utilization gu et al 2016 during the last half century anthropogenic activities have caused a series of detrimental environmental impacts especially vegetation degeneration and land desertification wang et al 2002 shiyang river once had a natural terminal lake named qingtu lake the lake had shrunken continuously throughout the historical period attributed to the overexploitation of water resources due to agricultural development since the han dynasty 110 bce irrigation had been consuming more and more water resulting in less water drainage into qingtu lake rapid population growth has exacerbated the lake shrinkage and the lake area shrunk to 120 km2 in the early 20th century and to 40 km2 by the 1940s the impoundment of the hongyashan reservoir almost cut off the inflow into the lake which completely dried up in 1959 zhu and li 2014 the natural oasis surrounding qingtu lake disappeared since the lake dried up accelerating the desertification of the lower basin the dried up lake had created a negative impact on the stability and sustainability of the shiyang river basin a general restoration plan of the shiyang river basin was implemented to address environmental and ecological issues affecting its sustainability at the original qingtu lake the objective was to preserve shallow groundwater for building a new oasis instead of trying to recover the natural lake zhu and li 2014 since september 2010 ecological water has been transferred annually through artificial channels from the hongyashan reservoir to the oasis gu et al 2016 by the end of 2018 the total volume of water diversion had reached 0 25 billion m3 the ecological water diversion formed seasonally inundated areas and shallow lakes small ponds and contributed to local groundwater recharge through deep percolation the improved water supply fostered vegetation growth and produced a new qingtu oasis though the precipitation is an important water source for vegetation water uptake it is so scarce that it cannot provide adequate water for vegetation growth instead groundwater is the main water source for vegetation growth and groundwater depth is a critical environmental factor affecting landscape dynamics huang et al 2019a at qingtu oasis groundwater depth increases in a gradient from the central oasis to the desert edge correspondingly the vegetation community changes from hygrophytes to xerophytes chunyu et al 2019 local vegetation includes phragmitesaustralis suaedaglauca haloxylonammodendron kalidiumfoliatum and nitrariatangutorum along which phragmitesaustralis a typical hygrophyte and nitrariatangutorum a typical xerophyte the ecological water diversion to qingtu oasis serves as a good prototype experiment on the evolution of a hydrological and ecological interacting system the dominant ecohydrological processes in oasis recovery have been identified by previous studies hence the development and verification of the conceptual lumped ecohydrological model in qingtu oasis is feasible han et al 2015 liu et al 2012 2 2 materials this study used yearly water diversion data from 2010 to 2018 in the analysis and modeling of the ecohydrological evolution of qingtu oasis the ecological water is usually diverted in the next half year when irrigation consumes less water in this case groundwater was mainly recharged by the water diversion of last year when modeling the ecohydrological dynamics the water diversion of a year was set as the input for driving oasis restoration for the next year for example the water diversion in 2010 was used as input into the water balance analysis of 2011 groundwater level data were obtained from a hydrometric station located at the northeast edge of qingtu oasis managed by the hydrology bureau of gansu province fig 1c annual mean groundwater depth data from 2010 to 2019 were used to assess the impact of ecological water diversion on groundwater recovery to assess the impact of ecological water diversion on vegetation restoration the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi was used given it is a widely applied indicator to estimate vegetation coverage and leaf area index bhanja et al 2019 zhang et al 2017 ndvi data of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis have been well recognized and utilized in the environmental impact assessment of arid inland river basins liu et al 2012 sun et al 2011 ndvi data from modis terra mod13q1 products which have a spatial resolution of 250 m and a temporal resolution of 16 days were used in this study because the ecohydrological dynamics were simulated with an annual time step yearly maximum ndvi data were used as vegetation surrogates representing ecological responses to groundwater variations the ndvi data spanned from 2000 to 2019 among which the pre impact period of 2000 2009 provided criterion for analyzing the ndvi changes during 2010 2019 the study area covered a total of 899 pixels with 31 rows and 29 columns visual inspection was practical and exercisable to identify the restored areas and the time when a pixel started to recover fig 2 shows the ndvi variations along three sample lines the pixels at the center responded first to ecological water diversion and the pixels away from the center responded later indicating the oasis expansion was driven by ecological water diversion the ndvi of pixels at the two sides fluctuated slightly indicating that these pixels were not affected by water diversion whose impact was restrained within a limited area 3 model description 3 1 ecohydrological mechanisms and assumptions ecological water diverted to qingtu oasis is impounded on low land where produces seasonal shallow lakes namely seasonally inundated areas surface water recharges groundwater through infiltration elevating the local water table groundwater storage increases within a limited space of the aquifer groundwater tank due to the lateral movement of groundwater the elevated water table improves soil moisture levels surrounding vegetation roots and alleviates water stress for vegetation to grow resulting in oasis recovery both the oasis area and vegetation coverage increase with the reduced groundwater depth which is a practically observable indicator characterizing the shallow groundwater regime jointly affected by land topography and depth to the water table the groundwater is shallower at the oasis center and goes deeper with the distance further away from the center in this context the oasis covers the sites where vegetation can use groundwater effectively so that the oasis area and vegetation condition is highly correlated with groundwater depth huang et al 2020 the vegetation consumes groundwater for transpiration and provides feedback to groundwater storage and groundwater depth evapotranspiration is positively correlated with groundwater depth oasis area and vegetation condition groundwater consumption further provides feedback to oasis restoration in general the ecohydrological processes driven by ecological water diversion are composed of groundwater recharge oasis recovery groundwater consumption and its feedback to oasis recovery fig 3 groundwater depth is an important index which characterizes the change in groundwater storage controls the water supply for vegetation growth and links the hydrological and ecological interactions besides ecological water diversion water inputs for the oasis include precipitation and groundwater inflow water output includes evapotranspiration and groundwater outflow the water is stored as groundwater soil water and surface water coupling ecological water diversion and natural hydrological cycle the local water balance embedded in ecohydrological processes for a time step of one year can be expressed as 1 w e p g in e t g out δ g δ s δ l where w e is the volume of ecological water diversion p is precipitation g in and g out is groundwater inflow and outflow respectively e t is evapotranspiration δ g δ s and δ l is the change in groundwater storage soil water storage and seasonal lake storage respectively to reduce complexity the model structure is simplified with a focus on the key ecohydrological processes wagener et al 2001 the model has three assumptions 1 spatial homogeneity and lumped parameters lumped models describe the watershed as a single entity and provide hydrological results in a spatially averaged way these models have been widely applied because of their validity reliability simplicity and low time cost charizopoulos et al 2017 tran et al 2018 with an emphasis on simplicity and effectiveness the proposed model assumes spatial homogeneity and represents the affected area as a single homogeneous unit the simulation uses lumped parameters and disregards spatial variability in physical properties such as groundwater depth and evapotranspiration 2 simplified water budget ecological water diversion is a key driving factor for groundwater recovery and oasis restoration therefore it must be considered in the water budget the precipitation amount is so scarce that it is assumed to be consumed by evapotranspiration almost completely its impact on groundwater is marginal compared with the contribution of ecological water diversion in this context precipitation is negligible in the water balance equation the difference between g in and g out is denoted as w g which indicates the impact of local groundwater processes on the water budget evapotranspiration is a dominant component of groundwater consumption the movement of soil water is simplified as a transition process from groundwater to evapotranspiration the soil water movement and the change in soil water storage are disregarded liu et al 2012 ecological water diversion produces seasonal ponds with limited water impoundment and marginal storage change the water balance equation is simplified and transformed as 2 δ g w e w g e t 3 static natural hydrological conditions because of an emphasis on the impact of ecological water diversion the natural hydrological conditions are assumed to be static the inter annual fluctuations in meteorological conditions are ignored resulting in steady pan evaporation e p levels in this study multi year mean pan evaporation of 2600 mm was used as e p before the ecological water diversion e t consumed groundwater dominantly δ g was assumed to be zero and there was a balance between e g and w g the evaporation of groundwater e g can be estimated by the averyanov equation 3 e g a 1 h h max b e p where a and b are empirical parameters and h max is maximum groundwater depth that restrains groundwater evaporation a and b were 0 76 and 1 53 respectively h max was 5 m chen et al 2014 in 2010 h 3 91 m combined with e p 2600 mm resulting in w g e g 192 mm the inter annual fluctuations in w g are ignored resulting in static local groundwater conditions 3 2 model structure and equations based on the aforementioned assumptions the model structure is simplified and the model is constituted by a hydrological module and an ecological module and the interactions between hydrological and ecological processes are characterized by the dynamics of groundwater carrying capacity fig 4 the main model input is ecological water diversion the outputs include groundwater depth oasis area and vegetation condition the hydrological module simulates a evapotranspiration that consumes groundwater and b groundwater depth that responds to the change in groundwater storage and drives ecological processes the connections between ecological dynamics and groundwater depth are determined by groundwater carrying capacity functions in the ecological module the ecological response is described by the oasis area and vegetation condition which are controlled by the area dynamic function and the vegetation dynamic function respectively oasis area and vegetation condition are input variables for calculating evapotranspiration which affects groundwater storage and triggers the following ecohydrological processes groundwater depth is calculated based on the water balance eq 2 the change in the vegetated area is proportional to the difference between groundwater carrying capacity and vegetated area at a certain time with a certain groundwater depth similarly the change in spatial mean ndvi of the vegetated area is proportional to the difference between groundwater carrying capacity and ndvi at a certain time with a certain groundwater depth muneepeerakul et al 2008 verhulst 1838 the model includes three differential equations 4 d h d t θ δ g a r 5 d a d t β a a gcc a 6 d v d t β v v gcc v 7 δ g w e 10 3 w g a r 10 3 e t a 10 3 e g a r a where h is groundwater depth in m t indicates time every one year step δ g

and vegetation condition respectively unit 1 year and a gcc and v gcc is groundwater carrying capacity gcc of the oasis area and vegetation condition respectively the dominant impact of the climate system on ecohydrological processes is through potential evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration is highly correlated with groundwater depth and vegetation condition mcmahon et al 2013 8 e t 1 k e v

described by sigmoidal functions huang et al 2020 9 a gcc h a max 1 exp h h a s a 10 a max α a r 11 v gcc h v max 1 exp h h v s v where a max and v max indicates the maximum vegetated area and ndvi a

describes the steepness of the groundwater carrying capacity curves unit m in essence the two groundwater carrying capacity functions describe the empirical relations of groundwater depth to oasis area and ndvi respectively table 1 summarizes all the variables and parameters used in the ecohydrological model 3 3 performance evaluation the simulation and forecasting accuracy is mainly determined by the quality of model parameters the hydrological and ecological data should be separated into two parts one part for calibration and the other for validation usually 60 70 of data are used for calibration and 30 40 of data are used for validation kan et al 2019 therefore the data of 2010 2015 and the data of 2016 2019 were used for calibration and validation respectively the agreement between simulated and observed data was evaluated by correlation coefficient r and root mean square error rmse which are commonly used performance evaluators han et al 2015 naseem et al 2016 viola et al 2014 the bayesian inference approach was used for parameter estimation because this approach is a well established and coherent methodology for statistical inference schaefli and kavetski 2017 when performing the bayesian inference because the posterior distribution is often highly dimensional and analytically intractable the analytical expression is substituted by sampling techniques based upon the markov chain monte carlo mcmc method haario et al 2006 2001 the bayesian methodology coupling with the mcmc approach has been widely applied in science and engineering to reconcile earth system models with data including prediction in space and time assimilation of observations and inference of model parameters vrugt 2016 the full matlab codes of the mcmc algorithm are available from github https github com mjlaine mcmcstat git in the application of the mcmc approach as the parameter estimation started from non optimized values the chain needs some time to find the location of the posterior therefore the chain with one hundred thousand samples was conducted by three runs starting from the values of the previous run the mean value of the last running chain was taken as the estimation of model parameters 3 4 application for scenario analysis using the ecohydrological model a scenario analysis was implemented to assess the impacts of changes in ecological water diversion on oasis evolution the multi year mean volume of water diversion from 2010 to 2019 was 30 million m3 three scenarios were assumed for 2020 to 2029 a ecological water diversion stopped due to water depletion b ecological water diversion continued and the annual volume remained 30 million m3 and c stronger efforts were made in ecological restoration and more water was diverted with the annual volume increased to 60 million m3 double of the volume during the last decade the correlation between water benefit and water consumption was investigated to identify the appropriate target of oasis restoration the water benefit was defined as the ecological outputs of water diversion and the water consumption was defined as the water loss caused by evapotranspiration the appropriate target of oasis restoration corresponds to a reasonable volume of ecological water diversion which produces a larger oasis area and ndvi with less water loss the simulation spanned from 2010 to 2029 until the oasis reached a stable status a total of 24 scenarios were modeled the annual volume of ecological water diversion was 5 10 15 110 115 and 120 million m3 with a unique interval of 5 million m3 for each scenario the evolutions of oasis area ndvi and evapotranspiration were simulated to get the final stable values for the stable statuses of different scenarios water benefits and water consumption were compared and an ideal point method ipm was used to analyze the appropriate target of oasis restoration shang 2008 the water benefit w b was defined as the spatial sum of ndvi values 12 w b a v where larger a and v result in larger w b the water consumption w c was defined as the difference between total evapotranspiration and basic evapotranspiration the basic evapotranspiration equals to w g 13 w c e t a e g a r a a r w g where shallower groundwater has a positive impact on e g e t and a resulting in both larger w c and w b in oasis management there is a trade off between ecological restoration and water savings it is a multiple criteria decision making problem including two contradictory objectives a maximum w b with largest oasis area and best vegetation condition and b minimum w c with least water loss the two objectives are incompatible and there is usually no optional solution at which both objectives reach their optimal values an optimal value of each objective can be obtained disregarding the other objective these optimal values form a supposed point that is called the ideal point the ipm ranks the options in terms of their distance to the ideal point and the option closest to the ideal point can be taken as the pareto solutions of the multi objective problem shang 2008 to eliminate the potential impact of relative scaling of w b and w c dimensionless values were used in the ipm analysis both w b and w c were normalized and expressed as proportions of their maximum values resulting in normalized water benefit n w b and normalized water consumption n w c if the oasis restoration is the only objective under consideration it is preferred to increase ecological water diversion and the extreme scenario is n w b n w c 1 on the other hand if the water saving is the only objective under consideration it is preferred to stop ecological water diversion and the extreme scenario is n w b n w c 0 to solve the multiple criteria problem of maximum n w b and minimum n w c a supposed scenario with n w b 1 and n w c 0 was taken as the ideal point the distances between each of the 24 scenarios and the supposed ideal point were calculated using the euclidean distance the scenario with minimum distance to the ideal point was taken as the optimization of oasis restoration corresponding to an appropriate oasis area ndvi and ecological water requirement 3 5 practical framework fig 5 synthesizes the methodologies mentioned above into a framework for ecohydrological simulation and potential application in oasis restoration in arid endorheic basins commonly found worldwide data monitoring and preparation provide the basis for ecohydrological simulation which requires ground truth data and remote sensing data such as the volume of water diversion groundwater depth and ndvi to mention a few mechanism analysis is necessary for a reasonable model structure and should focus on the critical interaction between hydrological and ecological processes the analysis results provide references for model simplification and assumptions which are mainly determined by the ecohydrological characteristics and data availability of a specific research area the premises of the simplified water budget and static natural hydrological conditions are applicable in the qingtu oasis and can also be revised for applicability in other case studies with variable ecohydrological conditions for example in the case that ecological water diversion produces a perennial lake where the change in lake storage is significant the simplified water balance eq 2 can be revised as 14 δ g w e w g e t δ l the change in groundwater storage δ g can be analyzed using the complete water balance eq 1 if necessary the observation and estimation of the variables in eq 1 depend on the specific hydrogeological features of different study sites three differential equations characterize the ecohydrological interaction and constitute the model the bayesian methodology coupling with the mcmc approach is useful in the inference of model parameters after calibration and validation the model can be applied for scenario simulation which results in the oasis status corresponding to specific volumes of water diversion and provides the data for optimum analysis the correlation analysis of water benefit and water consumption indicates the incompatibility between the two objectives maximum oasis recovery and minimum water cost the ipm methodology helps to identify the pareto solutions of this multi objective problem the oasis recovery target and ecological water requirement provide critical information for water resource managers and policymakers for adequately establishing ecological water diversion goals the continuous data collection at the hydrometric monitoring station in the years to come provides an opportunity for constant re evaluation and refining of the model model re calibration and re validation would help to improve the model accuracy and reduce the uncertainty of parameter estimation 4 results and discussion 4 1 ecohydrological recovery of qingtu oasis fed by ecological water diversion for a decade qingtu oasis has recovered in terms of the elevated water table expanded area and improved vegetation condition fig 6 annual mean groundwater depth experienced a substantial decreasing tendency with a total reduction of about 1 m the oasis expanded continuously and reached an area of 24 75 km2 in 2019 the oasis area was highly correlated r 0 95 with groundwater depth at a level of significance of p 0 05 the spatially averaged ndvi of the recovered area experienced a significantly increasing tendency indicating a better vegetation condition induced by ecological water diversion the oasis ndvi was also highly correlated r 0 94 with groundwater depth vegetation growth is affected by environmental factors such as soil texture water supply nutrients temperature and solar radiation to mention a few in arid inland river basins water availability is the principal limiting factor for vegetation growth because of low precipitation supply and high evaporation capacity liu et al 2012 vegetation roots obtain water from the phreatic aquifer and or the unsaturated soil zone where soil water is supplied by groundwater through capillary rising huang et al 2019b the observed significant correlation between oasis area ndvi and groundwater depth corroborated the rationale of using groundwater depth as a driving variable to simulate ecological responses 4 2 model calibration and validation the conceptual lumped ecohydrological model encompasses eleven parameters table 2 the evaluators of model performance are displayed in table 3 all r values were significant with p 0 05 rmse values were small and met the accuracy requirement fig 7 illustrates the model performance during calibration and validation the scatters distributed closely around the 1 1 line indicating that the simulated values matched well with the observed values the results verified the model capability to simulate the ecohydrological dynamics driven by ecological water diversion conceptual models are common tools in the ecohydrological simulation and the model parameters are usually calibrated to obtain a good fit between observed and simulated outputs engeland et al 2005 however the estimation of model parameters is a challenging task because of the highly non linear nature of ecohydrological processes and the fact that different parameter vectors driving models describing the physical processes might have the same effect on the model outputs bardossy and singh 2008 on the other hand data for model calibration and validation are typically observations taken from both satellite and in situ systems given that model inputs are subject to errors these errors will affect the estimation of model parameters and contribute to the uncertainty of the model outputs bastin et al 2013 in this context when applying this conceptual lumped ecohydrological model re evaluation of the model performance using the updated high quality data is necessary to improve the parameter estimation and model accuracy 4 3 oasis responses to changes in ecological water diversion results from the three different model scenarios used to predict oasis response to changes in ecological water diversion are shown in fig 8 the oasis dynamics from 2010 to 2019 were further simulated using the observed data and estimated parameters the results indicated a good consistency between the simulated and observed data verifying the model capability to capture oasis dynamics responding to ecological water diversion from 2020 to 2029 three different scenarios of ecological water diversion were analyzed and results showed that the oasis dynamics responded in various patterns a common feature was that the oasis reached relative stability after several years of evolution because of the balance between water input and water consumption groundwater depth oasis area and ndvi reached relatively stable values in 2029 the differences were mainly reflected in the tendency and range of oasis responses when ecological water diversion was interrupted due to water scarcity the oasis lacked external water supply and consumed local groundwater bringing down the water table and resulting in water deficit the increased groundwater depth decreased water availability for vegetation and caused oasis degradation in terms of reduced vegetated area and ndvi therefore it is assumed that qingtu oasis would again disappear if its ecological water requirement was not satisfied when ecological water diversion maintained the status quo the oasis largely held its current status groundwater depth was relatively stable due to the balance between recharge and evapotranspiration as a result the oasis area and ndvi fluctuated slightly because they had been gradually approaching groundwater carrying capacity for the current groundwater depth when more efforts were made in ecological restoration and the volume of water diversion was doubled the oasis dynamics responded positively the increased water diversion caused water surplus first then groundwater depth continued declining for several years until gradually reached a relatively stable level resulting in a new status of water balance correspondingly the oasis area and ndvi increased for several years due to the enhanced groundwater carrying capacity both the oasis area and ndvi remained relatively stable when they reached the groundwater carrying capacity level besides the differences in the tendency of oasis response the range of oasis response to the changes in ecological water diversion was also different comparing the stable status of scenarios a and b when ecological water diversion increased from 0 to 30 million m3 groundwater depth decreased by 1 08 m oasis area increased by 22 84 km2 and ndvi increased by 0 19 comparing the stable status of scenarios b and c when ecological water diversion further increased from 30 to 60 million m3 groundwater depth decreased by 0 85 m oasis area increased by 4 92 km2 and ndvi increased by 0 11 the same increment in ecological water diversion of 30 million m3 caused different oasis response the increase from 0 to 30 million m3 water induced more ecological benefits than the increase from 30 to 60 million m3 water in terms of larger increment of both oasis area and ndvi in arid endorheic basins where water resources are very scarce it is preferred to use less water to produce more ecological benefits and increase the effectiveness of the ecological water diversion the oasis response to changes in ecological water diversion provided the following implications for managers and policymakers first in the viewing of the oasis responses to the decrease of ecological water diversion the current oasis was fragile and dependent on external water input significantly the project should continue to satisfy the ecological water requirement and sustain the recovered vegetation community second the oasis recovery was positively correlated with the volume of ecological water diversion however the relationship was non linear the ecological benefit of unit water input during the early stages of oasis recovery was greater than the ecological benefit when the oasis had been restored near the maximum groundwater carrying capacity on the other hand when oasis had been recovered to some extent the further restoration required more water diversion and increased water cost therefore both ecological benefit and water cost should be considered in designing the strategies of ecological water diversion an appropriate objective of oasis restoration is necessary to determine a cost effective volume of water diversion given that the current qingtu oasis conditions are fragile and dependent on ecological water diversions it is necessary to maintain or increase watershed groundwater recovery to enhance oasis resilience groundwater overexploitation typically results in a drop down of the water table and it is a primary cause of environmental degradation in arid endorheic basins based on the water balance eq 2 the increase in δ g would benefit from arise in both w e and w g the restored natural groundwater regime is fundamental for regional ecological restoration in this context groundwater recovery is the ultimate target of watershed groundwater management policies in january 2006 the chinese central government launched a watershed groundwater restoration policy named the comprehensive treatment program of the shiyang river basin to restore the water table in the lower reaches hao et al 2017 the policy primarily aims to increase surface water supply control excessive groundwater exploitation promote water saving technologies and establish water user associations that function within the new water resources management framework however since the watershed groundwater recovery is a long slow and continuously changing dynamic process aarnoudse et al 2012 favorable management institutions reasonable farming strategies and supportive capital investments are all necessary to ensure the smooth implementation of the intended policy changes hao et al 2017 4 4 optimization of oasis restoration a total of 24 scenarios were simulated to investigate the correlation between oasis restoration and ecological water diversion results showed the ecohydrological evolution of the oasis was similar for all scenarios tested and that the oasis recovered gradually and reached a relatively stable status fig 9 with the increase in water diversion volume groundwater depth decreased substantially indicating ecological water diversion helped to recharge local groundwater effectively the improved water supply was conducive to vegetation growth and oasis expansion jointly affected by the elevated groundwater level and recovered vegetation evapotranspiration was strengthened significantly with the increased water volume of diversion the increasing rates of oasis area and ndvi slowed down when water input kept going up yet evapotranspiration increased continually and significantly in this case the ecological benefit decreased while water cost increased fig 10 shows the correlation between water benefit and water consumption the water benefit characterized ecological restoration and the water consumption characterized water loss caused by evapotranspiration the water benefit increased non linearly with water consumption when the water volume of diversion was relatively small the increment in water consumption produced a relatively large increase in water benefit indicating that water benefit was sensitive to water consumption conversely when the water volume of diversion was relatively large the sensitivity of water benefit to water consumption was lower and the same increment in water consumption produced a relatively small increase in water benefit the theoretical ideal point referred to the scenario that produced maximum water benefit using minimum water consumption hence the optimal scenario was the one closest to this ideal point the analysis of distance to the ideal point indicated that a water volume of 45 million m3 was the most cost effective scenario in this optimal scenario groundwater depth was 2 34 m oasis area was recovered to 29 16 km2 and ndvi increased to 0 41 in 2019 qingtu oasis covered an area of 24 75 km2 with ndvi of 0 36 close to the status of the optimal scenario the optimization analysis of oasis restoration provided the following implications for managers and policymakers it is important to recognize that more water diversion did not lead to equally better ecological restoration an appropriate objective of ecological restoration existed this objective corresponded to a threshold of water volume above which water benefit was limited but water consumption was high the optimal volume of water diversion for qingtu oasis was 45 million m3 which would result in the largest water benefit with the least water consumption the current status of oasis recovery has approached closely to this optimal scenario future efforts should be made to maintain the current status in order to improve the utilization efficiency of water resources the water volume of 45 million m3 was suggested to be taken as an upper threshold of water resource allocation for ecological water requirement 4 5 advantages limitations and future research this research proposed a conceptual lumped ecohydrological model addressing the linkage between ecological water diversion and oasis responses the model structure was simplified by focusing on the key hydrological and ecological processes including groundwater recharge and discharge oasis area and ndvi dynamics and evapotranspiration processes though the model had a simple structure and a small number of equations it successfully captured the main components of ecohydrological processes driven by ecological water diversion and showed good performance overall for the case study of qingtu oasis northwest china compared with ecohydrological models applied in the lower tarim river northwest china the advantages of this study relied on the model simplicity and effectiveness which required low cost of calculation han et al 2015 liu et al 2012 furthermore the proposed model linked ecological water diversion to oasis area and ndvi directly facilitated the simulation of overall oasis recovery figured out how much water was required for balancing groundwater recharge and discharge and provided the basis for optimization analysis of oasis restoration huang et al 2020 through scenario analysis using the conceptual lumped ecohydrological model this research added insights into the mechanisms behind ecohydrological responses to ecological water diversion for a scenario with certain water diversion ecohydrological processes of oasis evolved gradually for several years and approached a relatively stable status when the water input and water consumption was balanced for different scenarios with different volumes of water diversion the stable status of the oasis had different groundwater depth oasis area ndvi and evapotranspiration corresponding to various water benefit and water consumption based on the correlation analysis of water benefit and water consumption this research used the ipm approach to investigate the optimal scenario and suggested the appropriate objective of oasis restoration for managers though this study had the advantages mentioned above it also had some limitations one of which was due to model uncertainty the model uncertainty and errors usually source from the observational data used to drive and evaluate the model model parameters and the structure that is associated with the model s mechanisms and assumptions engeland et al 2005 liu and gupta 2007 the conceptual lumped ecohydrological model developed in this study required data such as the volume of water diversion groundwater depth and ndvi the intrinsic uncertainty in a given measurement e g in situ monitoring and remote sensing due to noise in the electronics of the sensor systems is an essential source of uncertainty in modeling bastin et al 2013 model parameters are usually difficult to be measured directly still they can be inferred by calibration that adjusts the parameter values to closely match the input output behavior of the model to the real ecohydrological processes the errors in data as well as the epistemic errors in model structure account for parametric uncertainty which reflects the inability to specify exact values of model parameters teweldebrhan et al 2018 the model structure is a critical component for ecohydrological modeling systems which are abstractions and simplifications of the complex reality they aim to represent but not a perfect representation of reality bastin et al 2013 the underlying assumptions and simplifications in the model formulation usually result in structural uncertainty teweldebrhan et al 2018 model performance is strongly dependent on the model structure which can be improved based on a more in depth analysis of the ecohydrological mechanisms being studied uncertainty analysis of ecohydrological models is a complex research area on its own the key to which is to understand quantify and reduce the uncertainty involved in the models in a cohesive systematic manner liu and gupta 2007 comprehensive research and discussion on this topic are outside of the scope of this paper and future efforts will be made to address this issue the limitations of this study also include the incompleteness of model application and verification only one case study was implemented to test the conceptual lumped ecohydrological model more case studies in other arid endorheic basins are required to verify the model practicability and reliability further because the present model applied in qingtu oasis was data hungry the parameters generated from the bayesian inference approach should be updated with new data the assumptions of a simplified water budget and static natural hydrological conditions can be relaxed by improving the monitoring network to gather more data which can be examined in future research 5 conclusions in many arid endorheic basins worldwide ecological water diversion can be effective for restoring deteriorated oasis ecosystems the implementation of this management practice in the shiyang river basin northwest china indicates that ecological water diversion contributed to restoring lost ecohydrological functions by establishing a new terminal qingtu oasis successfully during the last decade a total of 0 25 billion m3 water were diverted to help to restore qingtu oasis that now covers an area of 24 75 km2 and has a spatially averaged ndvi of 0 36 ecological water diversion recharged local groundwater effectively and elevated the water table by 1 m playing a critical role in fostering vegetation growth and oasis expansion qingtu oasis provided a good prototype study for testing an ecohydrological model driven by ecological water diversion to characterize how ecological water diversion affected hydrological and ecological processes of the recovered oasis a conceptual lumped ecohydrological model that incorporated the simulation of groundwater budget oasis responses and evapotranspiration dynamics was developed the model structure was clear and reasonable and the simulation was effective and reliable the model successfully simulated the evolution processes of groundwater depth oasis area and ndvi that were driven by ecological water diversion combined with scenario analysis the simulation of oasis responses to changes in ecological water diversion indicated that qingtu oasis was fragile and largely dependent on external water input the ecological water diversion was critically important for sustaining qingtu oasis and was suggested to continue the ecohydrological processes of the oasis were sensitive to the volume of water diversion in general more water input resulted in shallower groundwater depth larger oasis area and ndvi and greater evapotranspiration however the correlation between water consumption and water benefit was non linear an optimal volume of water diversion existed which was the most cost effective by using minimum water consumption to produce maximum water benefit the ideal point method was effective in identifying this optimal scenario the optimal water volume was 45 million m3 which would recover the oasis to 29 16 km2 with an ndvi of 0 41 this water volume was suggested to be taken as an upper threshold of water diversion because above this threshold the increase in water consumption would not increase water benefit effectively the improvement and advantage of this research were mainly reflected in a the simplicity and effectiveness of the proposed conceptual lumped ecohydrological model and b the optimization analysis of oasis restoration using this model the main limitation was the parameter uncertainty due to limited data availability despite its limitations the model combined with scenario analysis had great potential in characterizing ecohydrological responses of oasis to ecological water diversion and it was an effective and practical tool for environmental conservation and water resource management ongoing research would help to relax the assumptions of the simplified water budget and static natural hydrological conditions further testing using additional information from the study site but also from other case studies are required to assess the broader applicability and reliability of the model credit authorship contribution statement feng huang conceptualization methodology software formal analysis investigation data curation

4932,dew as an important contribution of non rainfall water nrw plays a vital role in ecosystem processes in arid and semi arid regions and is expected to be affected by climate warming infrared heater warming systems have been widely used to simulate climate warming effects on ecosystems however how this warming system affects dew formation has been long ignored and rarely addressed in a typical alpine grassland ecosystem on the northeast of the tibetan plateau we measured dew amount and duration using three independent methods artificial condensing surfaces leaf wetness sensors and in situ dew formation on plants from 2012 to 2017 we also measured plant traits related to dew conditions the results showed that 1 warming reduced the dew amount by 41 6 91 1 depending on the measurement method and reduced dew duration by 32 1 days compared to the ambient condition 2 different plant functional groups differed in dew formation 3 under the infrared warming treatment the dew amount decreased with plant height while under the ambient conditions the dew amount showed the opposite trend we concluded that warming with an infrared heater system greatly reduces dew formation

and ratcliffe 2012 hill et al 2015 wang et al 2019 biological crusts zhang et al 2009 fischer et al 2012 kidron and temina 2013 small animals steinberger et al 1989 zheng et al 2010 and microorganisms agam and berliner 2006 kidron et al 2011 kidron and temina 2013 2017 kidron and kronenfeld 2019 dew also determined the magnitude of water and energy flux and ecological processes during the periods of drought beysens et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 gotsch et al 2015 in particular dew has significant effects on soil plant interactions munné 1999 kidron and starinsky 2012 goldsmith et al 2013 wang et al 2019 and dew influences plant foliar uptakes berry et al 2019 berry and goldsmith 2020 increases photosynthesis by enhancing co2 uptake and decrease transpiration beysens 1995 benasher et al 2010 wang et al 2017a goldsmith et al 2017 to date evidence suggests that dew in ecosystems alters microclimate by changing energy balance water budget and plant water status tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 kaseke and wang 2018 in turn dew formation in ecosystems is affected by many factors dew results from the condensation of water vapor on a surface in contrast to fog soil water adsorption or other non rainfall water kaseke et al 2017 beysens 2018 kidron and starinsky 2019 kidron and kronenfeld 2020 dew condensation process can proceed because the substrate surface cools down below the dew point temperature of surrounding air due to the radiation deficit between surface and atmosphere beysens 2016 beysens et al 2003 dew formation therefore depends on the details of the condensation surface properties e g substrate shape size emissivity and heat capacity and surface roughness location e g angle orientation position and height above ground determining the sky view factor and the characteristics of the atmospheric condition e g air temperature relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit kidron 2005 kidron and starinsky 2019 the dew formation processes and the influencing factors were thoroughly covered by agam and berliner 2006 kidron and starinsky 2019 beysens 1995 2006 and the important book of beysens 2018 furthermore the above mentioned factors e g substrate properties atmospheric condition would change under different climatic conditions and are associated with different plant species or functional groups agam and berliner 2006 hao et al 2012 liu et al 2020 few studies have investigated the influences of different plant functional groups on dew formations plant functional groups can change the micro environment and substrates properties affecting dew amount and duration through differences in aboveground biomass leaf area leaf roughness and plant height wang et al 2012 xu et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 thus it is expected that rapidly changing climates and different plant functional groups will significantly affect dew formation walther et al 2002 xiao et al 2013 li et al 2018 to simulate climate warming an infrared heater warming system is widely used to address the potential impacts of climate warming on ecosystems in the field liu et al 2018 song et al 2019 ettinger et al 2019 however there are differences between infrared heater warming and natural warming song et al 2019 shaver et al 2000 for natural warming the extra energy should dissipate in three pathways sensible heat latent heat and soil heat fluxes shaver et al 2000 rustad et al 2001 these three energy dissipation pathways are responsible for warming of the air increasing evapotranspiration and heating the soil respectively shaver et al 2000 in terms of the three heat dissipation pathways the infrared heater warming system is technically different from the natural warming it will increase the air temperature and the air sensible heat radiation which will lead to the increase of the drying degree in the micro environment at the community scale and will affect a number of ecosystem processes rustad et al 2001 liu et al 2016 therefore the effects of infrared heater warming have the potential to influence dew formation wolkovich et al 2012 moni et al 2019 recently there are increasing number of studies on dew research tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 wang et al 2017a aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 most of which analyzed the ecological effects of dew on ecosystem processes such as plant photosynthesis and transpiration in ecosystems ninari and berliner 2002 de boeck et al 2015 wang et al 2017b beysens 2018 or compared the effects of environmental factors on dew formation hao et al 2012 ettinger et al 2019 beysens 2016 there are also substantial efforts have been made to study the potential impacts of climate warming on dryland ecosystems by manipulating temperature in the field with various warming facilities kimball et al 2018 moni et al 2019 song et al 2019 however the effects of artificial warming on dew formation and ecosystem processes have not been addressed and have been overlooked as a result the observed changes in ecological processes in various climate change studies are likely attributed to some extent to altered dew amounts misrepresenting the effects of warming on ecosystem processes wolkovich et al 2012 song et al 2019 few studies on dew research have been conducted in the context of climate change and global warming experiments have not reported the effects of climate change or plant traits and functional groups on dew formation or even considered the effects of dew as a long term factor affecting soils and plants as well as ecosystem processes during the course of climate change tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 li et al 2018 on the other hand few studies have investigated the influences of different plant traits or functional groups on dew amount and duration wang et al 2012 xu et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 therefore the impacts of artificial warming plant traits and functional groups on dew formation urgently need to be revealed to better understand the impacts of warming on ecosystem processes korell et al 2019 experimental data from field based climate change experiments are crucial to determine mechanistic links between simulated climate change and dew formation this study is a part of a comprehensive warming experiment in a typical alpine grassland in tibet plateau liu et al 2018 where we measured the dew amount and duration using the methods of the artificial condensation surface leaf wetness sensor and in situ plant dew formation measurement to explore the responses of dew formation among different functional groups to simulated climate warming the objectives of the present study were to 1 address how the widely used infrared heater warming system affects dew amount and duration and 2 elucidate whether plant functional groups which are expected to shift under future warming affect dew formation under ambient and warming conditions our results will enhance the understanding of the characteristics of dew formation under a warming climate in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site was located at haibei national field research station of the alpine grassland ecosystem 37 36 n 101 19 e 3215 m a s l in the northeastern part of the tibetan plateau china the mean annual air temperature and precipitation were 1 2 c and 489 0 mm during 1980 2014 respectively liu et al 2018 approximately 80 of the precipitation was concentrated in the growing season from may to september the ambient conditions of air temperature and precipitation distribution of study area was shown at fig 1 this mesic alpine grassland is dominated by stipa aliena elymus nutans and helictotrichon tibeticum the soil is classified as a mollisol according to usda soil taxonomy the average soil bulk density organic carbon concentration and ph were 0 8 g cm 3 63 1 g kg 1 and 7 8 at the 0 10 cm soil depth respectively lin et al 2016 2 2 warming experiment design our study was conducted within an experimental warming precipitation infrastructure within an area of 50 m 110 m that was established in july 2011 fig 2 a the design of the experiment was detailed in liu et al 2018 in brief the experiment manipulated the temperature 2 c control and precipitation 50 control 50 with a completely randomized design each treatment had six replicates and six plots of 2 2 m 1 8 m were randomly divided into six blocks the warming treatment was warmed by two infrared heaters 220 v 1200 w 1 0 m long 0 22 m wide and 1 2 m above the ground which operate all the time and had been resulting in an increase of 2 c above ambient temperature at the top 5 cm layer of the soil ma et al 2017 in the current study we only compared ambient and warming conditions fig 2 air temperature and relative humidity probes vp 3 meter group inc pullman wa usa were installed 30 cm above the soil surface within each plot all data were automatically recorded hourly and stored in a data logger em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa 2 3 dew formation measurements we used three methods to measure dew amount and duration fig 3 1 artificial condensation surface the daily dew production was collected and measured using a preplaced plastic film 20 cm 20 cm in size 15 cm above the ground at each plot vuollekoski et al 2015 kidron and starinsky 2019 the specific material is polyethylene pe and its thickness is 0 05 cm the ir emissivity of this material ranges from 0 81to 0 93 zhu 2007 and it is 0 91 in our study calculated by the manufacturer moisture and dew measurements are calculated by the difference in weight before and after dew collection specifically the clean plastic films were weighed and placed at each plot at 20 00 pm local time the day before each measurement at 6 00 am the next morning the preplaced plastic films were weighed and the differences in the weights were designated as the dew production g for that night the dew amount mm was equal to the dew weight divided by the area of the plastic film in this study the dew amounts were measured by this method on sunny and windless days two times per week total number of measurements were 42 during the peak growing seasons from july to september in 2012 and 2013 2 in situ dew formation measurements on plants dew formation on plants was measured by sampling the outside plots to avoid disturbing the plant community composition of each plot similar individuals of the same species were chosen to measure dew formation for each species four or five individuals were selected weighed fresh weight measured plant heights and placed into floral foam to prevent wilting the day before measurement and then placed at each plot at 20 00 pm local time at 6 00 am the next morning these plants were weighed after being brought back to the laboratory to attain the total weight the dew production g was equal to the total weight minus the plant fresh weight at the same time we scanned the leaf area of plants and finally calculated the dew amount mm produced per unit plant area in this study the dew amounts were measured by this method on sunny and windless days three times per week total number of measurements were 40 during the peak growing season from july to september in 2017 3 leaf wetness sensors the dew amount and duration were monitored hourly using leaf wetness sensors s lwa m003 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa which is 15 cm above the ground and a hobo data logger h21 002 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa at each plot from 2015 to 2017 chen 2015 the dew amount was calculated by the fitting relationship between the measured leaf wetness sensor readings and the actual condensed water amount g we sprayed water evenly on the leaf wetness sensors to induce water condensation on their surface recorded the instrument reading and established the relationship between the condensation amount and the leaf wetness sensor readings in addition the simulated solid condensation amount was determined using the same method in a 20 c refrigerator to establish a relationship curve we repeated the above steps multiple times to ensure a wide range of leaf wetness sensor readings the relationship curve between the leaf wetness sensor readings and the condensation amount was fitted fig s1 and the relationship was as follows d 0 00005 rl2 0 0001 rl s r2 0 71 p 0 001 where d is the dew amount mm rl is the leaf wetness sensor reading and s is the area of the leaf wetness sensor which was 4 7 cm 5 1 cm in our study the former two measurement methods focused on dew amount while only the leaf wetness sensor method measured the dew duration the data were automatically recorded hourly and dew duration was calculated as the number of days for which dew was recorded between 8 00p m and 6 00 a m of the next morning during the measuring periods 2 4 dew formation and aboveground biomass at the species level in total we measured dew formation at the species level for 10 species these ten species accounted for approximately 72 of the total community biomass liu et al 2018 we divided these plant species into three functional groups i e grasses stipa aliena elymus nutans and helictotrichon tibeticum forbs tibetia himalaica oxytropis ochrocephala medicago ruthenica gentiana straminea and saussurea pulchra and sedges kobresia humilis and carex przewalskii and separately analyzed their dew formation responses to warming the aboveground biomass was separated into grasses sedges and forbs harvested and oven dried at 65 c to a constant weight plant height was measured using five selected individuals per species in each plot before dew formation measurement during the experimental periods 2 5 the extra radiative distribution the radiative flux of infrared heater and the distance from the lamp to the condenser should affect the ir energy balance and dew formation here the extra ir power received by the condensing surface radiative flux per unit condensing surface gi w m2 at different height compared to ambient conditions were quantitatively explained by following method s i a i b i 2 t a n α h i 0 22 b i g i p s i p 2 t a n α h i 0 22 b i where si m2 and p w are irradiated area and mean emitted power by two infrared heaters 1 0 m long 0 22 m wide 1200 w at the height of hi m respectively α is the angle between the lampshade and the vertical line of the infrared lamp and it equals 30 in this study plots ai m and bi m are the length and width of si hi m is the distance from the lamp to the condenser 2 6 data analysis based on long term meteorological observations the dew point temperature was calculated by penman monteith equation with the following function allen et al 1998 t d e w 116 91 237 3 l n e a 16 78 l n e a e a r h 100 e o t e o t a 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t t 237 3 where tdew is dew point temperature c ea is actual vapour pressure kpa eo t is saturation vapor pressure at the air temperature ta kpa and t a is air temperature c meanwhile the temperature differences ta tdew was calculated by the difference between the air temperature ta and dew point temperature tdew to represent the difficult degrees of dew formation the dew point temperature was calculated using long term meteorological observations linear regression was used to test the relationship between plant height and dew amount in the control and warming treatments to test the warming effect one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s hsd test were used to determine differences in dew amount and duration between the control and warming plots all statistical analyses were conducted using r 3 2 2 software r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria 2013 differences were considered significant at p 0 05 unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 effects of warming on the dew formation the multiple measurement methods showed decreased dew amounts under warming conditions warming resulted in average decreases of 91 7 83 9 and 41 6 in dew amount by the artificial condensation surfaces method the in situ dew formation on plants and the leaf wetness sensors respectively linear mixed effects model p 0 001 fig 4 from 2015 to 2017 warming significantly decreased the dew duration by an average of 10 3 linear mixed effects model p 0 001 fig 5 a therefore warming reduced the total dew formation by not only reducing the daily dew amounts mm day but also the dew duration days the results also showed that warming significantly increased the temperature differences ta tdew by 3 8 p 0 001 fig 5b which made dew formation more difficult furthermore the differences in the dew amount between the control and warming treatments dcontrol dwarming showed significant differences at the seasonal scale fig 5c 3 2 effects of warming on dew amount among different functional groups the total aboveground biomass and dew amounts among each functional group were measured by in situ dew formation measurements on plants in this study the results showed that different plant functional groups significantly differed in dew formation and warming significantly decreased the dew amount among each functional group a reduction of 83 5 71 6 97 6 and 87 0 for sedges forbs grasses and all species combined fig 6 a while it slightly changed the aboveground biomass of different functional groups fig 6b 3 3 effects of warming on the relationships between plant height and dew amount compared with the control treatment the warming treatment significantly affected the relationship between plant height and dew amount p 0 001 n 60 fig 7 in the control treatment linear regression revealed that the dew amount was significantly positively correlated with plant height r2 0 35 p 0 001 fig 7a however dew amount was significantly negatively correlated with plant height r2 0 34 p 0 001 fig 7b in the warming treatment 3 4 the radiative power distribution under inferred warming compared with the ambient treatment the effects of infrared heaters on dew formation are mainly attributed to the extra ir heating radiative power received by the condensing surface at different heights the infrared heaters are regarded as a linear light source and their radiative area si m2 increases with the increase of the distance from the lamps fig 8 a with the constant emitting power the extra ir power from the infrared heaters decreases gradually with the increase of the distance from the lamps fig 8b therefore the extra ir power increases gradually with the increase of height above ground the relationship between extra radiative flux and the distance from the lamp was shown at fig 8b the extra ir power at 10 cm from the lamps 110 cm above the ground was 3181 8 w m2 while it was 436 0 w m2 at 120 cm from the lamps at the surface ground the extra ir power of infrared lamps at 10 and 20 cm above the ground were 469 7 w m2 and 509 2 w m2 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 warming reduces dew amount and changes seasonal patterns of dew formation our study showed that warming significantly reduces dew amount using three distinct measurement methods fig 4 but to different degrees there are many methods and substrates have been used for dew harvest and they have different results even under the same climate conditions or at the same locations kidron and starinsky 2019 groh et al 2018 this is mostly due to different substrates properties in each method such as shape size roughness infrared emissivity heat capacity and radiative cooling processes kidron 2005 2010 kidron and starinsky 2019 also different collection methods involve different condensation water components such as water vapor adsorption horizontal precipitation and guttation which are challenging to be differentiated from one another kidron and starinsky 2019 therefore in our study we focus on the dew formation dynamics under warming and ambient conditions using three independent methods the converging results enhance the robustness of our major conclusions on the impacts of infrared heating warming on dew formation warming can reduce dew formation in two ways by hindering dew condensation and shortening dew retention warming can hinder the dew condensation processes by decreasing the air humidity and increasing evaporation scheff and frierson 2014 li et al 2018 additionally warming changes the air temperature dew point temperature and dew point depression fig 5b which makes it more difficult for the air temperature to approach the dew point temperature beysens 1995 jacobs et al 2006 mortuza et al 2014 warming can also accelerate the dew evaporation process xiao et al 2013 dew droplets lasted for a shorter period of time under warmer temperatures which also led to a lower dew duration or amount xu et al 2015 in this study we found that warming reduces dew formation fig 5 which is a major contribution of nrw in water limited ecosystems kidron and starinsky 2019 therefore plants growing under water stress would have higher risks of not surviving under warming conditions tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 on the other hand it should be noticed that there is a regular diurnal variations in the daily dew amount and it must be influenced by rainfall distribution due to changed water vapor concentration and relative humidity in atmosphere and soil environment overall under the rapidly changing climate changes in dew formation should be considered an important environmental factor and should not be neglected in arid and cold regions 4 2 dew formation varied among different functional groups under warming functional groups create different microenvironments and have different water use strategies to influence the dew production and plant water uptake zhuang and zhao 2017 wang et al 2019 dew formation is also great influenced by many factors including substrate shape size emissivity and heat capacity surface roughness leaf angle orientation position and plant height kidron and starinsky 2019 meanwhile environmental conditions such as temperature relative humidity and wind speed change due to various micromorphological features and distribution patterns among different functional groups agam and berliner 2006 affecting dew formation and duration ninari and berliner 2002 our results showed that different functional groups had different degrees of dew formation consistent with our expectations to date few studies have investigated how biotic factors e g plant traits and functional groups affect dew formation here we examined the effects of plant traits i e plant height and aboveground biomass on dew formation in different plant functional groups sedges forbs and grasses and found that sedges and forbs with shorter heights are associated with less dew than grasses with taller heights under natural conditions fig 6 because under ambient conditions the upper canopy air temperature is lower at night due to this area receiving less land surface radiation dew formation occurs earlier in higher leaves such as those of grasses zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2017a in addition the dominant taller species stipa aliena elymus nutans and helictotrichon tibeticum usually have more aboveground biomass konrad et al 2015 ma et al 2017 than shorter species which can facilitate dew formation and retention pan et al 2010 additionally the dew water stored within a dense canopy can be preserved for a longer period of time through the reduction in evaporation xiao et al 2013 under warming conditions the aboveground biomass and plant height increased and the community composition changed with a higher prevalence of grass in the alpine ecosystems liu et al 2018 such changes should be beneficial for dew formation based on our findings under ambient conditions i e results from the control plots fig 7a however a substantial reduction in dew formation was observed under the warming treatments fig 4 and fig 5 in addition we found that warming resulted in a lower dew amount on taller plants in contrast to the results under ambient conditions fig 7 warming changed the relationship between plant height and dew amount in both direct and indirect ways warming directly affected the air temperature profile and made dew formation more difficult wolkovich et al 2012 in this case the taller plants had less dew formation because artificial infrared heating made the temperature of the taller canopy higher than that of the lower canopy xiao et al 2013 warming indirectly caused the soil moisture to evaporate more quickly during the night tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 li et al 2018 more importantly according to energy balance model beysens 2016 dew formation occurred with the radiative deficit power at the condensing surface radiative emission minus radiative absorption from the environment and the heat losses with surrounding air beysens 2016 2018 as for artificial warming device infrared heaters will supply extra ir power which would be received by the condensing surface at different height based on the relationship between extra radiative flux of infrared heating lamp and the distance from the lamp fig 8 the distance from lamp to plant should affect the ir energy balance during the dew formation process at different heights due to a smaller distance from the lamps the taller plants have an increase in ir heating radiative flux under artificial warming conditions leading to the less dew formation in this case therefore the shorter plants experienced more dew collection than the higher plants during the night under warming conditions clearly warming influenced the dew formation on plants and changed the ecosystem processes compared with those under natural conditions 4 3 infrared heater warming system reduces dew formation an overlooked factor in climate change studies there have been many studies about the response of ecosystem processes to climate change using various artificial warming methods in dry ecosystems kimball et al 2018 song et al 2019 korell et al 2019 but the possible impacts from the differences between artificial and natural warming on the experimental results have often been overlooked our results showed that artificial warming with an infrared heater warming system affects dew formation which likely affects ecosystem processes liu et al 2016 however it is worth noting that natural climate warming and the infrared heater warming system differ in terms of their heat dissipating pathways korell et al 2019 artificial warming generates more heat radiation in the air and drier micro environments than natural warming liu et al 2018 this difference will affect a number of ecosystem processes and is often overlooked across simulated climate change experiments warming makes plants grow taller liu et al 2018 but taller plants produced less dew under warming in our study fig 6 this indicates that the dew formation was significantly reduced under the experimental warming conditions in addition the relationship between dew formation and plant height changed being positively correlated under the control treatment to being negatively correlated under the warming treatment fig 7 for such cases the conclusions of the impacts of warming obtained by artificial warming experiments may deviate from the actual impacts of warming on ecosystem processes under future climate warming the changes in water condensation will also have an especially profound impact on the ecosystem patterns and processes in dryland ecosystems li et al 2018 wang et al 2017b therefore we suggest that the impact of experimental warming on dew formation should be considered an important environmental factor affecting ecosystems processes during climate warming 5 conclusions using three measurement methods we observed that warming significantly reduced the dew amount and duration and changed its seasonal patterns different plant functional groups had different effects on dew formation due to their associated microclimates and plant heights resulting in taller plants experiencing more dew formation however artificial warming caused the taller plants to have less dew formation due to the associated heat radiation we also found that infrared heater warming systems markedly reduced dew formation which should be addressed to avoid overestimating the impact of climate warming on ecosystems during global change studies our study demonstrates that dew condensation responds to climate warming and highlights that microhabitat conditions and plant traits mediate dew formation under warming conditions having an important potential effect on ecosystems processes in

and ratcliffe 2012 hill et al 2015 wang et al 2019 biological crusts zhang et al 2009 fischer et al 2012 kidron and temina 2013 small animals steinberger et al 1989 zheng et al 2010 and microorganisms agam and berliner 2006 kidron et al 2011 kidron and temina 2013 2017 kidron and kronenfeld 2019 dew also determined the magnitude of water and energy flux and ecological processes during the periods of drought beysens et al 2006 zhang et al 2019 gotsch et al 2015 in particular dew has significant effects on soil plant interactions munné 1999 kidron and starinsky 2012 goldsmith et al 2013 wang et al 2019 and dew influences plant foliar uptakes berry et al 2019 berry and goldsmith 2020 increases photosynthesis by enhancing co2 uptake and decrease transpiration beysens 1995 benasher et al 2010 wang et al 2017a goldsmith et al 2017 to date evidence suggests that dew in ecosystems alters microclimate by changing energy balance water budget and plant water status tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 kaseke and wang 2018 in turn dew formation in ecosystems is affected by many factors dew results from the condensation of water vapor on a surface in contrast to fog soil water adsorption or other non rainfall water kaseke et al 2017 beysens 2018 kidron and starinsky 2019 kidron and kronenfeld 2020 dew condensation process can proceed because the substrate surface cools down below the dew point temperature of surrounding air due to the radiation deficit between surface and atmosphere beysens 2016 beysens et al 2003 dew formation therefore depends on the details of the condensation surface properties e g substrate shape size emissivity and heat capacity and surface roughness location e g angle orientation position and height above ground determining the sky view factor and the characteristics of the atmospheric condition e g air temperature relative humidity and vapor pressure deficit kidron 2005 kidron and starinsky 2019 the dew formation processes and the influencing factors were thoroughly covered by agam and berliner 2006 kidron and starinsky 2019 beysens 1995 2006 and the important book of beysens 2018 furthermore the above mentioned factors e g substrate properties atmospheric condition would change under different climatic conditions and are associated with different plant species or functional groups agam and berliner 2006 hao et al 2012 liu et al 2020 few studies have investigated the influences of different plant functional groups on dew formations plant functional groups can change the micro environment and substrates properties affecting dew amount and duration through differences in aboveground biomass leaf area leaf roughness and plant height wang et al 2012 xu et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 thus it is expected that rapidly changing climates and different plant functional groups will significantly affect dew formation walther et al 2002 xiao et al 2013 li et al 2018 to simulate climate warming an infrared heater warming system is widely used to address the potential impacts of climate warming on ecosystems in the field liu et al 2018 song et al 2019 ettinger et al 2019 however there are differences between infrared heater warming and natural warming song et al 2019 shaver et al 2000 for natural warming the extra energy should dissipate in three pathways sensible heat latent heat and soil heat fluxes shaver et al 2000 rustad et al 2001 these three energy dissipation pathways are responsible for warming of the air increasing evapotranspiration and heating the soil respectively shaver et al 2000 in terms of the three heat dissipation pathways the infrared heater warming system is technically different from the natural warming it will increase the air temperature and the air sensible heat radiation which will lead to the increase of the drying degree in the micro environment at the community scale and will affect a number of ecosystem processes rustad et al 2001 liu et al 2016 therefore the effects of infrared heater warming have the potential to influence dew formation wolkovich et al 2012 moni et al 2019 recently there are increasing number of studies on dew research tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 wang et al 2017a aguirre gutiérrez et al 2019 most of which analyzed the ecological effects of dew on ecosystem processes such as plant photosynthesis and transpiration in ecosystems ninari and berliner 2002 de boeck et al 2015 wang et al 2017b beysens 2018 or compared the effects of environmental factors on dew formation hao et al 2012 ettinger et al 2019 beysens 2016 there are also substantial efforts have been made to study the potential impacts of climate warming on dryland ecosystems by manipulating temperature in the field with various warming facilities kimball et al 2018 moni et al 2019 song et al 2019 however the effects of artificial warming on dew formation and ecosystem processes have not been addressed and have been overlooked as a result the observed changes in ecological processes in various climate change studies are likely attributed to some extent to altered dew amounts misrepresenting the effects of warming on ecosystem processes wolkovich et al 2012 song et al 2019 few studies on dew research have been conducted in the context of climate change and global warming experiments have not reported the effects of climate change or plant traits and functional groups on dew formation or even considered the effects of dew as a long term factor affecting soils and plants as well as ecosystem processes during the course of climate change tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 li et al 2018 on the other hand few studies have investigated the influences of different plant traits or functional groups on dew amount and duration wang et al 2012 xu et al 2015 tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 therefore the impacts of artificial warming plant traits and functional groups on dew formation urgently need to be revealed to better understand the impacts of warming on ecosystem processes korell et al 2019 experimental data from field based climate change experiments are crucial to determine mechanistic links between simulated climate change and dew formation this study is a part of a comprehensive warming experiment in a typical alpine grassland in tibet plateau liu et al 2018 where we measured the dew amount and duration using the methods of the artificial condensation surface leaf wetness sensor and in situ plant dew formation measurement to explore the responses of dew formation among different functional groups to simulated climate warming the objectives of the present study were to 1 address how the widely used infrared heater warming system affects dew amount and duration and 2 elucidate whether plant functional groups which are expected to shift under future warming affect dew formation under ambient and warming conditions our results will enhance the understanding of the characteristics of dew formation under a warming climate in the future 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site the study site was located at haibei national field research station of the alpine grassland ecosystem 37 36 n 101 19 e 3215 m a s l in the northeastern part of the tibetan plateau china the mean annual air temperature and precipitation were 1 2 c and 489 0 mm during 1980 2014 respectively liu et al 2018 approximately 80 of the precipitation was concentrated in the growing season from may to september the ambient conditions of air temperature and precipitation distribution of study area was shown at fig 1 this mesic alpine grassland is dominated by stipa aliena elymus nutans and helictotrichon tibeticum the soil is classified as a mollisol according to usda soil taxonomy the average soil bulk density organic carbon concentration and ph were 0 8 g cm 3 63 1 g kg 1 and 7 8 at the 0 10 cm soil depth respectively lin et al 2016 2 2 warming experiment design our study was conducted within an experimental warming precipitation infrastructure within an area of 50 m 110 m that was established in july 2011 fig 2 a the design of the experiment was detailed in liu et al 2018 in brief the experiment manipulated the temperature 2 c control and precipitation 50 control 50 with a completely randomized design each treatment had six replicates and six plots of 2 2 m 1 8 m were randomly divided into six blocks the warming treatment was warmed by two infrared heaters 220 v 1200 w 1 0 m long 0 22 m wide and 1 2 m above the ground which operate all the time and had been resulting in an increase of 2 c above ambient temperature at the top 5 cm layer of the soil ma et al 2017 in the current study we only compared ambient and warming conditions fig 2 air temperature and relative humidity probes vp 3 meter group inc pullman wa usa were installed 30 cm above the soil surface within each plot all data were automatically recorded hourly and stored in a data logger em50 meter group inc pullman wa usa 2 3 dew formation measurements we used three methods to measure dew amount and duration fig 3 1 artificial condensation surface the daily dew production was collected and measured using a preplaced plastic film 20 cm 20 cm in size 15 cm above the ground at each plot vuollekoski et al 2015 kidron and starinsky 2019 the specific material is polyethylene pe and its thickness is 0 05 cm the ir emissivity of this material ranges from 0 81to 0 93 zhu 2007 and it is 0 91 in our study calculated by the manufacturer moisture and dew measurements are calculated by the difference in weight before and after dew collection specifically the clean plastic films were weighed and placed at each plot at 20 00 pm local time the day before each measurement at 6 00 am the next morning the preplaced plastic films were weighed and the differences in the weights were designated as the dew production g for that night the dew amount mm was equal to the dew weight divided by the area of the plastic film in this study the dew amounts were measured by this method on sunny and windless days two times per week total number of measurements were 42 during the peak growing seasons from july to september in 2012 and 2013 2 in situ dew formation measurements on plants dew formation on plants was measured by sampling the outside plots to avoid disturbing the plant community composition of each plot similar individuals of the same species were chosen to measure dew formation for each species four or five individuals were selected weighed fresh weight measured plant heights and placed into floral foam to prevent wilting the day before measurement and then placed at each plot at 20 00 pm local time at 6 00 am the next morning these plants were weighed after being brought back to the laboratory to attain the total weight the dew production g was equal to the total weight minus the plant fresh weight at the same time we scanned the leaf area of plants and finally calculated the dew amount mm produced per unit plant area in this study the dew amounts were measured by this method on sunny and windless days three times per week total number of measurements were 40 during the peak growing season from july to september in 2017 3 leaf wetness sensors the dew amount and duration were monitored hourly using leaf wetness sensors s lwa m003 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa which is 15 cm above the ground and a hobo data logger h21 002 onset computer corporation bourne ma usa at each plot from 2015 to 2017 chen 2015 the dew amount was calculated by the fitting relationship between the measured leaf wetness sensor readings and the actual condensed water amount g we sprayed water evenly on the leaf wetness sensors to induce water condensation on their surface recorded the instrument reading and established the relationship between the condensation amount and the leaf wetness sensor readings in addition the simulated solid condensation amount was determined using the same method in a 20 c refrigerator to establish a relationship curve we repeated the above steps multiple times to ensure a wide range of leaf wetness sensor readings the relationship curve between the leaf wetness sensor readings and the condensation amount was fitted fig s1 and the relationship was as follows d 0 00005 rl2 0 0001 rl s r2 0 71 p 0 001 where d is the dew amount mm rl is the leaf wetness sensor reading and s is the area of the leaf wetness sensor which was 4 7 cm 5 1 cm in our study the former two measurement methods focused on dew amount while only the leaf wetness sensor method measured the dew duration the data were automatically recorded hourly and dew duration was calculated as the number of days for which dew was recorded between 8 00p m and 6 00 a m of the next morning during the measuring periods 2 4 dew formation and aboveground biomass at the species level in total we measured dew formation at the species level for 10 species these ten species accounted for approximately 72 of the total community biomass liu et al 2018 we divided these plant species into three functional groups i e grasses stipa aliena elymus nutans and helictotrichon tibeticum forbs tibetia himalaica oxytropis ochrocephala medicago ruthenica gentiana straminea and saussurea pulchra and sedges kobresia humilis and carex przewalskii and separately analyzed their dew formation responses to warming the aboveground biomass was separated into grasses sedges and forbs harvested and oven dried at 65 c to a constant weight plant height was measured using five selected individuals per species in each plot before dew formation measurement during the experimental periods 2 5 the extra radiative distribution the radiative flux of infrared heater and the distance from the lamp to the condenser should affect the ir energy balance and dew formation here the extra ir power received by the condensing surface radiative flux per unit condensing surface gi w m2 at different height compared to ambient conditions were quantitatively explained by following method s i a i b i 2 t a n α h i 0 22 b i g i p s i p 2 t a n α h i 0 22 b i where si m2 and p w are irradiated area and mean emitted power by two infrared heaters 1 0 m long 0 22 m wide 1200 w at the height of hi m respectively α is the angle between the lampshade and the vertical line of the infrared lamp and it equals 30 in this study plots ai m and bi m are the length and width of si hi m is the distance from the lamp to the condenser 2 6 data analysis based on long term meteorological observations the dew point temperature was calculated by penman monteith equation with the following function allen et al 1998 t d e w 116 91 237 3 l n e a 16 78 l n e a e a r h 100 e o t e o t a 0 6108 e x p 17 27 t t 237 3 where tdew is dew point temperature c ea is actual vapour pressure kpa eo t is saturation vapor pressure at the air temperature ta kpa and t a is air temperature c meanwhile the temperature differences ta tdew was calculated by the difference between the air temperature ta and dew point temperature tdew to represent the difficult degrees of dew formation the dew point temperature was calculated using long term meteorological observations linear regression was used to test the relationship between plant height and dew amount in the control and warming treatments to test the warming effect one way analysis of variance anova and tukey s hsd test were used to determine differences in dew amount and duration between the control and warming plots all statistical analyses were conducted using r 3 2 2 software r foundation for statistical computing vienna austria 2013 differences were considered significant at p 0 05 unless otherwise stated 3 results 3 1 effects of warming on the dew formation the multiple measurement methods showed decreased dew amounts under warming conditions warming resulted in average decreases of 91 7 83 9 and 41 6 in dew amount by the artificial condensation surfaces method the in situ dew formation on plants and the leaf wetness sensors respectively linear mixed effects model p 0 001 fig 4 from 2015 to 2017 warming significantly decreased the dew duration by an average of 10 3 linear mixed effects model p 0 001 fig 5 a therefore warming reduced the total dew formation by not only reducing the daily dew amounts mm day but also the dew duration days the results also showed that warming significantly increased the temperature differences ta tdew by 3 8 p 0 001 fig 5b which made dew formation more difficult furthermore the differences in the dew amount between the control and warming treatments dcontrol dwarming showed significant differences at the seasonal scale fig 5c 3 2 effects of warming on dew amount among different functional groups the total aboveground biomass and dew amounts among each functional group were measured by in situ dew formation measurements on plants in this study the results showed that different plant functional groups significantly differed in dew formation and warming significantly decreased the dew amount among each functional group a reduction of 83 5 71 6 97 6 and 87 0 for sedges forbs grasses and all species combined fig 6 a while it slightly changed the aboveground biomass of different functional groups fig 6b 3 3 effects of warming on the relationships between plant height and dew amount compared with the control treatment the warming treatment significantly affected the relationship between plant height and dew amount p 0 001 n 60 fig 7 in the control treatment linear regression revealed that the dew amount was significantly positively correlated with plant height r2 0 35 p 0 001 fig 7a however dew amount was significantly negatively correlated with plant height r2 0 34 p 0 001 fig 7b in the warming treatment 3 4 the radiative power distribution under inferred warming compared with the ambient treatment the effects of infrared heaters on dew formation are mainly attributed to the extra ir heating radiative power received by the condensing surface at different heights the infrared heaters are regarded as a linear light source and their radiative area si m2 increases with the increase of the distance from the lamps fig 8 a with the constant emitting power the extra ir power from the infrared heaters decreases gradually with the increase of the distance from the lamps fig 8b therefore the extra ir power increases gradually with the increase of height above ground the relationship between extra radiative flux and the distance from the lamp was shown at fig 8b the extra ir power at 10 cm from the lamps 110 cm above the ground was 3181 8 w m2 while it was 436 0 w m2 at 120 cm from the lamps at the surface ground the extra ir power of infrared lamps at 10 and 20 cm above the ground were 469 7 w m2 and 509 2 w m2 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 warming reduces dew amount and changes seasonal patterns of dew formation our study showed that warming significantly reduces dew amount using three distinct measurement methods fig 4 but to different degrees there are many methods and substrates have been used for dew harvest and they have different results even under the same climate conditions or at the same locations kidron and starinsky 2019 groh et al 2018 this is mostly due to different substrates properties in each method such as shape size roughness infrared emissivity heat capacity and radiative cooling processes kidron 2005 2010 kidron and starinsky 2019 also different collection methods involve different condensation water components such as water vapor adsorption horizontal precipitation and guttation which are challenging to be differentiated from one another kidron and starinsky 2019 therefore in our study we focus on the dew formation dynamics under warming and ambient conditions using three independent methods the converging results enhance the robustness of our major conclusions on the impacts of infrared heating warming on dew formation warming can reduce dew formation in two ways by hindering dew condensation and shortening dew retention warming can hinder the dew condensation processes by decreasing the air humidity and increasing evaporation scheff and frierson 2014 li et al 2018 additionally warming changes the air temperature dew point temperature and dew point depression fig 5b which makes it more difficult for the air temperature to approach the dew point temperature beysens 1995 jacobs et al 2006 mortuza et al 2014 warming can also accelerate the dew evaporation process xiao et al 2013 dew droplets lasted for a shorter period of time under warmer temperatures which also led to a lower dew duration or amount xu et al 2015 in this study we found that warming reduces dew formation fig 5 which is a major contribution of nrw in water limited ecosystems kidron and starinsky 2019 therefore plants growing under water stress would have higher risks of not surviving under warming conditions tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 on the other hand it should be noticed that there is a regular diurnal variations in the daily dew amount and it must be influenced by rainfall distribution due to changed water vapor concentration and relative humidity in atmosphere and soil environment overall under the rapidly changing climate changes in dew formation should be considered an important environmental factor and should not be neglected in arid and cold regions 4 2 dew formation varied among different functional groups under warming functional groups create different microenvironments and have different water use strategies to influence the dew production and plant water uptake zhuang and zhao 2017 wang et al 2019 dew formation is also great influenced by many factors including substrate shape size emissivity and heat capacity surface roughness leaf angle orientation position and plant height kidron and starinsky 2019 meanwhile environmental conditions such as temperature relative humidity and wind speed change due to various micromorphological features and distribution patterns among different functional groups agam and berliner 2006 affecting dew formation and duration ninari and berliner 2002 our results showed that different functional groups had different degrees of dew formation consistent with our expectations to date few studies have investigated how biotic factors e g plant traits and functional groups affect dew formation here we examined the effects of plant traits i e plant height and aboveground biomass on dew formation in different plant functional groups sedges forbs and grasses and found that sedges and forbs with shorter heights are associated with less dew than grasses with taller heights under natural conditions fig 6 because under ambient conditions the upper canopy air temperature is lower at night due to this area receiving less land surface radiation dew formation occurs earlier in higher leaves such as those of grasses zhang et al 2009 wang et al 2017a in addition the dominant taller species stipa aliena elymus nutans and helictotrichon tibeticum usually have more aboveground biomass konrad et al 2015 ma et al 2017 than shorter species which can facilitate dew formation and retention pan et al 2010 additionally the dew water stored within a dense canopy can be preserved for a longer period of time through the reduction in evaporation xiao et al 2013 under warming conditions the aboveground biomass and plant height increased and the community composition changed with a higher prevalence of grass in the alpine ecosystems liu et al 2018 such changes should be beneficial for dew formation based on our findings under ambient conditions i e results from the control plots fig 7a however a substantial reduction in dew formation was observed under the warming treatments fig 4 and fig 5 in addition we found that warming resulted in a lower dew amount on taller plants in contrast to the results under ambient conditions fig 7 warming changed the relationship between plant height and dew amount in both direct and indirect ways warming directly affected the air temperature profile and made dew formation more difficult wolkovich et al 2012 in this case the taller plants had less dew formation because artificial infrared heating made the temperature of the taller canopy higher than that of the lower canopy xiao et al 2013 warming indirectly caused the soil moisture to evaporate more quickly during the night tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 li et al 2018 more importantly according to energy balance model beysens 2016 dew formation occurred with the radiative deficit power at the condensing surface radiative emission minus radiative absorption from the environment and the heat losses with surrounding air beysens 2016 2018 as for artificial warming device infrared heaters will supply extra ir power which would be received by the condensing surface at different height based on the relationship between extra radiative flux of infrared heating lamp and the distance from the lamp fig 8 the distance from lamp to plant should affect the ir energy balance during the dew formation process at different heights due to a smaller distance from the lamps the taller plants have an increase in ir heating radiative flux under artificial warming conditions leading to the less dew formation in this case therefore the shorter plants experienced more dew collection than the higher plants during the night under warming conditions clearly warming influenced the dew formation on plants and changed the ecosystem processes compared with those under natural conditions 4 3 infrared heater warming system reduces dew formation an overlooked factor in climate change studies there have been many studies about the response of ecosystem processes to climate change using various artificial warming methods in dry ecosystems kimball et al 2018 song et al 2019 korell et al 2019 but the possible impacts from the differences between artificial and natural warming on the experimental results have often been overlooked our results showed that artificial warming with an infrared heater warming system affects dew formation which likely affects ecosystem processes liu et al 2016 however it is worth noting that natural climate warming and the infrared heater warming system differ in terms of their heat dissipating pathways korell et al 2019 artificial warming generates more heat radiation in the air and drier micro environments than natural warming liu et al 2018 this difference will affect a number of ecosystem processes and is often overlooked across simulated climate change experiments warming makes plants grow taller liu et al 2018 but taller plants produced less dew under warming in our study fig 6 this indicates that the dew formation was significantly reduced under the experimental warming conditions in addition the relationship between dew formation and plant height changed being positively correlated under the control treatment to being negatively correlated under the warming treatment fig 7 for such cases the conclusions of the impacts of warming obtained by artificial warming experiments may deviate from the actual impacts of warming on ecosystem processes under future climate warming the changes in water condensation will also have an especially profound impact on the ecosystem patterns and processes in dryland ecosystems li et al 2018 wang et al 2017b therefore we suggest that the impact of experimental warming on dew formation should be considered an important environmental factor affecting ecosystems processes during climate warming 5 conclusions using three measurement methods we observed that warming significantly reduced the dew amount and duration and changed its seasonal patterns different plant functional groups had different effects on dew formation due to their associated microclimates and plant heights resulting in taller plants experiencing more dew formation however artificial warming caused the taller plants to have less dew formation due to the associated heat radiation we also found that infrared heater warming systems markedly reduced dew formation which should be addressed to avoid overestimating the impact of climate warming on ecosystems during global change studies our study demonstrates that dew condensation responds to climate warming and highlights that microhabitat conditions and plant traits mediate dew formation under warming conditions having an important potential effect on ecosystems processes in

4933,this study examines the potential improvement in seasonal predictability of monthly precipitation and temperature using a novel machine learning approach the convolutional gaussian process cgp this approach allows us to take into account multiple quantities and their interdependencies simultaneously we use one global climate model florb01 part of the north american multi model ensemble nmme project and quantify its skill in reproducing precipitation and temperature in march and july across iowa central united states for lead times from one month to one year as a first step we train the cgp over the 1985 2005 period and then apply it out of sample from 2006 to 2019 over the validation period our results indicate that the cgp is able to increase the skill i e increased correlation coefficient and reduced root mean squared error in predicting precipitation and temperature compared to both the raw outputs and after standard bias correction these statements are consistent across different lead times and target month i e march or july these encouraging findings provide a new potential path towards improved predictability of the regional climate at the seasonal scale keywords convolutional gaussian process nmme seasonal forecasting machine learning 1 introduction issues related to the prediction of climate related variables with a lead time from several weeks to several months have been the subject of growing research interest examples of these heightened interest are represented by the operational european seasonal to interannual prediction eurosip vitart et al 2007 and the north american multi model ensemble nmme kirtman et al 2014 and its related collection of papers archambault et al 2019 several studies have examined the performance of these models in forecasting different quantities of interest including precipitation and temperature e g cash et al 2019 krakauer 2019 slater et al 2017 2019a zhang et al 2019 vittal et al 2020 streamflow and coastal flooding e g khouakhi et al 2019 slater et al 2019b slater and villarini 2018 drought e g ma et al 2019 sea surface temperature e g hervieux et al 2019 shin and huang 2019 the el niño southern

the strength associated with these projects in terms of skill at the shortest lead times this is particularly true for precipitation temperature and drought e g mo and lyon 2015 roundy et al 2015 ma et al 2016 for areas that are under significant influence by enso for instance infanti and kirtman 2016 showed higher correlation between forecasted and observed precipitation temperature in the southeastern southwestern and northwestern north america during eastern pacific el niño events some of the weaknesses of these models are tied to their limited capability in reproducing the precipitation and temperature at seasonal to annual lead times e g slater et al 2017 or in forecasting extended period of above below average conditions for the right reason kam et al 2014 different approaches have been developed to improve the forecasting skill of these models including bias correction and ensemble averaging e g hagedorn et al 2005 delsole and tippett 2014 thober et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2019 slater et al 2017 in terms of bias correction most of the work has generally focused on the comparison of the observed and forecasted anomalies e g kirtman et al 2014 becker et al 2014 with other approaches that have been applied to try to improve the predictive skill e g tian et al 2014 khajehei et al 2018 singh et al 2017 for instance singh et al 2017 explored the performance of standardization quantile mapping and nonlinear transformation in bias correcting the precipitation forecasts over india and found that the nonlinear transformation led the largest improvements narapusetty et al 2018 proposed to first apply quantile mapping to bias correct the temperature forecast and then use the observed relationship between temperature and precipitation to forecast precipitation they applied this methodology to the summer across the continental united states and found a reduction in root mean squared error rmse khajehei et al 2018 compared and contrasted the performance of different post processing approaches finding a good performance for a copula based ensemble post processing slater et al 2017 applied a simple bayesian updating approach for temperature and precipitation forecasts across europe and found that it performed well in correcting the models forecasts for conditional and unconditional biases see also zhang et al 2017 for its application to enso however most of the existing methods correct the biases in temperature and precipitation separately neglecting the significant correlation between temperature and precipitation and their biases in other words the bias information in temperature would be informative to infer the bias in precipitation and vice versa as a result the joint simultaneous modeling and correction of temperature and precipitation biases would be a promising way to improve the overall prediction performance however this is not a trivial task the major limitations that complicate the joint bias correction of temperature and precipitation are 1 the conventional methods e g quantile mapping are applied to single quantities after data fitting thus they are not general and flexible enough to represent the information in both temperature and precipitation and 2 there lacks an efficient way to explicitly characterize the relationship between temperature and precipitation and their biases machine learning techniques represent a good alternative offering great flexibility in data mapping for instance xu et al 2019 applied machine learning to bias correct and statistically downscale precipitation forecasts over china more specifically they used wavelet support vector machine and wavelet random forest and highlighted their better performance with respect to the more traditional quantile mapping however their method also only focuses on a single quantity i e precipitation building explicit relationships between temperature and precipitation and their biases within the machine learning context is still an unsolved task moreover few studies have examined the use of machine learning techniques to increase the predictive skill of these models simultaneously more generally cohen et al 2019 argued that new statistical techniques mostly developed outside the field of climate science collectively referred to as machine learning can be adopted by climate forecasters to increase the accuracy of s2s subseasonal to seasonal predictions and suggested that s2s prediction will be most beneficial to the public by incorporating mixed or a hybrid of dynamical forecasts and updated statistical techniques such as machine learning here we propose to use a novel machine learning approach the convolutional gaussian processes cgp to jointly improve the predictive skill of precipitation and temperature over iowa central united states for two target months i e march and july and lead times from one month to one year the basic idea of this method is to use a specially designed cgp to fit the relationship between the forecast and bias values for temperature and precipitation the feature of the proposed method is that it not only provides a flexible representation of the bias in temperature and precipitation but also builds an explicit relationship between the bias in these two quantities this feature is expected to outperform existing bias correction methods in terms of both accuracy and flexibility this study is organized as follows in the next section we will describe the data and the methodology while in section 3 we present the results section 4 summarizes the main points and concludes the paper 2 data and methodology we focus on a domain centered over iowa within the central united states this is an area of the country that has been experiencing several hydrometeorological extremes with the missouri mississippi flood event of spring 2019 being one of the most recent examples this is a highly agricultural region with most of the land used for corn and soybean production therefore our improved capability in predicting weather conditions with long lead times can have significant impacts for our preparation response and mitigation efforts here we focus on the evaluation of march and july precipitation and temperature for lead times ranging from one month to one year we have selected these two months as representative of two different hydrometeorological conditions one tied to the early spring snowmelt and one to summertime convection the reference data for temperature and precipitation are based on the monthly parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism dataset during 1981 2018 at a spatial resolution of 4 km across the continental united states daly et al 2008 we focus on the seasonal forecasts performed by the geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory gfdl forecast oriented low ocean resolution version of the cm2 5 gfdl flor version b01 available from the nmme project vecchi et al 2014 it has 12 members but here we consider the ensemble average this climate model has shown relatively promising skill in forecasting precipitation and temperature across the continental united states jia et al 2014 we compare the skill in forecasting temperature and precipitation produced by this model against what can be obtained through standard bias correction approach i e anomaly correlation we use bc in referring to it in the rest of the paper and the machine learning method introduced next we jointly formulate the relationship between forecast and bias values of temperature and precipitation as follows 1 e y o y f f y f f t y f f p y f where y o y t o y p o t is a vector of observed values of temperature y t o and precipitation y p o at a specific location grid y f y t f y p f t is the vector of forecast values of temperature y t f and precipitation y p f at the same location grid e y t o y t f y p o y p f t is the vector of the bias values while is the vector of random noise described by an identically and independent distributed multivariate normal distribution with mean vector 0 and covariance matrix σ 2 i 2 i 2 is a 2 2 identity matrix f y f f t y f f p y f t is the target transformation vector that builds the relationship between the forecast y f and the bias e vectors once we have this relationship f we can apply it to any new forecast value vector y f to obtain the corresponding bias value vector f y f then the predicted observation vector would be y f f y f which represents the temperature and precipitation values after correction the key to the accuracy and flexibility of this model is the way we design and construct f as mentioned in the introduction f should be 1 flexible enough to capture the bias feature in temperature and precipitation and 2 capable of capturing the implicit relationship between temperature and precipitation biases we propose to use the convolutional based gaussian process to construct f to satisfy these requirements the gaussian process is a flexible nonparametric tool that provides a distribution over the infinite space of functions by treating all observations as random variables with a joint gaussian distribution quinonero candela and rasmussen 2005 the convolution process is an effective way to construct a gaussian process by convolving a gaussian white noise process with a smoothing kernel boyle and frean 2005 we propose to generalize the univariate gaussian process to the multivariate case to satisfy our requirements 2 f i y f q k qi y f t x q t d t 3 c o v f i y f f j y f q k qi y f t k qj y f t d t where x q is the q th gaussian white noise process latent function k qi is the absolutely integrable kernel applied to the i th i 1 represents the temperature bias i 2 represents the precipitation bias climate metric bias based on the q th latent function and the c o v f i y f f j y f represents the covariance inter relationship between the i th metric bias at input forecast value y f and the j th metric bias at another input forecast value y f the univariate gaussian process only allows single response metric higdon 1998 while our proposed structure allows multiple response metrics and can characterize their interactions through eq 3 please note the proposed framework in eqs 2 and 3 is not limited to two response metrics and it can be easily extended to model inter relationship among multiple response metrics we also want to point out that different kernels rasmussen 2003 such as gaussian kernel rational quadratic kernels and periodic kernels can be applied to the cgp to handle different input output relationships making the cgp flexible and adaptive to the forecast data y f from different climatological models the proposed cgp structure is graphically demonstrated in fig 1 a where each surface is a gaussian process representing a climate metric bias and the black asterisks represent bias data eq 1 sampled at various input forecast values y f y t f y p f in this structure the x 0 is shared between two bias metrics to represent the metric similarity interaction while each bias has also its own latent function x i and kernel k ii to capture its uniqueness the parameters in various kernels can be estimated from the data points black asterisks in fig 1a based on the maximum likelihood estimation method ying 1991 with the estimated parameters it is straightforward to predict the bias response through eq 2 quinonero candela and rasmussen 2005 the prediction interval at a specific input forecast value y f representing the uncertainties associated with our estimates can also be obtained from eqs 2 and 3 quinonero candela and rasmussen 2005 which gives the prediction variance at a specific input forecast value y f please note that we consider two types of uncertainties the observation errors and the prediction uncertainty the observation error represents the measurement noise resulting from data collection which is denoted as in eq 1 the prediction uncertainty represents the confidence of the prediction results more specifically if a prediction were generated at an input location near the training data then the uncertainty for this prediction would be lower than that far away from the training data we characterize this type of uncertainty as the co variance between difference gaussian processes f y f which corresponds to eq 3 as a result the prediction variance comprehensively quantifies data uncertainties and the effect of the interactions among responses the prediction results are demonstrated in fig 1b through a cross section view conditioning on a forecast temperature value y t f when we compare the prediction results between the proposed method and the standard bias correction methods maraun 2016 we find that the proposed method leads to better prediction accuracy demonstrating that we are able to obtain an accurate prediction solid line we can also observe that the proposed method can successfully quantify the uncertainties 95 confidence interval around the predicted bias values and all the data are within the intervals these intervals reveal the normal range for the bias and they can also be incorporated into the anomaly detection of climate metric observations the good performance of the proposed cgp structure is because we consider both the flexibility of individual metric bias and the interaction between metric biases which brings additional information and facilitates a better constraining of the predictions the structure in fig 1 provides a flexible formulation of the climate metric biases and their interactions and also facilitates uncertainty quantification to apply the structure in fig 1 to correct the bias for new forecast temperature and precipitation denoted as y f we can first collect various forecast and observation pairs to construct the cgp f based on eq 1 3 the f builds the relationship between forecast values and the bias values once we have f we can apply it to the new forecast value vector y f to obtain the corresponding bias value vector f y f then the predicted observation vector would be y f f y f which is the temperature and precipitation values after correction here we evaluate the forecast skill of the raw model outputs and after correction using standard bc and the cgp in terms of correlation coefficient and rmse we divide the sample into calibration and validation periods the overall bias used for the bc approach and the parameters of the cgp approach are estimated based on the 1985 2005 period and evaluated on an out of sample validation period from 2006 to 2019 we estimate these parameters for every pixel within the study area every target month and lead time 3 results we will start by providing an example of the model performance for one pixel within the domain target month march with the forecast initialized in july of the previous year fig 2 during the calibration period 1985 2005 the gfdl flor exhibits biases in both precipitation and temperature with respect to the observations compare the black and orange lines moreover the interannual variability is not captured either bias correction bc can help with the biases even though it just represents a translation of the forecast and cannot help with the variability at such a long lead time i e 9 month lead time much of the year to year variability is lost and the time series tends to oscillate around the mean values see also villarini et al 2019 for similar findings in terms of seasonal forecasting of hurricane activity the use of the cgp approach however leads to a much improved forecast skill both in terms of magnitude and variability these positive features are tied to the fact that we have a flexible modeling framework that is able to leverage the information shared between precipitation and temperature the excellent performance exhibited in the calibration period is maintained in the validation period 2006 2019 the raw model outputs cannot represent well the observational record and the situation is only mitigated once we use the bc correction based on the training period on the other hand the cgp approach is able to significantly improve the overall performance closely mimicking the observational record these statements are valid for both precipitation and temperature these features are clear once we examine the scatterplots in the right hand panels of fig 2 they highlight the forecast model s lack of skill in reproducing the observations with a correlation coefficient between raw or bc forecasts and observations that is either marginally positive 0 19 for temperature or even negative 0 28 for precipitation the use of the cgp approach leads to a significant improvement in performance in terms of magnitude and variability this is particularly true for precipitation as highlighted by the scatterplot fig 2 bottom right panel the correlation coefficient increases from 0 28 for the raw bc forecast to 0 80 for the cgp method the correlation coefficient for temperature is high and equal to 0 88 strongly suggesting that our proposed approach can improve the skill of not only precipitation but also of temperature because of the way that the relationship between biases in these quantities is handled concurrently we can extend the results in fig 2 to the entire domain both target months and all lead times we start with the evaluation of the skill in forecasting precipitation for the target month march for the validation period 2006 2019 figs 3 and 4 the correlation coefficient between the raw gfdl flor outputs and the observations tends to be relatively high at the shortest lead time and to generally decrease as we increase the lead time for instance the february initialized forecast tends to have negative correlation and the situation does not change as we increase the lead time with the correlation coefficients that vary between marginally positive to negative for this metric the bc approach does not help as the value of the correlation coefficient does not change if we shift all the values by a same amount on the other hand the situation significantly improves after using the cgp approach for the shortest lead time we are able to preserve the areas with higher skill and to increase the values in the parts of the domain with lower skill these improvements become even clearer as we increase the forecast horizon the use of the cgp method leads to an overall increase in the correlation coefficient between observations and forecasts with the majority of the domain exhibiting positive correlations another important element is that this heightened skill tends to be preserved across lead times this overall improvement is also clear when we consider the rmse as the performance metric fig 4 when we consider the raw gfdl flor output the higher rmse values tend to be located in the eastern part of the domain with an overall tendency to increase as we move from the northwestern to the southeastern part of the domain these results are consistent across the different lead times with a tendency towards increasing values for longer lead times when we perform bc the situation tends to improve with the rmse that tends to increase from north to south the use of the cgp method leads to a better performance compared to the bc the rmse values are smaller with a better performance that now encompasses the entire study area across the different forecast horizons the advantage of using the cgp method is also clear when we consider march temperature figs 3 and 5 the correlation coefficient between observations and the gfdl flor model is marginally positive across the entire domain for the march to december initialization as we increase the lead time there are large swings between overall negative e g forecasts initialized in november october august and may and positive e g forecasts initialized in september and july without a strong dependence on lead time fig 3 the cgp approach on the other hand is able to increase the skill across all lead times fig 3 the values of the correlation coefficient are generally large across the entire domain the exceptions are represented by the november and june initialized forecasts and to a lesser extent for may even though the cgp method still leads to a much better performance compared to the raw model outputs the improved performance of our proposed approach is also evident when we consider the rmse as evaluation metric fig 5 the larger values tend to be concentrated in the northern part of the study region and to move east as we increase the lead time the bc approach generally helps in reducing these values even though the regional variability observed in raw outputs remains largely unchanged the use of the cgp on the other hand leads to a significant performance improvement with rmse values that are much smaller than the original gfdl flor outputs both before and after bias correction based on these results it is clear that the cgp method leads to a better performance in forecasting march precipitation and temperature we expand our analyses to the forecasting of july precipitation and temperature figs 6 8 the correlation coefficient between the gfdl flor forecast and the observations is generally low to negative with no regional consistency or dependence on lead time fig 6 as we apply the proposed approach there is a marked increase in skill with large areas of the study region that exhibit high correlation with the observations regardless of the forecast horizon the results related to the rmse fig 7 highlight how the bc approach can reduce it compared to the raw model outputs and how the cgp approach reduces the rmse even further the results for temperature lead to the same conclusions for precipitation the cgp approach is able to increase the correlation relative to the raw mode outputs but also in an absolute sense with values of the correlation coefficient of 0 4 and larger fig 6 the improvements of our approach with respect to the raw and bc forecasts are even more apparent with considering rmse as performance metric fig 8 the largest values are for the raw model outputs with the bc that leads to an improved performance this is especially true for the shortest lead times which suggests that the model outputs tend to have a warm bias whose impacts can be generally mitigated by the bc the application of the cgp approach leads to much smaller rmse values indicating that our proposed approach outperforms both the model and the standard bias correction approach 4 conclusions this study has examined the capability of a new machine learning technique the convolutional gaussian processes in improving the performance of the gfdl flor model part of the nmme project in forecasting precipitation and temperature analyses have focused on iowa central united states two target months march and july and forecast horizons from one month to one year the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows the raw gfdl flor model has biases limited correlation with the observations and large rmse values this statement is valid across lead times and target months the bc approach can mitigate some of these issues bias and rmse but not increase correlation despite these improvements there are still residual errors that are not corrected for the application of the cgp method leads to a consistent improved performance with respect to the bc approach with no strong dependence on lead time therefore our approach highlights the improvement due to considering simultaneously uncertainties in both precipitation and temperature rather than in isolation from each other while these results are very promising and provide a path forward towards reducing uncertainties in seasonal forecasting there are a number of possible directions that could lead to an even improved performance for example here we considered one model and the average of its 12 members future efforts could be devoted to the extension of the cgp approach towards ensemble averaging moreover here we developed separate models for each pixel in the future we could develop a hierarchical approach to leverage information across neighboring pixels finally this approach could be expanded to other target months and regions with different climates to examine the transferability of these results in space and time credit authorship contribution statement chao wang conceptualization

4933,this study examines the potential improvement in seasonal predictability of monthly precipitation and temperature using a novel machine learning approach the convolutional gaussian process cgp this approach allows us to take into account multiple quantities and their interdependencies simultaneously we use one global climate model florb01 part of the north american multi model ensemble nmme project and quantify its skill in reproducing precipitation and temperature in march and july across iowa central united states for lead times from one month to one year as a first step we train the cgp over the 1985 2005 period and then apply it out of sample from 2006 to 2019 over the validation period our results indicate that the cgp is able to increase the skill i e increased correlation coefficient and reduced root mean squared error in predicting precipitation and temperature compared to both the raw outputs and after standard bias correction these statements are consistent across different lead times and target month i e march or july these encouraging findings provide a new potential path towards improved predictability of the regional climate at the seasonal scale keywords convolutional gaussian process nmme seasonal forecasting machine learning 1 introduction issues related to the prediction of climate related variables with a lead time from several weeks to several months have been the subject of growing research interest examples of these heightened interest are represented by the operational european seasonal to interannual prediction eurosip vitart et al 2007 and the north american multi model ensemble nmme kirtman et al 2014 and its related collection of papers archambault et al 2019 several studies have examined the performance of these models in forecasting different quantities of interest including precipitation and temperature e g cash et al 2019 krakauer 2019 slater et al 2017 2019a zhang et al 2019 vittal et al 2020 streamflow and coastal flooding e g khouakhi et al 2019 slater et al 2019b slater and villarini 2018 drought e g ma et al 2019 sea surface temperature e g hervieux et al 2019 shin and huang 2019 the el niño southern

the strength associated with these projects in terms of skill at the shortest lead times this is particularly true for precipitation temperature and drought e g mo and lyon 2015 roundy et al 2015 ma et al 2016 for areas that are under significant influence by enso for instance infanti and kirtman 2016 showed higher correlation between forecasted and observed precipitation temperature in the southeastern southwestern and northwestern north america during eastern pacific el niño events some of the weaknesses of these models are tied to their limited capability in reproducing the precipitation and temperature at seasonal to annual lead times e g slater et al 2017 or in forecasting extended period of above below average conditions for the right reason kam et al 2014 different approaches have been developed to improve the forecasting skill of these models including bias correction and ensemble averaging e g hagedorn et al 2005 delsole and tippett 2014 thober et al 2015 rodrigues et al 2019 slater et al 2017 in terms of bias correction most of the work has generally focused on the comparison of the observed and forecasted anomalies e g kirtman et al 2014 becker et al 2014 with other approaches that have been applied to try to improve the predictive skill e g tian et al 2014 khajehei et al 2018 singh et al 2017 for instance singh et al 2017 explored the performance of standardization quantile mapping and nonlinear transformation in bias correcting the precipitation forecasts over india and found that the nonlinear transformation led the largest improvements narapusetty et al 2018 proposed to first apply quantile mapping to bias correct the temperature forecast and then use the observed relationship between temperature and precipitation to forecast precipitation they applied this methodology to the summer across the continental united states and found a reduction in root mean squared error rmse khajehei et al 2018 compared and contrasted the performance of different post processing approaches finding a good performance for a copula based ensemble post processing slater et al 2017 applied a simple bayesian updating approach for temperature and precipitation forecasts across europe and found that it performed well in correcting the models forecasts for conditional and unconditional biases see also zhang et al 2017 for its application to enso however most of the existing methods correct the biases in temperature and precipitation separately neglecting the significant correlation between temperature and precipitation and their biases in other words the bias information in temperature would be informative to infer the bias in precipitation and vice versa as a result the joint simultaneous modeling and correction of temperature and precipitation biases would be a promising way to improve the overall prediction performance however this is not a trivial task the major limitations that complicate the joint bias correction of temperature and precipitation are 1 the conventional methods e g quantile mapping are applied to single quantities after data fitting thus they are not general and flexible enough to represent the information in both temperature and precipitation and 2 there lacks an efficient way to explicitly characterize the relationship between temperature and precipitation and their biases machine learning techniques represent a good alternative offering great flexibility in data mapping for instance xu et al 2019 applied machine learning to bias correct and statistically downscale precipitation forecasts over china more specifically they used wavelet support vector machine and wavelet random forest and highlighted their better performance with respect to the more traditional quantile mapping however their method also only focuses on a single quantity i e precipitation building explicit relationships between temperature and precipitation and their biases within the machine learning context is still an unsolved task moreover few studies have examined the use of machine learning techniques to increase the predictive skill of these models simultaneously more generally cohen et al 2019 argued that new statistical techniques mostly developed outside the field of climate science collectively referred to as machine learning can be adopted by climate forecasters to increase the accuracy of s2s subseasonal to seasonal predictions and suggested that s2s prediction will be most beneficial to the public by incorporating mixed or a hybrid of dynamical forecasts and updated statistical techniques such as machine learning here we propose to use a novel machine learning approach the convolutional gaussian processes cgp to jointly improve the predictive skill of precipitation and temperature over iowa central united states for two target months i e march and july and lead times from one month to one year the basic idea of this method is to use a specially designed cgp to fit the relationship between the forecast and bias values for temperature and precipitation the feature of the proposed method is that it not only provides a flexible representation of the bias in temperature and precipitation but also builds an explicit relationship between the bias in these two quantities this feature is expected to outperform existing bias correction methods in terms of both

values for longer lead times when we perform bc the situation tends to improve with the rmse that tends to increase from north to south the use of the cgp method leads to a better performance compared to the bc the rmse values are smaller with a better performance that now encompasses the entire study area across the different forecast horizons the advantage of using the cgp method is also clear when we consider march temperature figs 3 and 5 the correlation coefficient between observations and the gfdl flor model is marginally positive across the entire domain for the march to december initialization as we increase the lead time there are large swings between overall negative e g forecasts initialized in november october august and may and positive e g forecasts initialized in september and july without a strong dependence on lead time fig 3 the cgp approach on the other hand is able to increase the skill across all lead times fig 3 the values of the correlation coefficient are generally large across the entire domain the exceptions are represented by the november and june initialized forecasts and to a lesser extent for may even though the cgp method still leads to a much better performance compared to the raw model outputs the improved performance of our proposed approach is also evident when we consider the rmse as evaluation metric fig 5 the larger values tend to be concentrated in the northern part of the study region and to move east as we increase the lead time the bc approach generally helps in reducing these values even though the regional variability observed in raw outputs remains largely unchanged the use of the cgp on the other hand leads to a significant performance improvement with rmse values that are much smaller than the original gfdl flor outputs both before and after bias correction based on these results it is clear that the cgp method leads to a better performance in forecasting march precipitation and temperature we expand our analyses to the forecasting of july precipitation and temperature figs 6 8 the correlation coefficient between the gfdl flor forecast and the observations is generally low to negative with no regional consistency or dependence on lead time fig 6 as we apply the proposed approach there is a marked increase in skill with large areas of the study region that exhibit high correlation with the observations regardless of the forecast horizon the results related to the rmse fig 7 highlight how the bc approach can reduce it compared to the raw model outputs and how the cgp approach reduces the rmse even further the results for temperature lead to the same conclusions for precipitation the cgp approach is able to increase the correlation relative to the raw mode outputs but also in an absolute sense with values of the correlation coefficient of 0 4 and larger fig 6 the improvements of our approach with respect to the raw and bc forecasts are even more apparent with considering rmse as performance metric fig 8 the largest values are for the raw model outputs with the bc that leads to an improved performance this is especially true for the shortest lead times which suggests that the model outputs tend to have a warm bias whose impacts can be generally mitigated by the bc the application of the cgp approach leads to much smaller rmse values indicating that our proposed approach outperforms both the model and the standard bias correction approach 4 conclusions this study has examined the capability of a new machine learning technique the convolutional gaussian processes in improving the performance of the gfdl flor model part of the nmme project in forecasting precipitation and temperature analyses have focused on iowa central united states two target months march and july and forecast horizons from one month to one year the main findings of this study can be summarized as follows the raw gfdl flor model has biases limited correlation with the observations and large rmse values this statement is valid across lead times and target months the bc approach can mitigate some of these issues bias and rmse but not increase correlation despite these improvements there are still residual errors that are not corrected for the application of the cgp method leads to a consistent improved performance with respect to the bc approach with no strong dependence on lead time therefore our approach highlights the improvement due to considering simultaneously uncertainties in both precipitation and temperature rather than in isolation from each other while these results are very promising and provide a path forward towards reducing uncertainties in seasonal forecasting there are a number of possible directions that could lead to an even improved performance for example here we considered one model and the average of its 12 members future efforts could be devoted to the extension of the cgp approach towards ensemble averaging moreover here we developed separate models for each pixel in the future we could develop a hierarchical approach to leverage information across neighboring pixels finally this approach could be expanded to other target months and regions with different climates to examine the transferability of these results in space and time credit authorship contribution statement chao wang conceptualization

4934,hydrologic processes in depression dominated areas are controlled by the spatial distribution of surface depressions and their dynamic hydrologic connectivity existing hydrologic models often utilize lumped ways to handle depressions and hence their spatial features are lost in this simplification process in this study a unique watershed scale semi distributed hydrologic model accounting for dynamic hydrologic connectivity hydrol dc is developed and the functionalities of depressions in runoff generation processes and hydrologic connectivity are respectively quantified by introducing two concepts of depression impact coefficient and connected area unlike other models a new modeling framework is proposed in hydrol dc to facilitate separate modeling for the puddle based units off stream channel based units and on stream channel based units of each subbasin hydrol dc was applied to the edmore coulee watershed in north dakota the modeling results showed that depressions significantly influenced hydrologic processes and their impact capacities were mainly dominated by the storages and spatial distributions of depressions in a subbasin with depressions of similar storage depending on the spatial distribution of fully filled depressions hydrologic connectivity varied within a range with the increase in depression storage the variation of the range exhibited a progressive and hierarchical pattern additionally depressions blocked the pathways of runoff water from the activated topographic units to the associated outlet in a subbasin and such a blocking function became significant as more depressions were fully filled keywords hydrologic modeling surface depressions hydrologic connectivity surface runoff watershed 1 introduction surface depressions increase the complexity of hydrologic connectivity across land surfaces yang et al 2010 golden et al 2014 grimm and chu 2018 and retain runoff water which leads to reduced peak flow during a rainfall event phillips et al 2011 chen et al 2013 in traditional semi distributed hydrologic models the entire area of a watershed is assumed to be well connected to its associated outlet and surface depressions are often lumped as a single depth providing functions of water retaining and or release for the entire watershed kim et al 2012 amoah et al 2013 shaw et al 2013 in reality however the contributing area of a watershed is variable and can be significantly influenced by the spatial distribution of depressions and their dynamic connectivity therefore such topographic characteristics of depressions need to be accounted for improved simulation of hydrologic processes in depression dominated areas to simulate the hydrologic processes in depression dominated areas many studies have been conducted by incorporating different functionalities of surface depressions for example markstrom et al 2015 developed the semi distributed precipitation runoff modeling system prms in which a watershed was divided into different units a percentage of each unit was specified to make runoff contribution to its associated lumped depression and a percentage of the lumped depression was used to control water release i e open part or close part vining 2002 utilized the prms for hydrologic simulation in a depression dominated subbasin of the devils lake watershed hay et al 2018 applied the prms to simulate depression storage variations of a watershed in the prairie pothole region of north dakota similar to the prsm the soil and water assessment tool swat also implemented a lumped scheme to simulate the impact of depressions for each subbasin gassman et al 2007 by using a user specified parameter to control water release from the lumped depression neitsch et al 2011 the original depression function in swat is relatively simple which however has been modified and improved in many studies wang et al 2008 proposed a concept of hydrologic equivalent wetland hew to account for the properties of depressions and incorporated this concept into swat for hydrologic simulation of a watershed in the red river basin tahmasebi nasab et al 2017 coupled a puddle delineation pd algorithm chu et al 2010 with swat to analyze the influence of depressions on hydrologic modeling in a depression dominated watershed in the ppr based on the digital elevation model dem data and the pd algorithm depression storage and contributing area were accurately calculated and used in swat for depression controlled hydrologic modeling mekonnen et al 2016 developed the swat probability distribution landscape distribution swat pdld model which incorporated surface depression heterogeneity in swat by using a probability distribution function grimm and chu 2020 proposed a depression threshold control proxy dtcp which was further incorporated in hec hms to improve its performance in hydrologic simulation for depression dominated areas wang et al 2019 developed a new hydrologic model with multiple control thresholds to simulate the dynamic water release from surface depressions the aforementioned models utilized various lumped ways to simulate the impacts of depressions on hydrologic processes in reality however surface depressions are disconnected in most conditions and the connections between depressions occur only when there is sufficient rainfall or snowmelt van der kamp and hayashi 2009 hayashi et al 2016 therefore although these models can improve the hydrologic simulations in depression dominated areas they still fail to account for the spatial distribution of depressions and their hydrologic connectivity as well as the real dynamic hydrologic processes in depression dominated areas in recent decades many studies have been conducted to investigate the dynamic connectivity in depression dominated areas and the influences of hydrologic connectivity on hydrologic processes for example leibowitz and vining 2003 observed and analyzed the temporal connectivity between two depressions in the prairie pothole region ppr and discussed the potential chemical and biological consequences caused by the temporal connectivity phillips et al 2011 analyzed the dynamic connectivity of stream drainage network with the influences of complex landforms e g lakes exposed bedrock and soil filled areas and highlighted the importance of the connectivity to streamflow and runoff response therefore instead of a lumped depression in a region considering individual depressions is more appropriate for hydrologic simulation in depression dominated areas chu et al 2013 developed a distributed puddle to puddle p2p model to simulate the depression dominated filling merging spilling and splitting overland flow processes and the dynamic hydrologic connectivity in the p2p model depressions were classified into a number of levels and lower level depressions sharing the same thresholds can merge and become a higher level depression during the filling process chu et al 2013 puddle based unit pbu which consists of the highest level depression and its associated contributing area was utilized as a basic component to calculate cell to cell and p2p processes on a surface chu 2017 grimm and chu 2018 although the p2p model can simulate the hydrologic processes and connectivity associated with the hierarchical depression structure it is computationally intensive especially for large watershed scale problems since there is no outflow from a pbu to its downstream units until the highest level depression in the pbu is fully filled considering highest level depressions is an efficient way to simulate hydrologic processes in depression dominated watersheds the objective of this research is to examine the watershed scale functionalities of surface depressions in runoff generation and hydrologic connectivity by developing a watershed scale depression oriented hydrologic model hydrol dc for continuous simulation of hydrologic processes and connectivity of highest level depressions the model is further applied to the edmore coulee watershed in north dakota to 1 analyze the depression controlled hydrologic processes 2 quantify the subbasin level influence capacity of depressions 3 examine the variability of hydrologic connectivity associated with depressions and 4 quantify the distributions of the blocked contributing areas induced by depressions 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the hydrol dc framework hydrol dc is a semi distributed physically based model for continuously simulating daily hydrologic processes and accounting for the dynamic hydrologic connectivity within subbasins in depression dominated areas as illustrated in fig 1 hydrol dc delineates a watershed into subbasins each of which is further divided into one main channel and a number of pbus and channel based units cbus cbus are further classified into off stream cbus for those that have no direct interactions with the main channel and on stream cbus for those that have direct interactions with the main channel following the definitions proposed by chu et al 2010 chu et al 2013 and tahmasebi nasab et al 2017 a pbu is composed of a ponding area pa and its contributing area ca while a cbu includes a channel segment a main channel or a tributary channel and its ca moreover each pbu has at least one downstream unit note that multiple thresholds are considered for pbus in hydrol dc while a cbu has only one downstream unit fig 1 in a pbu surface runoff transfers from ca to pa and then to its downstream unit s after the depression storage of the pbu reaches the maximum storage of the highest level depression of the pbu however surface runoff in a cbu runs directly into its tributary channel or the main channel vertically fig 2 each unit is divided into four zones including canopy zone snow zone surface zone and soil zone the soil zone is further divided into upper and lower soil zones and the upper soil zone consists of a number of soil cells in addition all units in a subbasin share the same shallow groundwater zone fig 2 water is tracked zone by zone and unit by unit and finally converted into deep groundwater and streamflow table 1 lists the major processes in different zones and the references of the methods used in the modeling which are detailed in section 2 2 there are three nested loops in hydrol dc including subbasin loop unit loop and time loop fig 3 the time loop starts from the most upstream units in the most upstream subbasins to the most downstream units in the most downstream subbasins in the time loop of a unit in a subbasin the mass balance is calculated following the order of canopy zone snow zone and surface zone for a pbu the evaporation from its pa and its depression storage is calculated if the depression storage is greater than the maximum depression storage mds puddle routing is triggered for the calculation of water released from the pa to its associated unit outlet s otherwise the ca and pa are updated based on the current depression storage for an off stream cbu its outflow to the associated unit outlet is determined by tributary channel routing after the tributary channel or puddle routing the mass balance of the soil zone of the unit is calculated the percolation from all units in a subbasin is considered as the source of the shallow groundwater zone of the subbasin in the mass balance computation main channel routing is triggered after the main channel in a subbasin receives water from the surface zone of all on stream cbus and the shallow groundwater zone of the subbasin baseflow 2 2 descriptions of hydrol dc 2 2 1 canopy zone simulation the interception by plants in the canopy zone is calculated in hydrol dc the daily canopy capacity is first estimated by dhi 2007 1 mc cnp t l a i t mc cnp m a x where mc cnp is the canopy capacity l lai is the leaf area index mc cnp m a x is the maximum canopy capacity l the source term of the canopy zone of a unit pbu or cbu is precipitation and the sink terms are evaporation and precipitation exceeding the canopy zone capacity the water mass balance for

maximum air temperature is higher than the temperature for snowmelt the temperature index method neitsch et al 2011 is used in hydrol dc to simulate the snowmelt of the snow zone of each unit based on ret cnp the sublimation from the snow zone is calculated by the method proposed by dhi 2007 and the residual ret after the calculation of the sublimation is determined by 9 ret sno t ret cnp t e sno t where e sno is the sublimation from the snow zone l and ret sno is the residual ret after the calculation of sublimation l 2 2 3 surface zone simulation the surface zone is the most complex zone in hydrol dc based on the characteristics of different types of units unique hydrologic procedures and methods are used for each type of unit for the ca of a pbu the source terms include precipitation falling into the surface zone of the ca and the outflow of its upstream unit s including pbus and cbus and the sink terms are the infiltration into the soil zone and the discharge to its associated pa fig 4 a different from the ca in a pbu if the upstream of a cbu is an off stream cbu the outflow of the upstream off stream cbu flows directly to the channel of the current cbu therefore the source terms of a cbu are the precipitation falling into the surface zone and the outflow of its upstream pbu s and the sink terms are the infiltration into the soil zone and the discharge to its associated channel fig 4 b and c the mass balance equation for the ca of a pbu cbu can be expressed as 10 m ca t m ca t 1 p sur t s m t r ca t d ca t q ca i n t q ca o u t t where m ca is the ca storage l r ca

the mass balance can be calculated by 12 m ch t m ch t 1 q ch i n t q tc o u t t where m ch is the channel storage l q ch i n is the water flowing into the channel l and q ch o u t is the water flowing out of the channel l 2 2 3 1 surface runoff and infiltration the surface runoff that generates in the ca of a unit is calculated by the scs curve number method mishra and singh 2003 for continuous simulation the curve number of each unit is updated by using the method proposed by chu and marino 2007 based on the soil water content of the first soil cell in the upper soil zone in addition the identification of frozen soil is critical for hydrologic simulation in cold regions in a unit if the temperature of a soil cell is lower than zero this cell is assumed to be frozen vice versa if the first soil cell is frozen the curve number of each unit is updated by mohammed et al 2013 13 cn fz t c n t 1 c fz wc us 1 t ws us 1 where cn fz and cn are the curve numbers under frozen and unfrozen conditions c fz is a shape parameter used to control the variation of curve number with soil water content wc us 1 and ws us 1 are the soil water content and the saturated water content of the first soil cell 2 2 3 2 surface runoff routing after the surface runoff in the ca of a unit is calculated the outflow from the ca to the pa or the channel in the unit is determined by neitsch et al 2011 14 q ca o u t t r ca t m ca t 1 1 e x p lag sur t c where r ca is the surface runoff generates in ca l lag sur is a parameter that controls water release from the ca to its associated pa or channel t and tc is the time of concentration of the unit t 2 2 3 3 depression infiltration percolation and evaporation the percolation infiltration from the pa of a pbu that is assumed to be added to the first cell in the upper soil zone and is controlled by the water content of the first soil cell is given by neitsch et al 2011 15 d pa t ks us 1 r pa t δ t f o r wc us 1 t 0 5 fc us 1 ks us 1 wc

and the residual ret after the calculation of sublimation ret sno is greater than zero the evaporation from the pa of the pbu is calculated based on the ret sno allen et al 1998 16 e pa t m i n c epa

tributary channel in an off stream cbu or the main channel in a subbasin the variable storage method williams 1969 is used for channel routing as follows 17 q ch o u t t c ch q ch i n t m ch t 1 where m ch is the channel storage l q ch i n is the channel inflow l q ch o u t is the channel outflow l and c ch is the storage coefficient for a pbu if its depression is fully filled two methods are used to handle depression routing and their selection is based on a user defined depression storage m pa r t when the mds of the pbu is less than m pa r t all water exceeding the mds flows out of the pa immediately otherwise a linear reservoir equation is used to handle the depression routing mishra and singh 2004 18 q pa o u t t β 1 q pa i n t β 1 q pa i n t 1 β 2 q pa o u t t 1 where β 1 and β 2 are two coefficients used to control the water from the pa of a pbu to its downstream unit s variable pa and depression storage of a pbu are simulated in hydrol dc and are respectively given by liu and schwartz 2011 19 a pa t π r t 2 π r max 2 π a r c c o s 1 2 h t h max 2 20 m pa t 0 h t π r max 2 π a r c c o s 1 2 h h max 2 d h where a pa is the area of the pa in a pbu l2 m pa is the storage

of a unit is divided into an upper soil zone and a lower soil zone and the upper soil zone is further divided into different cells the source terms of the upper soil zone in a pbu are the infiltration percolation from the ca and pa of the pbu the percolation from a channel into the soil zone is not considered in the current hydrol dc therefore the source term of the upper soil zone in a cbu is the infiltration from the ca of a cbu the sink terms of the upper soil zone include evaporation transpiration and percolation to the lower soil cell or zone the soil water storage and water content of a cell in the upper soil zone can be respectively expressed as 21 m us i t m us i t 1 d us i 1 t e us i t tr us i t d us i t where m us i is the water storage of the ith soil cell l d us i 1 and d us i are the percolation from the i 1th and ith soil cells l if i 1 d us i 1 t d ca t d pa t and tr us i and e us i are the transpiration and evaporation of the ith soil cell l in hydrol dc transpiration and evaporation are assumed to occur only within a user defined depth in the upper soil zone and calculated following kristensen and jensen 1975 similar to dhi 2007 the percolation rate of a soil cell in the upper soil zone is estimated following van genuchten 1980 without considering the suction head in hydrol dc it is also assumed that there is no percolation when an upper soil cell is frozen i e the temperature of the cell is below zero to determine the soil condition and control the percolation in different soil cells the temperature of a soil cell is calculated following klein 2018 22 t us

from the land surface to the center of the ith soil cell l for the lower soil zone of a unit the entire zone is assumed homogeneous and its water content is assumed invariant the percolation from this zone to the shallow groundwater zone is estimated by neitsch et al 2011 23 d ls t 1 exp 1 lag ls d us j t e x p 1 lag ls d us j t 1 where d ls is the percolation of the lower soil zone l lag ls is the delay time of soil water flow through the entire lower soil zone t and j is the last soil cell in the upper soil zone 2 2 5 groundwater zone simulation in a subbasin the shallow groundwater zone receives water from the lower soil zones of all units and drains water to the main channel and the deep groundwater zone the mass balance of the shallow groundwater zone can be expressed as 24 m sgw t m swg t 1 q sgw i n t d sgw t q sgw o u t t where m sgw is the shallow groundwater storage l q sgw i n is the inflow of the shallow groundwater zone l d sgw is the percolation from the shallow groundwater zone to the deep groundwater zone and q sgw o u t is the outflow from the shallow groundwater zone to the main channel l since all units in a subbasin share the same shallow groundwater zone the inflow of the shallow groundwater zone that equals the total percolating water from the lower soil zones of all units and the percolation from the shallow groundwater zone to the deep groundwater zone can be respectively expressed as neitsch et al 2011 25 q sgw i n t i 1 n u d ls i t 26 d sgw t c pco q sgw i n t where n u is the number of units in the subbasin d ls i is the percolation from the lower soil zone of the ith unit to the shallow groundwater zone l and c pco is a parameter that controls the percolation in a subbasin if the storage of the shallow groundwater zone is greater than a water release threshold an exponential recession function is used to calculate the outflow from the shallow groundwater zone to its associated main channel nielsen and hansen 1973 27 q sgw o u t t q sgw o u t t 1 e 1 c sgw q sgw i n t d sgw t 1 e 1 c sgw where c sgw is a parameter that controls the outflow 2 3 introduction to hud dc and arcgis hydrology toolset the arcgis hydrology toolset is widely used to calculate flow directions identify stream networks delineate a watershed and analyze topographic characteristics based on dems esri 2012 hud dc wang and chu 2020 is an arcgis based surface delineation algorithm used to identify pbus and cbus including depressions channels and their contributing areas and quantify the connectivity between units i e pbus and cbus hud dc consists of two modules the depression identification module and the channel and unit identification module the delineation procedure of hud dc is illustrated in fig 5 based on a dem the depression identification module delineates all highest level depressions and their overflow thresholds and calculates the property parameters of the depressions and thresholds e g mds maximum ponding area and the slope of each threshold to its downstream cell with the steepest descent with the calculated depressions and their thresholds the channel and unit identification module searches for all channel segments and channel ending nodes based on the user specified flow accumulation and channel lengths and then determines pbus and cbus by identifying the contributing areas of all depressions and channels in this study hud dc and the arcgis hydrology toolset were used to prepare topographic parameters for hydrol dc specifically hud dc was utilized to identify depressions channels units and the connectivity between units the arcgis toolset was used to delineate subbasins classify main channels and tributary channels and further assort cbus into on stream cbus and off stream cbus according to the spatial relationships between the cbus and the main channels or tributary channels 2 4 study area and input data the edmore coulee watershed fig 6 which covers 995 58 km2 in the middle of ppr was selected to test the performance of hydrol dc the edmore coulee watershed drains into sweetwater lake and the final outlet of the watershed is located at the united states geological survey usgs 05 056 200 edmore coulee gauge station latitude 48o20 12 n longitude 98o39 36 w in ramsey county the 2011 nlcd national land cover database shows that the watershed is mostly covered by cultivated crops 63 97 pasture 15 04 and open water and wetlands 13 33 the input data of hydrol dc can be classified into subbasin level and unit level data table 2 the 10 m dem of the watershed was downloaded from the usgs national map viewer and used for delineation of depressions channels units and subbasins during the delineation the dem was pre filled by 10 cm water to eliminate any artifacts and the delineation errors caused by buildings roads and other structures were corrected based on the usgs watershed boundary dataset and national hydrography dataset nhd in addition the topographic parameters such as mds and maximum ponding area mpa were calculated from the dem using hud dc the 2011 nlcd and statsgo2 state soil geographic dataset soil type data were used to compute curve numbers under the average antecedent moisture condition in this study the upper soil zone of each unit was divided into 4 soil cells and the thickness of each soil cell was 40 cm the parameters of each soil cell e g saturated hydraulic conductivity wilting point and field capacity were estimated based on the statsgo2 data following rawls and brakensiek 1983 carsel and parrish 1988 and maidment 1993 the daily precipitation and temperature were downloaded from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 we used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 500 m resolution 8 day composite product mod15a2h version 6 for leaf area index usgs 2019 we calculated ret using the solar radiation data downloaded from a station of the north dakota agricultural weather network latitude 48 45 36 n longitude 98 20 40 w ndawn 2019 the daily discharge data at the edmore coulee gauge station were downloaded from the usgs national water information system and used for the calibration and validation of hydrol dc 2 5 model setup and performance evaluation based on the delineation results from hud dc the topographic characteristics of all subbasins were analyzed to highlight the distribution and connectivity of depressions in the subbasins for hydrol dc modeling the year of 2004 1 1 2004 12 31 2004 was selected as the warming up period to set the initial conditions of the model the model calibration and validation periods were 1 1 2005 12 31 2010 and 1 1 2011 12 31 2016 respectively the selections of the warming up calibration and validation periods mainly depended on the availability of input data hydroclimatic conditions and other factors additionally it was important to ensure that the calibration and validation periods included both dry and wet years and had comparable conditions the hydrol dc modeling was executed with a daily time step for all the three periods the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse

values of p sur sm m pa d pa and e pa during the entire simulation period 2 7 analyses of the influences of depressions on hydrologic connectivity hydrol dc focuses on quantifying the influences of the highest level depressions on the hydrologic connectivity to subbasin outlets two concepts activated area aact and connected area acon are introduced to analyze the influences the aact of a subbasin is defined as the total area of all off stream cbus on stream cbus and fully filled pbus in the subbasin while the acon of a subbasin excludes the off stream cbus and the fully filled pbus that have no direct connection to the outlet of the subbasin that is the acon of a subbasin is defined as the total area of all on stream cbus off stream cbus and the pbus that are directly connected to the subbasin outlet therefore aact and acon of a subbasin are respectively the maximum area potential area and the actual area that contributes runoff water to the subbasin outlet in this study acon was used to quantify the hydrologic connectivity to the outlet of each subbasin for each subbasin the temporal variations of acon and the normalized depression storage ds were utilized to analyze the dynamic influences of depressions on the hydrologic connectivity in addition the differences between the normalized acon and the normalized aact under different ponding conditions were analyzed to reveal the variations in the areas that were fully filled but blocked from contributing runoff water to the subbasin outlet 3 results and discussion 3 1 topographic characteristics the edmore coulee watershed was delineated using the arcgis hydrology toolset into 15 subbasins which were further divided into 12 250 units pbus and cbus by using hud dc fig 6 table 3 lists the topographic parameters for all subbasins the low ratio of on stream cbus 0 02 to 0 34 indicated that depressions dominated all subbasins and only a limited area directly contributed surface runoff to its associated subbasin outlet in each subbasin this is in agreement with the findings from other studies in depression dominated areas e g chen et al 2013 grimm and chu 2020 numerous depressions were identified in the study area and the ratio of the total maximum storage of all depressions in a subbasin to the entire subbasin area tmds ranged from 21 77 mm to 130 89 mm to characterize their spatial distribution the depressions in each subbasin were classified into three categories based on the ratio of their mds to the subbasin area rmds 1 small depressions 0 mm rmds 0 01 mm medium depressions 0 01 mm rmds 1 mm and large depressions rmds 1 mm despite their small numbers large depressions had much greater storage in all subbasins except subbasin 3 table 3 small and medium depressions appeared to distribute randomly in all subbasins fig 7 a and b while large depressions tended to show certain distribution patterns e g the large depressions in subbasin 8 were located near the subbasin boundary fig 7c therefore the locations of large depressions were critical to surface runoff generation and hydrologic connectivity in all subbasins the percentage of the control area of large depressions in the entire area of a subbasin pcal ranged from 12 26 to 84 35 3 2 model calibration and validation because the edmore coulee watershed is located in a cold region and surface runoff mainly occurs in early spring snow zone and surface zone are the major zones that influence the hydrologic simulation in the watershed table 4 shows the parameter ranges for calibration shabani et al 2017 and the calibrated parameters for the two zones fig 8 shows the comparisons of the simulated and observed hydrographs at the usgs gauge station for the calibration and validation periods because of snowmelt most of the peak flows occurred in the early spring of each year from the end of march to the end of april the overall performance of hydrol dc was good for both calibration and validation periods moriasi et al 2007 the nse values were 0 80 and 0 77 for the calibration and validation periods respectively the pbias of the calibration period 9 66 was much better than that of the validation period 18 66 according to the pbias values hydrol dc overestimated the discharge on average but underestimated some peak flows due to the limitations of the methods used for the snow zone and the frozen soil in hydrol dc 3 3 depression functionalities in hydrologic processes fig 9 shows the ratios of five sink terms i e infiltration in the ca percolation in the pa evaporation from the pa storage of the pa and inflow of the main channel to the total source water of the surface zone note that the ratios of ca storage and tributary channel storage to the total source water of the surface zone were negligible smaller than 10 4 additionally subbasins were sorted according to their tmds values from small to large fig 9 for the surface zone of each subbasin most of the total source water was converted to the infiltration in the ca and the ratio ranged from 0 72 to 0 81 fig 9 the ratio of the channel inflow to the total source water ranged from 0 03 to 0 11 and the remaining source water was finally transferred into sink terms related to depressions the depression impact coefficients i e c d of all subbasins are also shown in fig 9 according to fig 9 it can be observed that c d increased with the tmds in general certain disagreements with the increasing trend were mainly due to the influences of the distribution of depressions especially large depressions for example large depressions were concentrated in the north part of subbasin 4 while the distribution of large depressions in subbasin 7 was relatively scattered fig 7c in addition the values of pcal for subbasins 4 and 7 were 34 55 and 49 09 table 3 respectively therefore although the tmds of subbasins 4 was greater than that of subbasin 7 table 3 the value of c d for subbasin 4 was smaller than that of subbasin 7 fig 9 3 4 influence of depressions on hydrologic connectivity the dynamic variations of the normalized acon and the normalized ds were simulated for all subbasins and fig 10 shows an example for subbasin 12 due to snowmelt and rainfall larger normalized acon and ds were observed during the wet periods in early spring and summer fig 10 for most dry periods the normalized ds decreased gradually because of evapotranspiration and percolation different from the normalized ds the normalized acon decreased abruptly and then reached its minimum value i e 0 14 for subbasin 12 due to the disconnection between depressions in winter both the normalized acon and the normalized ds were relatively stable because of the frozen conditions fig 11 displays the variations of the normalized acon with the normalized ds in all subbasins although the normalized ds of a subbasin was the same for different ponding conditions acon showed a significant difference for example the normalized ds of subbasin 12 was 0 34 on 5 27 2008 and 3 31 2007 however the values of the normalized acon were respectively 0 14 and 0 38 fig 12 a and b similarly the normalized ds of subbasin 12 was 0 55 on 6 25 2015 and 4 12 2009 while the values of acon were respectively 0 18 and 0 77 fig 12c and d in previous studies e g shaw et al 2013 grimm and chu 2018 similar analyses were conducted and the relationship between the normalized acon and ds in an area was represented by a single line for an event according to fig 11 however their relationship in a continuous simulation is much more complex than that for an event simulation this can be attributed to the different ponding conditions that were generated due to the distributions of the fully filled depressions additionally with the increase in the normalized ds the range of the normalized acon increased following a hierarchical pattern during the entire simulation period for each subbasin fig 11 for subbasin 12 the maximum value of the normalized acon was 0 39 when the normalized ds was smaller or equal to 0 4 however the maximum acon increased to 0 79 when 0 4 normalized ds 0 6 and finally to 0 86 when 0 6 normalized ds 0 8 the sudden increase of the range of acon was due to the release of runoff water from some previous blocked contributing areas this finding is similar to those from previous studies e g phillips et al 2011 yang and chu 2013 shaw et al 2013 grimm and chu 2018 for example fig 12b and 12d show that the acon was close to its maximum values when the normalized ds was respectively in the range of 0 4 0 6 and 0 6 0 8 as shown in fig 12b the north part of subbasin 12 did not contribute runoff to the subbasin outlet however due to the increase of ds this area eventually changed from an inactivated area to acon fig 12d the difference between the normalized aact and acon was used to quantify the variation of the blocked area with the development of the hydrologic connectivity to a subbasin outlet i e acon fig 13 for each subbasin when acon was small the limited differences were due to the fact that most depressions were not fully filled at this early stage in addition most of the fully filled depressions were small and had a very limited influence on the difference between aact and acon for example the normalized aact and acon of subbasin 12 were 0 18 and 0 16 respectively on 6 4 2015 their difference at this time was caused by one fully filled pbu and the off stream cbus that were not connected to the main channel of the subbasin fig 14 a and d with the increase of acon over time more depressions were fully filled however the runoff from some fully filled pbus and off stream cbus were blocked by their downstream units that were not connected to the outlet yet thus a great difference occurred due to the distribution of the fully filled highest level depressions fig 13 for example the normalized aact and acon of subbasin 12 on 3 21 2010 were 0 40 and 0 62 respectively the fully filled pbus and off stream cbus which were blocked by their downstream units were found in the north northeast and south parts of subbasin 12 fig 14b and e after most depressions were fully filled their corresponding contributing areas were connected to the subbasin outlet and the differences between aact and acon decreased fig 13 for example the normalized aact and acon of subbasin 12 were very close on 6 25 2010 normalized aact 0 84 and normalized acon 0 86 and their small difference was due to some small units that drained runoff water to the pbus with partially filled large depressions fig 14c and f 4 summary and conclusion in this study a new depression oriented hydrologic model hydrol dc was developed for simulating hydrologic processes in depression dominated watersheds the major unique features of hydrol dc can be summarized as follows 1 it has a unique modeling framework to cope with the complexity in hydrologic connectivity and functionalities associated with surface depressions in the modeling 2 it incorporates the concepts of pbu and cbu chu et al 2010 into semi distributed hydrologic modeling to simulate the dynamic connectivity between different hydrotopographic units 3 cbus are further classified into on stream cbus and off stream cbus for watershed scale simulations and 4 hydrol dc is capable of simulating the influences of both storage and distribution of surface depressions on hydrologic processes and connectivity hydrol dc was applied to the edmore coulee watershed the delineation results demonstrated the complexity of surface connectivity in the selected watershed because of the existence of depressions only a small portion of the area of each subbasin 2 34 was directly connected to its associated main channel the influences of depressions on hydrologic processes were quantified by using an impact coefficient i e c d and the comparison of the c d values of different subbasins indicated that both depression storage and distribution influenced the impact capacities of depressions in hydrologic processes the normalized acon varied dynamically during the entire simulation period due to the connection and disconnection between depressions although the normalized acon values were different for the same normalized ds the range of the normalized acon increased in a hierarchical fashion with the increase of the normalized ds additionally the variations in the differences between the normalized acon and aact indicated that depressions had a significant block function when only a portion of them were fully filled but no connectivity to the outlet was established since the interactions between surface water and groundwater were simplified and the groundwater discharge to depressions was not considered in hydrol dc this research focused on investigating the functionalities of depressions in the surface water system in the future research hydrol dc can be combined with groundwater models to investigate the influences of depressions on the entire hydrologic system also integrated analyses of the statistical properties of topographic characteristics and the depression controlled

4934,hydrologic processes in depression dominated areas are controlled by the spatial distribution of surface depressions and their dynamic hydrologic connectivity existing hydrologic models often utilize lumped ways to handle depressions and hence their spatial features are lost in this simplification process in this study a unique watershed scale semi distributed hydrologic model accounting for dynamic hydrologic connectivity hydrol dc is developed and the functionalities of depressions in runoff generation processes and hydrologic connectivity are respectively quantified by introducing two concepts of depression impact coefficient and connected area unlike other models a new modeling framework is proposed in hydrol dc to facilitate separate modeling for the puddle based units off stream channel based units and on stream channel based units of each subbasin hydrol dc was applied to the edmore coulee watershed in north dakota the modeling results showed that depressions significantly influenced hydrologic processes and their impact capacities were mainly dominated by the storages and spatial distributions of depressions in a subbasin with depressions of similar storage depending on the spatial distribution of fully filled depressions hydrologic connectivity varied within a range with the increase in depression storage the variation of the range exhibited a progressive and hierarchical pattern additionally depressions blocked the pathways of runoff water from the activated topographic units to the associated outlet in a subbasin and such a blocking function became significant as more depressions were fully filled keywords hydrologic modeling surface depressions hydrologic connectivity surface runoff watershed 1 introduction surface depressions increase the complexity of hydrologic connectivity across land surfaces yang et al 2010 golden et al 2014 grimm and chu 2018 and retain runoff water which leads to reduced peak flow during a rainfall event phillips et al 2011 chen et al 2013 in traditional semi distributed hydrologic models the entire area of a watershed is assumed to be well connected to its associated outlet and surface depressions are often lumped as a single depth providing functions of water retaining and or release for the entire watershed kim et al 2012 amoah et al 2013 shaw et al 2013 in reality however the contributing area of a watershed is variable and can be significantly influenced by the spatial distribution of depressions and their dynamic connectivity therefore such topographic characteristics of depressions need to be accounted for improved simulation of hydrologic processes in depression dominated areas to simulate the hydrologic processes in depression dominated areas many studies have been conducted by incorporating different functionalities of surface depressions for example markstrom et al 2015 developed the semi distributed precipitation runoff modeling system prms in which a watershed was divided into different units a percentage of each unit was specified to make runoff contribution to its associated lumped depression and a percentage of the lumped depression was used to control water release i e open part or close part vining 2002 utilized the prms for hydrologic simulation in a depression dominated subbasin of the devils lake watershed hay et al 2018 applied the prms to simulate depression storage variations of a watershed in the prairie pothole region of north dakota similar to the prsm the soil and water assessment tool swat also implemented a lumped scheme to simulate the impact of depressions for each subbasin gassman et al 2007 by using a user specified parameter to control water release from the lumped depression neitsch et al 2011 the original depression function in swat is relatively simple which however has been modified and improved in many studies wang et al 2008 proposed a concept of hydrologic equivalent wetland hew to account for the properties of depressions and incorporated this concept into swat for hydrologic simulation of a watershed in the red river basin tahmasebi nasab et al 2017 coupled a puddle delineation pd algorithm chu et al 2010 with swat to analyze the influence of depressions on hydrologic modeling in a depression dominated watershed in the ppr based on the digital elevation model dem data and the pd algorithm depression storage and contributing area were accurately calculated and used in swat for depression controlled hydrologic modeling mekonnen et al 2016 developed the swat probability distribution landscape distribution swat pdld model which incorporated surface depression heterogeneity in swat by using a probability distribution function grimm and chu 2020 proposed a depression threshold control proxy dtcp which was further incorporated in hec hms to improve its performance in hydrologic simulation for depression dominated areas wang et al 2019 developed a new hydrologic model with multiple control thresholds to simulate the dynamic water release from surface depressions the aforementioned models utilized various lumped ways to simulate the impacts of depressions on hydrologic processes in reality however surface depressions are disconnected in most conditions and the connections between depressions occur only when there is sufficient rainfall or snowmelt van der kamp and hayashi 2009 hayashi et al 2016 therefore although these models can improve the hydrologic simulations in depression dominated areas they still fail to account for the spatial distribution of depressions and their hydrologic connectivity as well as the real dynamic hydrologic processes in depression dominated areas in recent decades many studies have been conducted to investigate the dynamic connectivity in depression dominated areas and the influences of hydrologic connectivity on hydrologic processes for example leibowitz and vining 2003 observed and analyzed the temporal connectivity between two depressions in the prairie pothole region ppr and discussed the potential chemical and biological consequences caused by the temporal connectivity phillips et al 2011 analyzed the dynamic connectivity of stream drainage network with the influences of complex landforms e g lakes exposed bedrock and soil filled areas and highlighted the importance of the connectivity to streamflow and runoff response therefore instead of a lumped depression in a region considering individual depressions is more appropriate for hydrologic simulation in depression dominated areas chu et al 2013 developed a distributed puddle to puddle p2p model to simulate the depression dominated filling merging spilling and splitting overland flow processes and the dynamic hydrologic connectivity in the p2p model depressions were classified into a number of levels and lower level depressions sharing the same thresholds can merge and become a higher level depression during the filling process chu et al 2013 puddle based unit pbu which consists of the highest level depression and its associated contributing area was utilized as a basic component to calculate cell to cell and p2p processes on a surface chu 2017 grimm and chu 2018 although the p2p model can simulate the hydrologic processes and connectivity associated with the hierarchical depression structure it is computationally intensive especially for large watershed scale problems since there is no outflow from a pbu to its downstream units until the highest level depression in the pbu is fully filled considering highest level depressions is an efficient way to simulate hydrologic processes in depression dominated watersheds the objective of this research is to examine the watershed scale functionalities of surface depressions in runoff generation and hydrologic connectivity by developing a watershed scale depression oriented hydrologic model hydrol dc for continuous simulation of hydrologic processes and connectivity of highest level depressions the model is further applied to the edmore coulee watershed in north dakota to 1 analyze the depression controlled hydrologic processes 2 quantify the subbasin level influence capacity of depressions 3 examine the variability of hydrologic connectivity associated with depressions and 4 quantify the distributions of the blocked contributing areas induced by depressions 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the hydrol dc framework hydrol dc is a semi distributed physically based model for continuously simulating daily hydrologic processes and accounting for the dynamic hydrologic connectivity within subbasins in depression dominated areas as illustrated in fig 1 hydrol dc delineates a watershed into subbasins each of which is further divided into one main channel and a number of pbus and channel based units cbus cbus are further classified into off stream cbus for those that have no direct interactions with the main channel and on stream cbus for those that have direct interactions with the main channel following the definitions proposed by chu et al 2010 chu et al 2013 and tahmasebi nasab et al 2017 a pbu is composed of a ponding area pa and its contributing area ca while a cbu includes a channel segment a main channel or a tributary channel and its ca moreover each pbu has at least one downstream unit note that multiple thresholds are considered for pbus in hydrol dc while a cbu has only one downstream unit fig 1 in a pbu surface runoff transfers from ca to pa and then to its downstream unit s after the depression storage of the pbu reaches the maximum storage of the highest level depression of the pbu however surface runoff in a cbu runs directly into its tributary channel or the main channel vertically fig 2 each unit is divided into four zones including canopy zone snow zone surface zone and soil zone the soil zone is further divided into upper and lower soil zones and the upper soil zone consists of a number of soil cells in addition all units in a subbasin share the same shallow groundwater zone fig 2 water is tracked zone by zone and unit by unit and finally converted into deep groundwater and streamflow table 1 lists the major processes in different zones and the references of the methods used in the modeling which are detailed in section 2 2 there are three nested loops in hydrol dc including subbasin loop unit loop and time loop fig 3 the time loop starts from the most upstream units in the most upstream subbasins to the most downstream units in the most downstream subbasins in the time loop of a unit in a subbasin the mass balance is calculated following the order of canopy zone snow zone and surface zone for a pbu the evaporation from its pa and its depression storage is calculated if the depression storage is greater than the maximum depression storage mds puddle routing is triggered for the calculation of water released from the pa to its associated unit outlet s otherwise the ca and pa are updated based on the current depression storage for an off stream cbu its outflow to the associated unit outlet is determined by tributary channel routing after the tributary channel or puddle routing the mass balance of the soil zone of the unit is calculated the percolation from all units in a subbasin is considered as the source of the shallow groundwater zone of the subbasin in the mass balance computation main channel routing is triggered after the main channel in a subbasin receives water from the surface zone of all on stream cbus and the shallow groundwater zone of the subbasin baseflow 2 2 descriptions of hydrol dc 2 2 1 canopy zone simulation the interception by plants in the canopy zone is calculated in hydrol dc the daily canopy capacity is first estimated by dhi 2007 1 mc cnp t l a i t mc cnp m a x where mc cnp is the canopy capacity l lai is the leaf area index mc cnp m a x is the maximum canopy capacity l the source term of the canopy zone of a unit pbu or cbu is precipitation and the sink terms are evaporation and precipitation exceeding the canopy zone capacity the water mass balance for the canopy zone can be expressed as 2 m cnp t m cnp t 1 p cnp t e cnp t p cano t where m cnp is the canopy storage l p cnp is the precipitation received by the canopy zone l e cnp is the evaporation from the canopy zone l p cano is the precipitation exceeding the canopy zone capacity l and t is the time step in hydrol dc only a portion of precipitation is assumed to be captured by the canopy zone eq 3 the evaporation from the canopy zone is calculated based on the canopy storage and reference evapotranspiration ret by using eq 4 neitsch et al 2011 after the calculation of precipitation falling into the canopy zone and evaporation the precipitation exceeding the canopy zone capacity is determined accordingly in addition the residual ret after the calculation of canopy zone evaporation is determined by using eq 5 3 p cnp t c cnp p total t 4 e cnp t m i n r e t t m cnp t 1 p cnp t 5 ret cnp t 0 f o r r e t t m cnp t 1 p cnp t r e t t e cnp t f o r r e t t m cnp t 1 p cnp t where c cnp is the ratio of precipitation falling into the canopy zone and p total is the total precipitation l ret is the reference evapotranspiration l e cnp is the evaporation from the canopy zone l and ret cnp is the residual ret after the calculation of canopy zone evaporation l 2 2 2 snow zone simulation for the snow zone of a unit the source term is the precipitation falling on the snow zone and the sink terms include snowmelt sublimation and precipitation falling into the surface zone the water mass balance of this zone is given by 6 m sno t m sno t 1 p sno t p sur t s m t e sno t where m sno is the snow zone storage l p sno is the precipitation falling into the snow zone l e sno is the sublimation from the snow zone l p sur is the precipitation falling into the surface zone l and sm is the snowmelt l in eq 6 p sno equals the sum of the precipitation falling directly into the snow zone and the precipitation exceeding the canopy zone capacity as follows 7 p sno t 1 c cnp p total t p cano

maximum air temperature is higher than the temperature for snowmelt the temperature index method neitsch et al 2011 is used in hydrol dc to simulate the snowmelt of the snow zone of each unit based on ret cnp the sublimation from the snow zone is calculated by the method proposed by dhi 2007 and the residual ret after the calculation of the sublimation is determined by 9 ret sno t ret cnp t e sno t where e sno is the sublimation from the snow zone l and ret sno is the residual ret after the calculation of sublimation l 2 2 3 surface zone simulation the surface zone is the most complex zone in hydrol dc based on the characteristics of different types of units unique hydrologic procedures and methods are used for each type of unit for the ca of a pbu the source terms include precipitation falling into the surface zone of the ca and the outflow of its upstream unit s including pbus and cbus and the sink terms are the infiltration into the soil zone and the discharge to its associated pa fig 4 a different from the ca in a pbu if the upstream of a cbu is an off stream cbu the outflow of the upstream off stream cbu flows directly to the channel of the current cbu therefore the source terms of a cbu are the precipitation falling into the surface zone and the outflow of its upstream pbu s and the sink terms are the infiltration into the soil zone and the discharge to its associated channel fig 4 b and c the mass balance equation for the ca of a pbu cbu can be expressed as 10 m ca t m ca t 1 p sur t s m t r ca t d ca t q ca i n t q ca o u t t where m ca is the ca storage l r ca is the ratio of ca to the entire area of a unit d ca is the infiltration into the soil zone in the ca l q ca i n is the ca inflow from its associated upstream unit s l and q ca o u t is the water from the ca to the pa or channel in a unit l the pa in a pbu receives water from rainfall snowmelt and its associated ca and loses water through evaporation infiltration percolation and outflow to its downstream unit s fig 4 a the mass balance equation can be expressed as 11 m pa t m pa t 1 q pa i n t p sur t s m t r pa t e pa t d pa t q pa o u t t where m pa is the pa storage l r pa is the ratio of pa to the entire area of a unit e pa is the evaporation from the pa l d pa is the infiltration percolation from the pa to the soil zone l q pa i n is the water from the ca to the pa l q pa i n q ca o u t and q pa o u t is the water from the pa to its downstream unit l the inflows of a tributary channel include the outflows from its associated ca and its upstream off stream cbu s fig 4 b however the main channel in a subbasin receives water from the cas of all on stream cbus its upstream off stream cbus and the main channel of its upstream subbasin s fig 4 c for a tributary or main channel the mass balance can be calculated by 12 m ch t m ch t 1 q ch i n t q tc o u t t where m ch is the channel storage l q ch i n is the water flowing into the channel l and q ch o u t is the water flowing out of the channel l 2 2 3 1 surface runoff and infiltration the surface runoff that generates in the ca of a unit is calculated by the scs curve number method mishra and singh 2003 for continuous simulation the curve number of each unit is updated by using the method proposed by chu and marino 2007 based on the soil water content of the first soil cell in the upper soil zone in addition the identification of frozen soil is critical for hydrologic simulation in cold regions in a unit if the temperature of a soil cell is lower than zero this cell is assumed to be frozen vice versa if the first soil cell is frozen the curve number of each unit is updated by mohammed et al 2013 13 cn fz t c n t 1 c fz wc us 1 t ws us 1 where cn fz and cn are the curve numbers under frozen and unfrozen conditions c fz is a shape parameter used to control the variation of curve number with soil water content wc us 1 and ws us 1 are the soil water content and the saturated water content of the first soil cell 2 2 3 2 surface runoff routing after the surface runoff in the ca of a unit is calculated the outflow from the ca to the pa or the channel in the unit is determined by neitsch et al 2011 14 q ca o u t t r ca t m ca t 1 1 e x p lag sur t c where r ca is the surface runoff generates in ca l lag sur is a parameter that controls water release from the ca to its associated pa or

the first cell in the upper soil zone and is controlled by the water content of the first soil cell is given by neitsch et al 2011 15 d pa t ks us 1 r pa t δ t f o r wc us 1 t 0 5 fc us 1 ks us 1 wc

and the residual ret after the calculation of sublimation ret sno is greater than zero the evaporation from the pa of the pbu is calculated based on the ret sno allen et al 1998 16 e pa t m i n c epa

tributary channel in an off stream cbu or the main channel in a subbasin the variable storage method williams 1969 is used for channel routing as follows 17 q ch o u t t c ch q ch i n t m ch t 1 where m ch is the channel storage l q ch i n is the channel inflow l q ch o u t is the channel outflow l and c ch is the storage coefficient for a pbu if its depression is fully filled two methods are used to handle depression routing and their selection is based on a user defined depression storage m pa r t when the mds of the pbu is less than m pa r t all water exceeding the mds flows out of the pa immediately otherwise a linear reservoir equation is used to handle the depression routing mishra and singh 2004 18 q pa o u t t β 1 q pa i n t β 1 q pa i n t 1 β 2 q pa o u t t 1 where β 1 and β 2

of a unit is divided into an upper soil zone and a lower soil zone and the upper soil zone is further divided into different cells the source terms of the upper soil zone in a pbu are the infiltration percolation from the ca and pa of the pbu the percolation from a channel into the soil zone is not considered in the current hydrol dc therefore the source term of the upper soil zone in a cbu is the infiltration from the ca of a cbu the sink terms of the upper soil zone include evaporation transpiration and percolation to the lower soil cell or zone the soil water storage and water content of a cell in the upper soil zone can be respectively expressed as 21 m us i t m us i t 1 d us i 1 t e us i t tr us i t d us i t where m us i is the water storage of the ith soil cell l d us i 1 and d us i are the percolation from the i 1th and ith soil cells l if i 1 d us i 1 t d ca t d pa t and tr us i and e us i are the transpiration and evaporation of the ith soil cell l in hydrol dc transpiration and evaporation are assumed to occur only within a user defined depth in the upper soil zone and calculated following kristensen and jensen 1975 similar to dhi 2007 the percolation rate of a soil cell in the upper soil zone is estimated following van genuchten 1980 without considering the suction head in hydrol dc it is also assumed that there is no percolation when an upper soil cell is frozen i e the temperature of the cell is below zero to determine the soil condition and control the percolation in different soil cells the temperature of a soil cell is calculated following klein 2018 22 t us

from the land surface to the center of the ith soil cell l for the lower soil zone of a unit the entire zone is assumed homogeneous and its water content is assumed invariant the percolation from this zone to the shallow groundwater zone is estimated by neitsch et al 2011 23 d ls t 1 exp 1 lag ls d us j t e x p 1 lag ls d us j t 1 where d ls is the percolation of the lower soil zone l lag ls is the delay time of soil water flow through the entire lower soil zone t and j is the last soil cell in the upper soil zone 2 2 5 groundwater zone simulation in a subbasin the shallow groundwater zone receives water from the lower soil zones of all units and drains water to the main channel and the deep groundwater zone the mass balance of the shallow groundwater zone can be expressed as 24 m sgw t m swg t 1 q sgw i n t d sgw t q sgw o u t t where m sgw is the shallow groundwater storage l q sgw i n is the inflow of the shallow groundwater zone l d sgw is the percolation from the shallow groundwater zone to the deep groundwater zone and q sgw o u t is the outflow from the shallow groundwater zone to the main channel l since all units in a subbasin share the same shallow groundwater zone the inflow of the shallow groundwater zone that equals the total percolating water from the lower soil zones of all units and the percolation from the shallow groundwater zone to the deep groundwater zone can be respectively expressed as neitsch et al 2011 25 q sgw i n t i 1 n u d ls i t 26 d sgw t c pco q sgw i n t where n u is the number of units in the subbasin d ls i is the percolation from the lower soil zone of the ith unit to the shallow groundwater zone l and c pco is a parameter that controls the percolation in a subbasin if the storage of the shallow groundwater zone is greater than a water release threshold an exponential recession function is used to calculate the outflow from the shallow groundwater zone to its associated main channel nielsen and hansen

hydrology toolset is widely used to calculate flow directions identify stream networks delineate a watershed and analyze topographic characteristics based on dems esri 2012 hud dc wang and chu 2020 is an arcgis based surface delineation algorithm used to identify pbus and cbus including depressions channels and their contributing areas and quantify the connectivity between units i e pbus and cbus hud dc consists of two modules the depression identification module and the channel and unit identification module the delineation procedure of hud dc is illustrated in fig 5 based on a dem the depression identification module delineates all highest level depressions and their overflow thresholds and calculates the property parameters of the depressions and thresholds e g mds maximum ponding area and the slope of each threshold to its downstream cell with the steepest descent with the calculated depressions and their thresholds the channel and unit identification module searches for all channel segments and channel ending nodes based on the user specified flow accumulation and channel lengths and then determines pbus and cbus by identifying the contributing areas of all depressions and channels in this study hud dc and the arcgis hydrology toolset were used to prepare topographic parameters for hydrol dc specifically hud dc was utilized to identify depressions channels units and the connectivity between units the arcgis toolset was used to delineate subbasins classify main channels and tributary channels and further assort cbus into on stream cbus and off stream cbus according to the spatial relationships between the cbus and the main channels or tributary channels 2 4 study area and input data the edmore coulee watershed fig 6 which covers 995 58 km2 in the middle of ppr was selected to test the performance of hydrol dc the edmore coulee watershed drains into sweetwater lake and the final outlet of the watershed is located at the united states geological survey usgs 05 056 200 edmore coulee gauge station latitude 48o20 12 n longitude 98o39 36 w in ramsey county the 2011 nlcd national land cover database shows that the watershed is mostly covered by cultivated crops 63 97 pasture 15 04 and open water and wetlands 13 33 the input data of hydrol dc can be classified into subbasin level and unit level data table 2 the 10 m dem of the watershed was downloaded from the usgs national map viewer and used for delineation of depressions channels units and subbasins during the delineation the dem was pre filled by 10 cm water to eliminate any artifacts and the delineation errors caused by buildings roads and other structures were corrected based on the usgs watershed boundary dataset and national hydrography dataset nhd in addition the topographic parameters such as mds and maximum ponding area mpa were calculated from the dem using hud dc the 2011 nlcd and statsgo2 state soil geographic dataset soil type data were used to compute curve numbers under the average antecedent moisture condition in this study the upper soil zone of each unit was divided into 4 soil cells and the thickness of each soil cell was 40 cm the parameters of each soil cell e g saturated hydraulic conductivity wilting point and field capacity were estimated based on the statsgo2 data following rawls and brakensiek 1983 carsel and parrish 1988 and maidment 1993 the daily precipitation and temperature were downloaded from the parameter elevation regressions on independent slopes model prism daly et al 2008 we used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 500 m resolution 8 day composite product mod15a2h version 6 for leaf area index usgs 2019 we calculated ret using the solar radiation data downloaded from a station of the north dakota agricultural weather network latitude 48 45 36 n longitude 98 20 40 w ndawn 2019 the daily discharge data at the edmore coulee gauge station were downloaded from the usgs national water information system and used for the calibration and validation of hydrol dc 2 5 model setup and performance evaluation based on the delineation results from hud dc the topographic characteristics of all subbasins were analyzed to highlight the distribution and connectivity of depressions in the subbasins for hydrol dc modeling the year of 2004 1 1 2004 12 31 2004 was selected as the warming up period to set the initial conditions of the model the model calibration and validation periods were 1 1 2005 12 31 2010 and 1 1 2011 12 31 2016 respectively the selections of the warming up calibration and validation periods mainly depended on the availability of input data hydroclimatic conditions and other factors additionally it was important to ensure that the calibration and validation periods included both dry and wet years and had comparable conditions the hydrol dc modeling was executed with a daily time step for all the three periods the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 and the percent bias pbias gupta et al 1999 were used to evaluate the performance of hydrol dc the nse and pbias can respectively be expressed as 28 nse 1 i 1 n o i s i 2 i 1 n o i o 2 29 pbias i 1 n o i s i i 1 n o i 100 where o i is the observed value at time step i s i is the simulated value at time step i o is the mean observed value and n is the total number of time steps 2 6 analyses of depression functionalities in hydrologic processes in a subbasin rainfall and snowmelt entering the surface zone i e p sur and sm are eventually converted to the

snowmelt entering the surface zone were calculated for all subbasins to analyze the hydrologic processes in the edmore coulee watershed in addition a depression impact coefficient c d was proposed to quantify the subbasin level influence capacity of depressions on hydrologic processes during the entire simulation period the storages of depressions and their spatial distributions in subbasins with different topographic characteristics were compared to analyze the differences in their c d values 30 c d m pa d pa e pa p sur sm where p sur sm m pa d pa and e pa respectively are the average daily values of p sur sm m pa d pa and e pa during the entire simulation period 2 7 analyses of the influences of depressions on hydrologic connectivity hydrol dc focuses on quantifying the influences of the highest level depressions on the hydrologic connectivity to subbasin outlets two concepts activated area aact and connected area acon are introduced to analyze the influences the aact of a subbasin is defined as the total area of all off stream cbus on stream cbus and fully filled pbus in the subbasin while the acon of a subbasin excludes the off stream cbus and the fully filled pbus that have no direct connection to the outlet of the subbasin that is the acon of a subbasin is defined as the total area of all on stream cbus off stream cbus and the pbus that are directly connected to the subbasin outlet therefore aact and acon of a subbasin are respectively the maximum area potential area and the actual area that contributes runoff water to the subbasin outlet in this study acon was used to quantify the hydrologic connectivity to the outlet of each subbasin for each subbasin the temporal variations of acon and the normalized depression storage ds were utilized to analyze the dynamic influences of depressions on the hydrologic connectivity in addition the differences between the normalized acon and the normalized aact under different ponding conditions were analyzed to reveal the variations in the areas that were fully filled but blocked from contributing runoff water to the subbasin outlet 3 results and discussion 3 1 topographic characteristics the edmore coulee watershed was delineated using the arcgis hydrology toolset into 15 subbasins which were further divided into 12 250 units pbus and cbus by using hud dc fig 6 table 3 lists the topographic parameters for all subbasins the low ratio of on stream cbus 0 02 to 0 34 indicated that depressions dominated all subbasins and only a limited area directly contributed surface runoff to its associated subbasin outlet in each subbasin this is in agreement with the findings from other studies in depression dominated areas e g chen et al 2013 grimm and chu 2020 numerous depressions were identified in the study area and the ratio of the total maximum storage of all depressions in a subbasin to the entire subbasin area tmds ranged from 21 77 mm to 130 89 mm to characterize their spatial distribution the depressions in each subbasin were classified into three categories based on the ratio of their mds to the subbasin area rmds 1 small depressions 0 mm rmds 0 01 mm medium depressions 0 01 mm rmds 1 mm and large depressions rmds 1 mm despite their small numbers large depressions had much greater storage in all subbasins except subbasin 3 table 3 small and medium depressions appeared to distribute randomly in all subbasins fig 7 a and b while large depressions tended to show certain distribution patterns e g the large depressions in subbasin 8 were located near the subbasin boundary fig 7c therefore the locations of large depressions were critical to surface runoff generation and hydrologic connectivity in all subbasins the percentage of the control area of large depressions in the entire area of a subbasin pcal ranged from 12 26 to 84 35 3 2 model calibration and validation because the edmore coulee watershed is located in a cold region and surface runoff mainly occurs in early spring snow zone and surface zone are the major zones that influence the hydrologic simulation in the watershed table 4 shows the parameter ranges for calibration shabani et al 2017 and the calibrated parameters for the two zones fig 8 shows the comparisons of the simulated and observed hydrographs at the usgs gauge station for the calibration and validation periods because of snowmelt most of the peak flows occurred in the early spring of each year from the end of march to the end of april the overall performance of hydrol dc was good for both calibration and validation periods moriasi et al 2007 the nse values were 0 80 and 0 77 for the calibration and validation periods respectively the pbias of the calibration period 9 66 was much better than that of the validation period 18 66 according to the pbias values hydrol dc overestimated the discharge on average but underestimated some peak flows due to the limitations of the methods used for the snow zone and the frozen soil in hydrol dc 3 3 depression functionalities in hydrologic processes fig 9 shows the ratios of five sink terms i e infiltration in the ca percolation in the pa evaporation from the pa storage of the pa and inflow of the main channel to the total source water of the surface zone note that the ratios of ca storage and tributary channel storage to the total source water of the surface zone were negligible smaller than 10 4 additionally subbasins were sorted according to their tmds values from small to large fig 9 for the surface zone of each subbasin most of the total source water was converted to the infiltration in the ca and the ratio ranged from 0 72 to 0 81 fig 9 the ratio of the channel inflow to the total source water ranged from 0 03 to 0 11 and the remaining source water was finally transferred into sink terms related to depressions the depression impact coefficients i e c d of all subbasins are also shown in fig 9 according to fig 9 it can be observed that c d increased with the tmds in general certain disagreements with the increasing trend were mainly due to the influences of the distribution of depressions especially large depressions for example large depressions were concentrated in the north part of subbasin 4 while the distribution of large depressions in subbasin 7 was relatively scattered fig 7c in addition the values of pcal for subbasins 4 and 7 were 34 55 and 49 09 table 3 respectively therefore although the tmds of subbasins 4 was greater than that of subbasin 7 table 3 the value of c d for subbasin 4 was smaller than that of subbasin 7 fig 9 3 4 influence of depressions on hydrologic connectivity the dynamic variations of the normalized acon and the normalized ds were simulated for all subbasins and fig 10 shows an example for subbasin 12 due to snowmelt and rainfall larger normalized acon and ds were observed during the wet periods in early spring and summer fig 10 for most dry periods the normalized ds decreased gradually because of evapotranspiration and percolation different from the normalized ds the normalized acon decreased abruptly and then reached its minimum value i e 0 14 for subbasin 12 due to the disconnection between depressions in winter both the normalized acon and the normalized ds were relatively stable because of the frozen conditions fig 11 displays the variations of the normalized acon with the normalized ds in all subbasins although the normalized ds of a subbasin was the same for different ponding conditions acon showed a significant difference for example the normalized ds of subbasin 12 was 0 34 on 5 27 2008 and 3 31 2007 however the values of the normalized acon were respectively 0 14 and 0 38 fig 12 a and b similarly the normalized ds of subbasin 12 was 0 55 on 6 25 2015 and 4 12 2009 while the values of acon were respectively 0 18 and 0 77 fig 12c and d in previous studies e g shaw et al 2013 grimm and chu 2018 similar analyses were conducted and the relationship between the normalized acon and ds in an area was represented by a single line for an event according to fig 11 however their relationship in a continuous simulation is much more complex than that for an event simulation this can be attributed to the different ponding conditions that were generated due to the distributions of the fully filled depressions additionally with the increase in the normalized ds the range of the normalized acon increased following a hierarchical pattern during the entire simulation period for each subbasin fig 11 for subbasin 12 the maximum value of the normalized acon was 0 39 when the normalized ds was smaller or equal to 0 4 however the maximum acon increased to 0 79 when 0 4 normalized ds 0 6 and finally to 0 86 when 0 6 normalized ds 0 8 the sudden increase of the range of acon was due to the release of runoff water from some previous blocked contributing areas this finding is similar to those from previous studies e g phillips et al 2011 yang and chu 2013 shaw et al 2013 grimm and chu 2018 for example fig 12b and 12d show that the acon was close to its maximum values when the normalized ds was respectively in the range of 0 4 0 6 and 0 6 0 8 as shown in fig 12b the north part of subbasin 12 did not contribute runoff to the subbasin outlet however due to the increase of ds this area eventually changed from an inactivated area to acon fig 12d the difference between the normalized aact and acon was used to quantify the variation of the blocked area with the development of the hydrologic connectivity to a subbasin outlet i e acon fig 13 for each subbasin when acon was small the limited differences were due to the fact that most depressions were not fully filled at this early stage in addition most of the fully filled depressions were small and had a very limited influence on the difference between aact and acon for example the normalized aact and acon of subbasin 12 were 0 18 and 0 16 respectively on 6 4 2015 their difference at this time was caused by one fully filled pbu and the off stream cbus that were not connected to the main channel of the subbasin fig 14 a and d with the increase of acon over time more depressions were fully filled however the runoff from some fully filled pbus and off stream cbus were blocked by their downstream units that were not connected to the outlet yet thus a great difference occurred due to the distribution of the fully filled highest level depressions fig 13 for example the normalized aact and acon of subbasin 12 on 3 21 2010 were 0 40 and 0 62 respectively the fully filled pbus and off stream cbus which were blocked by their downstream units were found in the north northeast and south parts of subbasin 12 fig 14b and e after most depressions were fully filled their corresponding contributing areas were connected to the subbasin outlet and the differences between aact and acon decreased fig 13 for example the normalized aact and acon of subbasin 12 were very close on 6 25 2010 normalized aact 0 84 and normalized acon 0 86 and their small difference was due to some small units that drained runoff water to the pbus with partially filled large depressions fig 14c and f 4 summary and conclusion in this study a new depression oriented hydrologic model hydrol dc was developed for simulating hydrologic processes in depression dominated watersheds the major unique features of hydrol dc can be summarized as follows 1 it has a unique modeling framework to cope with the complexity in hydrologic connectivity and functionalities associated with surface depressions in the modeling 2 it incorporates the concepts of pbu and cbu chu et al 2010 into semi distributed hydrologic modeling to simulate the dynamic connectivity between different hydrotopographic units 3 cbus are further classified into on stream cbus and off stream cbus for watershed scale simulations and 4 hydrol dc is capable of simulating the influences of both storage and distribution of surface depressions on hydrologic processes and connectivity hydrol dc was applied to the edmore coulee watershed the delineation results demonstrated the complexity of surface connectivity in the selected watershed because of the existence of depressions only a small portion of the area of each subbasin 2 34 was directly connected to its associated main channel the influences of depressions on hydrologic processes were quantified by using an impact coefficient i e c d and the comparison of the c d values of different subbasins indicated that both depression storage and distribution influenced the impact capacities of depressions in hydrologic processes the normalized acon varied dynamically during the entire simulation period due to the connection and disconnection between depressions although the normalized acon values were different for the same normalized ds the range of the normalized acon increased in a hierarchical fashion with the increase of the normalized ds additionally the variations in the differences between the normalized acon and aact indicated that depressions had a significant block function when only a portion of them were fully filled but no connectivity to the outlet was established since the interactions between surface water and groundwater were simplified and the groundwater discharge to depressions was not considered in hydrol dc this research focused on investigating the functionalities of depressions in the surface water system in the future research hydrol dc can be combined with groundwater models to investigate the influences of depressions on the entire hydrologic system also integrated analyses of the statistical properties of topographic characteristics and the depression controlled hydrologic processes would help reveal their intrinsic relationships and improve watershed modeling credit authorship contribution statement ning wang conceptualization methodology software validation
