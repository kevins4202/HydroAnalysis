8125,study region this article contributes to understanding processes occurring in long time abandoned shallow and unremediated mining lakes exemplified by the colorful lakes near wieściszowice southwest poland study focus temporal and spatial water chemistry variation and stable isotopic composition has been investigated in two sampling campaigns in wet and dry seasons novelties relating to these lakes are that for the first time depth and temporal dependent samples were studied chemically and isotopically water samples from various depths of the lakes and drainage water were analyzed for main ions trace and semi metals as well as sulfur and water isotopes data were interpreted statistically and with the chemical thermodynamic code phreeqc new hydrological insights for the region processes in the lakes are similar resulting from rain and groundwater infiltrating the rocks and mine residues and leaching efflorescent salts differences result from the lakes depth altitude and source of inflow they cause the blue lake to be in the al and the yellow and purple lakes in the fe buffer range these lakes characteristics result either in stratification evaporation influence or a well mixed pit lake identified by the isotope variability isotope results further identified bacterial sulfate reduction throughout the lake water column during spring and summer saturation indices

quality and the environment can be studied particularly in pit lakes which often create a picturesque landscape but with a potentially harmful content numerous accidents are related to tourists swimming in low ph water including instagrammers or influencers being injured after posing in the spanish monte neme lake zlotnick 2019 to minimize the effects of such events it is critical to know the water chemistry and processes in post mining lakes of touristic interest in as many locations as possible e g molenda and kidawa 2020 this is also a crucial issue in case of the colorful lakes kolorowe jeziorka presented in this article one of the most popular touristic attractions in southern poland kolorowe jeziorka 2021 in the past two decades the complexity of post mining lakes has been described in four comprehensive monographs they provide an outlook on former metal lignite and hard coal open pit mines castendyk and eary 2009 geller et al 2013 1998 mccullough 2011 that are often affected by acid mine drainage amd in these books guidelines for investigations management remediation and prediction of the water chemistry and potential environmental impacts of pit lakes are given and supported by relevant case studies a comprehensive study on potential after usage of open pit lakes was published by mccullough et al 2020 abandoned open pit mines ultimately resulting in pit lakes are common wherever easy accessible shallow mineral resources occur some of the best explored open pit lakes are in germany australia spain portugal usa canada and poland focusing on european examples german pit lakes are mostly related to lignite mining in the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century nearly 500 lakes located in six german districts cause substantial environmental and reclamation challenges benthaus et al 2020 schultze et al 2009 with over 140 lignite mining pits belonging to the central german district schultze et al 2010 most of these lakes are highly acidic and need long term remediation measures in poland similar lakes near the german border are part of the łuk mużakowa geopark publications about polish lignite mine pit lakes focus on their chemistry and biology gąsiorowski et al 2021 lutyńska and labus 2015 oszkinis golon et al 2020 sienkiewicz and gąsiorowski 2016 while those about german pit lakes focus on identifying the chemical processes reclamation methods or mine water reuse benthaus et al 2020 nixdorf et al 2010 schultze et al 2018 one of the world s most prominent cases for acid rock and mine drainage is the spanish and portuguese iberian pyrite belt dozens of lakes are highly acidic and their hydrochemistry and limnology has extensively been characterized gomes et al 2019 sánchez españa et al 2009 2005 in addition their microbial diversity santofimia et al 2013 and biogeochemistry were studied in detail falagán et al 2014 a common feature of these lakes and the colorful lakes is that they are the remnants of pyrite mining yet the iberian pyrite belt s pit lakes are larger and deeper compared to the colorful lakes and their geological as well as climatic background is different these differences make the colorful lakes a stimulating site for hydrogeological and isotopic investigations groundwater research of the lakes vicinity initially focused on regional aspects followed by studies of the chemistry michniewicz 1981 identified a hydrogeochemical anomaly and based on these results a model of mineral transformation in the sulfide oxidation zone of the silicate metamorphic rocks was developed further research provided knowledge on the origin and chemical composition and evolution of groundwater jezierski 2002 konieczyńska 2007 marszałek and wąsik 2001 mickiewicz and marszałek 2016 the water of the colorful lakes has been characterized by several authors of which the first one presents aluminum solubility in the pit lakes water dobrzyński 1995 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 investigated the relationship between groundwater and surface water and pociecha et al 2018 described the rotifer diversity in the lakes while the physicochemical background has been analyzed by fedak and lindner 1966 so far the latest investigation of the baseline and the pit lake chemistry has been provided by costa et al 2021 this investigation aims in understanding temporal and spatial changes in the chemistry main and trace elements and stable isotope composition in shallow pit lakes exemplified by the wieściszowice colorful lakes none of the previous studies of the colorful lakes conducted investigations in potential lake stratification and the chemical mechanisms occurring in different seasons therefore this study supplements the knowledge about long time abandoned nearly 100 years shallow and unremediated metal mining lakes preliminary results of this research were published by konsencjusz et al 2012b and are extended and interpreted in more detail here the goal of this paper is to characterize chemical processes understand vertical spatial changes in the lakes chemistry and answer whether these changes fit seasonal patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area colorful lakes near the village of wieściszowice formerly rohnau poland is a common name for a set of four abandoned mining lakes located in the rudawy landscape park and rudawy janowickie natura 2000 area fig 1 around the lakes the 3 ha large area has been intensively transformed by historical opencast and underground mining of pyrite performed from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 20th century after mining and sulfuric acid production ceased in 1925 pietryga 1962 the mienica and its tributaries rdzawy potok rusty brook formerly ockerbach and several unnamed streams flooded the mine excavations and four artificial lakes formed yellow purple blue and green periodical all these lakes are situated in the lower part of the wielka kopa 871 m a s l formerly scharlachberg at an altitude of 560 730 m a s l fig 2 the higher parts of wielka kopa blue lake are dominated by coniferous pine spruce forests with a small admixture of deciduous trees while at lower altitudes purple lake and yellow lake deciduous trees with a high proportion of birch dominate meaning that more leaves are in the brooks and lakes and settle to the bottom where they decompose green lake also known as green pond black lake was created during the gustav grube mine excavation fig 3 which started operation in 1796 this lake is located at an altitude of 730 m a s l and appears rarely only after intense rainfall usually it dries out quickly disappearing again for many years during the 2011 and 2012 sampling campaigns this lake was dry and therefore could not be sampled blue lake also known as emerald turquoise azure formerly grüner see is a remnant of the abandoned neues glück mine which started operation in 1793 located at an altitude of 635 m a s l the lake is 150 m long 30 50 m wide and 7 8 m deep there are two old adits in its close vicinity the first one 45 m long and partially flooded while the other one is only about 10 m long purple lake also known as orange or red lake is another remnant of the hoffnung mine at an altitude of 560 m a s l this lake has dimensions of about 430 110 m a highly variable shoreline and its depth depends substantially on rainfall ranging from 0 5 to 3 m around the lake the height of rock faces measured from the water level reaches 30 150 m moreover there is a former currently flooded mine gallery with a length of 132 m a width of 1 5 m and a height of 1 7 m yellow lake also known as yellow pond is in the oldest and northern part of the hoffnung mine which started mining in 1785 berg 1913a 1913b fedak and lindner 1966 jaskólski 1964 krajewski 1949 nielubowicz 1958 nielubowicz and jaskólski 1957 this lake is located at an altitude of 560 m a s l and formed between the mined heaps about 20 years ago after heavy rainfall rainwater draining from the hill slopes filles it with yellowish water greatly depending on the amount of rain its depth ranges between 0 5 and 4 m in dry low precipitation years the lake disappears and leaves an indistinguishable depression from its surroundings for none of the lakes or streams hydrographs exist so that precipitation flow relationships can currently not be provided this also holds true for bathymetric data about the lakes hydrological hydrogeological and detailed meteorological studies in the area around the lakes could not be found in the published literature in principle the hydrogeological conditions of the rudawy janowickie can be considered similar to those in other crystalline massifs of the sudetes marszałek 1996 staśko 2010 groundwater occurs in three depth zones within a weathering cover in the upper part of the fractured crystalline rocks in deeper fractured rocks and the deep tectonic faults these zones are often connected with each other but can also form independent and isolated hydrodynamic systems mickiewicz and marszałek 2016 the first zone from which the lakes water supply originates is related to a porous fissured aquifer composed of the weathering zone of fissures with a saprolite up to 25 30 m thick it is recharged by precipitation and melting snow in general the fracture density was observed to decreases with depth pumping tests identified that the hydraulic conductivity of the fissured zone is low and amounts to 0 08 0 1 m d 1 on average marszałek and wąsik 2005 springs draining hard rocks discharge mostly from 0 1 to 1 0 l s marszałek and wąsik 2001 various geological studies were conducted around wieściszowice with initial scientific activities primarily related to mineral exploitation dating to the 18th century when pyrite deposits were found fechner 1900 three separate mines were established there at that time fig 3 the hoffnung mine in 1785 the neues glück mine in 1793 and the gustav grube mine in 1796 fechner 1900 subsequent geological research related to an attempt to resume sulfide mining after the world wars but exploitation was finally abandoned first publications in the 20th century were conducted by german geologists and subsequently by polish ones petrascheck 1933 schneiderhöhn 1958 exploitation concerned only pyrite the source of raw material for sulfuric acid production and lasted continuously until 1923 closure of the mine and 1925 closure of the ore processing plants aleksandrowski 2003 fedak and lindner 1966 kądziołko hofmokl et al 1998 kryza et al 1995 kryza and mazur 1995 mayer et al 2012 mazur 1995 mazur et al 2006 mazur and aleksandrowski 2001 mroczkowski 1992 pietryga 1962 szałamacha and szałamacha 1991 werner et al 2000 geologically the study area belongs to the leszczyniec unit which is made up of metabasites and gneisses fig 4 and has been described in several publications numerous geologists using geochemical and isotopic analyses have also studied the tectonic position origin of metamorphic rocks and the geological age of rocks belonging to the rudawy janowickie mountains kryza and mazur 1995 generally the metamorphic part of the karkonosze izera massif has been interpreted as a succession of four structural units fig 4 the izera kowary the ješted the southern karkonosze and the leszczyniec units mazur and aleksandrowski 2001 the metaigneous leszczyniec unit is located in the uppermost position of the karkonosze izera massif s structural units this formation is composed of fine grained schistose and medium grained massive metabasites as well as metagranites felsic gneisses and metadiorites hornblende gneisses the latter two forming several large igneous bodies within the metabasites oberc dziedzic et al 2011 in the northern part of the leszczyniec unit near wieściszowice the metaigneous rocks are accompanied by pyrite bearing schists representing the only metasedimentary rocks in that unit jaskólski 1964 all the remaining rocks are a mineralogically variable series of quartz sericite chlorite schists kryza and mazur 1995 the pyrite bearing sericite chlorite schists spread over a length of 4 km from the kowary pass through czarnów to wieściszowice on the surface they outcrop from about 200 m south of wieściszowice up to wielka kopa gradually wedging out and disappearing with the colorful lakes being in this zone fig 4 three 5 12 m thick zones of high quality pyrite ore were found during exploitation nielubowicz 1958 and further research found that the central zone is the richest part of the deposit parafiniuk and siuda 2006 on average the deposit s pyrite concentrations were 10 reaching 30 in some locations oberc dziedzic et al 2011 parafiniuk et al 2016 petrascheck 1933 piestrzyński and salamon 1977 teisseyre 1973 based on the literature the main ore mineral is pyrite besides chalcopyrite tennantite galena pyrrhotite arsenopyrite marcasite sphalerite boulangerite jamesonite bournonite tetrahedrite limonite and siderite balcerzak et al 1992 on these rocks and in the heaps a weathering zone with a wide range of secondary efflorescent minerals formed among these are components of the pyritic shale quartz sericite chlorite secondary minerals illite kaolinite goethite balcerzak et al 1992 parafiniuk 1996 1991 parafiniuk et al 2016 2010 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 and a rich paragenesis of secondary sulfate minerals melanterite fibroferrite copiapite pickeringite slavíkite epsomite alunogen and gypsum balcerzak et al 1992 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 uzarowicz et al 2012 2011 2008 geochemical research showed that intense pyrite weathering in the abandoned excavations and heaps resulted in a specific geochemical environment and the creation of a local hydrogeochemical anomaly parafiniuk and siuda 2006 commonly referred to as acid rock drainage ard due to this highly acidic environment and well developed ard and amd also schwertmannite precipitates were found balcerzak et al 1992 costa et al 2021 parafiniuk 1996 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 uzarowicz et al 2012 2011 2008 relating to the weathering processes in the oxidation zone of the wieściszowice pyrite bearing shale the surrounding rocks control the chemistry of the water and weathering products balcerzak et al 1992 mining resulted in the rocks disintegration increasing the thickness of the aeration and oxidation zone as well as the water ingress and consequently the weathering process iron di sulfide oxidation releases iron and chalcophile metals protons and sulfate turning the water and environment acidic consequently further geochemical reactions in the weathering zone intensify the hydrolytic breakdown of additional minerals balcerzak et al 1992 being responsible for the characteristic chemical composition of the lakes water 2 2 isotopes until present no publication dealt with isotopic research about the colorful lakes from general studies it is known that sulfate is not subject to isotopic exchange processes and therefore the sulfur isotopic composition is only determined by its origin and redox reactions which are primarily controlled by the biosphere clark and fritz 1999 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 consequently δ34s so4 2 results from the isotopic composition of sulfate from different sources each source has its distinct isotopic characteristic as well as isotopic fractionation factor related to the transition of sulfur to different oxidation states with the largest variations resulting from kinetic effects accompanying the biochemical cycling of sulfur krouse and grinienko 1991 the most relevant process modifying the sulfate isotopic composition is bacterial sulfate reduction which enriches the heavier sulfate isotope 34s because sulfate reducing bacteria prefer the light sulfur isotope 32s jędrysek 2002 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 sulfur fractionation is also associated with photosynthetic reduction of sulfate by plants during the incorporation of sulfur into the amino acid structures kendall and mcdonnell 1998 plants preferentially use 32s but the isotopic effect is less pronounced as in bacterial sulfate reduction mandernack et al 2000 even considered negligible by some authors fritz et al 1989 similarly the sulfate oxygen isotopic composition in lacustrine water predominantly depends on biological processes sulfate reduction and reoxidation of reduced sulfur in spite of a slow rate of thermodynamic isotopic exchange between sulfate and water δ18o so4 2 is clearly related to δ18o h2o this relationship results from the equilibrium isotopic exchange of sulfate oxygen with water oxygen during bacterial sulfate reduction in cells dso₄2 h₂o 25 brunner et al 2005 this process is bidirectional and can accompany the reduction of sulfate to sulfide and subsequently their reoxidation an isotopic equilibrium is therefore reached between sulfate oxygen and water oxygen during these gradual successive transformations thus δ18o so4 2 results from the water isotopic composition the equilibrium oxygen isotopic fractionation factor in the system the kinetic isotopic effect that occurs during reoxidation of reduced sulfur phases and the ratio of the rate of sulfate reduction to the rate of their re formation during oxidation processes schiff et al 2005 during sulfate formation water oxygen or molecular oxygen dissolved in the water are used as oxygen sources δ18o of the formed sulfate therefore depends on the ratio of water oxygen and the oxygen from dissolved molecular oxygen both of which are a function of the available dissolved oxygen the type of enzymes catalyzing the oxidation reaction and eh ph and temperature carmody et al 1998 2 3 methods sampling in the colorful lakes was performed twice on 2011 09 29 and 2012 06 20 konsencjusz et al 2012a weather conditions temperature precipitation were like those recorded in previous years in the blue lake samples were taken at depths of 0 m 1 5 m 2 5 m 3 5 m 4 5 m 5 5 m only on 2011 09 29 6 5 m and 7 5 in the purple lake at 0 m 1 5 m and 2 5 m and in the yellow lake at 0 m 2 0 m and 3 5 m below the lake surface as the green lake was dry during the sampling campaigns it could not be sampled samples were taken from the central part of each lake using a pontoon and a ruttner type sampler kc denmark a s a 5 liter cylindrical acrylic probe that closed at the desired depth was used collection of water from the sampler was done through a dew valve located at the lower part of the sampler flow in rdzawy potok and the neues glück adit was measured volumetrically with the bag and stopwatch method ph eh redox potential corrected to standard hydrogen electrode and ec electrical conductivity were measured in the field with an elmetron cpc 401 multi parameter

made at the chemical laboratory of the physical geography department of the wroclaw university appendix 1 oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope samples were collected in 30 ml tightly sealed amber glass bottles and analyzed by mass spectrometry sulfur 34s 32s and sulfate oxygen 18o 16o stable isotope samples were collected in acidified ph 2 3 1 l hdpe bottles with 10 bacl solution to precipitate sulfate as baso4 gehre 1996 gehre et al 2004 vinograd and porowski 2020 and analyzed at the institute of geological sciences of the polish academy of sciences ing pan warsaw poland appendix 1 oxygen isotopes 18o were measured by water co2 gas equilibration using a thermofisher scientific s gas bench ii system with online continuous flow on evolved co2 gas and hydrogen isotopes 2h by water

gehre et al 2004 vinograd and porowski 2020 measurement precision based on the long term repeated measurements of international reference materials was 0 1 for δ18o and 1 0 for δ2h sulfur and oxygen isotopes of sulfate were analyzed by dynamic flash combustion tc ea combined with a thermo scientific delta v advantage irms on baso4 wrapped in silver capsules halas et al 2007 mizutani 1971 and purged in helium to remove water and nitrogen to analyze the sulfur isotopes combustion and reduction were carried out in a single reactor filled with tungsten oxide wo3 and copper cu as a reducing agent in the reactor the 1020 c helium carrier is enriched in o2 gas and the baso4 is thermally decomposed to produce so2 for sulfur isotope measurement for the oxygen isotopes the samples and glassy carbon were heated to around 1450 c to produce co gas from which the oxygen isotopes were measured kendall and mcdonnell 1998 the results of analyses were reported using δ notation δ18o with respect to vsmow and δ34s with respect to vcdt carmody et al 1998 gehre 1996 gehre et al 2004 vinograd and porowski 2020 the precision of the measurements was 0 1 for both δ18o and δ34s statistical investigations were conducted with spss 27 using the methods discussed in each individual section phreeqc 3 6 2 parkhurst and appelo 2013 with the phreeqc dat database was used to conduct chemical thermodynamic modeling of the colorful lakes mining influenced water all the parameters that can be calculated with this database were included in the solution spread input file concentrations under the detection limit were used with half of the detection limit 3 results 3 1 general it can clearly be seen that the water in the three lakes is either in the fe or in the al buffer range table 1 and according to the furtak and langguth 1965 classification all sampled waters are of the normal earth alkaline with prevailing sulfate type while the blue lake with ph values from 4 9 to 5 7 shows the characteristics for water in the al buffer range with lower electrical conductivities the purple and yellow lakes with ph between 2 3 and 2 9 is in the fe buffer range and has higher electrical conductivities this characteristic influences the lakes chemistry and therefore a conclusive discussion needs to consider these differences hierarchical cluster analysis ward method using the parameters with a score above 0 5 from principal cluster analysis of all samples showed that each lake falls into its own cluster indicating that the individual chemistry of the three lakes differs statistically significantly and that they can be discussed individually appendix 2 first the physicochemical and isotopic characteristic of each individual lake and thereafter a summarizing discussion will be given principal component analysis appendix 3 showed that 74 of the water chemistry s variance is covered by the first three components 50 of the variance is in the first component which consists of the electrical conductivity mg sr so4 no3 sio2 mn the proton activity ca fe eh and some minor constituents the second component accounting for 16 of the variance is dominated by na and nh4 while the 3rd component which accounts for 8 of the variance is dominated by ba the first component is indicative of pyrite weathering and the dissolution of efflorescent minerals from the waste rock while the second component seems to be primarily indicative for rain and snow influence of the lakes waters rain and snow in the southern part of poland contains 0 3 11 4 mg l of nh4 0 6 4 3 mg l of cl and 0 6 2 5 mg l of na as well as 0 3 1 1 mg l of k błaś et al 2008 dore et al 1999 stachurski and zimka 2002 żelazny 2005 as no other source of ammonia that could correlate with na exists in the vicinity of the lakes the rain and snow source is the most likely in that case ba is abundant in the pyrite bearing host rocks with up to 786 mg kg oberc dziedzic et al 2011 and could originate from there calculation of the sample s ion balances with phreeqc showed values between 25 0 and 19 2 table 1 which are not ph dependent but show a high positive correlation with the electrical conductivity imbalance ratio between measured and calculated electrical conductivity in the blue lake the absolute values are generally lower than in the yellow and purple lakes which have lower ph values because the lab used an uncommon method to calculate the ion balances this error was not noted before the detailed analysis with phreeqc which is based on the species rather than the equivalent concentration of the individual analytes all the interpretations in this paper have been done with this imbalance in mind 3 2 blue lake samples of the blue lake table 1 fig 4 were taken at eight depths it is the deepest of the lakes and it has the lowest tds among the three lakes it has the highest ph ranging from 4 85 to 5 74 decreasing with depth the vertical distribution of selected chemical indicators is shown in figs 5 9 and in appendix 1 from the west the intermittent rdzawy potok with a discharge of 0 1 l s flows into the blue lake field observations show that the brook is fed from seepage water from waste rock heaps after snow melt or longer rainfall in june 2012 the samples were acid ph 3 17 with 2 5 times higher tds 300 mg l concentrations than the blue lake consequently most of the other parameters show also higher concentrations such as 2 5 times more so4 2 170 mg l or 4 times more ca2 29 5 mg l the largest difference was found for fetot with a more than 20 times higher concentration reaching 3 88 mg l main ion concentrations cl na k are like those of the blue lake especially in its lower parts rdzawy potok water is of the so4 ca mg type appendix 1 3 3 purple lake of all the lakes the purple lake shows the most variable shoreline and a maximum depth of 2 5 3 0 m in its center compared to the blue lake the water s mineralization is higher and acid though it has the same so4 ca mg water type table 1 the vertical distribution of selected chemical indicators is shown in fig 5 to fig 9 and in appendix 1 apart from rainwater and snowmelt the purple lake is recharged from acid mine water discharging from the abandoned mine adit ph ranged from 2 3 to 2 7 tds from 2180 to 1960 mg l and fetot from 20 mg l to 97 mg l in june and september respectively all these values are in the same range as those of the lake s surface indicating a relationship between the adit and the lake water 3 4 yellow lake yellow lake is the shallowest of the three lakes with the smallest water volume chemically the lake s water is similar to the purple lake and it is also of the so4 ca mg type table 1 as well as acid 2 25 2 9 fig 6 with tds concentrations in the range of 1236 1384 mg l fig 7 the vertical distribution of selected chemical indicators is shown in fig 5 to fig 9 and in appendix 1 3 5 isotopic composition 3 5 1 blue lake results from the blue lake show seasonal variations of the so4 2 concentrations δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 fig 10 table 2 source of the so4 2 in this lake is mainly surface runoff containing sulfate and oxidized organic sulfur while sulfate originating from direct oxidation of pyrite commonly found in dispersed form in the adjacent rock formations and spoil tips is missing so4 2 from direct pyrite oxidation would be characterized by negative δ34s so4 2 values ranging from about 4 5 to about 3 5 and in extreme cases up to 15 balcerzak et al 1992 but was not observed in the vicinity of the colored lakes it can therefore be assumed that the so4 2 in the lakes originates from sulfide oxidation in the adjacent spoil tips surrounding this water body such processes were found in the oxidation zone of pyrite bearing shales near wieściszowice mandernack et al 2000 in september 2011 compared to june 2012 lower concentrations of so4 2 as well as smaller differences in δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 were found in september 2011 with lower rainfall and therefore probably lower surface runoff less so4 2 discharged into the lake in june 2012 higher rainfall was recorded and increasing surface runoff of oxidized sulfur species into the lake caused a small increase in the so4 2 concentrations this runoff probably activated an additional so4 2 source and hence the greater differences in δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 results of the so4 2 oxygen and sulfur isotopic composition from the rdzawy potok shows a twice as high so4 2 concentration compared to the lake no depth dependency was observed for the so4 2 concentrations δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 which is an evidence of mixing and more or less no stratification in this lake results of the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes show small variations in september 2011 confirming one main supply source into the lake fig 13 larger variations of the isotopic composition were found in june 2012 no relationship between depth and δ2h h2o or δ18o h2o could be observed confirming a good mixing processes with respect to δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 3 5 2 purple lake sulfate concentrations as well as δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 showed seasonal variations fig 11 and correlations between the sulfate concentrations δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 with r2 between 0 6 and 0 7 in september 2011 a larger span of the sulfate concentrations occurred but very small variations in δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 at the same time it can be assumed that oxidation of reduced organic sulfur occurred accompanied by an increase in sulfate concentration without changing the isotopic composition krouse and grinienko 1991 this process was most intensive above the sediment because the largest amount of organic matter is accumulated in the bottom sediment in june 2012 a negative correlation between the sulfate concentration and δ34s so4 2 exists indicating bacterial sulfate reduction this leads to the accumulation of the heavy sulfur isotope as sulfate reducing bacteria prefer to process the lighter sulfur isotope 32s cook and olive 2012 noyhouzer et al 2018 simultaneously the sulfate concentration decreases in the purple lake a correlation between depth and δ2h h2o as well as δ18o h2o exists fig 13 shifting δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o to more negative values both in june 2012 and september 2011 one of the main processes driving changes in δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o is evaporation indicated by the heavier samples near the lake s surface with increasing depth the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition was shifted towards negative values such a situation was found for both sampling periods with a similar trend the main process driving the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition in the pond is evaporation the greatest impoverishment in the light isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen was found in the samples collected from the pond surface the surface evaporation process loses its importance and at a depth of 2 5 m the isotopic composition of δ2h h2o δ18o h2o is similar to that of the adit it can therefore be inferred that the adit is one of the main sources supplying this lake which can also be seen by the chemical similarity of adit and lake surface water in both sampling periods 3 5 3 yellow lake seasonal changes of sulfate concentrations and δ34s so4 2 as well as δ18o so4 2 could also be observed for the yellow lake fig 12 a strong negative correlation r2 0 99 for september 2011 and r2 0 93 for june 2012 exists for δ34s so4 2 vs sulfate concentrations for both sets of samples bacterial sulfate reduction seems to occur being less prominent in september 2011 compared to june 2012 where larger variations of δ34s so4 2 exist as in the purple lake δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o is controlled by evaporation but with different intensities fig 13 in september 2011 δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o variations were small and no depth correlation existed indicating a low evaporation and mixing in june 2012 evaporation was more intense affecting the isotopic fractionation and resulting in an enrichment of heavier isotopes in the upper lake water body disappearing with depth the depth correlation of δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o indicates an absence of mixing in the lake 3 6 chemical thermodynamic calculations most of the normally relevant phases in mine water calculated by phreeqc are undersaturated in relation to the lakes water appendix 4 this result is similar to that of dobrzyński 1995 who used wateq4f for his calculations very likely this undersaturation results from both the missing concentrations of the chemical analysis and a relatively short reaction time between the efflorescent salts in the abandoned mines waste rock and the precipitation therefore only for a selected range controlling phases can be defined controlling phases in the blue lake are al oh 3 a barite and fe oh 3 a for al ba and fe and chalcedony quartz and sio2 for the silica for al this differs from dobrzyński 1995 who identified alohso4 respectively jurbanite alohso4 5h2o as the controlling phase a reason for this potential discrepancy is the different thermodynamic databases used in both cases in the purple and yellow lakes controlling phases are anhydrite and gypsum for the sulfate barite for ba and chalcedony and sio2 for silica these controlling phases do not explain the whole lakes chemical composition but all other phases show a high undersaturation including calcite si 4 to 7 and dolomite si 7 to 13 what can clearly be seen is that the species distribution and the saturation indices in the three lakes show a pattern which allows to differentiate between the various mining influenced lake waters in the purple and the yellow lake the si in the three depths are similar respectively while in the blue lake the si shows a slight stratification with a trend to lower si with increasing depths for most of the relevant phases possibly indicating evaporation exceptions to this stratification are the sulfate phases anhydrite gypsum and celestine as well as the silicate phases which have a similar si throughout the water column all the carbonate phases aragonite calcite dolomite and rhodochrosite show different behaviors in the september and the june sampling while the si increases in september it decreases in june these results show that the smaller lakes are very likely connected with each other which can already be seen by the similar chemistry and the fact that the cluster analysis groups them into the same cluster comparing the si of the two influents into the lakes it becomes obvious that the same si distribution prevails for the purple and yellow lakes including their inflow rdzawy potok shows the si signature for the acidic waters but is quickly buffered once it flows into the blue lake with some of the si increasing e g al oh 3 a fe oh 3 a jarosite k gibbsite others decreasing e g anhydrite gypsum melanterite this indicates precipitation and mixing reactions occurring once the brook water enters the blue lake investigating the species calculated by phreeqc shows that in all three lakes and the three inflows so4 2 dominates followed by ca2 fig 14 in the blue lake the next dominating species are h4sio2 and mg2 all other species in the blue lake contribute to a smaller degree to the total water s chemistry between the september and the june samples of the blue lake there is a difference in the concentration of no3 and hco3 with a higher concentration of hco3 resulting from either carbonate dissolution or evapo concentration in september and a higher concentration of no3 in june the latter possibly resulting from precipitation though the si for the yellow and purple lakes were similar this is not the case for the species distribution h4sio4 concentrations in these acid lakes become less while the typical amd phases of al and fe show up purple lake shows a stratification with increasing concentrations with depth while the yellow lake seems to be better mixed just showing small variations between the sampling campaigns in case of the purple lake which is fed by the mine drainage from the adit one can see that a evaporation increases the concentrations of the species and b the tds increase with depth discussed above and results mainly from the so4 2 and ca2 species thought the inflow into the blue lake has si similar to the acid lakes the species distribution of the inflow is similar to the blue lake s species distribution indicating that the water in this lake is mainly fed by the inflow and unlikely by additional ground water sources 3 7 species and controlling processes based on the predominance eh ph diagrams predominance or pourbaix diagrams are eh ph diagrams that help to understand the predominant species in an analyzed water sample and potential reactions occurring in the system pourbaix 1966 vanloon and duffy 2011 fig 15 though some authors question the usefulness of redox measurements in systems with low concentrations e g nordstrom and munoz 1994 they can be applied in systems where higher concentrations of redox couples such as fe exist in case of the colorful lakes the al and so4 diagrams were plotted based on the average sample chemistry of all the sampled waters whilst the fe diagrams are based on the average of the individual lake essays based on the results of the phreeqc modeling four representative pourbaix diagrams for various activities of al so4 2 and fe were constructed at 17 c and 101 3 hpa fig 15 al in the blue lake the eh and ph falls into the gibbsite field which explains the lower concentrations of al in the blue lake and its ph in the al buffer range fig 15 a this means that the al concentration in the blue lake is controlled by gibbsite precipitation as already could be seen earlier fig 6 the ph decreases with depth while the eh is relatively stable the eh differences between the june and september samples can be neglected as eh measurements show a methodological error of 50 mv no controlling al phases can be seen in the purple and yellow lakes nor the inflows which explains why the al concentrations in these water samples are between 7 and 26 times higher than in the blue lake mine water from rdzawy potok seems to be buffered and mixes with lower mineralized surface water once it flows into the blue lake so 4 as expected most of the sulfate predominates as the so4 2 species fig 15 b which was already shown by the phreeqc chemical thermodynamic calculations only the purple and blue lake samples with a lower ph and higher eh fall into the feso4 field resulting from the high fe concentrations in these two lakes compared to the blue lake fe fe speciation highly depends on the concentrations of the fe and so4 in the system garrels and christ 1966 to interpret the processes in the three lakes therefore requires two eh ph diagrams in the blue lake fig 15 c fe concentrations are controlled by the precipitation of the fe oxyhydrates in the form of ochre which can be seen by the coloration of the sediments seasonal depth variation play a minor role because all the measured eh and ph values fall into the fe oh 3 ppd phase field in case of the purple and yellow lakes fig 15 d with higher fe and so4 concentrations and lower ph values no carbonates buffer the water therefore the ph stays in the fe buffer range which can be seen by the more or less similar ph values in each of the two sampling campaigns with more or less no depth dependency as in the blue lake the controlling phase is still the fe oh 3 ppd indicated by the parallel course of the sampling dots with the boarder of the predominance field two different behaviors can be recognized for the adits and rdzawy potok the adit water gets oxidized and increases its redox potential while its ph stays stable as no reactions occur which could lower the ph through hydrolysis because of the similar ph of the adit and lake waters fe oh 3 ppd might again be assumed as the controlling phase for this water once the adit water enters the lake it contributes substantially to the lake s chemistry for rdzawy potok the situation differs it is quickly buffered once it flows into the blue lake and increases in its ph value while the redox potential does not change 4 discussion and conceptual model blue lake has the highest altitude and is in an area where mining was deeper but less extensive leaving steep banks and small heaps above the pit it is recharged primarily by rdzawy potok throughout the year and periodically by precipitation and snowmelt diluting the tds derived by the stream infiltration waters flow through a thin weathered zone with a low hydraulic conductivity balcerzak et al 1992 costa et al 2021 marszałek and wąsik 2001 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 and through some heaps resulting in minor pyrite oxidation fig 16 the brook water has a low mineralization primarily resulting from so4 2 ca and mg isotope results indicate that sulfate in the lake originates from the advanced oxidation of sulfide to sulfate in the heaps surrounding the reservoir and not from immediate pyrite weathering decomposition of organic matter seems to be an additional source of sulfur especially during the spring june 2012 sampling after entering the lake rdzawy potok s water is mixed through the entire profile to a depth of about 8 m which results in a lack of vertical variability in the lake s chemical composition and which can be seen by the similar species distribution in both the lake and rdzawy potok fig 14 none of the three results neither the chemical composition nor the isotopes or the chemical thermodynamic modeling give indication to a relevant evaporation contribution which might be due to the lakes higher elevation and lower sun exposure purple lake is located at a lower altitude is only 3 m deep and its southern shore is flattened it is for most of the year fed by the neues glück adit which drains the eastern part of the hills at a flow rate of 0 1 0 3 l s fig 17 during the dryer season september 2011 mainly from september to november the adit is commonly dry and its chemical evolution which is controlled by processes in the mined rocks has been described in earlier publications balcerzak et al 1992 costa et al 2021 marszałek and wąsik 2001 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 mine water discharging from the adit has a low ph 2 38 2 88 and a high concentration of so4 2 ca2 and fetot with little variability in the two datasets except fetot which has 5 times higher concentrations in june compared to september this mine water is the main source for purple lake with additional ions including h so4 2 fetot ca2 originating from seepage water from the surrounding mine dumps as could be shown by chemical thermodynamic modeling the species composition in this lake is similar to the mine water but substantially different from that in the blue lake fig 14 evaporation contributes substantially to the lakes chemical composition and its vertical variation as good sun exposure extent and a shallow depth result in a higher surface evaporation compared to blue lake it is higher in the 2nd half of the year summer and autumn this results in solution concentration an increase in its density and a slow flow towards the bottom where a twofold increase in mineralization and so4 2 with very high fetot concentrations are recorded as indicated by the isotopic results during spring and summer a process associated with bacterial sulfate reduction occurs throughout the water column resulting in an enrichment in the heavy sulfur isotope later in the year the oxidation process of reduced organic sulfur plays a dominant role increasing the waters sulfate concentration substantially yellow lake is the smallest of the three pit lakes and because it is very close to purple lake in an identical geological setting it can be assumed that the processes controlling the lake s chemistry are very similar there is no inflow of mine drainage and the feed comes mainly from precipitation and infiltration through the weathered zone of the wielka kopa rocks and through numerous mining residues occurring to its north and west fig 18 this can be seen by lower ph values and 5 6 times higher fetot concentrations in june 2012 when snowmelt supplies the lake with dissolved efflorescent salts due to its poor sun exposure evaporation is less intense throughout the year which is evident by the lower mineralization compared to purple lake fig 14 but in spring june it is higher compared to autumn september in deeper parts of the lake the dominant process seems to be bacterial reduction of sulfate occurring under conditions with lower oxygen availability 5 conclusions though the wieściszowice colorful lakes are unique for the sudetes mountains due to the outcrop of the pyrite bearing shists this research extends the knowledge about processes controlling the chemical composition of shallow post mining lakes in humic meteorogical conditions and di sulfide containing rocks until now research there focused mainly on determining the relevant processes controlling the chemical composition of the water resulting from water rock interaction and the associated phase transformations of the minerals costa et al 2021 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 a second research focus was the influence of efflorescent salts on the water chemistry of the brooks flowing in the rdzawy potok valley wąsik and wasowski 2015 past pit lakes studies have been limited to samples collected near the banks which restricts characterization of spatio temporal developments in the pit lake water strata in case of the colorful lakes this study for the first time also included isotope samples this investigation therefore determined the spatio temporal variability of water chemistry and isotopic composition sampling took place during the wetter season june 2012 which includes the winter and spring months when snowfall and snowmelt occur and the dryer season september 2011 which includes the summer and autumn months with low precipitation and high temperatures associated with insolation the results indicate that each of the three pit lakes should be considered separately although the general course of processes is similar there is an obvious difference in the pit lakes chemical composition resulting from different natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the geochemical conditions of each lake these similarities result from the inflow water flowing through the weathered mining residues leaching the efflorescent salts originating from pyrite and rock weathering based on these results and discussions it can be concluded that only when spatio temporal samples assisted by isotope investigations are taken and the chemical thermodynamic conditions are studied investigations of small historical mine pit lakes provide full insight into the relevant processes future studies of the colorful lakes should sample the waters monthly and measure the flow rates in rdzawy potok and the adits regularly to allow for an overall mass balance of the processes occurring in the lakes and the surrounding brooks installing a weather station might improve the conclusions that can be drawn funding the research work was co funded with the kghm cuprum r d centre ltd internal research grant no 571 01 0006 0 o 11 0008 002 and a

8125,study region this article contributes to understanding processes occurring in long time abandoned shallow and unremediated mining lakes exemplified by the colorful lakes near wieściszowice southwest poland study focus temporal and spatial water chemistry variation and stable isotopic composition has been investigated in two sampling campaigns in wet and dry seasons novelties relating to these lakes are that for the first time depth and temporal dependent samples were studied chemically and isotopically water samples from various depths of the lakes and drainage water were analyzed for main ions trace and semi metals as well as sulfur and water isotopes data were interpreted statistically and with the chemical thermodynamic code phreeqc new hydrological insights for the region processes in the lakes are similar resulting from rain and groundwater infiltrating the rocks and mine residues and leaching efflorescent salts differences result from the lakes depth altitude and source of inflow they cause the blue lake to be in the al and the yellow and purple lakes in the fe buffer range these lakes characteristics result either in stratification evaporation influence or a well mixed pit lake identified by the isotope variability isotope results further identified bacterial sulfate reduction throughout the lake water column during spring and summer saturation indices

quality and the environment can be studied particularly in pit lakes which often create a picturesque landscape but with a potentially harmful content numerous accidents are related to tourists swimming in low ph water including instagrammers or influencers being injured after posing in the spanish monte neme lake zlotnick 2019 to minimize the effects of such events it is critical to know the water chemistry and processes in post mining lakes of touristic interest in as many locations as possible e g molenda and kidawa 2020 this is also a crucial issue in case of the colorful lakes kolorowe jeziorka presented in this article one of the most popular touristic attractions in southern poland kolorowe jeziorka 2021 in the past two decades the complexity of post mining lakes has been described in four comprehensive monographs they provide an outlook on former metal lignite and hard coal open pit mines castendyk and eary 2009 geller et al 2013 1998 mccullough 2011 that are often affected by acid mine drainage amd in these books guidelines for investigations management remediation and prediction of the water chemistry and potential environmental impacts of pit lakes are given and supported by relevant case studies a comprehensive study on potential after usage of open pit lakes was published by mccullough et al 2020 abandoned open pit mines ultimately resulting in pit lakes are common wherever easy accessible shallow mineral resources occur some of the best explored open pit lakes are in germany australia spain portugal usa canada and poland focusing on european examples german pit lakes are mostly related to lignite mining in the 19th and at the beginning of the 20th century nearly 500 lakes located in six german districts cause substantial environmental and reclamation challenges benthaus et al 2020 schultze et al 2009 with over 140 lignite mining pits belonging to the central german district schultze et al 2010 most of these lakes are highly acidic and

biology gąsiorowski et al 2021 lutyńska and labus 2015 oszkinis golon et al 2020 sienkiewicz and gąsiorowski 2016 while those about german pit lakes focus on identifying the chemical processes reclamation methods or mine water reuse benthaus et al 2020 nixdorf et al 2010 schultze et al 2018 one of the world s most prominent cases for acid rock and mine drainage is the spanish and portuguese iberian pyrite belt dozens of lakes are highly acidic and their hydrochemistry and limnology has extensively been characterized gomes et al 2019 sánchez españa et al 2009 2005 in addition their microbial diversity santofimia et al 2013 and biogeochemistry were studied in detail falagán et al 2014 a common feature of these lakes and the colorful lakes is that they are the remnants of pyrite mining yet the iberian pyrite belt s pit lakes are larger and deeper compared to the colorful lakes and their geological as well as climatic background is different these differences make the colorful lakes a stimulating site for hydrogeological and isotopic investigations groundwater research of the lakes vicinity initially focused on regional aspects followed by studies of the chemistry michniewicz 1981 identified a hydrogeochemical anomaly and based on these results a model of mineral transformation in the sulfide oxidation zone of the silicate metamorphic rocks was developed

water of the colorful lakes has been characterized by several authors of which the first one presents aluminum solubility in the pit lakes water dobrzyński 1995 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 investigated the relationship between groundwater and surface water and pociecha et al 2018 described the rotifer diversity in the lakes while the physicochemical background has been analyzed by fedak and lindner 1966 so far the latest investigation of the baseline and the pit lake chemistry has been provided by costa et al 2021 this investigation aims in understanding temporal and spatial changes in the chemistry main and trace elements and stable isotope composition in shallow pit lakes exemplified by the wieściszowice colorful lakes none of the previous studies of the colorful lakes conducted investigations in potential lake stratification and the chemical mechanisms occurring in different seasons therefore this study supplements the knowledge about long time abandoned nearly 100 years shallow and unremediated metal mining lakes preliminary results of this research were published by konsencjusz et al 2012b and are extended and interpreted in more detail here the goal of this paper is to characterize chemical processes understand vertical spatial changes in the lakes chemistry and answer whether these changes fit seasonal patterns 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area colorful lakes near the village of wieściszowice formerly rohnau poland is a common name for a set of four abandoned mining lakes located in the rudawy landscape park and rudawy janowickie natura 2000 area fig 1 around the lakes the 3 ha large area has been intensively transformed by historical opencast and underground mining of pyrite performed from the end of the 18th to the beginning of the 20th century after mining and sulfuric acid production ceased in 1925 pietryga 1962 the mienica and its tributaries rdzawy potok rusty brook formerly ockerbach and several unnamed streams flooded the mine excavations and four artificial lakes formed yellow purple blue and green periodical all these lakes are situated in the lower part of the wielka kopa 871 m a s l formerly scharlachberg at an altitude of 560 730 m a s l fig 2 the higher parts of wielka kopa blue lake are dominated by coniferous pine spruce forests with a small admixture of deciduous trees while at lower altitudes purple lake and yellow lake deciduous trees with a high proportion of birch dominate meaning that more leaves are in the brooks and lakes and settle to the bottom where they decompose green lake also known as green pond black lake was created during the gustav grube mine excavation fig 3 which started operation in 1796 this lake is located at an altitude of 730 m a s l and appears rarely only after intense rainfall usually it dries out quickly disappearing again for many years during the 2011 and 2012 sampling campaigns this lake was dry and therefore could not be sampled blue lake also known as emerald turquoise azure formerly grüner see is a remnant of the abandoned neues glück mine which started operation in 1793 located at an altitude of 635 m a s l the lake is 150 m long 30 50 m wide and 7 8 m deep there are two old adits in its close vicinity the first one 45 m long and partially flooded while the other one is only about 10 m long purple lake also known as orange or red lake is another remnant of the hoffnung mine at an altitude of 560 m a s l this lake has dimensions of about 430 110 m a highly variable shoreline and its depth depends substantially on rainfall ranging from 0 5 to 3 m around the lake the height of rock faces measured from the water level reaches 30 150 m moreover there is a former currently flooded mine gallery with a length of 132 m a width of 1 5 m and a height of 1 7 m yellow lake also known as yellow pond is in the oldest and northern part of the hoffnung mine which started mining in 1785 berg 1913a 1913b fedak and lindner 1966 jaskólski 1964 krajewski 1949 nielubowicz 1958 nielubowicz and jaskólski 1957 this lake is located at an altitude of 560 m a s l and formed between the mined heaps about 20 years ago after heavy rainfall rainwater draining from the hill slopes filles it with yellowish water greatly depending on the amount of rain its depth ranges between 0 5 and 4 m in dry low precipitation years the lake disappears and leaves an indistinguishable depression from its surroundings for none of the lakes or streams hydrographs exist so that precipitation flow relationships can currently not be provided this also holds true for bathymetric data about the lakes hydrological hydrogeological and detailed meteorological studies in the area around the lakes could not be found in the published literature in principle the hydrogeological conditions of the rudawy janowickie can be considered similar to those in other crystalline massifs of the sudetes marszałek 1996 staśko 2010 groundwater occurs in three depth zones within a weathering cover in the upper part of the fractured crystalline rocks in deeper fractured rocks and the deep tectonic faults these zones are often connected with each other but can also form independent and isolated hydrodynamic systems mickiewicz and marszałek 2016 the first zone from which the lakes water supply originates is related to a porous fissured aquifer composed of the weathering zone of fissures with a saprolite up to 25 30 m thick it is recharged by precipitation and melting snow in general the fracture density was observed to decreases with depth pumping tests identified that the hydraulic conductivity of the fissured zone is low and amounts to 0 08 0 1 m d 1 on average marszałek and wąsik 2005 springs draining hard rocks discharge mostly from 0 1 to 1 0 l s marszałek and wąsik 2001 various geological studies were conducted around wieściszowice with initial scientific activities primarily related to mineral exploitation dating to the 18th century when pyrite deposits were found fechner 1900 three separate mines were established there at that time fig 3 the hoffnung mine in 1785 the neues glück mine in 1793 and the gustav grube mine in 1796 fechner 1900 subsequent geological research related to an attempt to resume sulfide mining after the world wars but exploitation was finally abandoned first publications in the 20th century were conducted by german geologists and subsequently by polish ones petrascheck 1933 schneiderhöhn 1958 exploitation concerned only pyrite the source of raw material for sulfuric acid production and lasted continuously until 1923 closure of the mine and 1925 closure of the ore processing plants aleksandrowski 2003 fedak and lindner 1966 kądziołko hofmokl et al 1998 kryza et al 1995 kryza and mazur 1995 mayer et al

unit which is made up of metabasites and gneisses fig 4 and has been described in several publications numerous geologists using geochemical and isotopic analyses have also studied the tectonic position origin of metamorphic rocks and the geological age of rocks belonging to the rudawy janowickie mountains kryza and mazur 1995 generally the metamorphic part of the karkonosze izera massif has been interpreted as a succession of four structural units fig 4 the izera kowary the ješted the southern karkonosze and the leszczyniec units mazur and aleksandrowski 2001 the metaigneous leszczyniec unit is located in the uppermost position of the karkonosze izera massif s structural units this formation is composed of fine grained schistose and medium grained massive metabasites as well as metagranites felsic gneisses and metadiorites hornblende gneisses the latter two forming several large igneous bodies within the metabasites oberc dziedzic et al 2011 in the northern part of the leszczyniec unit near wieściszowice the metaigneous rocks are accompanied by pyrite bearing schists representing the only metasedimentary rocks in that unit jaskólski 1964 all the remaining rocks are a mineralogically variable series of quartz sericite chlorite schists kryza and mazur 1995 the pyrite bearing sericite chlorite schists spread over a length of 4 km from the kowary pass through czarnów to wieściszowice on the surface they outcrop from about 200 m south of wieściszowice up to wielka kopa gradually wedging out and disappearing with the colorful lakes being in this zone fig 4 three 5 12 m thick zones of high quality pyrite ore were found during exploitation nielubowicz 1958 and further research found that the central zone is the richest part of the deposit parafiniuk and siuda 2006 on average the deposit s pyrite concentrations were 10 reaching 30 in some locations oberc dziedzic et al 2011 parafiniuk et al 2016 petrascheck 1933 piestrzyński and salamon 1977 teisseyre 1973 based on the literature the main ore mineral is pyrite besides chalcopyrite tennantite galena pyrrhotite arsenopyrite marcasite sphalerite boulangerite jamesonite bournonite tetrahedrite limonite and siderite balcerzak et al 1992 on these rocks and in the heaps a weathering zone with a wide range of secondary efflorescent minerals formed among these are components of the pyritic shale quartz sericite chlorite secondary minerals illite kaolinite goethite balcerzak et al 1992 parafiniuk 1996 1991 parafiniuk et al 2016 2010 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 and a rich paragenesis of secondary sulfate minerals melanterite fibroferrite copiapite pickeringite slavíkite epsomite alunogen and gypsum balcerzak et al 1992 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 uzarowicz et al 2012 2011 2008 geochemical research showed that intense pyrite weathering in the abandoned excavations and heaps resulted in a specific geochemical environment and the creation of a local hydrogeochemical anomaly parafiniuk and siuda 2006 commonly referred to as acid rock drainage ard due to this highly acidic environment and well developed ard and amd also schwertmannite precipitates were found balcerzak et al 1992 costa et al 2021 parafiniuk 1996 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 uzarowicz et al 2012 2011 2008 relating to the weathering processes in the oxidation zone of the wieściszowice pyrite bearing shale the surrounding rocks control the chemistry of the water and weathering products balcerzak et al 1992 mining resulted in the rocks disintegration increasing the thickness of the aeration and oxidation zone as well as the water ingress and consequently the weathering process iron di sulfide oxidation releases iron and chalcophile metals protons and sulfate turning the water and environment acidic consequently further geochemical reactions in the weathering zone intensify the hydrolytic breakdown of additional minerals balcerzak et al 1992 being responsible for the characteristic chemical composition of the lakes water 2 2 isotopes until present no publication dealt with isotopic research about the colorful lakes from general studies it is known that sulfate is not subject to isotopic exchange processes and therefore the sulfur isotopic composition is only determined by its origin and redox reactions which are primarily controlled by the biosphere clark and fritz 1999 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 consequently δ34s so4 2 results from the isotopic composition of sulfate from different sources each source has its distinct isotopic characteristic as well as isotopic fractionation factor related to the transition of sulfur to different oxidation states with the largest variations resulting from kinetic effects accompanying the biochemical cycling of sulfur krouse and grinienko 1991 the most relevant process modifying the sulfate isotopic composition is bacterial sulfate reduction which enriches the heavier sulfate isotope 34s because sulfate reducing bacteria prefer the light sulfur isotope 32s jędrysek 2002 kendall and mcdonnell 1998 sulfur fractionation is also associated with photosynthetic reduction of sulfate by plants during the incorporation of sulfur into the amino acid structures kendall and mcdonnell 1998 plants preferentially use 32s but the isotopic effect is less pronounced as in bacterial sulfate reduction mandernack et al 2000 even considered negligible by some authors fritz et al 1989 similarly the sulfate oxygen isotopic composition in lacustrine water predominantly depends on biological processes sulfate reduction and reoxidation of reduced sulfur in spite of a slow rate of thermodynamic isotopic exchange between sulfate and water δ18o so4 2 is clearly related to δ18o h2o this relationship results from the equilibrium isotopic exchange of sulfate oxygen with water oxygen during bacterial sulfate reduction in cells dso₄2 h₂o 25 brunner et al 2005 this process is bidirectional and can accompany the reduction of sulfate to sulfide and subsequently their reoxidation an isotopic equilibrium is therefore reached between sulfate oxygen and water oxygen during these gradual successive transformations thus δ18o so4 2 results from the water isotopic composition the equilibrium oxygen isotopic fractionation factor in the system the kinetic isotopic effect that occurs during reoxidation of reduced sulfur phases and the ratio of the rate of sulfate reduction to the rate of their re formation during oxidation processes schiff et al 2005 during sulfate formation water oxygen or molecular oxygen dissolved in the water are used as oxygen sources δ18o of the formed sulfate therefore depends on the ratio of water oxygen and the oxygen from dissolved molecular oxygen both of which are a function of the available dissolved oxygen the type of enzymes catalyzing the oxidation reaction and eh ph and temperature carmody et al 1998 2 3 methods sampling in the colorful lakes was performed twice on 2011 09 29 and 2012 06 20

investigations were conducted with spss 27 using the methods discussed in each individual section phreeqc 3 6 2 parkhurst and appelo 2013 with the phreeqc dat database was used to conduct chemical thermodynamic modeling of the colorful lakes mining influenced water all the parameters that can be calculated with this database were included in the solution spread input file concentrations under the detection limit were used with half of the detection limit 3 results 3 1 general it can clearly be seen that the water in the three lakes is either in the fe or in the al buffer range table 1 and according to the furtak and langguth 1965 classification all sampled waters are of the normal earth alkaline with prevailing sulfate type while the blue lake with ph values from 4 9 to 5 7 shows the characteristics for water in the al buffer range with lower electrical conductivities the purple and yellow lakes with ph between 2 3 and 2 9 is in the fe buffer range and has higher electrical conductivities this characteristic influences the lakes chemistry and therefore a conclusive discussion needs to consider these differences hierarchical cluster analysis ward method using the parameters with a score above 0 5 from principal cluster analysis of all samples showed that each lake falls into its own cluster indicating that the individual chemistry of the three lakes differs statistically significantly and that they can be discussed individually appendix 2 first the physicochemical and isotopic characteristic of each individual lake and thereafter a summarizing discussion will be given principal component analysis appendix 3 showed that 74 of the water chemistry s variance is covered by the first three components 50 of the variance is in the first component which consists of the electrical conductivity mg sr so4 no3 sio2 mn the proton activity ca fe eh and some minor constituents the second component accounting for 16 of the variance is dominated by na and nh4 while the 3rd component which accounts for 8 of the variance is dominated by ba the first component is indicative of pyrite weathering and the dissolution of efflorescent minerals from the waste rock while the second component seems to be primarily indicative for rain and snow influence of the lakes waters rain and snow in the southern part of poland contains 0 3 11 4 mg l of nh4 0 6 4 3 mg l of cl and 0 6 2 5 mg l of na as well as 0 3 1 1 mg l of k błaś et al 2008 dore et al 1999 stachurski and zimka 2002 żelazny 2005 as no other source of ammonia that could correlate with na exists in the vicinity of the lakes the rain and snow source is the most likely in that case ba is abundant in the pyrite bearing host rocks with up to 786 mg kg oberc dziedzic et al 2011 and could originate from there calculation of the sample s ion balances with phreeqc showed values between 25 0 and 19 2 table 1 which are not ph dependent but show a high positive correlation with the electrical conductivity imbalance ratio between measured and calculated electrical conductivity in the blue lake the absolute values are generally lower than in the yellow and purple lakes which have lower ph values because the lab used an uncommon method to calculate the ion balances this error was not noted before the detailed analysis with phreeqc which is based on the species rather than the equivalent concentration of the individual analytes all the interpretations in this paper have been done with this imbalance in mind 3 2 blue lake samples of the blue lake table 1 fig 4 were taken at eight depths it is the deepest of the lakes and it has the lowest tds among the three lakes it has the highest ph ranging from 4 85 to 5 74 decreasing with depth the vertical distribution of selected chemical indicators is shown in figs 5 9 and in appendix 1 from the west the intermittent rdzawy potok with a discharge of 0 1 l s flows into the blue lake field observations show that the brook is fed from seepage water from waste rock heaps after snow melt or longer rainfall in june 2012 the samples were acid ph 3 17 with 2 5 times higher tds 300 mg l concentrations than the blue lake consequently most of the other parameters show also higher concentrations such as 2 5 times more so4 2 170 mg l or 4 times more ca2 29 5 mg l the largest difference was found for fetot with a more than 20 times higher concentration reaching 3 88 mg l main ion concentrations cl na k are like those of the blue lake especially in its lower parts rdzawy potok water is of the so4 ca mg type appendix 1 3 3 purple lake of all the lakes the purple lake shows the most variable shoreline and a maximum depth of 2 5 3 0 m in its center compared to the blue lake the water s mineralization is higher and acid though it has the same so4 ca mg water type table 1 the vertical distribution of selected chemical indicators is shown in fig 5 to fig 9 and in appendix 1 apart from rainwater and snowmelt the purple lake is recharged from acid mine water discharging from the abandoned mine adit ph ranged from 2 3 to 2 7 tds from 2180 to 1960 mg l and fetot from 20 mg l to 97 mg l in june and september respectively all these values are in the same range as those of the lake s surface indicating a relationship between the adit and the lake water 3 4 yellow lake yellow lake is the shallowest of the three lakes with the smallest water volume chemically the lake s water is similar to the purple lake and it is also of the so4 ca mg type table 1 as well as acid 2 25 2 9 fig 6 with tds concentrations in the range of 1236 1384 mg l fig 7 the vertical distribution of selected chemical indicators is shown in fig 5 to fig 9 and in appendix 1 3 5 isotopic composition 3 5 1 blue lake results from the blue lake show seasonal variations of the so4 2 concentrations δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 fig 10 table 2 source of the so4 2 in this lake is mainly surface runoff containing sulfate and oxidized organic sulfur while sulfate originating from direct oxidation of pyrite commonly found in dispersed form in the adjacent rock formations and spoil tips is missing so4 2 from direct pyrite oxidation would be characterized by negative δ34s so4 2 values ranging from about 4 5 to about 3 5 and in extreme cases up to 15 balcerzak et al 1992 but was not observed in the vicinity of the colored lakes it can therefore be assumed that the so4 2 in the lakes originates from sulfide oxidation in the adjacent spoil tips surrounding this water body such processes were found in the oxidation zone of pyrite bearing shales near wieściszowice mandernack et al 2000 in september 2011 compared to june 2012 lower concentrations of so4 2 as well as smaller differences in δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 were found in september 2011 with lower rainfall and therefore probably lower surface runoff less so4 2 discharged into the lake in june 2012 higher rainfall was recorded and increasing surface runoff of oxidized sulfur species into the lake caused a small increase in the so4 2 concentrations this runoff probably activated an additional so4 2 source and hence the greater differences in δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 results of the so4 2 oxygen and sulfur isotopic composition from the rdzawy potok shows a twice as high so4 2 concentration compared to the lake no depth dependency was observed for the so4 2 concentrations δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 which is an evidence of mixing and more or less no stratification in this lake results of the oxygen and hydrogen isotopes show small variations in september 2011 confirming one main supply source into the lake fig 13 larger variations of the isotopic composition were found in june 2012 no relationship between depth and δ2h h2o or δ18o h2o could be observed confirming a good mixing processes with respect to δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 3 5 2 purple lake sulfate concentrations as well as δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 showed seasonal variations fig 11 and correlations between the sulfate concentrations δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 with r2 between 0 6 and 0 7 in september 2011 a larger span of the sulfate concentrations occurred but very small variations in δ34s so4 2 and δ18o so4 2 at the same time it can be assumed that oxidation of reduced organic sulfur occurred accompanied by an increase in sulfate concentration without changing the isotopic composition krouse and grinienko 1991 this process was most intensive above the sediment because the largest amount of organic matter is accumulated in the bottom sediment in june 2012 a negative correlation between the sulfate concentration and δ34s so4 2 exists indicating bacterial sulfate reduction this leads to the accumulation of the heavy sulfur isotope as sulfate reducing bacteria prefer to process the lighter sulfur isotope 32s cook and olive 2012 noyhouzer et al 2018 simultaneously the sulfate concentration decreases in the purple lake a correlation between depth and δ2h h2o as well as δ18o h2o exists fig 13 shifting δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o to more negative values both in june 2012 and september 2011 one of the main processes driving changes in δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o is evaporation indicated by the heavier samples near the lake s surface with increasing depth the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition was shifted towards negative values such a situation was found for both sampling periods with a similar trend the main process driving the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic composition in the pond is evaporation the greatest impoverishment in the light isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen was found in the samples collected from the pond surface the surface evaporation process loses its importance and at a depth of 2 5 m the isotopic composition of δ2h h2o δ18o h2o is similar to that of the adit it can therefore be inferred that the adit is one of the main sources supplying this lake which can also be seen by the chemical similarity of adit and lake surface water in both sampling periods 3 5 3 yellow lake seasonal changes of sulfate concentrations and δ34s so4 2 as well as δ18o so4 2 could also be observed for the yellow lake fig 12 a strong negative correlation r2 0 99 for september 2011 and r2 0 93 for june 2012 exists for δ34s so4 2 vs sulfate concentrations for both sets of samples bacterial sulfate reduction seems to occur being less prominent in september 2011 compared to june 2012 where larger variations of δ34s so4 2 exist as in the purple lake δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o is controlled by evaporation but with different intensities fig 13 in september 2011 δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o variations were small and no depth correlation existed indicating a low evaporation and mixing in june 2012 evaporation was more intense affecting the isotopic fractionation and resulting in an enrichment of heavier isotopes in the upper lake water body disappearing with depth the depth correlation of δ2h h2o and δ18o h2o indicates an absence of mixing in the lake 3 6 chemical thermodynamic calculations most of the normally relevant phases in mine water calculated by phreeqc are undersaturated in relation to the lakes water appendix 4 this result is similar to that of dobrzyński 1995 who used wateq4f for his calculations very likely this undersaturation results from both the missing concentrations of the chemical analysis and a relatively short reaction time between the efflorescent salts in the abandoned mines waste rock and the precipitation therefore only for a selected range controlling phases can be defined controlling phases in the blue lake are al oh 3 a barite and fe oh 3 a for al ba and fe and chalcedony quartz and sio2 for the silica for al this differs from dobrzyński 1995 who identified alohso4 respectively jurbanite alohso4 5h2o as the controlling phase a reason for this potential discrepancy is the different thermodynamic databases used in both cases in the purple and yellow lakes controlling phases are anhydrite and gypsum for the sulfate barite for ba and chalcedony and sio2 for silica these controlling phases do not explain the whole lakes chemical composition but all other phases show a high undersaturation including calcite si 4 to 7 and dolomite si 7 to 13 what can clearly be seen is that the species distribution and the saturation indices in the three lakes show a pattern which allows to differentiate between the various mining influenced lake waters in the purple and the yellow lake the si in the three depths are similar respectively while in the blue lake the si shows a slight stratification with a trend to lower si with increasing depths for most of the relevant phases possibly indicating evaporation exceptions to this stratification are the sulfate phases anhydrite gypsum and celestine as well as the silicate phases which have a similar si throughout the water column all the carbonate phases aragonite calcite dolomite and rhodochrosite show different behaviors in the september and the june sampling while the si increases in september it decreases in june these results show that the smaller lakes are very likely connected with each other which can already be seen by the similar chemistry and the fact that the cluster analysis groups them into the same cluster comparing the si of the two influents into the lakes it becomes obvious that the same si distribution prevails for the purple and yellow lakes including their inflow rdzawy potok shows the si signature for the acidic waters but is quickly buffered once it flows into the blue lake with some of the si increasing e g al oh 3 a fe oh 3 a jarosite k gibbsite others decreasing e g anhydrite gypsum melanterite this indicates precipitation and mixing reactions occurring once the brook water enters the blue lake investigating the species calculated by phreeqc shows that in all three lakes and the three inflows so4 2 dominates followed by ca2 fig 14 in the blue lake the next dominating species are h4sio2 and mg2 all other species in the blue lake contribute to a smaller degree to the total water s chemistry between the september and the june samples of the blue lake there is a difference in the concentration of no3 and hco3 with a higher concentration of hco3 resulting from either carbonate dissolution or evapo concentration in september and a higher concentration of no3 in june the latter possibly resulting from precipitation though the si for the yellow and purple lakes were similar this is not the case for the species distribution h4sio4 concentrations in these acid lakes become less while the typical amd phases of al and fe show up purple lake shows a stratification with increasing concentrations with depth while the yellow lake seems to be better mixed just showing small variations between the sampling campaigns in case of the purple lake which is fed by the mine drainage from the adit one can see that a evaporation increases the concentrations of the species and b the tds increase with depth discussed above and results mainly from the so4 2 and ca2 species thought the inflow into the blue lake has si similar to the acid lakes the species distribution of the inflow is similar to the blue lake s species distribution indicating that the water in this lake is mainly fed by the inflow and unlikely by additional ground water sources 3 7 species and controlling processes based on the predominance eh ph diagrams predominance or pourbaix diagrams are eh ph diagrams that help to understand the predominant species in an analyzed water sample and potential reactions occurring in the system pourbaix 1966 vanloon and duffy 2011 fig 15 though some authors question the usefulness of redox measurements in systems with low concentrations e g nordstrom and munoz 1994 they can be applied in systems where higher concentrations of redox couples such as fe exist in case of the colorful lakes the al and so4 diagrams were plotted based on the average sample chemistry of all the sampled waters whilst the fe diagrams are based on the average of the individual lake essays based on the results of the phreeqc modeling four representative pourbaix diagrams for various activities of al so4 2 and fe were constructed at 17 c and 101 3 hpa fig 15 al in the blue lake the eh and ph falls into the gibbsite field which explains the lower concentrations of al in the blue lake and its ph in the al buffer range fig 15 a this means that the al concentration in the blue lake is controlled by gibbsite precipitation as already could be seen earlier fig 6 the ph decreases with depth while the eh is relatively stable the eh differences between the june and september samples can be neglected as eh measurements show a methodological error of 50 mv no controlling al phases can be seen in the purple and yellow lakes nor the inflows which explains why the al concentrations in these water samples are between 7 and 26 times higher than in the blue lake mine water from rdzawy potok seems to be buffered and mixes with lower mineralized surface water once it flows into the blue lake so 4 as expected most of the sulfate predominates as the so4 2 species fig 15 b which was already shown by the phreeqc chemical thermodynamic calculations only the purple and blue lake samples with a lower ph and higher eh fall into the feso4 field resulting from the high fe concentrations in these two lakes compared to the blue lake fe fe speciation highly depends on the concentrations of the fe and so4 in the system garrels and christ 1966 to interpret the processes in the three lakes therefore requires two eh ph diagrams in the blue lake fig 15 c fe concentrations are controlled by the precipitation of the fe oxyhydrates in the form of ochre which can be seen by the coloration of the sediments seasonal depth variation play a minor role because all the measured eh and ph values fall into the fe oh 3 ppd phase field in case of the purple and yellow lakes fig 15 d with higher fe and so4 concentrations and lower ph values no carbonates buffer the water therefore the ph stays in the fe buffer range which can be seen by the more or less similar ph values in each of the two sampling campaigns with more or less no depth dependency as in the blue lake the controlling phase is still the fe oh 3 ppd indicated by the parallel course of the sampling dots with the boarder of the predominance field two different behaviors can be recognized for the adits and rdzawy potok the adit water gets oxidized and increases its redox potential while its ph stays stable as no reactions occur which could lower the ph through hydrolysis because of the similar ph of the adit and lake waters fe oh 3 ppd might again be assumed as the controlling phase for this water once the adit water enters the lake it contributes substantially to the lake s chemistry for rdzawy potok the situation differs it is quickly buffered once it flows into the blue lake and increases in its ph value while the redox potential does not change 4 discussion and conceptual model blue lake has the highest altitude and is in an area where mining was deeper but less extensive leaving steep banks and small heaps above the pit it is recharged primarily by rdzawy potok throughout the year and periodically by precipitation and snowmelt diluting the tds derived by the stream infiltration waters flow through a thin weathered zone with a low hydraulic conductivity balcerzak et al 1992 costa et al 2021 marszałek and wąsik 2001 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 and through some heaps resulting in minor pyrite oxidation fig 16 the brook water has a low mineralization primarily resulting from so4 2 ca and mg isotope results indicate that sulfate in the lake originates from the advanced oxidation of sulfide to sulfate in the heaps surrounding the reservoir and not from immediate pyrite weathering decomposition of organic matter seems to be an additional source of sulfur especially during the spring june 2012 sampling after entering the lake rdzawy potok s water is mixed through the entire profile to a depth of about 8 m which results in a lack of vertical variability in the lake s chemical composition and which can be seen by the similar species distribution in both the lake and rdzawy potok fig 14 none of the three results neither the chemical composition nor the isotopes or the chemical thermodynamic modeling give indication to a relevant evaporation contribution which might be due to the lakes higher elevation and lower sun exposure purple lake is located at a lower altitude is only 3 m deep and its southern shore is flattened it is for most of the year fed by the neues glück adit which drains the eastern part of the hills at a flow rate of 0 1 0 3 l s fig 17 during the dryer season september 2011 mainly from september to november the adit is commonly dry and its chemical evolution which is controlled by processes in the mined rocks has been described in earlier publications balcerzak et al 1992 costa et al 2021 marszałek and wąsik 2001 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 mine water discharging from the adit has a low ph 2 38 2 88 and a high concentration of so4 2 ca2 and fetot with little variability in the two datasets except fetot which has 5 times higher concentrations in june compared to september this mine water is the main source for purple lake with additional ions including h so4 2 fetot ca2 originating from seepage water from the surrounding mine dumps as could be shown by chemical thermodynamic modeling the species composition in this lake is similar to the mine water but substantially different from that in the blue lake fig 14 evaporation contributes substantially to the lakes chemical composition and its vertical variation as good sun exposure extent and a shallow depth result in a higher surface evaporation compared to blue lake it is higher in the 2nd half of the year summer and autumn this results in solution concentration an increase in its density and a slow flow towards the bottom where a twofold increase in mineralization and so4 2 with very high fetot concentrations are recorded as indicated by the isotopic results during spring and summer a process associated with bacterial sulfate reduction occurs throughout the water column resulting in an enrichment in the heavy sulfur isotope later in the year the oxidation process of reduced organic sulfur plays a dominant role increasing the waters sulfate concentration substantially yellow lake is the smallest of the three pit lakes and because it is very close to purple lake in an identical geological setting it can be assumed that the processes controlling the lake s chemistry are very similar there is no inflow of mine drainage and the feed comes mainly from precipitation and infiltration through the weathered zone of the wielka kopa rocks and through numerous mining residues occurring to its north and west fig 18 this can be seen by lower ph values and 5 6 times higher fetot concentrations in june 2012 when snowmelt supplies the lake with dissolved efflorescent salts due to its poor sun exposure evaporation is less intense throughout the year which is evident by the lower mineralization compared to purple lake fig 14 but in spring june it is higher compared to autumn september in deeper parts of the lake the dominant process seems to be bacterial reduction of sulfate occurring under conditions with lower oxygen availability 5 conclusions though the wieściszowice colorful lakes are unique for the sudetes mountains due to the outcrop of the pyrite bearing shists this research extends the knowledge about processes controlling the chemical composition of shallow post mining lakes in humic meteorogical conditions and di sulfide containing rocks until now research there focused mainly on determining the relevant processes controlling the chemical composition of the water resulting from water rock interaction and the associated phase transformations of the minerals costa et al 2021 parafiniuk and dobrzyński 1995 a second research focus was the influence of efflorescent salts on the water chemistry of the brooks flowing in the rdzawy potok valley wąsik and wasowski 2015 past pit lakes studies have been limited to samples collected near the banks which restricts characterization of spatio temporal developments in the pit lake water strata in case of the colorful lakes this study for the first time also included isotope samples this investigation therefore determined the spatio temporal variability of water chemistry and isotopic composition sampling took place during the wetter season june 2012 which includes the winter and spring months when snowfall and snowmelt occur and the dryer season september 2011 which includes the summer and autumn months with low precipitation and high temperatures associated with insolation the results indicate that each of the three pit lakes should be considered separately although the general course of processes is similar there is an obvious difference in the pit lakes chemical composition resulting from different natural and anthropogenic factors affecting the geochemical conditions of each lake these similarities result from the inflow water flowing through the weathered mining residues leaching the efflorescent salts originating from pyrite and rock weathering based on these results and discussions it can be concluded that only when spatio temporal samples assisted by isotope investigations are taken and the chemical thermodynamic conditions are studied investigations of small historical mine pit lakes provide full insight into the relevant processes future studies of the colorful lakes should sample the waters monthly and measure the flow rates in rdzawy potok and the adits regularly to allow for an overall mass balance of the processes occurring in the lakes and the surrounding brooks installing a weather station might improve the conclusions that can be drawn funding the research work was co funded with the kghm cuprum r d centre ltd internal research grant no 571 01 0006 0 o 11 0008 002 and a

8126,study region during 2013 2019 we conducted a canada wide program of streamflow sampling for the analysis of stable isotopic composition 18o 16o and 2h 1h providing the first comprehensive survey for gauged watersheds across canada ranging from 10 to 10 000 km2 a watershed based assessment of vapour and runoff partitioning is presented for 103 watersheds across a diverse range of climate and land cover types spanning 25 latitude and 86 longitude study focus an isotope based methodology is applied to estimate evaporation inflow e i and transpiration evapotranspiration t et utilizing offset between isotope values in streamflow and precipitation augmented by regional climate reanalysis data isotopic enrichment in streamflow serves to differentiate direct abiotic evaporation mainly arising from open water evaporation from lakes and wetlands from transpiration by natural vegetation and cropland which has previously been recognized as principally non fractionating sensitivity analysis suggests only a minor influence of interception losses on t et new hydrological insights for the region systematic variations in evaporation losses transpiration losses and gauged runoff are revealed across the major hydrometric regions of canada calculations suggest that e i ranged from 2 to 60 while t et ranged from 25 to greater than 95 across the watersheds a new water loss classification is introduced which reveals that 19 of 103 watersheds were runoff dominated 54 were transpiration dominated 5 were evaporation dominated and 27 had more than one dominant water loss mechanism keywords

including many representative cold regions watersheds with mean annual temperatures ranging from 7 to 7 c one of the prevalent isotopic signals noted in river discharge across canada is evaporation often immediately detected when data are plotted in δ18o δ2h space owing to isotopic signatures that fall below the meteoric water line gibson et al 2020 the evaporation process is known to cause

water interface horita et al 2008 evaporation may occur as water flows along river channels gremillion and wanielista 2000 gibson et al 2008a although such influences are often subordinate to evaporative signals inherited from lakes and wetlands residing within the watershed as these water bodies typically have much longer residence times and cover a higher percentages of surface area

canada s landmass underlain by crystalline precambrian shield bedrock previous studies in arid climate zones have also shown appreciable evaporative enrichment of heavy isotopic species in soil porewaters although such labelling is often realized only in dry bare soils allison et al 1983 barnes and allison 1988 dry bare soil areas are most often disconnected or intermittently connected to river networks and presumably are less likely to be a sustained or prevalent source of heavy isotope enriched water in river discharge gibson et al 2008b here we apply isotopic enrichment in streamflow to better understand the underlying mechanisms associated with vapour loss across a broad range of climate zones within canada utilizing the newly available 18o and 2h dataset as compared to precipitation isotope data and recent canadian isoscape modelling efforts delavau et al 2015 vapour loss mechanisms including canopy interception evaporation from soil evaporation from wet surfaces

continents li et al 2019 as coupling of the water and carbon cycles by co2 uptake and vapour release during photosynthesis is linked only to plant mediated transpiration telmer and veizer 2000 a number of ecohydrology studies have proposed significant advantages for independent characterization or separation of transpiration from the bulk evapotranspiration flux including better understanding of responses to individual drivers schleisinger and jasechko 2014 several advantages include validation and improvement of ecosystem models shichun et al 2010 sutanto et al 2012 li et al 2019

environmental stressors li et al 2019 and overall for better understanding of land atmospheric interactions related to land use drought and climate change berg and sheffield 2019 several techniques employed for et partitioning at the plot to ecosystem scale include stable isotope methods sap flow eddy covariance and modelling isotope based methods make use of the fact that evaporation and transpiration differently fractionate the stable isotopes of water kool et al 2014 although they may be costly and labour intensive often requiring diurnal leaf water measurements watershed based partitioning of evaporation and transpiration relying on isotopic enrichment in river discharge has also been employed as was initially demonstrated by gibson et al 1993 and subsequently applied in a number of large river basin studies telmer and veizer 2000 lee and veizer 2003 ferguson et al 2007 notably ferguson and veizer 2007 show a comparison of results for 15 large watersheds in the americas africa australia and new guinea including discussion of implications for the net primary productivity and the global carbon cycle an informative review of the approach within the context of global water and carbon cycle research is provided by schulte et al 2011 jasechko et al 2013 extended application of the method to partition evapotranspiration for 73 large lake basins thereby assembling a perspective on the global significance of transpiration for land surfaces while jasechko et al 2013 concluded that transpiration may account for 80 90 of global evapotranspiration from the continents this assertion was subsequently challenged based on contentions regarding uncertainty propagation of the method coenders gerrits et al 2014 uncertainties regarding global interception estimates coenders gerrits et al 2014 schleisinger and jasechko 2014 as well as representativeness of applying lake isotopic signals to represent entire catchment areas owing to hydrological decoupling schlaepfer et al 2014 while representativeness plays a deterministic role in all isotope based investigations particularly at the large scale many other criticisms of the method have since been rebuked or explained jasechko et al 2014a nevertheless recent field scale tests of the method have shown more optimistic results hu et al 2018 in extending a similar approach to watersheds situated in 10 hydrometric regions across canada we illustrate refinements in methodology and implications of systematic variations across a range of hydroclimatic conditions for watersheds draining to the atlantic pacific and arctic oceans overall our hypothesis is that extent of open water and wetlands in watersheds will be the dominant drivers of evaporation losses whereas forest cover type and cropland will be the dominant driver of transpiration losses the main objectives of this paper are to evaluate a watershed based isotope mass balance approach for characterizing vapour partitioning mechanisms in a diverse range of hydrological regimes across canada to evaluate systematic influence of land cover characteristics on vapour partitioning mechanisms and to demonstrate a novel classification framework for watersheds based on dominant water loss mechanisms challenges limitations and implications for future research and monitoring in canada are also discussed 2 methods 2 1 study sites of 331 gauging stations within the isotope sampling program operated by water survey of canada 162 stations met our criteria to enable reliable estimation of flow weighted isotopic compositions see gibson et al 2020 2021 a total of 103 of these stations were used in the vapour partitioning vp analysis presented here table 1 fig 1 for these vp stations streamflow was found to be heavy isotope enriched relative to long term precipitation and so were amenable to a first order quantification of evaporation losses using a simple analytical isotope enrichment model the remainder of stations 61 were not used in this preliminary assessment owing to i significant content of water sources in streamflow other than modern precipitation i e glacier melt glaciogenic groundwater reflux or permafrost thaw ii uncertainty in the prediction or interpolation of long term precipitation isotope values for some remote or poorly monitored areas and or iii long residence times or storage lag effects in some watersheds resulting in a disconnect between the precipitation isotope input and streamflow response 2 2 isotope composition of streamflow oxygen 18 18o and deuterium 2h isotopic composition of streamflow was determined from measurement of water samples collected at flow gauging stations operated by the water survey of canada details of the streamflow network and sampling protocols have been described previously gibson et al 2020 2021 water samples were analyzed using a thermo scientific delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were analyzed on separate subsamples with oxygen determined by equilibration using a gasbench paul and skrzypek 2006 and hydrogen determined by injection of water on hot chromium using an h device reactor brand et al 1996 internal standards were selected that bracketed the dataset i e δ18o δ2h 1 27 39 213 6 2 3 88 17 2 3 9 81 72 1 results are reported in δ notation in permil relative to

relative humidity were extracted from the north america regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 long term basin weighted values of climate parameters were obtained by averaging all grid centered narr datapoints falling within the specified watersheds of interest 2 4 isotopic characterization of precipitation atmospheric water vapour and discharge isotopic composition of precipitation was estimated from time series ensembles 2013 2019 using a modified version of the model of delavau et al 2015 that included δ2h for all north american regional reanalysis narr coordinates falling within the canadian landmass from which climate data were extracted the regression based model relies mainly on monthly data collected within the canadian network for isotopes in precipitation cnip birks and gibson 2009 the united states network for isotopes in precipitation usnip welker 2012 and global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea wmo 2014 amount weighted annual values for δ18o in precipitation were calculated as the dot product of the sequence of monthly isotopic values and precipitation amounts divided by the total precipitation basin weighted averages were calculated by arithmetically averaging all grid centered narr datapoints falling within a watershed isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapour was estimated using the precipitation equilibrium assumption gibson et al 2008b 1 δ a δ p ε α where ε is the equilibrium water vapour isotope separation horita and wesolowski 1994 and α decimal notation is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation where these quantities are related by ε 10 3 α 1 to account for seasonally variable conditions under which evaporation takes place the exchange terms in eq 1 were evaluated on a monthly time step and evaporation flux weighted for each grid centered narr datapoint this was calculated as the dot product of the sequence of monthly δa outputs from eq 1 and monthly evaporation divided by the total evaporation similar calculations were made to calculate the effective annual evaporation temperature and relative humidity at 2 m atmospheric height for each grid centered narr datapoint basin weighted parameters were then estimated by arithmetically averaging all narr datapoints within a watershed of interest isotope composition of discharge was flow weighted and calculated as the dot product of the isotopic composition of δ18o and instantaneous flow at the time of sampling divided by the mean flow an equivalent calculation was used to flow weight δ2h 2 5 water yield storage effects and interception annual water yields were calculated for each watershed based on daily flow gauging records and reflect the mean depth of gauged streamflow from the watersheds of interest due to the use of long term average climatic and hydrologic parameters watershed storage effects were assumed to approach zero interception estimates were obtained from the global land evaporation model gleam version 3 1 www gleam eu miralles et al 2010 and were basin weighted according to the methodology used for the narr datasets 2 6 isotope mass balance the isotopic data from the vp stations 103 in total were analyzed to estimate the fraction of water loss by evaporation e i from the watersheds and the transpired vapour fraction i e transpiration total evapotranspiration t et the methodology of gibson et al 2015 2016b 2017 2018 2019 was used in the calculations but was adapted to be suitable for application to watersheds rather than lakes a similar approach but with simplifications was used by ferguson et al 2007 for the great plains region of north america and by gibson et al 2002b 2010 for lakes in western canada evaporation inflow for the watersheds was estimated as follows 2 e i δ i δ q δ e δ q dimensionless where δ i δ q and δ e are the isotopic compositions of inflow streamflow and evaporate respectively the latter evaluated from the craig and gordon 1965 model given by 3 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where h is relative humidity decimal fraction δ a is isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapour and ε k is the kinetic isotopic separation see horita et al 2008 as noted by gibson et al 2016b substitution of δ e from eq 3 into eq 2 yields 4 e i δ l δ i m δ δ l dimensionless where 5 m h 10 3 ε k ε α 1 h 10 3 ε k dimensionless and 6 δ h δ a ε k ε α h 10 3 ε k ε α for headwater catchments or watersheds we note that inflow and its isotopic composition can be approximated by precipitation and its isotopic composition respectively by substituting δ i δ p and i p in eq 4 we define e i for a headwater catchment estimated using the isotopic approach x to be 4a x e p δ l δ p m δ δ l dimensionless the water balance of a watershed non isotopic assuming zero change in storage can also be represented by 7 p n e t q mm yr where p n e t and q are the precipitation interception evaporation transpiration and gauged discharge respectively recognizing the following i that

streamflow precipitation and vapour streamflow and estimated precipitation isotopic compositions are illustrated in dual isotope space in relation to modelled isotopic composition of water vapour sources from the 103 vapour partitioning vp watersheds across canada fig 2 the locus of precipitation values for gauged basins closely resembles thecanadian meteoric water line cmwl gibson et al 2005 2020 measured streamflow is shown to be typically heavy isotope enriched relative to precipitation falling below the cmwl fig 2 further description and discussion of river trend lines in 2h 18o space based on this canadian streamflow dataset has been provided by gibson et al 2020 the modelled isotopic values for atmospheric moisture based on the equilibrium model are depleted relative to precipitation plotting ostensibly along a subparallel extension of the meteoric water line trend the craig and gordon 1965 model used to estimate the isotopic values of evaporate from both open water and soil predicts values that plot above the meteoric water line along subparallel imbricated clusters while transpiration is expected to fall closer to values for precipitation assuming net non fractionating biotic transfer of soil water evapotranspiration is approximated as a mixture of non fractionated transpiration and open water evaporation the strong potential of isotopic labelling of vapour by evaporation from bare soils is an end member that may be important in localized agricultural areas under tillage or summer fallow jalota and prihar 1990 but likely accounts for negligible amounts of annual vapour exchange across most natural canadian landscapes differential labelling of various vapour fluxes occurs due to variations in fractionation and mixing mechanisms we note that reduced evaporation losses and reduced fractionation during liquid vapour exchange is expected under conditions where large evaporating water bodies such as large lakes influence atmospheric water vapour in the boundary layer and alter the isotopic composition of the overlying air mass in downwind areas this effect has been described in detail from an isotope mass balance assessment of the great lakes jasechko et al 2014b and for smaller lakes located in coastal areas of atlantic and pacific coastal regions of canada gibson et al 2016b 2018 while our isotope balance calculations and the simulations shown in fig 2 assume that transpiration is non fractionating over the long term on the watershed scale we acknowledge that non mobile soil water compartments within the watershed e g water held within soils below field capacity but above the wilting point may also develop periodically and may in some cases become a distinctly labelled source of transpired water consistent with the two water worlds tww hypothesis mcdonnell 2014 the tww concept which remains to be widely tested evaristo et al 2015 postulates that streams are fed by mobile soil water associated with infiltration and groundwater recharge whereas plants may primarily be tapping into non mobile soil water sources significant isotopic fractionation of non mobile waters has been observed in the unsaturated soil zone see barnes and allison 1988 with similar enrichment potential to that observed in leaf water barbour 2007 but also is known to occur to a lesser extent in shallow soils subject to evaporation or intermittently during evaporation of interception storage isotopic discrimination during plant water uptake has also been suggested as a process that can leave a large imprint on finite soil water supplies vargas et al 2017 from the watershed perspective we acknowledge that a potentially wide range of isotopic signatures may develop within non mobile soil water storages which may in some cases directly influence the isotopic composition of transpired moisture or may indirectly affect evaporative enrichment by modifying the isotopic composition of the atmospheric boundary layer in the region but because non mobile waters are generally not returned to the stream they are not significantly affecting the isotopic signals in discharge despite being important factors influencing short term conditions at the hillslope or stand level we postulate that these storages account for a negligible fraction of the annual runoff volume in most watersheds and are therefore considered less influential in modifying the isotopic signatures of streamflow evaporate and transpirate it remains to be established if tww might be a more influential control on vapour partitioning in some watersheds if similar approaches were applied in higher frequency time series sampling programs 3 2 evaporation loss and et partitioning evaporation loss e i and transpiration ratios t et were estimated based on eqs 4 and 8 respectively and are presented by hydrometric region fig 3 use of long term climate data and flow weighted averages was intended to derive values representative of long term watershed integrated fluxes comparisons were made for t et using the base case model which incorporated interception loss i e eq 8 and a simplified model without interception i e eq 9 while e i spans a range of values for watersheds within each hydrometric region systematic differences emerge from region to region largely reflecting the degree of influence of lakes and wetlands in the drainage network across each region we note that watersheds within the maritime provinces region 1 and the pacific yukon and arctic regions 8 through 10 have the lowest e i ranges varying from 3 to 15 on average as compared to hudson bay drainages regions 4 5 and 6 that have higher average e i ratios ranging from 15 to 35 and less commonly ranging up to 60 for individual watersheds great slave lake drainages region 7 are found to have wide ranging values with higher e i values up to 45 for shield drainages with abundant lakes as compared to the peace athabasca river basins which drain both mountainous and low lying wetland dominated areas and bring the regional average down to approximately 10 by comparison e i for the great lakes st lawrence watersheds as well as northern quebec and labrador are fairly restricted and in the vicinity of 20 reflecting the importance of both small and large lakes in the drainage network t et is evidently greater than 80 on average across the maritime provinces region 1 as well as great slave lake pacific yukon and arctic watersheds regions 7 8 9 10 although the arctic and great slave lake regions regions 10 and 7 respectively include watersheds with much lower t et ranging down to 40 50 due largely to the dominance of lakes and wetland areas as well as the abundance of non vegetated outcrop transpiration ratios in the hudson bay drainages regions 4 5 and 6 range from 50 to 75 whereas great lakes st lawrence and northern quebec labrador are in the 40 50 range apparently controlled mainly by the fraction of lakes and wetlands in these drainage basins while these results are a first approximation given that they can be improved by refining estimates of the flow weighted isotopic composition of the watersheds they provide important new information on the dominant vapour loss mechanism weighted over contributing areas of the watersheds we note that for watersheds with large partial or non contributing areas isotope results may not be representative of the entire watershed area but rather of the relatively smaller area contributing to flow as noted in previous studies fang et al 2010 wolfe et al 2019 muhammad et al 2019 non contributing areas occur widely in the semi arid southern prairie watersheds of the nelson river drainage region 5 and in the milk river region 11 the latter of which was not included in this assessment but is part of a transboundary isotopic assessment in progress such grassland regions with low hummocky relief are known to be frequently disconnected from higher order streams shook et al 2015 other informative examples can be drawn from semi arid regions such as the darling river basin in australia gibson et al 2008b where the main river channel was shown to be largely disconnected from its upstream contributing area except during storm events or due to diversion of river water for irrigation of crops in general the presence of partial or non contributing areas is likely to underestimate areal t et ratios for the watershed as a whole given that non connected areas of predominantly grasslands are likely to be dominated by transpiration nevertheless such isotope based estimates may compliment physically based water balance assessments helping to constrain the overall dynamic effect of non contributing areas in wet and dry years or seasons 3 3 effect of interception losses and sublimation on t et several et partitioning assessments have included estimates of canopy interception loss under controlled conditions e g sutanto et al 2012 although field based isotopic assessments have commonly encountered difficulties given that isotopic signals due to interception are non linear as water is selectively transferred to the soil following evaporation into the atmosphere and associated isotopic exchange that may be partial or complete depending on rainfall frequency duration and intensity allen et al 2017 to evaluate the importance of interception in determining transpiration ratios we compare t et results from the base case model based on a global satellite based reanalysis dataset gleam miralles et al 2010 to a version of the model that neglects interception to our knowledge no previous watershed based isotopic assessments have evaluated the effect of incorporating interception loss as shown in fig 4 we compare t et using eqs 8 and 9 but find only minor differences between the models amounting to 1 6 difference on average standard deviation of 5 from this we conclude that interception n likely has a negligible influence on watershed integrated t et estimates for canada while sublimation losses are not explicitly accounted for in this assessment we recognize that some previous studies have shown sublimation to produce enrichment of the residual snowpack leading to offset below the meteoric water line sokratov and golubev 2009 in other cases no detectable systematic isotopic changes in the residual snowpack due to sublimation were observed st amour et al 2005 with regards to our t et assessment sublimation losses would likely result in minor enrichment of streamflow where fractionation is prevalent a signal which would be incorporated within the non biotic evaporative water loss fraction and so classified here as an evaporative water loss as noted by pang et al 2019 for sites in east antarctica concurrent observations of stable isotopes in atmospheric water vapor precipitation and surface snow would be necessary to quantify net changes in the isotopic composition of surface snow due to sublimation 3 4 runoff versus vapour loss from watersheds watersheds are classified according to dominant water loss mechanisms fig 5 of the 103 watersheds examined only 19 had water losses that were runoff dominated whereas 84 were vapour dominated among vapour dominated watersheds 54 were transpiration dominated and only 5 were evaporation dominated a total of 27 watersheds were classified as mixed having more than one dominant water loss mechanism geographically the transpiration dominated watersheds are situated largely within western canada in prairie boreal plains taiga plains and montane ecoregions wiken 1986 within hydrometric regions 4 8 and 10 fig 6 runoff dominated watersheds are widely distributed across eastern canada regions 1 3 as well as within montane watersheds of western canada regions 5 8 10 evaporation dominated watersheds are the most restricted geographically being found only in boreal watersheds apparently confined to watersheds with a high degree of lake cover near the boreal prairie fringe in regions 5 and 6 mixed water loss watersheds appear to be found most commonly within the boreal taiga and central arctic tundra ecozones including treeline areas of regions 4 10 fig 6 the seal river region 6 which drains tundra wetland and forested areas of northern manitoba and southern nunavut is found to be runoff dominated which we expect is more typical of watersheds on the western shores of hudson bay it is informative to note that water loss mechanisms appear to evolve from headwaters to mouth within the largest river basins for example the 2575 km nelson river region 5 which traverses a wide range in latitude climatic zones and physiographic sub regions exhibits diverse and evolving water loss mechanisms within its sub basins runoff dominated tributaries are found in alpine headwaters of region 5 including the bow river alberta evaporation dominated tributaries are found in precambrian shield headwaters south of lake winnipeg manitoba and near lake of the woods ontario see inset fig 6 transpiration dominated tributaries are found for prairie headwaters and mixed water loss mechanisms are found for boreal watersheds including several rivers such as the souris river mossy river limestone river and odei river which carry upstream drainage in region 5 across lake rich precambrian shield terrain to hudson bay for the 4241 km mackenzie river system a similar evolution of dominant water loss mechanisms from headwaters to mouth is noted rocky mountains headwaters of the athabasca river are runoff dominated where monitored at hinton alberta whereas precambrian shield headwaters are mixed and wetland dominated watersheds along the peace athabasca mackenzie corridor are transpiration dominated in the following section we further explore water balance variations in watersheds across canada through more detailed analysis of land cover controls 3 5 land cover effects land cover characteristics for the studied watersheds was obtained from cci ls esa 2017 which differentiates 22 land cover classes globally based on the united nations land cover classification system lccs di gregorio and jansen 2000 to eliminate classes that were absent or unimportant in north america to highlight land cover characteristics considered to be influential for determining t et e i and for classification of dominant water losses a simplified set of 12 land classes was used some comprised of amalgamated cci ls classes fig 7 table s1 as transpiration is linked to photosynthesis in vascular plants whereas evaporation is linked to abiotic vapour losses i e mainly open water evaporation we hypothesize that greater percent forest cover grassland and cropland cover is likely to be associated with enhanced t et whereas surface water storage e g lakes and wetlands is likely to be associated with enhanced e i a heatmap diagram provides a test of these hypotheses fig 7 we find that t et is positively correlated with cropland in watersheds having extensive cultivation e g region 5 and positively correlated with forest cover in general although strength of the correlation among the various forest types depends on their importance within each region for example correlation between t et and deciduous forest is more robust for the maritimes region 1 whereas correlation between t et and needleleaf evergreen is more robust in boreal arctic regions of northern quebec and labrador great slave lake and the arctic regions 3 7 and 10 t et appears to be insensitive to percent shrubland and grassland presumably because these areas tend to be dominated by open water as expected e i is positively correlated with open water in all regions except the st lawrence which is fed by evaporatively enriched water from the great lakes system see jasechko et al 2014b karim et al 2008 for this reason isotopic enrichment and indicators such as e i are not a sensitive cumulative indicator of evaporation losses for the lower st lawrence watershed which was predicted for such basins by gat s 2010 river continuum model e i is positively correlated with the following land cover types i wetland cover in the hudson bay drainages regions 4 5 and 6 ii lichen moss cover in regions where it is abundant across most of northern canada regions 1 3 5 7 10 and iii open closed needleleaf evergreen in southwestern hudson bay region 4 note that lichen and mosses are non vascular and therefore respiration is accomplished by evaporation rather than transpiration price et al 2009 therefore lichen moss land cover is positively correlated with e i and negatively correlated with t et overall our general hypothesis that open water and wetlands were the dominant drivers of e i is verified and to some extent the inverse is found to be true for t et where watersheds with reduced wetland and open water generally had higher t et direct correlation between t et and various forest cover types is however found to be region specific and less systematic although patterns appear to be more predictable when both vapour and liquid water losses are considered together while we expected to detect the influence of cropland development on e i and t et in agricultural areas we were not anticipating that this effect would be quite as pronounced most notably the significant correlations between cropland cover and t et for the nelson r basin region 5 indicates that watershed management decisions may have a pronounced impact on the vapour partitioning mechanisms to further explore the effect of land cover on the dominant water loss mechanisms in watersheds across canada we applied principal components analysis pca to offer additional insight into vegetation drivers of vapour loss and runoff analogous methods have been applied to examine hydroclimatic controls on runoff gibson et al 2015 2019 and trophic status gibson et al 2016c as shown in a pca biplot fig 8 watersheds with similar vegetation characteristics cluster together with scores close to the origin reflecting near average characteristics and scores offset from the origin reflecting degree of departure from average characteristics attributable to variable loadings vectors note that subparallel loading vectors are highly correlated whereas correlation decreases in direct proportion to angle of offset between vectors culminating in perpendicularity for uncorrelated factors this allows for comparison between water balance characteristics and vegetation characteristics across the entire dataset notably we find the following i a negative correlation between e or e i versus t or t et ii lack of correlation between water yield wy and e e i t e t iii strong correlation between wy n and p iv runoff dominated watersheds are most often needleleaf evergreen but less commonly may be mixed leaf forest or contain significant areas of permanent snow and ice v p and n tend to be higher for mixed leaf forests vi transpiration dominated watersheds are most commonly cropland with secondary influences being deciduous forest and urban areas and vii mixed water loss and evaporation dominated water loss in watersheds are commonly associated with open water lichen and moss and wetlands while further work is warranted on a watershed by watershed basis to evaluate the specific effects of c3 versus c4 plant cover runoff organization elevation surface roughness groundwater surface water interactions and permafrost conditions our first approximation analysis suggests that basic land cover characteristics exert significant influence on the partitioning results time series analysis based on long term water sampling and isotope partitioning may therefore be informative for examining both climatic and land use impacts on the hydrological cycle 3 6 towards improved understanding of water and carbon cycle interactions previous watershed studies have applied isotope based water balance results to estimate important carbon cycle indicators including net primary productivity lee and veizer 2003 because transpiration alone is linked to photosynthesis the t et ratio and estimates of water use efficiency can be used to estimate net primary productivity of each watershed this is a potentially powerful tool for tracking impacts of land use and climate change on both the water and carbon cycles especially considering that it provides areal estimates that are representative of the watershed and are cumulative due to flow weighting as noted by gibson et al 2005 watershed based et partitioning using isotopes offers a complimentary perspective to tower based flux monitoring methods and may offer an additional opportunity to track changes on a watershed scale 3 7 comparison with continental and global studies we compared the results of our watershed et assessments across canada presented here with previous studies reported for river basins in north america and globally including those of jasechko et al 2013 schleisinger and jasechko 2014 and ferguson and veizer 2007 for north america fig 9 we found reasonable consistency overall for determinations of t et although our dataset lacked examples of temperate forests provided by ferguson and veizer 2007 that were characterized by high et and mid range t et values i e 60 80 and also lacked examples from the laurentian great lakes and central inland seas tahoe nicaragua presented by jasechko et al 2013 that had high et 700 1600 mm yr and t et ratios in the 85 95 range our analysis contained more examples of high latitude watersheds with both high t et mostly western and northern canada and low t et from the lake and wetland rich nelson r basin average values of t et std for our watersheds was 80 3 20 7 which was similar to isotope based estimates of ferguson and veizer for north american river basins 79 4 16 3 but lower than isotope based estimates of t et for large lake watersheds 87 8 8 0 presented by jasechko et al 2013 some of these differences may be attributed to catchment scale processes as argued by schlaepfer et al 2014 who contended that lakes may not be ideal reservoirs for capturing terrestrial ecosystem signals this is likely the case for arid or seasonally arid watersheds that may only be partially connected or periodically connected to the surrounding watershed schleisinger and jasechko 2014 described this effect as hydrologic decoupling which was invoked to explain lower t et values based on field based stand level monitoring methods e g sap or radial flow measurements diurnal water table monitoring energy balance eddy co variance aerodynamic profiling isotopic flux tracing for north american watersheds schleisinger and jasechko 2014 estimated average t et at 59 7 19 4 but acknowledged that poor characterization of subcanopy transpiration limited duration of stand level measurements that often do not extend to include the entire growing season and difficulty in extrapolating to the watershed scale may contribute to this differential 3 8 uncertainty in estimation of e i and t et uncertainty in estimation of e i for river watersheds using similar methodology to that presented here was reported to be 12 17 for 4 large watersheds in north america ferguson and veizer 2007 and this is shown to be the principal uncertainty carried through in the isotope based calculation of t et as revealed by the sensitivity analysis presented by gibson et al 1993 in a monte carlo uncertainty analysis by jasechko et al 2013 and also displayed in the uncertainty estimates of ferguson and veizer 2007 non linearity of the evaporative isotopic enrichment produces higher uncertainty for near terminal systems i e e i is close to 100 and also for systems with low evaporation losses as a consequence uncertainty in the range of 35 96 is reported by ferguson and veizer 2007 for several african river basins that apparently approach terminal status and uncertainty of 40 is estimated for the mississippi river which does not significantly deviate from the meteoric water line lee and veizer 2003 likewise uncertainties are estimated at 28 and 17 respectively for the murray darling river basin australia e i 22 and two humid oceania watersheds e i 6 ferguson and veizer 2007 as a test of the reproducibility of the results for specific watersheds in canada we compared our results with the estimates of telmer and veizer 2000 for the ottawa river basin and ferguson et al 2007 for the saskatchewan river basin and found these to be in agreement with our estimates to with 7 and 3 respectively despite being based on different periods of record for climate discharge and isotopic composition of streamflow this finding also lends support for our defined limits of uncertainty 3 9 implications for improved models and hydrometric prediction the isotope partitioning approach presented here allows for field based quantification of evaporation and transpiration partitioning which offers an independent approach for evaluating and or validating model based estimation or parameterization of these vapour fluxes this is particularly useful for long term water balance studies where the correct apportionment of water loss and storage within hydrologic models directly impacts estimation of future runoff and discharge such estimates can be particularly sensitive in inflow limited environments such as across the canadian prairies which leads to considerable uncertainty in the estimation of future runoff stadnyk et al 2019 process based apportionment of water within hydrologic models has been shown to be complex and subject to equifinality or many possible solutions all resulting in the same statistical outcome when evaluated against discharge alone beven and freer 2001 the inclusion of isotope tracers in hydrologic model calibration can however better inform the model calibration and process based partitioning within hydrologic models stadnyk and holmes 2020 holmes et al 2020 holmes et al 2020 demonstrated that statistically equivalent model performance could be obtained by very different internal water balance structures or process based partitions the difficulty was in evaluating the correctness of the various partitions due to a lack of regional evaporation and transpiration based partitions at the scale the model was developed the methods demonstrated in this study are appropriate to independently estimate evaporation and transpiration based loss at the watershed scale providing an independent and scale appropriate dataset for model evaluation these methods are particularly useful in regions where hydrometric data do not exist ungauged basins but where there are existing isotope data and or the capability to collect isotope data our methods therefore extend to predictions in ungauged basins by offering a means to estimate evaporation and transpiration losses in ungauged basins similarly we can extend the application of our methodology to future predictions using isotope enabled climate and hydrologic models the prediction accuracy of such models is focused through calibration and evaluation of hindcast scenarios on precipitation amount and temperature secondary variables such as evaporation loss and discharge are projected but with considerable uncertainty this methodology provides a means of improving future projections by constraining potential uncertainties in future projections at regional or continental scales on the topic of uncertainty there exists the potential to directly assess the uncertainty associated with non stationarity in land cover land use through time by correlating a watershed primary water balance control to landcover transitions or states by deriving a connection between landcover and water yield or the primary runoff generating mechanism e g fig 8 we can quantify the influence landcover change has on runoff generation without directly measuring changes in individual water balance components this offers significant opportunity for watershed management and sustainable land use planning 3 10 benefits and limitations application of isotope based partitioning in conjunction with routine hydrometric monitoring as demonstrated here provides an integrated approach for characterization of both runoff and vapour loss mechanisms at the regional or watershed scale and thereby establishes a more complete perspective on water cycling dynamics as well as capturing an important indicator of carbon cycling via the linkage between transpiration fluxes and photosynthesis one principal benefit of long term monitoring of isotope signals in rivers is that it offers a practical method for monitoring watershed scale changes and perhaps may even serve as an early warning indicator of hydrologic change and susceptibility related to climate and land cover alteration one of the primary limitations of the current dataset is that it is of restricted duration and scope and is spatially inconsistent therefore flow weighted averages are approximate as they were accrued from non uniform interannual sampling rather than being based on identical sampling schedules at all gauging stations fortunately additional and consistent sampling in the future across an identified network of stations will only improve flow weighted averages a more significant limitation in use of isotopes in time series monitoring mode is that it will require re activation and improvement of the canadian network for isotopes in precipitation cnip which has operated periodically over the past several decades see birks and gibson 2009 better understanding of the role of pre modern water sources including permafrost thaw glacial meltwater and glaciogenic groundwater sources and consideration of changes in watershed storage in general may require more sophisticated distributed models which are readily available 4 summary and conclusions canada wide water sampling for stable isotopes 18o and 2h was conducted at selected water survey gauging stations providing the first comprehensive national streamflow dataset 331 watersheds across 10 hydrometric regions ranging in size from 10 to 10 000 km2 were monitored 161 gauging stations had sufficient sampling to estimate flow weighted discharges and 103 watersheds were selected for vapour partitioning analysis based on the craig and gordon 1965 model a watershed based method for vapour partitioning is developed and applied in 103 watersheds variations in these vapour partitioning indicators reveal systematic responses across a range of land cover types and climate zones spanning over 25 latitude and 86 longitude the method compares favorably with previous applications of isotopic partitioning methods at the watershed scale e g ferguson and veizer 2007 jasechko et al 2013 and may provide practical context for comparing and extending vapour partitioning studies and water carbon cycle interaction studies from stand level to the continental scale important water cycle indicators were derived at the watershed scale including evaporation inflow e i and transpiration evapotranspiration t et e i is found to be controlled mainly by open water and wetland extent whereas t et is controlled by forest cover and cropland extent calculations suggest that e i ranged from 2 to 60 and t et ranged from 25 to 95 across a wide range of watersheds sensitivity analysis suggests only a minor influence on vapour partitioning at the watershed scale related to interception a new water loss classification approach is introduced which reveals that 19 of 103 watersheds were runoff dominated 54 were transpiration dominated 5 were evaporation dominated and 27 had more than one dominant water loss mechanism planned future studies include ongoing monitoring of the streamflow network comparison with simulations from a range of distributed hydrological models and further analysis of streamflow sources using hydrograph separation

stable isotopes vapour partitioning rivers evaporation transpiration runoff 1 introduction a stable isotope 18o and 2h survey of river discharge across canada was recently conducted as part of a multi year monitoring program operated by the water survey of canada during 2013 2019 gibson et al 2020 2021 similar programs carried out previously across the united states kendall and coplen 2001 europe rank et al 1998 koeniger et al 2009 reckhert et al 2017 and worldwide as part of the global network of isotopes in rivers gibson et al 2002a vitvar et al 2007 halder et al 2015 have sought to exploit

including many representative cold regions watersheds with mean annual temperatures ranging from 7 to 7 c one of the prevalent isotopic signals noted in river discharge across canada is evaporation often immediately detected when data are plotted in δ18o δ2h space owing to isotopic signatures that fall below the meteoric water line gibson et al 2020 the evaporation process is known to cause isotopic enrichment of heavy isotopic species in the residual liquid due to the less energetic behaviour of the heavy isotopic species i e isotopologues 1h1h18o 1h2h16o during diffusion across the air water interface horita et al 2008 evaporation may occur as water flows along river channels gremillion and wanielista 2000 gibson et al 2008a although such influences are often subordinate to evaporative signals inherited from lakes and wetlands residing within the watershed as these water bodies typically have much longer residence times and cover a higher percentages of surface area within the catchment gibson and edwards 2002 gibson et al 2016a evaporation is also enhanced progressively along chain of lakes drainage systems e g gibson and reid 2014 which are prevalent in 48 of canada s landmass underlain by crystalline precambrian shield bedrock previous studies in arid climate zones have also shown appreciable evaporative enrichment of heavy isotopic species in soil porewaters although such labelling is often realized only in dry bare soils allison et al 1983 barnes and allison 1988 dry bare soil areas are most often disconnected or intermittently connected to river networks and presumably are less likely to be a sustained or prevalent source of heavy isotope enriched water in river discharge gibson et al 2008b here we apply isotopic enrichment in streamflow to better understand the underlying mechanisms associated with vapour loss across a broad range of climate zones within canada utilizing the newly available 18o and 2h dataset as compared to precipitation isotope data and recent canadian isoscape modelling efforts delavau et al 2015 vapour loss mechanisms including canopy interception evaporation from soil evaporation from wet surfaces and transpiration by plants are often referred to collectively as evapotranspiration et a key component of the global water cycle regulating both atmospheric and surface water balance on the continents li et al 2019 as coupling of the water and carbon cycles by co2 uptake and vapour release during photosynthesis is linked only to plant mediated transpiration telmer and veizer 2000 a number of ecohydrology studies have proposed significant advantages for independent characterization or separation of transpiration from the bulk evapotranspiration flux including better understanding of responses to individual drivers schleisinger and jasechko 2014 several advantages include validation and improvement of ecosystem models shichun et al 2010 sutanto et al 2012 li et al 2019 application of water use efficiency based on transpiration estimates to calculate net primary productivity telmer and veizer 2000 mastrotheodoros et al 2017 ability to track stomatal response to environmental stressors li et al 2019 and overall for better understanding of land atmospheric interactions related to land use drought and climate change berg and sheffield 2019 several techniques employed for et partitioning at the plot to ecosystem scale include stable isotope methods sap flow eddy covariance and modelling isotope based methods make use of the fact that evaporation and transpiration differently fractionate the stable isotopes of water kool et al 2014 although they may be costly and labour intensive often requiring diurnal leaf water measurements watershed based partitioning of evaporation and transpiration relying on isotopic enrichment in river discharge has also been employed as was initially demonstrated by gibson et al 1993 and subsequently applied in a number of large river basin studies telmer and veizer 2000 lee and veizer 2003 ferguson et al 2007 notably ferguson and veizer 2007 show a comparison of results for 15 large watersheds in the americas africa australia and new guinea including discussion of implications for the net primary productivity and the global carbon cycle an informative review of the approach within the context of global water and carbon cycle research is provided by schulte et al 2011 jasechko et al 2013 extended application of the method to partition evapotranspiration for 73 large lake basins thereby assembling a perspective on the global significance of transpiration for land surfaces while jasechko et al 2013 concluded that transpiration may account for 80 90 of global evapotranspiration from the continents this assertion was subsequently challenged based on contentions regarding uncertainty propagation of the method coenders gerrits et al 2014 uncertainties regarding global interception estimates coenders gerrits et al 2014 schleisinger and jasechko 2014 as well as representativeness of applying lake isotopic signals to represent entire catchment areas owing to hydrological decoupling schlaepfer et al 2014 while representativeness plays a deterministic role in all isotope based investigations particularly at the large scale many other criticisms of the method have since been rebuked or explained jasechko et al 2014a nevertheless recent field scale tests of the method have shown more optimistic results hu et al 2018 in extending a similar approach to watersheds situated in 10 hydrometric regions across canada we illustrate refinements in methodology and implications of systematic variations across a range of hydroclimatic conditions for watersheds draining to the atlantic pacific and arctic oceans overall our hypothesis is that extent of open water and wetlands in watersheds will be the dominant drivers of evaporation losses whereas forest cover type and cropland will be the dominant driver of transpiration losses the main objectives of this paper are to evaluate a watershed based isotope mass balance approach for characterizing vapour partitioning mechanisms in a diverse range of hydrological regimes across canada to evaluate systematic influence of land cover characteristics on vapour partitioning mechanisms and to demonstrate a novel classification framework for watersheds based on dominant water loss mechanisms challenges limitations and implications for future research and monitoring in canada are also discussed 2 methods 2 1 study sites of 331 gauging stations within the isotope sampling program operated by water survey of canada 162 stations met our criteria to enable reliable estimation of flow weighted isotopic compositions see gibson et al 2020 2021 a total of 103 of these stations were used in the vapour partitioning vp analysis presented here table 1 fig 1 for these vp stations streamflow was found to be heavy isotope enriched relative to long term precipitation and so were amenable to a first order quantification of evaporation losses using a simple analytical isotope enrichment model the remainder of stations 61 were not used in this preliminary assessment owing to i significant content of water sources in streamflow other than modern precipitation i e glacier melt glaciogenic groundwater reflux or permafrost thaw ii uncertainty in the prediction or interpolation of long term precipitation isotope values for some remote or poorly monitored areas and or iii long residence times or storage lag effects in some watersheds resulting in a disconnect between the precipitation isotope input and streamflow response 2 2 isotope composition of streamflow oxygen 18 18o and deuterium 2h isotopic composition of streamflow was determined from measurement of water samples collected at flow gauging stations operated by the water survey of canada details of the streamflow network and sampling protocols have been described previously gibson et al 2020 2021 water samples were analyzed using a thermo scientific delta v advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer oxygen and hydrogen isotopes were analyzed on separate subsamples with oxygen determined by equilibration using a gasbench paul and skrzypek 2006 and hydrogen determined by injection of water on hot chromium using an h device reactor brand et al 1996 internal standards were selected that bracketed the dataset i e δ18o δ2h 1 27 39 213 6 2 3 88 17 2 3 9 81 72 1 results are reported in δ notation in permil relative to

repeats is 0 14 for δ18o n 382 and 0 52 for δ2h n 450 2 3 climate data gridded 32 km monthly climate data 1981 2001 including precipitation amount evaporation amount 2 m air temperature and 2 m relative humidity were extracted from the north america regional reanalysis narr mesinger et al 2006 long term basin weighted values of climate parameters were obtained by averaging all grid centered narr datapoints falling within the specified watersheds of interest 2 4 isotopic characterization of precipitation atmospheric water vapour and discharge isotopic composition of precipitation was estimated from time series ensembles 2013 2019 using a modified version of the model of delavau et al 2015 that included δ2h for all north american regional reanalysis narr coordinates falling within the canadian landmass from which climate data were extracted the regression based model relies mainly on monthly data collected within the canadian network for isotopes in precipitation cnip birks and gibson 2009 the united states network for isotopes in precipitation usnip welker 2012 and global network for isotopes in precipitation gnip iaea wmo 2014 amount weighted annual values for δ18o in precipitation were calculated as the dot product of the sequence of monthly isotopic values and precipitation amounts divided by the total precipitation basin weighted averages were calculated by arithmetically averaging all grid centered narr datapoints falling within a watershed isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapour was estimated using the precipitation equilibrium assumption gibson et al 2008b 1 δ a δ p ε α where ε is the equilibrium water vapour isotope separation horita and wesolowski 1994 and α decimal notation is the equilibrium isotopic fractionation where these quantities are related by ε 10 3 α 1 to account for seasonally variable conditions under which evaporation takes place the exchange terms in eq 1 were evaluated on a monthly time step and evaporation flux weighted for each grid centered narr datapoint this was calculated as the dot product of the sequence of monthly δa outputs from eq 1 and monthly evaporation divided by the total evaporation similar calculations were made to calculate the effective annual evaporation temperature and relative humidity at 2 m atmospheric height for each grid centered narr datapoint basin weighted parameters were then estimated by arithmetically averaging all narr datapoints within a watershed of interest isotope composition of discharge was flow weighted and calculated as the dot product of the isotopic composition of δ18o and instantaneous flow at the time of sampling divided by the mean flow an equivalent calculation was used to flow weight δ2h 2 5 water yield storage effects and interception annual water yields were calculated for each watershed based on daily flow gauging records and reflect the mean depth of gauged streamflow from the watersheds of interest due to the use of long term average climatic and hydrologic parameters watershed storage effects were assumed to approach zero interception estimates were obtained from the global land evaporation model gleam version 3 1 www gleam eu miralles et al 2010 and were basin weighted according to the methodology used for the narr datasets 2 6 isotope mass balance the isotopic data from the vp stations 103 in total were analyzed to estimate the fraction of water loss by evaporation e i from the watersheds and the transpired vapour fraction i e transpiration total evapotranspiration t et the methodology of gibson et al 2015 2016b 2017 2018 2019 was used in the calculations but was adapted to be suitable for application to watersheds rather than lakes a similar approach but with simplifications was used by ferguson et al 2007 for the great plains region of north america and by gibson et al 2002b 2010 for lakes in western canada evaporation inflow for the watersheds was estimated as follows 2 e i δ i δ q δ e δ q dimensionless where δ i δ q and δ e are the isotopic compositions of inflow streamflow and evaporate respectively the latter evaluated from the craig and gordon 1965 model given by 3 δ e δ l ε α h δ a ε k 1 h 10 3 ε k where h is relative humidity decimal fraction δ a is isotopic composition of atmospheric water vapour and ε k is the kinetic isotopic separation see horita et al 2008 as noted by gibson et al 2016b substitution of δ e from eq 3 into eq 2 yields 4 e i δ l δ i m δ δ l dimensionless where 5 m h 10 3 ε k ε α 1 h 10 3 ε k dimensionless and 6 δ h δ a ε k ε α h 10 3 ε k ε α for headwater catchments or watersheds we note that inflow and its isotopic composition can be approximated by precipitation and its isotopic composition respectively by substituting δ i δ p and i p in eq 4 we define e i for a headwater catchment estimated using the isotopic approach x to be 4a x e p δ l δ p m δ δ l dimensionless the water balance of a watershed non isotopic assuming zero change in storage can also be represented by 7 p n e t q mm yr where p n e t and q are the precipitation interception evaporation transpiration and gauged discharge respectively recognizing the following i that

simplified version of the water balance equation for comparative purposes that neglects interception losses 9 t e t p q x p p q dimensionless 3 results and discussion 3 1 isotope characteristics of streamflow precipitation and vapour streamflow and estimated precipitation isotopic compositions are illustrated in dual isotope space in relation to modelled isotopic composition of water vapour sources from the 103 vapour partitioning vp watersheds across canada fig 2 the locus of precipitation values for gauged basins closely resembles thecanadian meteoric water line cmwl gibson et al 2005 2020 measured streamflow is shown to be typically heavy isotope enriched relative to precipitation falling below the cmwl fig 2 further description and discussion of river trend lines in 2h 18o space based on this canadian streamflow dataset has been provided by gibson et al 2020 the modelled isotopic values for atmospheric moisture based on the equilibrium model are depleted relative to precipitation plotting ostensibly along a subparallel extension of the meteoric water line trend the craig and gordon 1965 model used to estimate the isotopic values of evaporate from both open water and soil predicts values that plot above the meteoric water line along subparallel imbricated clusters while transpiration is expected to fall closer to values for precipitation assuming net non fractionating biotic transfer of soil water evapotranspiration is approximated as a mixture of non fractionated transpiration and open water evaporation the strong potential of isotopic labelling of vapour by evaporation from bare soils is an end member that may be important in localized agricultural areas under tillage or summer fallow jalota and prihar 1990 but likely accounts for negligible amounts of annual vapour exchange across most natural canadian landscapes differential labelling of various vapour fluxes occurs due to variations in fractionation and mixing mechanisms we note that reduced evaporation losses and reduced fractionation during liquid vapour exchange is expected under conditions where large evaporating water bodies such as large lakes influence atmospheric water vapour in the boundary layer and alter the isotopic composition of the overlying air mass in downwind areas this effect has been described in detail from an isotope mass balance assessment of the great lakes jasechko et al 2014b and for smaller lakes located in coastal areas of atlantic and pacific coastal regions of canada gibson et al 2016b 2018 while our isotope balance calculations and the simulations shown in fig 2 assume that transpiration is non fractionating over the long term on the watershed scale we acknowledge that non mobile soil water compartments within the watershed e g water held within soils below field capacity but above the wilting point may also develop periodically and may in some cases become a distinctly labelled source of transpired water consistent with the two water worlds tww hypothesis mcdonnell 2014 the tww concept which remains to be widely tested evaristo et al 2015 postulates that streams are fed by mobile soil water associated with infiltration and groundwater recharge whereas plants may primarily be tapping into non mobile soil water sources significant isotopic fractionation of non mobile waters has been observed in the unsaturated soil zone see barnes and allison 1988 with similar enrichment potential to that observed in leaf water barbour 2007 but also is known to occur to a lesser extent in shallow soils subject to evaporation or intermittently during evaporation of interception storage isotopic discrimination during plant water uptake has also been suggested as a process that can leave a large imprint on finite soil water supplies vargas et al 2017 from the watershed perspective we acknowledge that a potentially wide range of isotopic signatures may develop within non mobile soil water storages which may in some cases directly influence the isotopic composition of transpired moisture or may indirectly affect evaporative enrichment by modifying the isotopic composition of the atmospheric boundary layer in the region but because non mobile waters are generally not returned to the stream they are not significantly affecting the isotopic signals in discharge despite being important factors influencing short term conditions at the hillslope or stand level we postulate that these storages account for a negligible fraction of the annual runoff volume in most watersheds and are therefore considered less influential in modifying the isotopic signatures of streamflow evaporate and transpirate it remains to be established if tww might be a more influential control on vapour partitioning in some watersheds if similar approaches were applied in higher frequency time series sampling programs 3 2 evaporation loss and et partitioning evaporation loss e i and transpiration ratios t et were estimated based on eqs 4 and 8 respectively and are presented by hydrometric region fig 3 use of long term climate data and flow weighted averages was intended to derive values representative of long term watershed integrated fluxes comparisons were made for t et using the base case model which incorporated interception loss i e eq 8 and a simplified model without interception i e eq 9 while e i spans a range of values for watersheds within each hydrometric region systematic differences emerge from region to region largely reflecting the degree of influence of lakes and wetlands in the drainage network across each region we note that watersheds within the maritime provinces region 1 and the pacific yukon and arctic regions 8 through 10 have the lowest e i ranges varying from 3 to 15 on average as compared to hudson bay drainages regions 4 5 and 6 that have higher average e i ratios ranging from 15 to 35 and less commonly ranging up to 60 for individual watersheds great slave lake drainages region 7 are found to have wide ranging values with higher e i values up to 45 for shield drainages with abundant lakes as compared to the peace athabasca river basins which drain both mountainous and low lying wetland dominated areas and bring the regional average down to approximately 10 by comparison e i for the great lakes st lawrence watersheds as well as northern quebec and labrador are fairly restricted and in the vicinity of 20 reflecting the importance of both small and large lakes in the drainage network t et is evidently greater than 80 on average across the maritime provinces region 1 as well as great slave lake pacific yukon and arctic watersheds regions 7 8 9 10 although the arctic and great slave lake regions regions 10 and 7 respectively include watersheds with much lower t et ranging down to 40 50 due largely to the dominance of lakes and wetland areas as well as the abundance of non vegetated outcrop transpiration ratios in the hudson bay drainages regions 4 5 and 6 range from 50 to 75 whereas great lakes st lawrence and northern quebec labrador are in the 40 50 range apparently controlled mainly by the fraction of lakes and wetlands in these drainage basins while these results are a first approximation given that they can be improved by refining estimates of the flow weighted isotopic composition of the watersheds they provide important new information on the dominant vapour loss mechanism weighted over contributing areas of the watersheds we note that for watersheds with large partial or non contributing areas isotope results may not be representative of the entire watershed area but rather of the relatively smaller area contributing to flow as noted in previous studies fang et al 2010 wolfe et al 2019 muhammad et al 2019 non contributing areas occur widely in the semi arid southern prairie watersheds of the nelson river drainage region 5 and in the milk river region 11 the latter of which was not included in this assessment but is part of a transboundary isotopic assessment in progress such grassland regions with low hummocky relief are known to be frequently disconnected from higher order streams shook et al 2015 other informative examples can be drawn from semi arid regions such as the darling river basin in australia gibson et al 2008b where the main river channel was shown to be largely disconnected from its upstream contributing area except during storm events or due to diversion of river water for irrigation of crops in general the presence of partial or non contributing areas is likely to underestimate areal t et ratios for the watershed as a whole given that non connected areas of predominantly grasslands are likely to be dominated by transpiration nevertheless such isotope based estimates may compliment physically based water balance assessments helping to constrain the overall dynamic effect of non contributing areas in wet and dry years or seasons 3 3 effect of interception losses and sublimation on t et several et partitioning assessments have included estimates of canopy interception loss under controlled conditions e g sutanto et al 2012 although field based isotopic assessments have commonly encountered difficulties given that isotopic signals due to interception are non linear as water is selectively transferred to the soil following evaporation into the atmosphere and associated isotopic exchange that may be partial or complete depending on rainfall frequency duration and intensity allen et al 2017 to evaluate the importance of interception in determining transpiration ratios we compare t et results from the base case model based on a global satellite based reanalysis dataset gleam miralles et al 2010 to a version of the model that neglects interception to our knowledge no previous watershed based isotopic assessments have evaluated the effect of incorporating interception loss as shown in fig 4 we compare t et using eqs 8 and 9 but find only minor differences between the models amounting to 1 6 difference on average standard deviation of 5 from this we conclude that interception n likely has a negligible influence on watershed integrated t et estimates for canada while sublimation losses are not explicitly accounted for in this assessment we recognize that some previous studies have shown sublimation to produce enrichment of the residual snowpack leading to offset below the meteoric water line sokratov and golubev 2009 in other cases no detectable systematic isotopic changes in the residual snowpack due to sublimation were observed st amour et al 2005 with regards to our t et assessment sublimation losses would likely result in minor enrichment of streamflow where fractionation is prevalent a signal which would be incorporated within the non biotic evaporative water loss fraction and so classified here as an evaporative water loss as noted by pang et al 2019 for sites in east antarctica concurrent observations of stable isotopes in atmospheric water vapor precipitation and surface snow would be necessary to quantify net changes in the isotopic composition of surface snow due to sublimation 3 4 runoff versus vapour loss from watersheds watersheds are classified according to dominant water loss mechanisms fig 5 of the 103 watersheds examined only 19 had water losses that were runoff dominated whereas 84 were vapour dominated among vapour dominated watersheds 54 were transpiration dominated and only 5 were evaporation dominated a total of 27 watersheds were classified as mixed having more than one dominant water loss mechanism geographically the transpiration dominated watersheds are situated largely within western canada in prairie boreal plains taiga plains and montane ecoregions wiken 1986 within hydrometric regions 4 8 and 10 fig 6 runoff dominated watersheds are widely distributed across eastern canada regions 1 3 as well as within montane watersheds of western canada regions 5 8 10 evaporation dominated watersheds are the most restricted geographically being found only in boreal watersheds apparently confined to watersheds with a high degree of lake cover near the boreal prairie fringe in regions 5 and 6 mixed water loss watersheds appear to be found most commonly within the boreal taiga and central arctic tundra ecozones including treeline areas of regions 4 10 fig 6 the seal river region 6 which drains tundra wetland and forested areas of northern manitoba and southern nunavut is found to be runoff dominated which we expect is more typical of watersheds on the western shores of hudson bay it is informative to note that water loss mechanisms appear to evolve from headwaters to mouth within the largest river basins for example the 2575 km nelson river region 5 which traverses a wide range in latitude climatic zones and physiographic sub regions exhibits diverse and evolving water loss mechanisms within its sub basins runoff dominated tributaries are found in alpine headwaters of region 5 including the bow river alberta evaporation dominated tributaries are found in precambrian shield headwaters south of lake winnipeg manitoba and near lake of the woods ontario see inset fig 6 transpiration dominated tributaries are found for prairie headwaters and mixed water loss mechanisms are found for boreal watersheds including several rivers such as the souris river mossy river limestone river and odei river which carry upstream drainage in region 5 across lake rich precambrian shield terrain to hudson bay for the 4241 km mackenzie river system a similar evolution of dominant water loss mechanisms from headwaters to mouth is noted rocky mountains headwaters of the athabasca river are runoff dominated where monitored at hinton alberta whereas precambrian shield headwaters are mixed and wetland dominated watersheds along the peace athabasca mackenzie corridor are transpiration dominated in the following section we further explore water balance variations in watersheds across canada through more detailed analysis of land cover controls 3 5 land cover effects land cover characteristics for the studied watersheds was obtained from cci ls esa 2017 which differentiates 22 land cover classes globally based on the united nations land cover classification system lccs di gregorio and jansen 2000 to eliminate classes that were absent or unimportant in north america to highlight land cover characteristics considered to be influential for determining t et e i and for classification of dominant water losses a simplified set of 12 land classes was used some comprised of amalgamated cci ls classes fig 7 table s1 as transpiration is linked to photosynthesis in vascular plants whereas evaporation is linked to abiotic vapour losses i e mainly open water evaporation we hypothesize that greater percent forest cover grassland and cropland cover is likely to be associated with enhanced t et whereas surface water storage e g lakes and wetlands is likely to be associated with enhanced e i a heatmap diagram provides a test of these hypotheses fig 7 we find that t et is positively correlated with cropland in watersheds having extensive cultivation e g region 5 and positively correlated with forest cover in general although strength of the correlation among the various forest types depends on their importance within each region for example correlation between t et and deciduous forest is more robust for the maritimes region 1 whereas correlation between t et and needleleaf evergreen is more robust in boreal arctic regions of northern quebec and labrador great slave lake and the arctic regions 3 7 and 10 t et appears to be insensitive to percent shrubland and grassland presumably because these areas tend to be dominated by open water as expected e i is positively correlated with open water in all regions except the st lawrence which is fed by evaporatively enriched water from the great lakes system see jasechko et al 2014b karim et al 2008 for this reason isotopic enrichment and indicators such as e i are not a sensitive cumulative indicator of evaporation losses for the lower st lawrence watershed which was predicted for such basins by gat s 2010 river continuum model e i is positively correlated with the following land cover types i wetland cover in the hudson bay drainages regions 4 5 and 6 ii lichen moss cover in regions where it is abundant across most of northern canada regions 1 3 5 7 10 and iii open closed needleleaf evergreen in southwestern hudson bay region 4 note that lichen and mosses are non vascular and therefore respiration is accomplished by evaporation rather than transpiration price et al 2009 therefore lichen moss land cover is positively correlated with e i and negatively correlated with t et overall our general hypothesis that open water and wetlands were the dominant drivers of e i is verified and to some extent the inverse is found to be true for t et where watersheds with reduced wetland and open water generally had higher t et direct correlation between t et and various forest cover types is however found to be region specific and less systematic although patterns appear to be more predictable when both vapour and liquid water losses are considered together while we expected to detect the influence of cropland development on e i and t et in agricultural areas we were not anticipating that this effect would be quite as pronounced most notably the significant correlations between cropland cover and t et for the nelson r basin region 5 indicates that watershed management decisions may have a pronounced impact on the vapour partitioning mechanisms to further explore the effect of land cover on the dominant water loss mechanisms in watersheds across canada we applied principal components analysis pca to offer additional insight into vegetation drivers of vapour loss and runoff analogous methods have been applied to examine hydroclimatic controls on runoff gibson et al 2015 2019 and trophic status gibson et al 2016c as shown in a pca biplot fig 8 watersheds with similar vegetation characteristics cluster together with scores close to the origin reflecting near average characteristics and scores offset from the origin reflecting degree of departure from average characteristics attributable to variable loadings vectors note that subparallel loading vectors are highly correlated whereas correlation decreases in direct proportion to angle of offset between vectors culminating in perpendicularity for uncorrelated factors this allows for comparison between water balance characteristics and vegetation characteristics across the entire dataset notably we find the following i a negative correlation between e or e i versus t or t et ii lack of correlation between water yield wy and e e i t e t iii strong correlation between wy n and p iv runoff dominated watersheds are most often needleleaf evergreen but less commonly may be mixed leaf forest or contain significant areas of permanent snow and ice v p and n tend to be higher for mixed leaf forests vi transpiration dominated watersheds are most commonly cropland with secondary influences being deciduous forest and urban areas and vii mixed water loss and evaporation dominated water loss in watersheds are commonly associated with open water lichen and moss and wetlands while further work is warranted on a watershed by watershed basis to evaluate the specific effects of c3 versus c4 plant cover runoff organization elevation surface roughness groundwater surface water interactions and permafrost conditions our first approximation analysis suggests that basic land cover characteristics exert significant influence on the partitioning results time series analysis based on long term water sampling and isotope partitioning may therefore be informative for examining both climatic and land use impacts on the hydrological cycle 3 6 towards improved understanding of water and carbon cycle interactions previous watershed studies have applied isotope based water balance results to estimate important carbon cycle indicators including net primary productivity lee and veizer 2003 because transpiration alone is linked to photosynthesis the t et ratio and estimates of water use efficiency can be used to estimate net primary productivity of each watershed this is a potentially powerful tool for tracking impacts of land use and climate change on both the water and carbon cycles especially considering that it provides areal estimates that are representative of the watershed and are cumulative due to flow weighting as noted by gibson et al 2005 watershed based et partitioning using isotopes offers a complimentary perspective to tower based flux monitoring methods and may offer an additional opportunity to track changes on a watershed scale 3 7 comparison with continental and global studies we compared the results of our watershed et assessments across canada presented here with previous studies reported for river basins in north america and globally including those of jasechko et al 2013 schleisinger and jasechko 2014 and ferguson and veizer 2007 for north america fig 9 we found reasonable consistency overall for determinations of t et although our dataset lacked examples of temperate forests provided by ferguson and veizer 2007 that were characterized by high et and mid range t et values i e 60 80 and also lacked examples from the laurentian great lakes and central inland seas tahoe nicaragua presented by jasechko et al 2013 that had high et 700 1600 mm yr and t et ratios in the 85 95 range our analysis contained more examples of high latitude watersheds with both high t et mostly western and northern canada and low t et from the lake and wetland rich nelson r basin average values of t et std for our watersheds was 80 3 20 7 which was similar to isotope based estimates of ferguson and veizer for north american river basins 79 4 16 3 but lower than isotope based estimates of t et for large lake watersheds 87 8 8 0 presented by jasechko et al 2013 some of these differences may be attributed to catchment scale processes as argued by schlaepfer et al 2014 who contended that lakes may not be ideal reservoirs for capturing terrestrial ecosystem signals this is likely the case for arid or seasonally arid watersheds that may only be partially connected or periodically connected to the surrounding watershed schleisinger and jasechko 2014 described this effect as hydrologic decoupling which was invoked to explain lower t et values based on field based stand level monitoring methods e g sap or radial flow measurements diurnal water table monitoring energy balance eddy co variance aerodynamic profiling isotopic flux tracing for north american watersheds schleisinger and jasechko 2014 estimated average t et at 59 7 19 4 but acknowledged that poor characterization of subcanopy transpiration limited duration of stand level measurements that often do not extend to include the entire growing season and difficulty in extrapolating to the watershed scale may contribute to this differential 3 8 uncertainty in estimation of e i and t et uncertainty in estimation of e i for river watersheds using similar methodology to that presented here was reported to be 12 17 for 4 large watersheds in north america ferguson and veizer 2007 and this is shown to be the principal uncertainty carried through in the isotope based calculation of t et as revealed by the sensitivity analysis presented by gibson et al 1993 in a monte carlo uncertainty analysis by jasechko et al 2013 and also displayed in the uncertainty estimates of ferguson and veizer 2007 non linearity of the evaporative isotopic enrichment produces higher uncertainty for near terminal systems i e e i is close to 100 and also for systems with low evaporation losses as a consequence uncertainty in the range of 35 96 is reported by ferguson and veizer 2007 for several african river basins that apparently approach terminal status and uncertainty of 40 is estimated for the mississippi river which does not significantly deviate from the meteoric water line lee and veizer 2003 likewise uncertainties are estimated at 28 and 17 respectively for the murray darling river basin australia e i 22 and two humid oceania watersheds e i 6 ferguson and veizer 2007 as a test of the reproducibility of the results for specific watersheds in canada we compared our results with the estimates of telmer and veizer 2000 for the ottawa river basin and ferguson et al 2007 for the saskatchewan river basin and found these to be in agreement with our estimates to with 7 and 3 respectively despite being based on different periods of record for climate discharge and isotopic composition of streamflow this finding also lends support for our defined limits of uncertainty 3 9 implications for improved models and hydrometric prediction the isotope partitioning approach presented here allows for field based quantification of evaporation and transpiration partitioning which offers an independent approach for evaluating and or validating model based estimation or parameterization of these vapour fluxes this is particularly useful for long term water balance studies where the correct apportionment of water loss and storage within hydrologic models directly impacts estimation of future runoff and discharge such estimates can be particularly sensitive in inflow limited environments such as across the canadian prairies which leads to considerable uncertainty in the estimation of future runoff stadnyk et al 2019 process based apportionment of water within hydrologic models has been shown to be complex and subject to equifinality or many possible solutions all resulting in the same statistical outcome when evaluated against discharge alone beven and freer 2001 the inclusion of isotope tracers in hydrologic model calibration can however better inform the model calibration and process based partitioning within hydrologic models stadnyk and holmes 2020 holmes et al 2020 holmes et al 2020 demonstrated that statistically equivalent model performance could be obtained by very different internal water balance structures or process based partitions the difficulty was in evaluating the correctness of the various partitions due to a lack of regional evaporation and transpiration based partitions at the scale the model was developed the methods demonstrated in this study are appropriate to independently estimate evaporation and transpiration based loss at the watershed scale providing an independent and scale appropriate dataset for model evaluation these methods are particularly useful in regions where hydrometric data do not exist ungauged basins but where there are existing isotope data and or the capability to collect isotope data our methods therefore extend to predictions in ungauged basins by offering a means to estimate evaporation and transpiration losses in ungauged basins similarly we can extend the application of our methodology to future predictions using isotope enabled climate and hydrologic models the prediction accuracy of such models is focused through calibration and evaluation of hindcast scenarios on precipitation amount and temperature secondary variables such as evaporation loss and discharge are projected but with considerable uncertainty this methodology provides a means of improving future projections by constraining potential uncertainties in future projections at regional or continental scales on the topic of uncertainty there exists the potential to directly assess the uncertainty associated with non stationarity in land cover land use through time by correlating a watershed primary water balance control to landcover transitions or states by deriving a connection between landcover and water yield or the primary runoff generating mechanism e g fig 8 we can quantify the influence landcover change has on runoff generation without directly measuring changes in individual water balance components this offers significant opportunity for watershed management and sustainable land use planning 3 10 benefits and limitations application of isotope based partitioning in conjunction with routine hydrometric monitoring as demonstrated here provides an integrated approach for characterization of both runoff and vapour loss mechanisms at the regional or watershed scale and thereby establishes a more complete perspective on water cycling dynamics as well as capturing an important indicator of carbon cycling via the linkage between transpiration fluxes and photosynthesis one principal benefit of long term monitoring of isotope signals in rivers is that it offers a practical method for monitoring watershed scale changes and perhaps may even serve as an early warning indicator of hydrologic change and susceptibility related to climate and land cover alteration one of the primary limitations of the current dataset is that it is of restricted duration and scope and is spatially inconsistent therefore flow weighted averages are approximate as they were accrued from non uniform interannual sampling rather than being based on identical sampling schedules at all gauging stations fortunately additional and consistent sampling in the future across an identified network of stations will only improve flow weighted averages a more significant limitation in use of isotopes in time series monitoring mode is that it will require re activation and improvement of the canadian network for isotopes in precipitation cnip which has operated periodically over the past several decades see birks and gibson 2009 better understanding of the role of pre modern water sources including permafrost thaw glacial meltwater and glaciogenic groundwater sources and consideration of changes in watershed storage in general may require more sophisticated distributed models which are readily available 4 summary and conclusions canada wide water sampling for stable isotopes 18o and 2h was conducted at selected water survey gauging stations providing the first comprehensive national streamflow dataset 331 watersheds across 10 hydrometric regions ranging in size from 10 to 10 000 km2 were monitored 161 gauging stations had sufficient sampling to estimate flow weighted discharges and 103 watersheds were selected for vapour partitioning analysis based on the craig and gordon 1965 model a watershed based method for vapour partitioning is developed and applied in 103 watersheds variations in these vapour partitioning indicators reveal systematic responses across a range of land cover types and climate zones spanning over 25 latitude and 86 longitude the method compares favorably with previous applications of isotopic partitioning methods at the watershed scale e g ferguson and veizer 2007 jasechko et al 2013 and may provide practical context for comparing and extending vapour partitioning studies and water carbon cycle interaction studies from stand level to the continental scale important water cycle indicators were derived at the watershed scale including evaporation inflow e i and transpiration evapotranspiration t et e i is found to be controlled mainly by open water and wetland extent whereas t et is controlled by forest cover and cropland extent calculations suggest that e i ranged from 2 to 60 and t et ranged from 25 to 95 across a wide range of watersheds sensitivity analysis suggests only a minor influence on vapour partitioning at the watershed scale related to interception a new water loss classification approach is introduced which reveals that 19 of 103 watersheds were runoff dominated 54 were transpiration dominated 5 were evaporation dominated and 27 had more than one dominant water loss mechanism planned future studies include ongoing monitoring of the streamflow network comparison with simulations from a range of distributed hydrological models and further analysis of streamflow sources using hydrograph separation methods as well as various other frequency analysis techniques see jasechko et al 2016 that will enable further insight into the age and sources of streamflow credit authorship contribution statement

8127,study region poland warta river catchment study focus the study aimed to explain the reasons for spatial variability in chloride concentrations at the mosina krajkowo riverbank filtration rbf site located along the river this variability is attributed to rbf s different intensity along the river sections related among others to clogging development the rbf effectiveness was studied using groundwater flow modelling by examining the water balance in zones established on hydrogeological setting and chloride concentrations travel time of the bankfiltrate investigation rbf parametrisation i e infiltration per unit area and specific infiltration per unit of riverbank new hydrological insights for the region the study identifies zones of the most favourable rbf conditions and establishes the variability causes the overall share bankfiltrate was found at 75 8 its spatial variation ranged widely from 41 1 89 3 confirming the usefulness of the rbf performance sectional analysis in managing this type of site the highest proportion of surface water 80 occurred along the straight river section where the riverbed was built by fine and medium sands preventing penetration of organic suspension into the aquifer in contrast the lowest values 42 occurred in the meander zone with the most favourable rbf conditions at the beginning of site operation where deep erosion reached coarse grained sediments in the river bottom followed by the development of clogging processes and a decrease in the rbf efficiency with time keywords riverbank filtration numerical modelling riverbed clogging modflow modpath 1 introduction the technique of rbf has been used in europe for more than 150 years grischek et al 2002 it is become worldwide particularly in the united states israel india and china hu et al 2016 ray et al 2002 sandhu et al 2011 the rbf systems ensure the long term productivity and stability of the water supply especially for large cities however the riverbed s clogging caused by poor water quality associated with particulate organic matter and supported by aquifer overexploitation has already significantly weakened the rbf systems sustainability wang et al 2015 przybylek et al 2017 it has been reported that most rbf facilities face a severe clogging problem within a short operation time chu et al 2019 du et al 2013 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 one of the critical factor controlling the rbf capacity is the natural permeability of the aquifer and the riverbed that might decrease under forced abstraction sepaskhah and sokoot 2010 on the other side the well design and operation practices also play a significant role in rbf performance and its durability over time grischek et al 2002 sprenger et al 2011 stuyfzand 1989 the permeability of the riverbed may also vary with the dynamic changes of hydrological conditions which favour sediment accumulation at low flows and bed scouring at high flows thus it cannot be regarded as constant hiscock and grischek 2002 schubert 2002 the intense production capacity of rbf systems is commonly needed to provide the expected water quantity but the balance between the rate of bankfiltrate and the residence time of contaminants must be considered to maintain sufficient water quality gutiérrez et al 2017 this balance may be provided by the rbf operational control of increasing the inflow of usually unpolluted groundwater during periods of poor river water quality thus designing the new rbf system and its stable functioning requires investigating factors affecting rbf and water quality improvement which are considered to be river well distance pumping rate filtration depth basin transmissivity and site hydrology ray and jain 2011 it is also essential to determine bank filtration conditions of various river sections i e meanders and oxbow lakes grischek et al 2002 lautz and siegel 2006 herrmann et al 2015 mustafa et al 2016 different methods of assessing rbf effectiveness are reported in the literature in germany it is common practice to analyse the rbf system s operational conditions using indicators such as the leakage coefficient grischek and bartak 2016 in case of rbf the use of natural tracers especially a chloride mass balance or isotopic composition is also considered to help evaluate the mixing ratio of groundwater and the infiltrate dillon et al 2002 ghodeif et al 2016 forizs et al 2005 kruc et al 2018 abou zakhem and hafez 2012 another approach used by researchers studying rbf problems is groundwater flow modelling which is generally applied to investigate groundwater flow patterns zhou and li 2011 this technique is suitable for determining surface water groundwater interactions boano et al 2013 and water balance testing lautz and siegel 2006 herrmann et al 2015 in the previous studies mathematical modelling was most often used in designing rbf well fields but modelling studies on long term operated rbf facilities are rare it was applied e g to simulate factors affecting rbf system operation grischek et al 2002 under variable hydrological conditions e g long hydrological dry and wet seasons the researchers used models to test various positions of wells in relation to the river or infiltration basin many studies have considered the significance of the dilution effect and prolonged travel time for wells situated farther from the surface water shamsuddin et al 2015 sprenger et al 2011 while others have emphasised that it is the pumping rate that has the dominant influence on the volume of the bankfiltrate abdel fattah et al 2008 this article presents a complex long term operated mosina krajkowo well field consisting of several rbf facilities rbf sites fed from different supply sources that intermingle making the above observations challenging to confirm explicitly in an analytical manner in such systems mathematical modelling seems to be the only method to solve and quantify the rbf efficiency variables however high quality input data are required to minimise the uncertainty of the model outputs the study focuses on the rbf c facility located parallel to the river where differentiation in chloride concentration was noticed therefore a three dimensional hydrogeological model was created to explain the causes of chloride variability investigate rbf effectiveness and identify clogging issues along the river sections the goal was achieved by i evaluating the water balance ambient groundwater surface water mixing and its differentiation in specific zones established according to rbf c wells technical and hydrogeological setting and the chloride differentiation in surface and groundwater ii investigating the groundwater flow path and the travel time from the river to individual wells and iii calculating the parameters describing the conditions of surface water infiltration i e infiltration per unit area and specific infiltration per unit riverbank our study unlike previous ones demonstrates the importance of sectional analysis in understanding and forecasting factors affecting rbf efficiency 2 methods 2 1 site description the presented research was carried out at the mosina krajkowo rbf well field the main water supply for the poznań agglomeration poland the well field is located on the floodplain and higher terrace on the left side of the warta river valley between mosina town and krajkowo village and consists of fig 1 terrace barrier rbf f containing 56 vertical wells with a depth of 38 0 52 0 m and a capacity of 50 150 m3 h spaced between 100 150 m on a length of 7 150 m krajkowo island an area separated by watercourses the warta river and an artificially formed protective channel with the following water well fields riverbank filtration rbf c 29 vertical wells with a depth of 35 0 46 5 m and a capacity of 90 120 m3 h located in a protective embankment with a length of 1 980 m recharged by the rbf from the warta river the upper edges of the well screens are located at depths of 12 16 m b g l a barrier of artificial infiltration ar 11 vertical wells with a depth of 20 0 25 0 m and a capacity of 40 45 m3 h supplied from three artificially formed infiltration basins and one natural pond stocked by pipelines with water from the warta river horizontal well hw consisting of collecting well with a diameter of 8 m and a depth of 12 m from which 8 horizontal drains were derived with a total active length of 718 m arranged at a depth of 5 m under the bottom of the warta river gorski et al 2011 the two major groundwater basins mgbs the wielkopolska buried valley wbv and the overlapping warszawa berlin ice marginal valley wbimv occur fig 2 which makes it a region with favourable hydrogeological conditions the upper aquifer wbimv is built of fine and medium grained sands of fluvial origin to a depth of 10 m and coarse grained sands and gravels of fluvio glacial origin to 20 m below ground level the deeper aquifer wbv is composed of fluvial fine and medium grained sands in the upper part to a depth of 25 30 m and coarse grained fluvio glacial sands and gravels in the deepest part of the aquifer locally these two aquifers with a total thickness of up to 40 m gorski et al 2018 are separated by glacial tills of 10 m thick there are also lenses of peats muds and clays interbedding the aquifers fig 3 as the weakly permeable sediments form a semi aquitard disturbed by extensive hydrogeological windows the difference in pressures between the wbimv and the wbv is insignificant but may reach up to 0 25 0 5 m in areas where poorly permeable sediments occur fig 4 the geological structure and hydrogeological conditions are recognised in detail within the modelling area over the years of the mosina krajkowo well field operation more than 500 hydrogeological boreholes and wells were made to investigate the water flow terms the rbf facilities wells are monitored in terms of the water withdrawal and the piezometric state position moreover 70 observation points are used for monitoring purposes fig 4 the variability of the surface water level is examined with loggers installed on the warta river protection channel and infiltration basin according to hydrological observations for the long term period 1991 2007 the average warta river level was 57 33 m a s l the lowest mean of warta level was 56 1 m a s l and the highest mean was 59 18 m a s l for this period przybylek and chomicki 2016 the average precipitation from 1985 to 2017 in the study area is 554 mm dragon et al 2019 the study s primary focus is the rbf c barrier which has been operated continuously since 1984 with a capacity of 45 000 60 000 m3 d the share of bankfiltrate is approx 75 at that capacity przybylek and kasztelan 2017 in this case surface water quality has a considerable influence on the overall potable water quality gorski et al 2019 wells of the rbf c site are characterised by different chloride content ranging between 31 0 and 56 0 in 2017 the lowest values below 40 mg l were observed in wells no 24 l 29 l and 31 l 35 l while the highest above 50 mg l characterised wells no 5 l 13 l fig 1 chloride concentrations in the warta river prior to the modelling study august october 2017 range of 45 60 mgcl l were documented as the concentrations of conservative pollutants are considered an indicator of water balance and water sources clark 2015 kruc et al 2018 the differentiation of chloride concentration of the abstracted water combined with hydrogeological setting of the rbf c wells was used to separate the balance zones fig 3 2 2 model characteristics visual modflow software has been used to simulate steady state three dimensional groundwater flow at the rbf site mosina krajkowo the numerical model covers 50 km2 5 10 km consisting of 196 rows and 380 columns to give more detailed consideration to surface water groundwater interactions under the rbf mosina krajkowo operation a perpendicular grid of variable cell sizes was implemented in adjacent krajkowo island the grid size has been refined to 10 10 m compared to the 50 50 m block size deployed in the remaining model area fig 4 according to the hydrogeology of the region the two major quaternary basins wbv and wbimv have been divided into 6 modelling layers regarding both sediment gradation and well barrier technical specifications well screen intervals fig 5 the top three layers are representative of the wbimv while the other layers reflect the occurrence of the wbv such a specific approach provided for vertical flow diversification induced by 3 pumping systems rbf c ar and hw of variable depth affecting each other the site morphology limited the model top and neogene clays occurrence specified the bottom the overall thickness of the modelled aquifers was approx 40 m 2 3 model input data as the simulation s accuracy improves with the incorporated data s high quality anderson et al 2015 comprehensive geological and hydrogeological studies were used to build the model almost 500 drilling profiles and basic hydrogeological pumping tests were used to specify the aquifers borders hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity as well as the elevation of the modelled layers the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers in distinguished layers varies between 2 4 36 m d layer i 16 8 72 m d layer ii 24 120 m d layer iii 16 8 60 m d layer iv 0 24 28 8 m d layer v and 48 120 m d layer vi the vertical conductivity of semi aquitards range between 0 24 and 0 0024 m d an effective porosity was assumed by relation to the grain size distribution based on literature rembeza 1998 gravels were given values of 0 26 0 3 coarse grained sands 0 21 medium sands from 0 19 fluvioglacial aquifers to 0 21 buried valleys fine sands 0 16 silty sands 0 12 tills 0 1 an effective porosity value of 0 1 0 21 was used for layer 1 and of 0 1 0 3 for layers 2 6 the mean values calculated as the average of all active blocks in a given numerical layer were 0 13 for layer 1 layers 2 and 3 were 0 18 layer iv was 0 2 layer v was 0 13 and layer vi was 0 19 the recognition of warta riverbed morphology and lithology covered 40 drillings przybylek et al 2017 in general the warta riverbed is situated at 54 8 56 5 m a s l and decreases to 51 0 m a s l at the river bend due to intensified erosion the riverbed mostly comprises fine and medium sands except the river bend where deep erosion reached coarse sands and gravels the bottom sediment thickness was assumed to be uniform at 1 m for all river boundaries the technical specification of the protection channel has also been comprehensively analysed the western part of channel bed sediments is represented by fine and medium grained sands while on the eastern side they consist of peats the channel profile of approx 20 40 m width was rebuilt in 2004 the newly formed channel was deepened to about 2 3 m depth its northern shore was constructed as a sandy sloping shelf to increase its bank filtration towards the rbf c barrier the opposite shore was sealed with paving using a 10 m model block size within krajkowo island allowed applying this variability in the model simulation the field studies were carried out in a net of 89 abstraction and observation points to generate potentiometric maps of the wbimv and the wbv aquifers groundwater level measurements were performed on 16 19 october 2017 these measurements were used as model calibration points for hydrogeological modelling surface water monitoring data were also considered during the study the warta river stage adjacent to krajkowo island was in the multi year average i e from 58 0 in the west to 58 5 m a s l in the east at 70 80 m width the water level of the protection channel varied between 58 05 58 46 m a s l while the stage of the infiltration basins reached 58 14 58 8 m a s l at a depth of 0 64 1 3 m all river boundary conditions were implemented in the first upper numerical layer as reported by the pumping well schedule in october 2017 total groundwater withdrawal by 26 active wells of rbf c located mostly 50 80 m from the left warta riverbank amounted to 46 732 5 m3 d well screen intervals of rbf c penetrate the investigated aquifer at depths corresponding to the 4 6 mathematical layers fig 5 diversification of the discharge regime of single wells into separate layers was made according to its hydraulic transmissivity at the time of investigation the hw system was temporarily inactive it was therefore applied to the second layer with a pumping rate of 0 0 m3 d ten pumping wells of the ar barrier with a total capacity of 8 571 4 m3 d were implemented in the third layer the spatial distribution of river and well boundary conditions within the krajkowo island well field is shown in fig 4 constant head boundary conditions were defined at the mathematical model s edge 2 5 5 km from krajkowo island the heads of 1 3 numerical layer represent the hydraulic pressure of wbimv while the deeper layers 4 and 6 stands for the wbv locally in the hydrogeological windows areas these two groups are identical covering also layer 5 an effective infiltration has been calculated according to the potentiometric pressure of the quaternary aquifers and water discharge the area variability of the calculated effective infiltration is shown in fig 4 it amounts on average to 5 33 l s km2 460 68 m3 d km2 the high module of precipitation renewability results from induced groundwater resources generated for groundwater facilities located in river valleys pleczyński and przybyłek 1974 in the case of the rbf c these resources develop in the depression cone due to reduced evapotranspration storage of the surface water in winter half years and seepage from the underlaying miocene aquifer as stated by dabrowski et al 1993 the miocene inflow to the rbf f and the rbf c recharge is about 5 6 of an effective infiltration under these circumstances the contribution of the deeper aquifer was considered negligible and was skipped in model tests as been proved by matusiak et al 2018 such approach results in higher effective infiltration introduced to the model since it compensates for the lack of under layer s inflow the approach does not influence the surface groundwater relation and the bankfiltrate calculation 2 4 model calibration the challenge of modelling studies on the rbf problem concerns the limited convergence of predictive simulations with future observation especially if they go beyond the range of historical values abdalla and scheytt 2012 umar et al 2017 thus the first calibration step was performed for the hydrological drought period of 1992 to improve model performance and minimise uncertainty in the calculations in that time the depression cone lowered below 45 m a s l at the south part of the rbf f barrier reaching its maximum extent at that time the mosina krajkowo well field s withdrawal amounted to 136 000 m3 d and the rbf c contributed with 56 300 m3 d przybylek et al 2017 apart from operating and monitoring wells measurements the 1992 potentiometric map considered geodetically determined water stage positions in numerous oxbow lakes located on the warta s flood terrace an essential element in the recalibration process was implementing the technological changes in the protection channel construction of 2004 the validated model was then applied to solve the riverbed and the aquifer clogging under the 2017 state the model s revalidation revealed an increase in the riverbed s vertical hydraulic conductivity at the straight section of the river and a decrease at the bend compared to 1992 the calculated hydraulic heads at observation points compared to the field measurements differed by 0 0 0 686 m at the model and 0 008 0 464 m at krajkowo island the absolute residual mean was equal to 0 219 0 225 m and the correlation coefficients were 0 937 0 953 respectively thus the outcomes have been regarded as providing sufficient accuracy fig 6 this multi parameter and multi stage calibration of the model ensured that the geological structure was correctly implemented so the current values of the bankfiltrate and the travel time could be calculated 3 results 3 1 riverbed permeability as a result of the model calibration a contour map of hydraulic heads at krajkowo island area was achieved fig 7 the values of riverbed hydraulic conductivity based on model calibration ranged between 0 08 m d and 2 7 m d 0 7 m d aver the diversification of hydraulic conductivity distribution depends on the riverbed grain size and the intensity of clogging processes the most beneficial riverbed permeability 0 5 2 7 m d that favours rbf was noticed on the west side of the rbf c with average values in zones 1 0 68 m d 2 1 2 m d 3 0 84 m d 4 0 63 m d and 5 0 81 m d the poorest riverbed permeability 0 09 1 31 m d was discovered in the east side of the rbf c in zones 6 7 and 8 of 0 53 m d 0 42 m d and 0 42 m d aver respectively 3 2 water balance the next step was to calculate the water balance of the two barriers located on krajkowo island the water balance represented as volume indicates the flow rates of water entering and leaving the rbf recharge zones through river boundary conditions aquifer recharge and lateral off island inflow zones 1 8 fig 7 form the recharge area for rbf c and zone no 9 is the recharge area for ar which is supplied with 62 2 of surface water from infiltration basins and the remaining groundwater content flowing from the southeast outside of the protection channel its inactivity in this section is caused by weakly permeable peats forming its bottom in zone 9 the overall balance of rbf c indicates that the rate of rbf makes up 75 8 of rbf c withdrawal however it should be noted that some part of the surface water supplying the rbf c well barrier is related to the protection channel the estimated warta rbf has a 68 share in rbf c supply table 1 as confirmed by both the presented and archival hydrochemical studies gorski et al 2021 the share of surface water flowing into the rbf c barrier through porous aquifers demonstrates spatial diversity therefore based on the chloride differentiation and the location of the wells in relation to identified sources of supply and other filtration sites rbf c wells were grouped into 8 zones fig 7 according to the following relationships zone 1 a westernmost group of wells no 1 l 1al 1bl and 1cl with chloride concentrations between 42 and 46 mgcl l surface water originates from the warta river with a small share of the protective channel zone 2 wells 3 l 4 l 1 and 5 l 1 with chloride concentrations rising from 42 to 51 mgcl l surface water originates from the warta river with a small share of the protective channel but the circulation system may be additionally affected by an hw not active during the study presented zone 3 wells 7 l 1 9 l 1 and 11 l with the highest chloride concentrations in the 51 52 mgcl l range the surface water supply may originate from the warta with a small share of the protective channel zone 4 wells 13 l 14 l and 15 l 1 with chloride concentrations between 43 and 46 mgcl l at the study time water balance and chloride concentration in this zone may be sensitive to ar activeness as reported by gorski et al 2021 in 2005 when the ar was not operated chloride concentrations in this zone were much lower than in surrounding wells this is likely due to an increased groundwater inflow from behind the protection channel captured during the ar operation zone 5 wels no 17 l 1 19 l 21 l 1 23 l 1 24 l 1 25 l 26 l delineated along the straight section of the warta river apart from the warta river surface water may also be delivered by the northern parts of infiltration ponds fig 7 chloride concentrations generally decrease towards the east ranging from 31 to 46 mgcl l zone 6 at the bend wells 27 l 1 29 l with the lowest chloride concentration of 31 39 mgcl l zone 7 well no 30 l is clearly distinguished from the surrounding zones by its higher chloride concentrations both now 47 mgcl l and in earlier studies zone 8 the eastern group of wells no 31 l 1 34 l 1 35 l 37 l 1 39 l 1 is usually characterised by lower chloride concentration 32 36 mgcl l in 2017 although elevated cl concentrations 42 mgcl l were observed in well no 37 l 1 the modpath programme was applied via advective flow pathlines of groundwater streams heading towards the rbf c wells to designate these zones according to the calculated water flow balance table 2 the highest share of surface water in the supply of the rbf c wells is marked in zones 3 4 5 and 7 81 1 89 3 in zones 1 and 2 the share of surface water is 76 6 78 1 in addition to the warta rbf there is a significant water supply from the protective channel on the other hand the lowest share of surface water in the well supply is recorded in zone 6 41 1 and 8 41 2 3 3 travel time the pathlines defined in the modpath programme were necessary to indicate not only where the surface water of the warta river supplying the aquifer is flowing but also how long it takes to reach every single well of the rbf c barrier fig 7 an effective porosity value was given to each cell in the grid to estimate travel times the forward and backward tracking option was used to designate river well flow travel times in the first step particles were tracked backwards from the pumping wells layers 3 6 towards the river layer 1 to acquire the particle starting location s origin for the next step forward tracking the backward tracking particle endpoints have defined a privileged zone of river aquifer outflow the new forward tracking particle starting locations were determined for each river cell in this zone based on these data these forward tracking particles made it possible to calculate the river well advective travel times fig 7 out of which mean values were calculated table 3 only the travel times along the shortest and the external lines of each well supply zone are shown to improve the figure s 8 readability the estimated travel times from the river to individual rbf c wells reached 13 231 days 22 2 112 3 on average table 3 particles travelled from 65 6 293 4 m average 86 4 198 6 m at a velocity of 0 9 5 5 m day average 1 6 4 3 m day 3 4 estimation of rbf intensity the results of groundwater flow modelling using visual modflow allowed to determine the rate and the scale of rbf and its diversification along the rbf c facility which are quantified as the calculated specific infiltration per river unit area and the calculated specific infiltration per unit riverbank table 4 determining these parameters was based on the water flow balance which quantifies the total amount of fluxes out of the river cells in zones 1 8 calculation of these comprehensive parameters includes riverbed and the aquifer permeability wells discharge and hydraulic gradient diversification the rbf c average infiltration per unit area equals 0 38 m3 d m2 and the calculated specific infiltration per unit riverbank is 15 2 m3 d m both of these parameters were the highest in zones 4 and 5 0 35 0 43 m3 d m2 and 23 0 31 6 m3 d m and the lowest in zones 6 and 8 0 06 0 12 m3 d m2 and 4 6 7 7 m3 d m indicating the capacity of these zones for rbf 4 discussion the rbf c facility presented here is fed from different supply sources that intermingle hindering the identification of factors that control the fate of rbf thus difficult to confirm by analytical calculations in most reported cases it is the well field distance to the river course to be claimed as one of the key factors determining the banfiltrate ratio and its travel time wells further from the river are thought to have a higher proportion of ambient groundwater and longer travel times of bankfiltrate ray and jain 2011 shankar et al 2009 some researchers have also pointed to the influence of well type and its screen depth ray and jain 2011 or the pumping rate of bankfiltrate volume shamsuddin et al 2015 moreover aquifer head and transmissivity have great impact as stated by bartak et al 2015 in the case of rbf c presented here the type and magnitude of each well s recharge components are the combinations of factors affecting rbf efficiency and water quality improvement which are distance to the warta river and other recharge elements protective channel infiltration basins pumping rate filtration depth basin transmissivity site hydrology time and space differential intensity of clogging hence it is indispensable to use mathematical modelling to quantify potential sources of supply in this resourceful aquifer where a small change in hydraulic pressure significantly affects the well s recharge components the hydrochemical image was very useful in reliable determining the rbf variability the rbf c wells technical and hydrogeological setting and the chloride concentrations allowed to delineate multiple zones reflecting the rbf varying contribution the average share of bankfiltrate was established at 75 8 with the spatial differentiation along the rbf c barrier in a wide range of 41 1 89 3 one reason for this variation in rbf intensity is the spatial diversity of the clogging processes development over several decades of barrier operation clogging development usually results in a decrease of the rbf performance in the rbf c the insufficient river water quantities are compensated by the inflow of ambient groundwater a more significant share of groundwater 58 9 61 was found in zone 6 at a river bend 41 1 of bankfiltrate and zone 8 in the east 41 2 of bankfiltrate respectively in case of zone 8 the geological structure partly hinders rbf due to the occurrence of the interlayer of poorly permeable formations wells no 33 l 37 l fig 3 the model allowed to identify zones at risk of deep clogging processes intensification aquifer clogging and those less susceptible to deep clogging riverbed clogging only the effect of deep clogging was found particularly in the highly convex meander section of the warta river zone 6 initially very good rbf conditions occurred in this zone due to the development of deep erosion reaching coarse sediments under blocking conditions of lateral erosion through engineering construction groyne however this situation favoured the intensive development of clogging by subsequent remobilisation of the mineral suspension and plankton into the aquifer which limited the rbf efficiency the presented example reveals the shortcomings of considering meanders as favorable conditions for rbf as stated by grischek et al 2002 thus under certain conditions the possibility of developing intense aquifer clogging should be considered by contrast at the straight section of the river zones 1 5 the presence of fine and medium grained bed sediments prevented the penetration of organic suspended solids into the aquifer in these zones the ratio of bankfiltrate was 76 6 89 3 interestingly this part of the river was the most heavily clogged in 1992 przybylek et al 2017 and subsequently regenerated by the scouring process during the warta floods and river icing the results confirm previous hypotheses put forward by stuyfzand et al 2004 that less permeable sandy riverbed can sustain a higher recharge rate for a longer time than gravel beds with high permeability since the sediment remains on the riverbed surface and is sheared off by river flow in the rbf c presented the magnitude of ambient groundwater inflow is strongly influenced by the wells position relative to the regional groundwater flow direction the privileged groundwater inflow to the eastern part of the barrier zones 6 and 8 is largely inducted by its favourable perpendicular relationship to the regional water flow direction occurring from east to west in the wbv aquifer captured by the rbf c filters an exception is seen in well 30 l zone 7 where a high surface water contribution of 81 1 is observed it is probably the groundwater drainage effect by an oxbow lake existing outside the island in the flow direction fig 4 which may not be marked at low water levels drought scenario in the rbf c facility s western parts zones 1 5 a high proportion of bankfiltrate at 76 6 89 3 is documented low groundwater ratio in these zones is mainly influenced by the proximity of the wbv aquifer boundary fig 2 limiting the groundwater inflow moreover a part of the southern groundwater inflow is intercepted by the ar facility so it does not flow into zones 4 5 and is compensated by the rbf the developed model allowed for the reliable parametrisation of rbf effectiveness by determining 1 infiltration per unit area and 2 specific infiltration per unit riverbank these parameters reflect all relationships mentioned above and describe bankfiltrate and groundwater s contribution to each zone s recharge and the rbf variability in different river sections assessing indexes for the rbf effectiveness like leakage coefficient is a common cost effective approach in analysing the rbf potential it is especially widespread in controlling german rbf sites operation grischek and bartak 2016 unlike the analytical solutions based on monitoring transects in case of such data rich rbf sites the modelling approach tends to be more accurate in results as it incorporates several factors such aquifer spreading river drop and hydraulic gradient the geometry of the river width and depth riverbed thickness and grain size analysis or the schedule of the withdrawal even though this method is regarded as time consuming abdalla and scheytt 2012 the most favourable conditions required for rbf c performance were found along zones 4 and 5 this region is characterised by the highest values of the following factors surface water infiltration per unit area 0 35 0 43 m3 d m2 and calculated specific infiltration per unit riverbank 23 0 31 6 m3 d m table 4 moreover the shortest travel times between the river and wells are observed in this area 13 3 20 6 days and the highest share of surface water supply 83 4 85 0 m3 d in contrast the least beneficial rbf operation terms are found on the river bend zone 6 and its eastern side zone 8 the calculated value of surface water infiltration per unit area and calculated specific infiltration per unit of riverbank in this zone decrease to 0 06 12 m3 d m2 and 4 6 7 7 m3 d m respectively while the warta surface water contribution decreases to 41 1 and 39 0 m3 d an essential element in the rbf operation is bankfiltrate travel time since it controls the pollutants removal efficiency kühn and müller 2000 dragon et al 2018 kruc et al 2019 the technique of backward and forward particle tracking has indicated a privileged zone of river aquifer outflow as the minimum and maximum bankfiltrate travel times in each zone have an extensive range that would not be easy to interpret the arithmetic mean was therefore calculated the average travel time of bankfiltrate calculated according to the proposed method proved high convergence with the entire supply zone s balance the shortest times were recorded in zones 4 and 5 along the river s straight section 13 3 20 6 days 22 2 42 2 days aver meanwhile the most extended times were recorded in zones 6 and 8 wells 29 l 37 l and 39 l table 3 with the travel times reaching 36 4 150 0 days with an average of 47 5 112 3 days respectively particles located in the eastern part of krajkowo island take longer to arrive at the wells of zone 8 since they travel a longer distance 121 7 293 4 m average 138 8 198 6 m and are passing through poorly permeable organic sediments such as muds and peats interbedding the aquifer and sealing the bottom of the protective channel the rbf travel time estimation based on temperature measurements indicates that the bankfiltrate travel time in summer oscillates within 1 1 5 months and rises to about 3 months in winter przybylek and kasztelan 2017 according to modelling research the average travel time at the rbf c is 54 9 days and vary significantly along the barrier the standard deviation is 33 9 since the method used indicates preferential flow paths from the river aquifer outflow privileged zone which tends to follow the river s current it may give shorter travel times than calculating average travel times considering the remaining more clogged width of the river 5 limitation of the methodology our study combine chloride concentration with modelling studies however it should be noted that the use of chemistry surveys in the identification of balance zones requires that all of the input data collected on chemistry piezometric pressure and water abstraction must be simultaneous before reuse the model has to be re estimated mainly in terms of geometry and hydraulic resistance of the river bed due to scouring or clogging effects based on precipitation surface and groundwater measurements and the withdrawal pattern this procedure which is not as time consuming as building a new model will allow new values for the parameters determining the rbf intensity to be calculated and compared with archival simulations it would be beneficial to extend the input data to improve the accuracy of the obtained results e g with a tracer test to measure porosity and to perform modelling under the assumption of non steady state flow the evaluation of water balance travel times infiltration per unit area and specific infiltration per unit of riverbank established in this research are representative only for the rbf c at krajkowo island 2017 steady state nevertheless the rbf effectiveness evaluation s primary principle can be used as a scientific reference for other rbf site management 6 conclusions the presented model was constructed for the rbf well field mosina krajkowo that has been operated for several decades the model involved the complex scheme of surface water and abstraction wells warta river protective channel infiltration basins vertical and horizontal wells in such systems mathematical modelling is a valuable tool for quantifying the rbf efficiency variables based on the model results parameters describing the well field s operation were determined the overall share bankfiltrate was found at 75 8 with the spatial distribution from 41 1 0 89 3 the variation in rbf efficiency defined as the calculated infiltration per river unit area varied from 0 06 to 0 43 m3 d m2 and specific infiltration per unit riverbank from 4 6 31 6 m3 d m this diversity confirms the rbf performance sectional analysis s usefulness in managing this type of site the shortest travel times less than 50 days corresponded to zones with the highest share of bankfiltrate 80 the calculated infiltration per unit area of 0 38 m3 d m2 and the specific infiltration per unit of riverbank of 15 2 m3 d m indicated the best conditions for the rbf in zones where the highest proportion of surface water and the shortest travel time was established the use of chloride differentiation in relation to rbf c wells technical and hydrogeological setting to distinguish balance zones with a varied share of bankfiltrate combined with hydrodynamic and geologic data highly increases the estimates reliability the model proved that the highly convex meander zones are at risk of deep clogging especially if the erosion reaches the coarse sediments in its bottom and is accompanied by subsequent remobilisation of the suspension into the aquifer aquifer clogging the combination of these factors leads consequently to the limitation of the rbf efficiency over time the straight sections of the river built of fine and medium sediments were less susceptible to the clogging process they could sustain a higher rbf rate for a long time because the scouring process during the floods and icing periods subsequently regenerates it the proposed method of analysing rbf performance s effectiveness at particular sections of the river may prove useful as a reference to other rbf suppliers in designing optimising and developing other such rbf sites which are playing an increasingly important role in the water supply of urban agglomerations by using groundwater flow modelling the operation of the rbf facility can be consciously controlled the awareness of the model estimated variability in the rbf along the river may be crucial in managing the rbf site especially when surface water carries a high pollutant load the knowledge of the rbf performance at each section of the rbf facility may help decide whether to exclude wells with the highest contribution of bankfiltrate and shortest travel times favouring those with a higher contribution of groundwater and longer travel times it will also allow an estimate of the acceptable rate of operation for each barrier section so that the lower limit of time needed to remove pathogens contained in the bankfiltrate is not exceeded author statement magdalena matusiak conceptualization methodology validation investigation resources writing original draft writing review editing visualization krzysztof

8127,study region poland warta river catchment study focus the study aimed to explain the reasons for spatial variability in chloride concentrations at the mosina krajkowo riverbank filtration rbf site located along the river this variability is attributed to rbf s different intensity along the river sections related among others to clogging development the rbf effectiveness was studied using groundwater flow modelling by examining the water balance in zones established on hydrogeological setting and chloride concentrations travel time of the bankfiltrate investigation rbf parametrisation i e infiltration per unit area and specific infiltration per unit of riverbank new hydrological insights for the region the study identifies zones of the most favourable rbf conditions and establishes the variability causes the overall share bankfiltrate was found at 75 8 its spatial variation ranged widely from 41 1 89 3 confirming the usefulness of the rbf performance sectional analysis in managing this type of site the highest proportion of surface water 80 occurred along the straight river section where the riverbed was built by fine and medium sands preventing penetration of organic suspension into the aquifer in contrast the lowest values 42 occurred in the meander zone with the most favourable rbf conditions at the beginning of site operation where deep erosion reached coarse grained sediments in the river bottom followed by the development of clogging processes and a decrease in the rbf efficiency with time keywords riverbank filtration numerical modelling riverbed clogging modflow modpath 1 introduction the technique of rbf has been used in europe for more than 150 years grischek et al 2002 it is become worldwide particularly in the united states israel india and china hu et al 2016 ray et al 2002 sandhu et al 2011 the rbf systems ensure the long term productivity and stability of the water supply especially for large cities however the riverbed s clogging caused by poor water quality associated with particulate organic matter and supported by aquifer overexploitation has already significantly weakened the rbf systems sustainability wang et al 2015 przybylek et al 2017 it has been reported that most rbf facilities face a severe clogging problem within a short operation time chu et al 2019 du et al 2013 rinck pfeiffer et al 2000 one of the critical factor controlling the rbf capacity is the natural permeability of the aquifer and the riverbed that might decrease under forced abstraction sepaskhah and sokoot 2010 on the other side the well design and operation practices also play a significant role in rbf performance and its durability over time grischek et al 2002 sprenger et al 2011 stuyfzand 1989 the permeability of the riverbed may also vary with the dynamic changes of hydrological conditions which favour sediment accumulation at low flows and bed scouring at high flows thus it cannot be regarded as constant hiscock and grischek 2002 schubert 2002 the intense production capacity of rbf systems is commonly needed to provide the expected water quantity but the balance between the rate of bankfiltrate and the residence time of contaminants must be considered to maintain sufficient water quality gutiérrez et al 2017 this balance may be provided by the rbf operational control of increasing the inflow of usually unpolluted groundwater during periods of poor river water quality thus designing the new rbf system and its stable functioning requires investigating factors affecting rbf and water quality improvement which are considered to be river well distance pumping rate filtration depth basin transmissivity and site hydrology ray and jain 2011 it is also essential to determine bank filtration conditions of various river sections i e meanders and oxbow lakes grischek et al 2002 lautz and siegel 2006 herrmann et al 2015 mustafa et al 2016 different methods of assessing rbf effectiveness are reported in the literature in germany it is common practice to analyse the rbf system s operational conditions using indicators such as the leakage coefficient grischek and bartak 2016 in case of rbf the use of natural tracers especially a chloride mass balance or isotopic composition is also considered to help evaluate the mixing ratio of groundwater and the infiltrate dillon et al 2002 ghodeif et al 2016 forizs et al 2005 kruc et al 2018 abou zakhem and hafez 2012 another approach used by researchers studying rbf problems is groundwater flow modelling which is generally applied to investigate groundwater flow patterns zhou and li 2011 this technique is suitable for determining surface water groundwater interactions boano et al 2013 and water balance testing lautz and siegel 2006 herrmann et al 2015 in the previous studies mathematical modelling was most often used in designing rbf well fields but modelling studies on long term operated rbf facilities are rare it was applied e g to simulate factors affecting rbf system operation grischek et al 2002 under variable hydrological conditions e g long hydrological dry and wet seasons the researchers used models to test various positions of wells in relation to the river or infiltration basin many studies have considered the significance of the dilution effect and prolonged travel time for wells situated farther from the surface water shamsuddin et al 2015 sprenger et al 2011 while others have emphasised that it is the pumping rate that has the dominant influence on the volume of the bankfiltrate abdel fattah et al 2008 this article presents a complex long term operated mosina krajkowo well field consisting of several rbf facilities rbf sites fed from different supply sources that intermingle making the above observations challenging to confirm explicitly in an analytical manner in such systems mathematical modelling seems to be the only method to solve and quantify the rbf efficiency variables however high quality input data are required to minimise the uncertainty of the model outputs the study focuses on the rbf c facility located parallel to the river where differentiation in chloride concentration was noticed therefore a three dimensional hydrogeological model was created to explain the causes of chloride variability investigate rbf effectiveness and identify clogging issues along the river sections the goal was achieved by i evaluating the water balance ambient groundwater surface water mixing and its differentiation in specific zones established according to rbf c wells technical and hydrogeological setting and the chloride differentiation in surface and groundwater ii investigating the groundwater flow path and the travel time from the river to individual wells and iii calculating the parameters describing the conditions of surface water infiltration i e infiltration per unit area and specific infiltration per unit riverbank our study unlike previous ones demonstrates the importance of sectional analysis in understanding and forecasting factors affecting rbf efficiency 2 methods 2 1 site description the presented research was carried out at the mosina krajkowo rbf well field the main water supply for the poznań agglomeration poland the well field is located on the floodplain and higher terrace on the left side of the warta river valley between mosina town and krajkowo village and consists of fig 1 terrace barrier rbf f containing 56 vertical wells with a depth of 38 0 52 0 m and a capacity of 50 150 m3 h spaced between 100 150 m on a length of 7 150 m krajkowo island an area separated by watercourses the warta river and an artificially formed protective channel with the following water well fields riverbank filtration rbf c 29 vertical wells with a depth of 35 0 46 5 m and a capacity of 90 120 m3 h located in a protective embankment with a length of 1 980 m recharged by the rbf from the warta river the upper edges of the well screens are located at depths of 12 16 m b g l a barrier of artificial infiltration ar 11 vertical wells with a depth of 20 0 25 0 m and a capacity of 40 45 m3 h supplied from three artificially formed infiltration basins and one natural pond stocked by pipelines with water from the warta river horizontal well hw consisting of collecting well with a diameter of 8 m and a depth of 12 m from which 8 horizontal drains were derived with a total active length of 718 m arranged at a depth of 5 m under the bottom of the warta river gorski et al 2011 the two major groundwater basins mgbs the wielkopolska buried valley wbv and the overlapping warszawa berlin ice marginal valley wbimv occur fig 2 which makes it a region with favourable hydrogeological conditions the upper aquifer wbimv is built of fine and medium grained sands of fluvial origin to a depth of 10 m and coarse grained sands and gravels of fluvio glacial origin to 20 m below ground level the deeper aquifer wbv is composed of fluvial fine and medium grained sands in the upper part to a depth of 25 30 m and coarse grained fluvio glacial sands and gravels in the deepest part of the aquifer locally these two aquifers with a total thickness of up to 40 m gorski et al 2018 are separated by glacial tills of 10 m thick there are also lenses of peats muds and clays interbedding the aquifers fig 3 as the weakly permeable sediments form a semi aquitard disturbed by extensive hydrogeological windows the difference in pressures between the wbimv and the wbv is insignificant but may reach up to 0 25 0 5 m in areas where poorly permeable sediments occur fig 4 the geological structure and hydrogeological conditions are recognised in detail within the modelling area over the years of the mosina krajkowo well field operation more than 500 hydrogeological boreholes and wells were made to investigate the water flow terms the rbf facilities wells are monitored in terms of the water withdrawal and the piezometric state position moreover 70 observation points are used for monitoring purposes fig 4 the variability of the surface water level is examined with loggers installed on the warta river protection channel and infiltration basin according to hydrological observations for the long term period 1991 2007 the average warta river level was 57 33 m a s l the lowest mean of warta level was 56 1 m a s l and the highest mean was 59 18 m a s l for this period przybylek and chomicki 2016 the average precipitation from 1985 to 2017 in the study area is 554 mm dragon et al 2019 the study s primary focus is the rbf c barrier which has been operated continuously since 1984 with a capacity of 45 000 60 000 m3 d the share of bankfiltrate is approx 75 at that capacity przybylek and kasztelan 2017 in this case surface water quality has a considerable influence on the overall potable water quality gorski et al 2019 wells of the rbf c site are characterised by different chloride content ranging between 31 0 and 56 0 in 2017 the lowest values below 40 mg l were observed in wells no 24 l 29 l and 31 l 35 l while the highest above 50 mg l characterised wells no 5 l 13 l fig 1 chloride concentrations in the warta river prior to the modelling study august october 2017 range of 45 60 mgcl l were documented as the concentrations of conservative pollutants are considered an indicator of water balance and water sources clark 2015 kruc et al 2018 the differentiation of chloride concentration of the abstracted water combined with hydrogeological setting of the rbf c wells was used to separate the balance zones fig 3 2 2 model characteristics visual modflow software has been used to simulate steady state three dimensional groundwater flow at the rbf site mosina krajkowo the numerical model covers 50 km2 5 10 km consisting of 196 rows and 380 columns to give more detailed consideration to surface water groundwater interactions under the rbf mosina krajkowo operation a perpendicular grid of variable cell sizes was implemented in adjacent krajkowo island the grid size has been refined to 10 10 m compared to the 50 50 m block size deployed in the remaining model area fig 4 according to the hydrogeology of the region the two major quaternary basins wbv and wbimv have been divided into 6 modelling layers regarding both sediment gradation and well barrier technical specifications well screen intervals fig 5 the top three layers are representative of the wbimv while the other layers reflect the occurrence of the wbv such a specific approach provided for vertical flow diversification induced by 3 pumping systems rbf c ar and hw of variable depth affecting each other the site morphology limited the model top and neogene clays occurrence specified the bottom the overall thickness of the modelled aquifers was approx 40 m 2 3 model input data as the simulation s accuracy improves with the incorporated data s high quality anderson et al 2015 comprehensive geological and hydrogeological studies were used to build the model almost 500 drilling profiles and basic hydrogeological pumping tests were used to specify the aquifers borders hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity as well as the elevation of the modelled layers the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifers in distinguished layers varies between 2 4 36 m d layer i 16 8 72 m d layer ii 24 120 m d layer iii 16 8 60 m d layer iv 0 24 28 8 m d layer v and 48 120 m d layer vi the vertical conductivity of semi aquitards range between 0 24 and 0 0024 m d an effective porosity was assumed by relation to the grain size distribution based on literature rembeza 1998 gravels were given values of 0 26 0 3 coarse grained sands 0 21 medium sands from 0 19 fluvioglacial aquifers to 0 21 buried valleys fine sands 0 16 silty sands 0 12 tills 0 1 an effective porosity value of 0 1 0 21 was used for layer 1 and of 0 1 0 3 for layers 2 6 the mean values calculated as the average of all active blocks in a given numerical layer were 0 13 for layer 1 layers 2 and 3 were 0 18 layer iv was 0 2 layer v was 0 13 and layer vi was 0 19 the recognition of warta riverbed morphology and lithology covered 40 drillings przybylek et al 2017 in general the warta riverbed is situated at 54 8 56 5 m a s l and decreases to 51 0 m a s l at the river bend due to intensified erosion the riverbed mostly comprises fine and medium sands except the river bend where deep erosion reached coarse sands and gravels the bottom sediment thickness was assumed to be uniform at 1 m for all river boundaries the technical specification of the protection channel has also been comprehensively analysed the western part of channel bed sediments is represented by fine and medium grained sands while on the eastern side they consist of peats the channel profile of approx 20 40 m width was rebuilt in 2004 the newly formed channel was deepened to about 2 3 m depth its northern shore was constructed as a sandy sloping shelf to increase its bank filtration towards the rbf c barrier the opposite shore was sealed with paving using a 10 m model block size within krajkowo island allowed applying this variability in the model simulation the field studies were carried out in a net of 89 abstraction and observation points to generate potentiometric maps of the wbimv and the wbv aquifers groundwater level measurements were performed on 16 19 october 2017 these measurements were used as model calibration points for hydrogeological modelling surface water monitoring data were also considered during the study the warta river stage adjacent to krajkowo island was in the multi year average i e from 58 0 in the west to 58 5 m a s l in the east at 70 80 m width the water level of the protection channel varied between 58 05 58 46 m a s l while the stage of the infiltration basins reached 58 14 58 8 m a s l at a depth of 0 64 1 3 m all river boundary conditions were implemented in the first upper numerical layer as reported by the pumping well schedule in october 2017 total groundwater withdrawal by 26 active wells of rbf c located mostly 50 80 m from the left warta riverbank amounted to 46 732 5 m3 d well screen intervals of rbf c penetrate the investigated aquifer at depths corresponding to the 4 6 mathematical layers fig 5 diversification of the discharge regime of single wells into separate layers was made according to its hydraulic transmissivity at the time of investigation the hw system was temporarily inactive it was therefore applied to the second layer with a pumping rate of 0 0 m3 d ten pumping wells of the ar barrier with a total capacity of 8 571 4 m3 d were implemented in the third layer the spatial distribution of river and well boundary conditions within the krajkowo island well field is shown in fig 4 constant head boundary conditions were defined at the mathematical model s edge 2 5 5 km from krajkowo island the heads of 1 3 numerical layer represent the hydraulic pressure of wbimv while the deeper layers 4 and 6 stands for the wbv locally in the hydrogeological windows areas these two groups are identical covering also layer 5 an effective infiltration has been calculated according to the potentiometric pressure of the quaternary aquifers and water discharge the area variability of the calculated effective infiltration is shown in fig 4 it amounts on average to 5 33 l s km2 460 68 m3 d km2 the high module of precipitation renewability results from induced groundwater resources generated for groundwater facilities located in river valleys pleczyński and przybyłek 1974 in the case of the rbf c these resources develop in the depression cone due to reduced evapotranspration storage of the surface water in winter half years and seepage from the underlaying miocene aquifer as stated by dabrowski et al 1993 the miocene inflow to the rbf f and the rbf c recharge is about 5 6 of an effective infiltration under these circumstances the contribution of the deeper aquifer was considered negligible and was skipped in model tests as been proved by matusiak et al 2018 such approach results in higher effective infiltration introduced to the model since it compensates for the lack of under layer s inflow the approach does not influence the surface groundwater relation and the bankfiltrate calculation 2 4 model calibration the challenge of modelling studies on the rbf problem concerns the limited convergence of predictive simulations with future observation especially if they go beyond the range of historical values abdalla and scheytt 2012 umar et al 2017 thus the first calibration step was performed for the hydrological drought period of 1992 to improve model performance and minimise uncertainty in the calculations in that time the depression cone lowered below 45 m a s l at the south part of the rbf f barrier reaching its maximum extent at that time the mosina krajkowo well field s withdrawal amounted to 136 000 m3 d and the rbf c contributed with 56 300 m3 d przybylek et al 2017 apart from operating and monitoring wells measurements the 1992 potentiometric map considered geodetically determined water stage positions in numerous oxbow lakes located on the warta s flood terrace an essential element in the recalibration process was implementing the technological changes in the protection channel construction of 2004 the validated model was then applied to solve the riverbed and the aquifer clogging under the 2017 state the model s revalidation revealed an increase in the riverbed s vertical hydraulic conductivity at the straight section of the river and a decrease at the bend compared to 1992 the calculated hydraulic heads at observation points compared to the field measurements differed by 0 0 0 686 m at the model and 0 008 0 464 m at krajkowo island the absolute residual mean was equal to 0 219 0 225 m and the correlation coefficients were 0 937 0 953 respectively thus the outcomes have been regarded as providing sufficient accuracy fig 6 this multi parameter and multi stage calibration of the model ensured that the geological structure was correctly implemented so the current values of the bankfiltrate and the travel time could be calculated 3 results 3 1 riverbed permeability as a result of the model calibration a contour map of hydraulic heads at krajkowo island area was achieved fig 7 the values of riverbed hydraulic conductivity based on model calibration ranged between 0 08 m d and 2 7 m d 0 7 m d aver the diversification of hydraulic conductivity distribution depends on the riverbed grain size and the intensity of clogging processes the most beneficial riverbed permeability 0 5 2 7 m d that favours rbf was noticed on the west side of the rbf c with average values in zones 1 0 68 m d 2 1 2 m d 3 0 84 m d 4 0 63 m d and 5 0 81 m d the poorest riverbed permeability 0 09 1 31 m d was discovered in the east side of the rbf c in zones 6 7 and 8 of 0 53 m d 0 42 m d and 0 42 m d aver respectively 3 2 water balance the next step was to calculate the water balance of the two barriers located on krajkowo island the water balance represented as volume indicates the flow rates of water entering and leaving the rbf recharge zones through river boundary conditions aquifer recharge and lateral off island inflow zones 1 8 fig 7 form the recharge area for rbf c and zone no 9 is the recharge area for ar which is supplied with 62 2 of surface water from infiltration basins and the remaining groundwater content flowing from the southeast outside of the protection channel its inactivity in this section is caused by weakly permeable peats forming its bottom in zone 9 the overall balance of rbf c indicates that the rate of rbf makes up 75 8 of rbf c withdrawal however it should be noted that some part of the surface water supplying the rbf c well barrier is related to the protection channel the estimated warta rbf has a 68 share in rbf c supply table 1 as confirmed by both the presented and archival hydrochemical studies gorski et al 2021 the share of surface water flowing into the rbf c barrier through porous aquifers demonstrates spatial diversity therefore based on the chloride differentiation and the location of the wells in relation to identified sources of supply and other filtration sites rbf c wells were grouped into 8 zones fig 7 according to the following relationships zone 1 a westernmost group of wells no 1 l 1al 1bl and 1cl with chloride concentrations between 42 and 46 mgcl l surface water originates from the warta river with a small share of the protective channel zone 2 wells 3 l 4 l 1 and 5 l 1 with chloride concentrations rising from 42 to 51 mgcl l surface water originates from the warta river with a small share of the protective channel but the circulation system may be additionally affected by an hw not active during the study presented zone 3 wells 7 l 1 9 l 1 and 11 l with the highest chloride concentrations in the 51 52 mgcl l range the surface water supply may originate from the warta with a small share of the protective channel zone 4 wells 13 l 14 l and 15 l 1 with chloride concentrations between 43 and 46 mgcl l at the study time water balance and chloride concentration in this zone may be sensitive to ar activeness as reported by gorski et al 2021 in 2005 when the ar was not operated chloride concentrations in this zone were much lower than in surrounding wells this is likely due to an increased groundwater inflow from behind the protection channel captured during the ar operation zone 5 wels no 17 l 1 19 l 21 l 1 23 l 1 24 l 1 25 l 26 l delineated along the straight section of the warta river apart from the warta river surface water may also be delivered by the northern parts of infiltration ponds fig 7 chloride concentrations generally decrease towards the east ranging from 31 to 46 mgcl l zone 6 at the bend wells 27 l 1 29 l with the lowest chloride concentration of 31 39 mgcl l zone 7 well no 30 l is clearly distinguished from the surrounding zones by its higher chloride concentrations both now 47 mgcl l and in earlier studies zone 8 the eastern group of wells no 31 l 1 34 l 1 35 l 37 l 1 39 l 1 is usually characterised by lower chloride concentration 32 36 mgcl l in 2017 although elevated cl concentrations 42 mgcl l were observed in well no 37 l 1 the modpath programme was applied via advective flow pathlines of groundwater streams heading towards the rbf c wells to designate these zones according to the calculated water flow balance table 2 the highest share of surface water in the supply of the rbf c wells is marked in zones 3 4 5 and 7 81 1 89 3 in zones 1 and 2 the share of surface water is 76 6 78 1 in addition to the warta rbf there is a significant water supply from the protective channel on the other hand the lowest share of surface water in the well supply is recorded in zone 6 41 1 and 8 41 2 3 3 travel time the pathlines defined in the modpath programme were necessary to indicate not only where the surface water of the warta river supplying the aquifer is flowing but also how long it takes to reach every single well of the rbf c barrier fig 7 an effective porosity value was given to each cell in the grid to estimate travel times the forward and backward tracking option was used to designate river well flow travel times in the first step particles were tracked backwards from the pumping wells layers 3 6 towards the river layer 1 to acquire the particle starting location s origin for the next step forward tracking the backward tracking particle endpoints have defined a privileged zone of river aquifer outflow the new forward tracking particle starting locations were determined for each river cell in this zone based on these data these forward tracking particles made it possible to calculate the river well advective travel times fig 7 out of which mean values were calculated table 3 only the travel times along the shortest and the external lines of each well supply zone are shown to improve the figure s 8 readability the estimated travel times from the river to individual rbf c wells reached 13 231 days 22 2 112 3 on average table 3 particles travelled from 65 6 293 4 m average 86 4 198 6 m at a velocity of 0 9 5 5 m day average 1 6 4 3 m day 3 4 estimation of rbf intensity the results of groundwater flow modelling using visual modflow allowed to determine the rate and the scale of rbf and its diversification along the rbf c facility which are quantified as the calculated specific infiltration per river unit area and the calculated specific infiltration per unit riverbank table 4 determining these parameters was based on the water flow balance which quantifies the total amount of fluxes out of the river cells in zones 1 8 calculation of these comprehensive parameters includes riverbed and the aquifer permeability wells discharge and hydraulic gradient diversification the rbf c average infiltration per unit area equals 0 38 m3 d m2 and the calculated specific infiltration per unit riverbank is 15 2 m3 d m both of these parameters were the highest in zones 4 and 5 0 35 0 43 m3 d m2 and 23 0 31 6 m3 d m and the lowest in zones 6 and 8 0 06 0 12 m3 d m2 and 4 6 7 7 m3 d m indicating the capacity of these zones for rbf 4 discussion the rbf c facility presented here is fed from different supply sources that intermingle hindering the identification of factors that control the fate of rbf thus difficult to confirm by analytical calculations in most reported cases it is the well field distance to the river course to be claimed as one of the key factors determining the banfiltrate ratio and its travel time wells further from the river are thought to have a higher proportion of ambient groundwater and longer travel times of bankfiltrate ray and jain 2011 shankar et al 2009 some researchers have also pointed to the influence of well type and its screen depth ray and jain 2011 or the pumping rate of bankfiltrate volume shamsuddin et al 2015 moreover aquifer head and transmissivity have great impact as stated by bartak et al 2015 in the case of rbf c presented here the type and magnitude of each well s recharge components are the combinations of factors affecting rbf efficiency and water quality improvement which are distance to the warta river and other recharge elements protective channel infiltration basins pumping rate filtration depth basin transmissivity site hydrology time and space differential intensity of clogging hence it is indispensable to use mathematical modelling to quantify potential sources of supply in this resourceful aquifer where a small change in hydraulic pressure significantly affects the well s recharge components the hydrochemical image was very useful in reliable determining the rbf variability the rbf c wells technical and hydrogeological setting and the chloride concentrations allowed to delineate multiple zones reflecting the rbf varying contribution the average share of bankfiltrate was established at 75 8 with the spatial differentiation along the rbf c barrier in a wide range of 41 1 89 3 one reason for this variation in rbf intensity is the spatial diversity of the clogging processes development over several decades of barrier operation clogging development usually results in a decrease of the rbf performance in the rbf c the insufficient river water quantities are compensated by the inflow of ambient groundwater a more significant share of groundwater 58 9 61 was found in zone 6 at a river bend 41 1 of bankfiltrate and zone 8 in the east 41 2 of bankfiltrate respectively in case of zone 8 the geological structure partly hinders rbf due to the occurrence of the interlayer of poorly permeable formations wells no 33 l 37 l fig 3 the model allowed to identify zones at risk of deep clogging processes intensification aquifer clogging and those less susceptible to deep clogging riverbed clogging only the effect of deep clogging was found particularly in the highly convex meander section of the warta river zone 6 initially very good rbf conditions occurred in this zone due to the development of deep erosion reaching coarse sediments under blocking conditions of lateral erosion through engineering construction groyne however this situation favoured the intensive development of clogging by subsequent remobilisation of the mineral suspension and plankton into the aquifer which limited the rbf efficiency the presented example reveals the shortcomings of considering meanders as favorable conditions for rbf as stated by grischek et al 2002 thus under certain conditions the possibility of developing intense aquifer clogging should be considered by contrast at the straight section of the river zones 1 5 the presence of fine and medium grained bed sediments prevented the penetration of organic suspended solids into the aquifer in these zones the ratio of bankfiltrate was 76 6 89 3 interestingly this part of the river was the most heavily clogged in 1992 przybylek et al 2017 and subsequently regenerated by the scouring process during the warta floods and river icing the results confirm previous hypotheses put forward by stuyfzand et al 2004 that less permeable sandy riverbed can sustain a higher recharge rate for a longer time than gravel beds with high permeability since the sediment remains on the riverbed surface and is sheared off by river flow in the rbf c presented the magnitude of ambient groundwater inflow is strongly influenced by the wells position relative to the regional groundwater flow direction the privileged groundwater inflow to the eastern part of the barrier zones 6 and 8 is largely inducted by its favourable perpendicular relationship to the regional water flow direction occurring from east to west in the wbv aquifer captured by the rbf c filters an exception is seen in well 30 l zone 7 where a high surface water contribution of 81 1 is observed it is probably the groundwater drainage effect by an oxbow lake existing outside the island in the flow direction fig 4 which may not be marked at low water levels drought scenario in the rbf c facility s western parts zones 1 5 a high proportion of bankfiltrate at 76 6 89 3 is documented low groundwater ratio in these zones is mainly influenced by the proximity of the wbv aquifer boundary fig 2 limiting the groundwater inflow moreover a part of the southern groundwater inflow is intercepted by the ar facility so it does not flow into zones 4 5 and is compensated by the rbf the developed model allowed for the reliable parametrisation of rbf effectiveness by determining 1 infiltration per unit area and 2 specific infiltration per unit riverbank these parameters reflect all relationships mentioned above and describe bankfiltrate and groundwater s contribution to each zone s recharge and the rbf variability in different river sections assessing indexes for the rbf effectiveness like leakage coefficient is a common cost effective approach in analysing the rbf potential it is especially widespread in controlling german rbf sites operation grischek and bartak 2016 unlike the analytical solutions based on monitoring transects in case of such data rich rbf sites the modelling approach tends to be more accurate in results as it incorporates several factors such aquifer spreading river drop and hydraulic gradient the geometry of the river width and depth riverbed thickness and grain size analysis or the schedule of the withdrawal even though this method is regarded as time consuming abdalla and scheytt 2012 the most favourable conditions required for rbf c performance were found along zones 4 and 5 this region is characterised by the highest values of the following factors surface water infiltration per unit area 0 35 0 43 m3 d m2 and calculated specific infiltration per unit riverbank 23 0 31 6 m3 d m table 4 moreover the shortest travel times between the river and wells are observed in this area 13 3 20 6 days and the highest share of surface water supply 83 4 85 0 m3 d in contrast the least beneficial rbf operation terms are found on the river bend zone 6 and its eastern side zone 8 the calculated value of surface water infiltration per unit area and calculated specific infiltration per unit of riverbank in this zone decrease to 0 06 12 m3 d m2 and 4 6 7 7 m3 d m respectively while the warta surface water contribution decreases to 41 1 and 39 0 m3 d an essential element in the rbf operation is bankfiltrate travel time since it controls the pollutants removal efficiency kühn and müller 2000 dragon et al 2018 kruc et al 2019 the technique of backward and forward particle tracking has indicated a privileged zone of river aquifer outflow as the minimum and maximum bankfiltrate travel times in each zone have an extensive range that would not be easy to interpret the arithmetic mean was therefore calculated the average travel time of bankfiltrate calculated according to the proposed method proved high convergence with the entire supply zone s balance the shortest times were recorded in zones 4 and 5 along the river s straight section 13 3 20 6 days 22 2 42 2 days aver meanwhile the most extended times were recorded in zones 6 and 8 wells 29 l 37 l and 39 l table 3 with the travel times reaching 36 4 150 0 days with an average of 47 5 112 3 days respectively particles located in the eastern part of krajkowo island take longer to arrive at the wells of zone 8 since they travel a longer distance 121 7 293 4 m average 138 8 198 6 m and are passing through poorly permeable organic sediments such as muds and peats interbedding the aquifer and sealing the bottom of the protective channel the rbf travel time estimation based on temperature measurements indicates that the bankfiltrate travel time in summer oscillates within 1 1 5 months and rises to about 3 months in winter przybylek and kasztelan 2017 according to modelling research the average travel time at the rbf c is 54 9 days and vary significantly along the barrier the standard deviation is 33 9 since the method used indicates preferential flow paths from the river aquifer outflow privileged zone which tends to follow the river s current it may give shorter travel times than calculating average travel times considering the remaining more clogged width of the river 5 limitation of the methodology our study combine chloride concentration with modelling studies however it should be noted that the use of chemistry surveys in the identification of balance zones requires that all of the input data collected on chemistry piezometric pressure and water abstraction must be simultaneous before reuse the model has to be re estimated mainly in terms of geometry and hydraulic resistance of the river bed due to scouring or clogging effects based on precipitation surface and groundwater measurements and the withdrawal pattern this procedure which is not as time consuming as building a new model will allow new values for the parameters determining the rbf intensity to be calculated and compared with archival simulations it would be beneficial to extend the input data to improve the accuracy of the obtained results e g with a tracer test to measure porosity and to perform modelling under the assumption of non steady state flow the evaluation of water balance travel times infiltration per unit area and specific infiltration per unit of riverbank established in this research are representative only for the rbf c at krajkowo island 2017 steady state nevertheless the rbf effectiveness evaluation s primary principle can be used as a scientific reference for other rbf site management 6 conclusions the presented model was constructed for the rbf well field mosina krajkowo that has been operated for several decades the model involved the complex scheme of surface water and abstraction wells warta river protective channel infiltration basins vertical and horizontal wells in such systems mathematical modelling is a valuable tool for quantifying the rbf efficiency variables based on the model results parameters describing the well field s operation were determined the overall share bankfiltrate was found at 75 8 with the spatial distribution from 41 1 0 89 3 the variation in rbf efficiency defined as the calculated infiltration per river unit area varied from 0 06 to 0 43 m3 d m2 and specific infiltration per unit riverbank from 4 6 31 6 m3 d m this diversity confirms the rbf performance sectional analysis s usefulness in managing this type of site the shortest travel times less than 50 days corresponded to zones with the highest share of bankfiltrate 80 the calculated infiltration per unit area of 0 38 m3 d m2 and the specific infiltration per unit of riverbank of 15 2 m3 d m indicated the best conditions for the rbf in zones where the highest proportion of surface water and the shortest travel time was established the use of chloride differentiation in relation to rbf c wells technical and hydrogeological setting to distinguish balance zones with a varied share of bankfiltrate combined with hydrodynamic and geologic data highly increases the estimates reliability the model proved that the highly convex meander zones are at risk of deep clogging especially if the erosion reaches the coarse sediments in its bottom and is accompanied by subsequent remobilisation of the suspension into the aquifer aquifer clogging the combination of these factors leads consequently to the limitation of the rbf efficiency over time the straight sections of the river built of fine and medium sediments were less susceptible to the clogging process they could sustain a higher rbf rate for a long time because the scouring process during the floods and icing periods subsequently regenerates it the proposed method of analysing rbf performance s effectiveness at particular sections of the river may prove useful as a reference to other rbf suppliers in designing optimising and developing other such rbf sites which are playing an increasingly important role in the water supply of urban agglomerations by using groundwater flow modelling the operation of the rbf facility can be consciously controlled the awareness of the model estimated variability in the rbf along the river may be crucial in managing the rbf site especially when surface water carries a high pollutant load the knowledge of the rbf performance at each section of the rbf facility may help decide whether to exclude wells with the highest contribution of bankfiltrate and shortest travel times favouring those with a higher contribution of groundwater and longer travel times it will also allow an estimate of the acceptable rate of operation for each barrier section so that the lower limit of time needed to remove pathogens contained in the bankfiltrate is not exceeded author statement magdalena matusiak conceptualization methodology validation investigation resources writing original draft writing review editing visualization krzysztof

8128,study region the study region is germany and two sub regions in germany i e the state of rhineland palatinate and the city of reutlingen study focus opportunistic rainfall sensors namely personal weather stations and commercial microwave links together with rain gauge data from the german weather service were used in different combinations to derive rainfall maps with a geostatistical interpolation framework for germany this kriging type framework considered the uncertainty of opportunistic sensors and the line structure of commercial microwave links the resulting rainfall maps were compared to two gauge adjusted radar products and evaluated to three reference gauge datasets in the respective study regions on both daily and hourly basis new hydrological insights for the region the interpolated rainfall products from opportunistic sensors provided good agreement to the reference rain gauges the dataset combinations including information from the opportunistic sensors performed best the addition of rain gauges from the german weather service did not consistently lead to an improvement of the interpolated rainfall maps on the country wide daily scale the interpolated rainfall maps performed well but the gauge adjusted radar products were closer to the reference for the regional and local scale in rhineland palatinate and reutlingen with an hourly resolution the interpolated rainfall maps outperformed the interpolated product from dwd rain gauges and showed a similar agreement to the reference as the radar products keywords rainfall mapping opportunistic sensing personal weather stations commercial microwave links 1 introduction reliable rainfall measurement is crucial for monitoring and understanding the hydrologic cycle and climate variability it delivers important information for water resource management agriculture urban planning as well as for weather climate and hydrological modelling several measurement devices for rainfall observations were developed in the past while rain gauges of different types are used since the nineteenth century weather radar observations are operated for the past decades the spatial and temporal coverage of such measurement networks are unevenly distributed over the globe compared to other regions the rain gauges and weather radars in germany form a dense observation network lorenz and kunstmann 2012 still depending on the spatial and temporal scale of a rainfall event rainfall estimates can still be uncertain for example small convective events can be underestimated by weather radars or even missed completely by a network of rain gauges the respective disadvantages of the individual measurement systems are the reason behind potentially uncertain estimates of the spatio temporal distribution of rainfall cristiano et al 2017 quantitative precipitation estimates qpe from weather radars suffer from an uncertain z r relationship beam blockage and ground clutter amongst others berne and krajewski 2013 rain gauges can underestimate rainfall due to wind but more importantly the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall is not fully captured by point observations pollock et al 2018 new opportunities of measuring meteorological data are emerging with the increasing number and availability of opportunistic sensors in the last years zheng et al 2018 clark et al 2018 used humidity temperature and air pressure from personal weather stations pwss to track the path of a hailstorm the same variables from pwss together with air pressure temperature and radiation from cell phones as well as rainfall estimates from commercial microwave links cmls were used to examine a frontal system and the urban heat island effect over amsterdam de vos et al 2020 various different opportunistic rainfall sensors have already been investigated the attenuation along satellite tv link path due to rainfall was exploited barthés and mallet 2013 mercier et al 2015 windshield wiper frequency regulated by the optical rainfall sensor of a car were used to derive binary rainfall information mahoney and o sullivan 2013 rabiei et al 2013 rainfall estimates were derived from camera footage of rain allamano et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 with the emerging 5g network and the growing number of devices connected to the internet of things the number of potential sensors will further increase balsamo et al 2018 mccabe et al 2017 tauro et al 2018 in this study we use rainfall data from pwss and commercial microwave links cmls the nearly linear relationship between rainfall and the attenuation of microwave link signals operating with frequencies between 10 and 40 ghz is known for several decades atlas and ulbrich 1977 with the growth of modern telecommunication infrastructure for which cmls provide a large portion of the backhaul network an increasing number of microwave links became available and cmls were introduced as opportunistic rainfall sensor almost 15 years ago messer et al 2006 leijnse et al 2007 deriving rainfall estimates from cmls can be challenging because of several issues erratic signal behavior due to refraction reflection or multipath propagation as well as unknown relation to meteorologic variables cause fluctuation of the signal upton et al 2005 van leth et al 2018 likewise wet cml antennas can cause additional attenuation during and also after rainfall events until they are dry again fencl et al 2019 rainfall estimates from cmls were derived for diverse regions in the world mainly in europe e g andersson et al 2017 fencl et al 2017 overeem et al 2016b roversi et al 2020 van de beek et al 2020 but also for other countries as for example israel ostrometzky and messer 2018 brasil rios gaona et al 2018 west africa doumounia et al 2014 and china song et al 2020 an overview of the background and challenges in rainfall estimation from cmls was given by chwala and kunstmann 2019 and uijlenhoet et al 2018 respectively rainfall maps were derived from cmls often neglecting the path integrated nature of the estimated rain rate but rather using the center of each cml as a theoretical point measurement graf et al 2020 overeem et al 2016b some dedicated mapping algorithms were introduced but not analyzed on a larger scale liberman et al 2014 beek et al 2020 haese et al 2017 the potential and challenges using rainfall data from pwss were first shown by de vos et al 2017 pwss also provide other meteorological information bell et al 2013 jenkins 2014 but for our study from here on pwss will only refer to personal weather stations measuring rainfall pwss are rain gauges which are set up by individual citizens data from pwss are prone to numerous error sources ranging from calibration issues to poor maintenance and unfavourable positioning therefore a thorough quality check of pwss data is necessary an intrinsic approach using information of neighboring pwss was tested in the netherlands de vos et al 2019 the norwegian meteorological institute deployed an automatic data quality control for their meteorological station data which is supplemented by opportunistic data e g for temperature båserud et al 2020 another approach presented by bárdossy et al 2021 used data from a trustworthy primary network and a geostatistical method combined with rank statistics this approach is also used in our study to remove and bias correct suspicious pwss and cml data with modifications of the filtering approach to account for the line characteristic of the cml data this study aims to provide 1 a large scale evaluation of rainfall estimates from two types of opportunistic rainfall sensors 2 a geostatistical interpolation framework and 3 a related performance analysis of the derived rainfall maps using data from opportunistic sensors official rain gauges and various combinations of these datasets the performance analysis is carried out on different spatial and temporal scales the interpolation framework takes the specific characteristics and uncertainties of the sensors into account and combines rainfall information from point and line sources with individual weights these sensors are official rain gauges from the german meteorological service dwd pwss data obtained from netatmo and cml data obtained from ericsson in germany the question we raise is how accurate can opportunistic sensors measure rainfall on a country wide regional and local scale specifically in germany the federal state of rhineland palatinate and the city of reutlingen respectively 2 study region and data 2 1 study region the study region is germany and our analysis was carried out on a national scale for the whole of germany with 357 386 km 2 on a regional scale for the state of rhineland palatinate with 19 847 km 2 and on a local scale for the city of reutlingen with 87 km 2 rainfall in germany is falling year round with a peak during the summer months the driest regions are located in the northeast with mean rainfall amounts of 450 mma 1 year highest rainfall amounts occur in the central german uplands with over 1000 mma 1 and in the alps with up to 2000 mma 1 rainfall in the northern part of germany is mostly influenced by synoptic driven processes while convective events become more frequent southwards rhineland palatinate is situated in the mid west of germany with yearly rainfall amounts between 500 and 800 mm between the rhine valley and the low mountain ranges of taunus and hunsrück the city of reutlingen is located in the south western state of baden wuerttemberg approximately 30 km south of the state capital stuttgart the density of hydro meteorologic measurements over germany and therefore also for rhineland palatinate and reutlingen is high compared to most other parts of the world lorenz and kunstmann 2012 the german weather service dwd operates a weather radar network and roughly 2000 rain gauges with daily and hourly temporal resolution several state agencies and private companies additionally operate hundreds of rain gauges which are partly used in rainfall products of the dwd the continuous measurement of precipitation in germany started more than a hundred of years ago with many gauge locations being sampled for multiple decades hellmann 1907 therefore the measurement of precipitation with additional opportunistic sensors and the generation of interpolated products from these sensors would not seem to be of primary importance in germany yet the spatio temporal variability of rainfall cannot be captured completely with common products derived from rain gauges and weather radars this is especially the case for short duration and high intensity rainfall which can cause flash floods berne et al 2004 emmanuel et al 2012 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 a striking example is the devastating flash flood in the city of braunsbach in 2016 in a 10 km radius around braunsbach only one rain gauge with a daily resolution is located radar data underestimated the rainfall measured from the rain gauge by 30 percent therefore it is uncertain whether the radar measurements of the peak rainfall several kilometers away from the gauge was estimated correctly bronstert et al 2018 with the increasing density of opportunistic sensor networks like the ones used in this study the probability that such sensors detect small scale events and their variability is also increasing we use the opportunity of having several independent rain gauge networks in germany to evaluate the rainfall maps derived from opportunistic rainfall sensors with our mapping approach on three different scales on the country wide scale for the whole of germany on the regional scale for rhineland palatinate and on the local scale for reutlingen we expect the higher network density of the opportunistic sensors to be beneficial especially on the regional and local scale 2 2 opportunistic rainfall data we use two types of opportunistic rainfall data namely pws data from the netatmo network https weathermap netatmo com and cml data from ericsson netatmo is a company selling pwss among other smart home devices their basic pws system which provides measurements of temperature humidity air pressure can be extended with an unheated tipping bucket gauge for rainfall measurement these rain gauges have a collecting area of 125 cm 2 and a temporal resolution of five minutes de vos et al 2019 gives further technical details to netatmo pwss if the owner agrees data from the pwss is uploaded to netatmo s weather map data is then available via an api in temporal resolutions down to five minutes the used dataset consists of all freely available pwss data from netatmo in germany in 2018 and 2019 fig 1 shows their continuously growing number of up to 15 000 by the end of our study period the reason for the decreasing numbers during winter was not investigated a possible explanation could be battery failure due to cold temperatures the spatial distribution of pwss in germany follows roughly the population density with most pwss situated in urban areas as for example shown in the map in fig 4 cml data are typically not publicly available but need to be provided by telecommunication providers we receive data from 3904 cmls from ericsson in germany via a near real time data acquisition system chwala et al 2016 the cml lengths range from 0 3 to 30 km and their frequencies from 10 to 40 ghz the spatial distribution of cmls is highly unbalanced throughout germany we currently only have access to a subset of cmls which is only a small part of the more than 100 000 cmls installed in germany bundesnetzagentur 2017 the distribution of the cmls in this subset is not representative for the general distribution of cmls in germany more information on the characteristics of this cml dataset are available from graf et al 2020 the analyzed periods are the summer season from april to october 2018 and 2019 as shown in fig 1 for previous years the availability of pwss was significantly lower and our country wide data acquisition for cmls in germany started in august 2017 we excluded months with high probability of snow since performance for both sensors decreases in winter pwss are not heated and cml suffer from snow and ice on their antennas as well as from large uncertainties of the relation between attenuation and snow and melting snow melting sown for example causes a many times higher attenuation than rain resulting in large overestimation of the precipitation event an overview of all used datasets and their respective usage is given in table 1 2 3 gauge and radar data we use two different gauge datasets operated by the dwd the first gauge dataset consists of 968 automatic pluviometers we use the hourly and quality checked data from these rain gauges referred to as dwdauto from here onwards in the interpolation framework section 3 3 the second gauge dataset referred to as dwdman consists of 1062 manual rain gauges with a daily resolution the collection diameter is 200 cm 2 and the gauges are heated this dataset is used as a reference for the country wide evaluation as it is independent of the dwdauto data both dwd gauge datasets have a density of roughly one gauge per 300 km 2 a network of 169 hourly rain gauges in rhineland palatinate is used for the evaluation on a higher temporal resolution these gauges are operated by the state agrometeorological agency of rhineland palatinate this dataset has a spatial density of roughly one gauge per 100 km 2 for the evaluation on the local scale we use hourly data from ten rain gauges situated in the city of reutlingen the ott pluviometers form a dense network of one gauge per 9 km 2 we use two radar datasets in this study namely radolan rw and radklim yw provided by the dwd radolan rw is a near real time product with an hourly resolution it is updated with 30 minutes lag time the gridded dataset covers germany with 900 by 900 grid cells with a 1 km resolution it is a composite of 17 weather radars adjusted via a weighted combination of additive and multiplicative corrections from the dwdauto gauge network bartels et al 2004 winterrath et al 2012 radklim yw is based on the same radar and gauge data as radolan rw but undergoes climatological adjustments accounting for e g range dependent underestimation and radar spokes due to beam blockage winterrath et al 2018 the adjustments are carried out with hourly data radklim rw but are also applied to the 5 minute data radklim yw which we use here the performance of radar and rain gauge products from the dwd were already analysed while especially during winter and in small catchments the differences in daily areal rainfall could exceed 50 kneis and heistermann 2009 meissner et al 2012 the mean yearly rainfall sums of dwd rain gauges and radar products compare well kreklow et al 2019 3 methods 3 1 cml and pws data preparation and processing cml data cannot be converted to a rainfall estimate directly several processing steps are required to obtain rain rates from raw cml attenuation data we use the processing routine described in graf et al 2020 with the exception of the classification of wet and dry periods where we use an improved method presented by polz et al 2020 first cmls with erratic data e g from drifts jumps or high levels of noise are removed from the dataset using two filters based on monthly statistics of the cml raw data data gaps shorter than 5 minutes are interpolated linearly then wet and dry periods are classified by a convolutional neural network trained to that specific task for each identified rain event the baseline of the signal is derived from the precedent dry period using this event specific baseline attenuation values are calculated which are then corrected for the additional attenuation caused by raindrops on the cml antennas from the final rain induced attenuation the rain rate can be calculated using the k r relation where k is the specific path attenuation in db km 1 and r is the rain rate in mmh 1 a detailed description of these steps as well as a large scale analysis can be found in graf et al 2020 we chose the new classification of wet and dry periods from polz et al 2020 because it reduces the false positive rate fpr while keeping the false negative rate fnr constant which is shown along with an evaluation of the combination of both methods for one month for the whole of germany in fig 9 of polz et al 2020 all introduced cml processing routines can be found in the software package pycomlink 2021 the resulting data consists of rain rates averaged along the cmls path with one minute temporal resolution this data is then aggregated to an hourly resolution except for hours with gaps longer than 5 minutes which were not interpolated in the first step the reason for the five minute interpolation besides rare connection problems of the data acquisition system is the engineering requirements of the cml network for each cml the combination of a given path length with a microwave frequency is chosen so that on average the path attenuation due to heavy rain leads to a complete signal loss at the receiver only for some minutes per year because the choice of the frequency and the path length are constrained only certain frequency bands are available high frequencies are desired to allow more bandwidth and path length is determined by the locations of cml towers the maximum rain rate before signal loss is different for all cmls it can be as low as 40 mmh 1 but also above 150 mmh 1 e g for very short cmls 1 km or shorter or for short cmls 5 km with low frequencies 20 ghz therefore for heavy rainfalls some cmls do not provide accurate rainfall information the pws data have been acquired via the netatmo api in time steps of variable length of typically 5 minutes and aggregated to hourly resolution additional information regarding the netatmo data acquisition can be found in de vos et al 2020 compared to the hourly data of the netatmo api which accepts up to eleven missing five minute values we have removed all hours with more than one missing five minute value 3 2 indicator correlation filter event based filter and bias correction the filtering and bias correction approach introduced by bárdossy et al 2021 was the basis for filtering and bias correcting the pws data in this study the cml data was also treated with this approach even though they already were pre processed with pycomlink which removed the worst performing cmls from the dataset problems we still encountered in the cml derived rain rates were strong overestimation of melting snow evident in april and october and other false positive events caused by attenuation which was not induced by rain which the rather liberal filtering of pycomlink did not remove the main assumption behind the indicator correlation filter is that the specific pws or cml values might be wrong but their ranks are correct especially for the most intense events using a reference network such as the dwdauto rain gauges which are installed according to the wmo guidelines the dependence between the nearest neighboring stations is investigated for each location the correlation value of the indicator series between the pairs of dwdauto pws or dwdauto cml is compared to the values between the dwdauto stations for similar separation distances and time periods hereby information on how precipitation varies in space is acquired and pws or cml locations with unreliable observations for high precipitation intensities are identified for the cml data we used an extended version of the indicator correlation filter to account for the geometric line structure of the cmls which is described in appendix b while the basic principle of the filter was unchanged the indicator correlation filter is applied on a yearly basis for all hourly pws and cml data fig 2 shows the results for the year 2019 after applying the filter around 92 of the pwss and of the cmls remained the number of pwss in fig 2 refers to the overall number of pwss providing data during 2019 while fig 1 shows the availability of pws measurements at each point in time which causes the different values even though the order of the values is assumed to be correct the pws and cml values remaining after the indicator correlation filter might have an unknown bias the bias varies individually for each location and each observation therefore the real precipitation amounts need to be estimated this is done for the observed hourly data for this purpose the precipitation distribution functions of the dwdauto stations are used for a target location and a given time step using the observed quantiles pws or cml the corresponding dwdauto quantiles are derived and the corresponding precipitation amount is interpolated through this procedure the possible bias available at the pws and cml locations is reduced the resulting time series are used further on in this study a more detailed description of both the indicator correlation filter and bias correction for the cml data can be found in appendix b while the indicator correlation filter removes opportunistic sensors for a whole year some remaining sensors can suffer from erratic measurements for individual events possible reasons can be low battery or clogged funnels for pwss as well as outages in the data acquisition or attenuation induced by other sources than rain for cmls we applied an event based filter after the bias correction which uses the variogram of the next 30 dwdauto stations to cross validate each sensor in order to remove faulty values if a sensors rainfall value differs too much from the value estimated by the variogram of the 30 stations here three times the kriging standard deviation it was rejected in order to preserve higher rainfall values and to focus more on discarding false zeros this filter used the square root of the rainfall sum this was the only modification of the event based filter which first was shown in bárdossy et al 2021 overall this filter removed around 0 6 of the pws data and 1 5 of the cml data 3 3 geostatistical interpolation framework we developed a geostatistical interpolation framework which allows a combination of different data sources and their specific features and geometric properties let x 1 x n be the locations of the dwdauto observation points y 1 y m the locations of the pwss after filtering and l 1 l k be the line segments of the cmls after filtering the estimation of the precipitation amounts z at a given location x is done by a combined kriging approach in which both the increased uncertainty of the pws and cml based precipitation is taken into account and the cml s line structure is considered by using a block kriging type approach the estimation is obtained in the form 1 z x i 1 n λ i z x i i 1 m α i z y i i 1 k β i z l i with the additional condition of unbiasedness 2 i 1 n λ i i 1 m α i i 1 k β i 1 the weights w t λ 1 λ n α 1 α m β 1 β k μ can be obtained by solving the linear equation system 3 a w c μ is the lagrange multiplier introduced to ensure the fulfilment of the unbiasedness condition eq 2 the matrix a is 4 a γ x 1 x 1 γ x 1 x n γ x 1 y 1 γ x 1 y m γ x 1 l 1 γ x 1 l k 1 γ x n x 1 γ x n x n γ x

l 1 γ x l k 1 here for any pair of points γ x i y j is the variogram value corresponding to the vector x i y j the combination of a point and a line segment requires a mean variogram value over the segment 6 γ x i l j 1 l j l j γ x i u du and for the consideration of pairs of line segments l i and l j one has to calculate the corresponding mean value 7 γ l i l j 1 l i l j l i l j γ u v du dv the ε y and the ε l values in the diagonal of the matrix represent the uncertainty of measurements of the pwss and the cmls respectively in our approach we selected a 10 error experimental variograms were calculated for each one hour time step using the dwdauto only and the filtered bias corrected pws data only the variograms were subsequently normalized and a k means clustering algorithm was used to divide them into 4 different groups theoretical variograms were fitted to each center of the cluster the fitted variograms differed mainly in the range which was between 12 5 and 40 0 km the variograms based on the dwdauto data showed no nugget effect while the pws based variograms had a nugget of about 10 this was the reason why the ε was selected as 10 of the sill the consideration of the length and orientation of the line segments is fully respected in this equation if one would replace each line segment with its central point as done e g in overeem et al 2016a the weights would be significantly different see fig a1 for an example all combinations of datasets and the respective interpolated products are given in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 cross validation of the interpolated rainfall products a leave one out cross validation is used to compare the performance between the interpolated products among each other at the location of the dwdauto stations for temporal aggregations between one hour and 30 days for the cross validation the target stations were removed for the whole procedure the filtering the assessment of the distribution function and for the interpolation of the precipitation amounts this allows us to evaluate the performance of the different interpolation products at the location of each dwdauto independently as diagnostic measures the pearson s correlation coefficient pcc the coefficient of variation cv and the kling gupta efficiency kge as well as the false positive fpr and false negative rate fpr are used their definitions can be found in appendix c because dwdauto was also used in four of the seven interpolation products the validation was carried out as a leave one out cross validation the results are shown in fig 3 a to c for all dwdauto stations as validation stations and in d to f for a selection of ten percent of dwdauto stations defined by the density of opportunistic sensors in close vicinity which we call selected validation stations from here on two groups of interpolation products are visible for all measures and both selections of stations this distinction was larger for the selected validation stations one group contained pwsint and the other combinations with pwss whereas the other group contained dwdint cmlint and their combination pwsint and the other combinations with pwss performed better for all three performance measures the interpolated products with opportunistic sensors had higher performance measures for the selected validation stations dwdint showed the worst performance for both all and selected validation stations the performance of opportunistic sensors increased when only validations stations surrounded by many pwss and cmls were considered we think that the heterogeneous distribution of opportunistic sensor networks of cmls and pwss shown in the map in fig 4 is the reason for this better performance dwdauto with its more homogeneous distribution performed similar between both validation station sets with increasing temporal aggregation the performance of all interpolated products increased the difference between all and selected validation stations was highest at short aggregations of one to 12 hours for pcc and kge for the aggregations over days they were similar this emphasizes the influence of quality and amount of sampling points when interpolating rainfall on sub daily temporal scales overall the combinations with pwss had the highest performance values while the interpolation product which used all three possible datasets dwd pws cmlint was not the overall best performing one even though it contained the highest number of sampling points a potential explanation is that dwdint measurements are considered more reliable and hence have a higher weight in the block kriging however their spatial density is the lowest on average we conclude that the large number and the accuracy of the opportunistic sensors lead to a better interpolation the block kriging approach in the interpolation framework accounts for the integral characteristic of the cmls the comparison to kriging with the center of each cml as point measurement cml pointint done in the same manner as in fig 3 shows a higher pcc for the block kriging approach see fig a2 for temporal aggregations of one and two hours cml pointint leads to higher kge values with the variance directly affecting kge values we assume that the reduced variance in cmlint of block kriging is the reason for the lower kge values 4 2 performance of interpolated rainfall products compared to gauge datasets on different scales the performance of the interpolated datasets is analyzed for the whole of germany a regional and a local subset with different independent reference datasets additionally two radar datasets from the dwd are compared analogously to the reference data 4 2 1 country wide daily scale for germany for the country wide scale we used data from manual rain gauges with a daily resolution from the dwd dwdman the interpolated rainfall maps and radar product values for this evaluation are taken at the respective grid cell of the locations of dwdman gauges an overview of the dwdman gauges pwss locations and cmls is given in the map of fig 4 together with results of the evaluation for this scale in general the radar products match the reference data better than the interpolated products they have slightly higher pcc and kge as well as a lower fpr the comparison is not quite fair though the radar products are based on measurements directly at each reference station s location while the interpolated rainfall fields have to rely on observations at a certain distance a distance that varies from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers in the north eastern part of germany nevertheless the performance measures of the interpolated products are good looking at the two radar products radklim yw outperformed radolan rw except for fpr this leads to the assumption that the climatological adjustments of radklim yw e g seasonal correction of range dependent underestimation improve this radar product not only for longer aggregations times from which the climatological corrections are derived but also on a daily scale among the interpolated products the ones including pwss compared better to the reference than the others the worst performance was obtained by cmlint these results are in accordance with the cross validation the scatter density plots show all daily rainfall values for pws cmlint and radolan rw against dwdman the number of missed rainy days false negative rate fnr from the reference visible along the x axis in fig 4 was lower for the interpolated product than for the radar product the performance of pwsint and the other combinations with pwss is better compared to the dwdauto product the reason for this is the high spatial density resulting from the high number of os this is true even though the os are heterogeneously distributed in contrast to the more homogeneously distributed dwdman this means that hydrological modeling studies which often use data from rain gauge networks can benefit from rainfall information derived from opportunistic sensors requirements for such applications are the availability of opportunists sensors the acquisition of their data and a thorough quality control similar to the cross validation the subset of dwdman surrounded by the densest opportunistic network were examined separately see fig a3 the results differ only slightly from the country wide analysis of fig 4 the range of the individual performance measures are more narrow and pwsint and cmlint have a small improvement similar to what was observed for the daily aggregation results of the cross validation this means that the density of opportunistic sensors is sufficient for rainfall mapping in almost all parts of germany except for the north eastern part of germany 4 2 2 regional hourly scale for rhineland palatinate as reference on a regional scale 169 rain gauges with an hourly resolution operated by the state agrometeorological agency of rhineland palatinate rlp are used an overview of the rhineland palatinate gauges pws locations and cmls is given in the map of fig 5 together with results of the evaluation for this scale for the pcc all interpolated products with opportunistic sensors outperformed the dwdint product pwsint and the other combinations with pwss performed almost as good as the radar products the combination pws cmlint reached marginally higher pcc values than pwsint cmlint has the highest negative bias this can be caused for example by the integral character of the cmls underestimating the highest rainfall events and the heterogeneous distribution of the cmls the fpr not shown in the plot for the evaluation at this scale of all products is 5 times smaller than fnr with the best performance for pwsint and pws cmlint radolan rw shows more over and underestimation of the highest hourly rainfall events which can be seen in the scatter plot the pws cmlint product underestimates the highest rainfall events which could be caused by a combination of the effect of the integral character of the cml measurement and the smoothing of the field caused by the 10 nugget that is used in kriging to represent the uncertainty of the opportunistic sensors moreover despite the thorough pwss quality check there could still be some stations that were not filtered and that recorded false zeros for the intense events affecting the performance of the interpolation products the biggest difference to the country wide dwdman reference evaluation is that the comparison to rlp is based on an hourly resolution on this temporal resolution rainfall shows more variability than on a daily scale hence on the hourly scale all interpolated and radar products have lower values for pcc and kge nevertheless the agreement of the best performing interpolation products with the reference data is high it can be assumed that for all regions with similar distribution and density of opportunistic sensors in germany similar results as for rhineland palatinate could be achieved that means opportunistic sensors can provide rainfall estimates with a good quality for most parts of germany with the exception of north eastern regions where their network density is low on an hourly scale 4 2 3 local hourly scale for the city of reutlingen ten rain gauges operated by the city of reutlingen rt are used to evaluate the performance of the interpolated products and radar datasets on a local scale with a temporal resolution of one hour an overview of the rt gauges pws locations and cmls is given in the map of fig 6 together with results of the evaluation for this scale the network of 10 rain gauges in and around reutlingen has a significantly higher density than the previous gauge datasets used as reference on this small scale the high number of pwss in this urban area becomes apparent with around thirty stations in reutlingen pwsint and the combinations with pwss compared best to the reference with a high pcc cmlint and combinations reproduce the reference rainfall values slightly better than dwdint dwdint as well as the radar products show a positive bias the reason could be the large distance of the next rain gauge which is also used to adjust the radar products the next rain gauges on this local scale are more than 15 km away and not located in the area shown by fig 6 this could make a difference in the rather complex terrain at the border of the swabian alps for the os products the bias is almost zero for the most intense events shown in the scatter plot of pws cmlint the opportunistic sensors are underestimated by the interpolated product upon closer inspection all reference rainfall points above 20 mm were from an event on the 12th of june 2018 lasting 3 hours while some of the pwss resembled the reference gauges rainfall almost perfectly others underestimated this event by a factor of ten the two cmls also underestimated the peak rainfall due to a complete loss of signal for a total of 12 and 21 minutes respectively we currently do not interpolate or fill gaps of this size in our processing the rainfall sum of the hour with this data gap is treated as missing value hence the one hour with the peak rainfall sum is missing from the cml data this rainfall event is an interesting opportunity to study the ability and required processing steps to measure intense events with pwss and cmls in the future first steps in this direction could be the improvement of the event based filter for pwss or filling cml outages caused by rain with the maximum of measurable rainfall at this cml apart from the city of reutlingen there are few cities which operate such a dense and high quality network of rain gauges only with such a dense network of conventional rain gauges we were able to evaluate the performance of opportunistic sensors on such a small scale the opportunistic sensors show very good results in estimating rainfall on this local scale therefore we conclude that rainfall information from pwss and cmls are highly valuable for the rainfall estimation in other urban areas with few or no conventional rain gauges this opens the possibility to use opportunistic rainfall sensors for applications in urban hydrology for all cities with a similar density of opportunistic sensors 4 3 performance for high intensity rainfall we investigated the potential of opportunistic sensors in capturing the most intense rain events with the leave one out cross validation results we performed the same analysis as in section 4 1 but only considered rain events above the 0 99 quantile level of each aggregation interval the results in fig 7 show pcc spearman s rank correlation coefficient scc and cv the scc defined in appendix c is used here because it credits the skewed distribution of rainfall for the pcc and cv the results are similar to the cross validation results for all rain events pwsint and combinations with pwss performed best while the combination of pwss and cmls was the overall best cmlint also outperformed dwdint for these two measures considering the scc the best results were obtained from pwsint without further combination both cml and dwd data could not add further information to increase the scc one reason for this might be the increased distance between cml and especially dwd sensors opposed by the high density of pwss for the scc dwd and cml performed similarly for one hour while dwd reaches higher values for aggregations between two and 120 hours for an analysis of the performance of the interpolated products and radar datasets for high intensity rainfall for the regional and local scale we show the scc for hourly rainfall sums in fig 8 the german wide scale is not shown as it is only available with a daily temporal resolution and an hourly evaluation for the whole of germany is already covered by fig 7 the three individual interpolated products show similar results on both scales as in fig 7 pwsint shows the overall highest scc while dwdint reaches slightly higher values than cmlint the combined interpolated products show a similar scc as the radar products except for dwd cmlint this again highlights the potential of exploiting dense opportunistic sensor networks on both regional and urban scales for hydrometeorologic purposes for the radar products the climatological adjustment seems to increase the scc marginally the lower scc values for cmlint on both scales could be caused by several reasons one reason for this is the engineering requirements of the cml network which allows an outage of the systems during the strongest rainfall events for some minutes this results in a maximum rain rate before signal loss between 40 mmh 1 and more than 150 mmh 1 depending on the exact cml configuration length frequency transmit power antenna gain thus for heavy rainfalls cmls do not always provide accurate rainfall information consequently the rank correlation for high rain intensities could be decreased for cmls another reason is the integral character of the cml measurements which gives the path averaged rain rate independently of the distribution of rain rates along the cmls path this leads to an underestimation of the highest rain rates along the path finally the effect of the classification of rainy and dry periods in the cmls processing has to be considered every wrong classification which can be caused by non rain induced attenuation multi path propagation or others will influence the fpr and fnr which ultimately have a large influence on the scc considering all this the hourly scc of cmlint is still close to the one of the conventional rain gauge product dwdint 4 4 rain event example in rhineland palatinate to illustrate the interpolation framework results for the different datasets we show an example for several interpolated rainfall maps from different combinations and radolan rw in rhineland palatinate in fig 9 on 12 july 2019 at 12 00 several rain cells are visible for all interpolation products and radolan rw for some regions the dwdauto network misses rainfall because the station density is too sparse this can be seen in the map showing the opportunistic sensors and dwdauto stations locations for dwdint the underlying structure of the network is clearly visible in comparison pws cmlint shows more variability in the rainfall field and with most features related to several opportunistic sensors the opportunistic sensors miss the most intense feature measured by the dwdauto gauges in the north of rhineland palatine while pwsint has the highest intensities further south we presume that the increased variability due to the larger number of measurements should be closer to the true spatio temporal distribution of rainfall most features and structures detected by radolan rw are visible in pws cmlint while the radar product produces higher rainfall values it seems that more opportunistic sensors lead to higher spatial variability in the interpolated rainfall fields which could potentially improve hydrological applications 5 conclusion the study region of germany with two sub regions namely the state of rhineland palatinate and the city of reutlingen are hydrometeorologically well monitored compared to most locations in the world and therefore provide a suitable testing ground to evaluate opportunistic rainfall sensors in this study we demonstrate the use of two different types of such opportunistic sensors we obtain rainfall fields using a geostatistic interpolation framework incorporating block kriging from point information of pwss and line information of cmls seven combinations of cml pws and official hourly rain gauge data from the dwd are evaluated for three different reference datasets in three study regions two radar products from the dwd were evaluated in the same manner as the interpolated datasets to further quantify the performance of the interpolated rainfall maps both pws and cml data come with individual drawbacks e g unfavorable locations of pwss or erratic fluctuations in the raw cml data after the respective data retrieval and the rainfall estimation for the cmls both datasets are filtered with an indicator correlation and event based method and are bias corrected only then they are used in different combinations with and without hourly rain gauge data from the dwd for interpolation while the presented indicator correlation filter approach relies on a primary station network the data from this network could potentially come from another period as the rain rates are compared and adjusted only by their distribution functions besides very high rainfall events i e with return periods of several years the rainfall distribution for individual years as used in this study might not change this distribution too much hence this approach could be usable for opportunistic sensors in areas where the number of rain gauges was reduced over the last decades because only their distribution function is needed to use the indicator correlation filter event based filter and the bias correction for data with higher temporal resolution than one hour upcoming issues like the increasing number of zero precipitation events and the filtering of small scaled extreme events which were not observed by the primary network i e dwd gauges have to be addressed potential solutions could be the usage of advection vectors or the mutual filtering of pws and cml where one opportunistic sensor can serve as primary network for the other and vice versa in this study reliable cmls were identified using the indicator correlation and event based filter and their values were corrected using the bias correction method these methods accounted for the line characteristic of the cmls measurement a cross validation shows the ability of cmls and especially pwss for rainfall mapping this is true for hourly as well as for multi day aggregations the opportunistic sensors are able to produce reasonable rainfall maps with increased spatial variability compared to rainfall maps derived from conventional rain gauge data these rainfall maps were evaluated country wide for germany with independent daily gauge data as reference and for rhineland palatinate and reutlingen with hourly gauge data as reference to set the results of the evaluation in a perspective we used the official gauge adjusted radar datasets radolan rw and radklim yw from the dwd on the country wide daily scale the radar products had a better agreement with the reference than the interpolated products for the two sub regions with an hourly resolution the interpolated products performed similarly good as the radar products the high number of opportunistic sensors might be the most import reason for this differences between the interpolated and radar products can be found especially for the highest rainfall amounts overall interpolations incorporating pws data performed best while the usage of cmls resulted in better performance metrics as product from hourly dwd rain gauges similar results were found for the most intense rain events with the exception of cmls which performed worse than the dwd product for temporal aggregations of several hours the results show the accuracy and increased spatial variability of rainfall maps from opportunistic sensors especially on smaller spatial and temporal scales numerous hydrometeorological applications can potentially benefit from this information the almost instantanous data availability could be used to access real time rainfall information applications in urban hydrology could therefore benefit both from the potential real time accessibility and the often dense opportunistic sensor networks in this urban areas nevertheless some of the

association of german research centreswithin the digital earth project we acknowledge support by the kit publication fund of the karlsruhe institute of technology we further want to thank two reviewers for their thorough work appendix a additional figures fig a1 fig a2 fig a3 appendix b consideration of the cml length for the indicator correlation filter and bias correction it is well known that the length area or volume of an observation or measurement has an effect on the statistical properties of this observation this so called support effect has been intensively studied in geostatistics mainly for mining applications there are several approaches which can be used to calculate the change of variance as a function of the support size and the variogramm block kriging as applied in this paper is also taking the support size into account the different lengths of the cmls have to be taken into account for the application of the indicator correlation filter and the bias correction the classical geostatistical formulas cannot be used as we consider the distribution of the values and not only their variances therefore the following simulation based approach is considered the indicator correlation between the cml and a primary station is partly influenced by the orientation and the length of the cml as the indicator correlation is independent of the marginal distribution only the dependence structure is of importance it is assumed that the spatial dependence of precipitation follows a normal copula this is a frequent assumption however not often stated explicitly this means that precipitation z x t can be obtained from the realization of a spatially stationary normal process y x t by a transformation z x t f x 1 φ y x t where f x is the distribution function of precipitation for location x and φ is the distribution function of the standard normal distribution z l t 1 l l z y t dy from the point observations the spatial correlation function of the indicators can be calculated this can be transformed to a correlation function of a normal y c y h with this correlation function realizations of y can be simulated and with the local distributions f y realizations of z x t and z l t can be derived thereafter the indicator correlations and the distribution functions f l of z l t can be calculated these distribution function can also be used for bias correction of the cmls for the indicator correlations a good approximation can be obtained by replacing the line l by a specific point u such that c i x l c i x u where d x u d x l 1 l l d x y dy this means that for the indicator correlation filter which for cmls with a primary network the cmls have to be considered as d x l and not as the central point along its path l the same assumption can be used for the bias correction to calculate the distribution of z l t as a first step the distribution functions of the precipitation observations at the primary observations are interpolated for each point y of the line l in practice l is discretized to a few points this is done the same way as for the pwss using these simulations the line averages can be calculated as follows z l t 1 l l z y t dy 1 l l f y 1 φ y y t dy so a monte carlo simulation of y can be used to obtain the distribution function of z l t due to the averaging procedure this distribution is different from the point distributions for example the probability of high values is reduced fig b1 shows the result of the bias correction for hourly rain rates appendix c diagnostic values considered in this study here all

8128,study region the study region is germany and two sub regions in germany i e the state of rhineland palatinate and the city of reutlingen study focus opportunistic rainfall sensors namely personal weather stations and commercial microwave links together with rain gauge data from the german weather service were used in different combinations to derive rainfall maps with a geostatistical interpolation framework for germany this kriging type framework considered the uncertainty of opportunistic sensors and the line structure of commercial microwave links the resulting rainfall maps were compared to two gauge adjusted radar products and evaluated to three reference gauge datasets in the respective study regions on both daily and hourly basis new hydrological insights for the region the interpolated rainfall products from opportunistic sensors provided good agreement to the reference rain gauges the dataset combinations including information from the opportunistic sensors performed best the addition of rain gauges from the german weather service did not consistently lead to an improvement of the interpolated rainfall maps on the country wide daily scale the interpolated rainfall maps performed well but the gauge adjusted radar products were closer to the reference for the regional and local scale in rhineland palatinate and reutlingen with an hourly resolution the interpolated rainfall maps outperformed the interpolated product from dwd rain gauges and showed a similar agreement to the reference as the radar products keywords rainfall mapping opportunistic sensing personal weather stations commercial microwave links 1 introduction reliable rainfall measurement is crucial for monitoring and understanding the hydrologic cycle and climate variability it delivers important information for water resource management agriculture urban planning as well as for weather climate and hydrological modelling several measurement devices for rainfall observations were developed in the past while rain gauges of different types are used since the nineteenth century weather radar observations are operated for the past decades the spatial and temporal coverage of such measurement networks are unevenly distributed over the globe compared to other regions the rain gauges and weather radars in germany form a dense observation network lorenz and kunstmann 2012 still depending on the spatial and temporal scale of a rainfall event rainfall estimates can still be uncertain for example small convective events can be underestimated by weather radars or even missed completely by a network of rain gauges the respective disadvantages of the individual measurement systems are the reason behind potentially uncertain estimates of the spatio temporal distribution of rainfall cristiano et al 2017 quantitative precipitation estimates qpe from weather radars suffer from an uncertain z r relationship beam blockage and ground clutter amongst others berne and krajewski 2013 rain gauges can underestimate rainfall due to wind but more importantly the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall is not fully captured by point observations pollock et al 2018 new opportunities of measuring meteorological data are emerging with the increasing number and availability of opportunistic sensors in the last years zheng et al 2018 clark et al 2018 used humidity temperature and air pressure from personal weather stations pwss to track the path of a hailstorm the same variables from pwss together with air pressure temperature and radiation from cell phones as well as rainfall estimates from commercial microwave links cmls were used to examine a frontal system and the urban heat island effect over amsterdam de vos et al 2020 various different opportunistic rainfall sensors have already been investigated the attenuation along satellite tv link path due to rainfall was exploited barthés and mallet 2013 mercier et al 2015 windshield wiper frequency regulated by the optical rainfall sensor of a car were used to derive binary rainfall information mahoney and o sullivan 2013 rabiei et al 2013 rainfall estimates were derived from camera footage of rain allamano et al 2015 jiang et al 2019 with the emerging 5g network and the growing number of devices connected to the internet of things the number of potential sensors will further increase balsamo et al 2018 mccabe et al 2017 tauro et al 2018 in this study we use rainfall data from pwss and commercial microwave links cmls the nearly linear relationship between rainfall and the attenuation of microwave link signals operating with frequencies between 10 and 40 ghz is known for several decades atlas and ulbrich 1977 with the growth of modern telecommunication infrastructure for which cmls provide a large portion of the backhaul network an increasing number of microwave links became available and cmls were introduced as opportunistic rainfall sensor almost 15 years ago messer et al 2006 leijnse et al 2007 deriving rainfall estimates from cmls can be challenging because of several issues erratic signal behavior due to refraction reflection or multipath propagation as well as unknown relation to meteorologic variables cause fluctuation of the signal upton et al 2005 van leth et al 2018 likewise wet cml antennas can cause additional attenuation during and also after rainfall events until they are dry again fencl et al 2019 rainfall estimates from cmls were derived for diverse regions in the world mainly in europe e g andersson et al 2017 fencl et al 2017 overeem et al 2016b roversi et al 2020 van de beek et al 2020 but also for other countries as for example israel ostrometzky and messer 2018 brasil rios gaona et al 2018 west africa doumounia et al 2014 and china song et al 2020 an overview of the background and challenges in rainfall estimation from cmls was given by chwala and kunstmann 2019 and uijlenhoet et al 2018 respectively rainfall maps were derived from cmls often neglecting the path integrated nature of the estimated rain rate but rather using the center of each cml as a theoretical point measurement graf et al 2020 overeem et al 2016b some dedicated mapping algorithms were introduced but not analyzed on a larger scale liberman et al 2014 beek et al 2020 haese et al 2017 the potential and challenges using rainfall data from pwss were first shown by de vos et al 2017 pwss also provide other meteorological information bell et al 2013 jenkins 2014 but for our study from here on pwss will only refer to personal weather stations measuring rainfall pwss are rain gauges which are set up by individual citizens data from pwss are prone to numerous error sources ranging from calibration issues to poor maintenance and unfavourable positioning therefore a thorough quality check of pwss data is necessary an intrinsic approach using information of neighboring pwss was tested in the netherlands de vos et al 2019 the norwegian meteorological institute deployed an automatic data quality control for their meteorological station data which is supplemented by opportunistic data e g for temperature båserud et al 2020 another approach presented by bárdossy et al 2021 used data from a trustworthy primary network and a geostatistical method combined with rank statistics this approach is also used in our study to remove and bias correct suspicious pwss and cml data with modifications of the filtering approach to account for the line characteristic of the cml data this study aims to provide 1 a large scale evaluation of rainfall estimates from two types of opportunistic rainfall sensors 2 a geostatistical interpolation framework and 3 a related performance analysis of the derived rainfall maps using data from opportunistic sensors official rain gauges and various combinations of these datasets the performance analysis is carried out on different spatial and temporal scales the interpolation framework takes the specific characteristics and uncertainties of the sensors into account and combines rainfall information from point and line sources with individual weights these sensors are official rain gauges from the german meteorological service dwd pwss data obtained from netatmo and cml data obtained from ericsson in germany the question we raise is how accurate can opportunistic sensors measure rainfall on a country wide regional and local scale specifically in germany the federal state of rhineland palatinate and the city of reutlingen respectively 2 study region and data 2 1 study region the study region is germany and our analysis was carried out on a national scale for the whole of germany with 357 386 km 2 on a regional scale for the state of rhineland palatinate with 19 847 km 2 and on a local scale for the city of reutlingen with 87 km 2 rainfall in germany is falling year round with a peak during the summer months the driest regions are located in the northeast with mean rainfall amounts of 450 mma 1 year highest rainfall amounts occur in the central german uplands with over 1000 mma 1 and in the alps with up to 2000 mma 1 rainfall in the northern part of germany is mostly influenced by synoptic driven processes while convective events become more frequent southwards rhineland palatinate is situated in the mid west of germany with yearly rainfall amounts between 500 and 800 mm between the rhine valley and the low mountain ranges of taunus and hunsrück the city of reutlingen is located in the south western state of baden wuerttemberg approximately 30 km south of the state capital stuttgart the density of hydro meteorologic measurements over germany and therefore also for rhineland palatinate and reutlingen is high compared to most other parts of the world lorenz and kunstmann 2012 the german weather service dwd operates a weather radar network and roughly 2000 rain gauges with daily and hourly temporal resolution several state agencies and private companies additionally operate hundreds of rain gauges which are partly used in rainfall products of the dwd the continuous measurement of precipitation in germany started more than a hundred of years ago with many gauge locations being sampled for multiple decades hellmann 1907 therefore the measurement of precipitation with additional opportunistic sensors and the generation of interpolated products from these sensors would not seem to be of primary importance in germany yet the spatio temporal variability of rainfall cannot be captured completely with common products derived from rain gauges and weather radars this is especially the case for short duration and high intensity rainfall which can cause flash floods berne et al 2004 emmanuel et al 2012 ochoa rodriguez et al 2015 a striking example is the devastating flash flood in the city of braunsbach in 2016 in a 10 km radius around braunsbach only one rain gauge with a daily resolution is located radar data underestimated the rainfall measured from the rain gauge by 30 percent therefore it is uncertain whether the radar measurements of the peak rainfall several kilometers away from the gauge was estimated correctly bronstert et al 2018 with the increasing density of opportunistic sensor networks like the ones used in this study the probability that such sensors detect small scale events and their variability is also increasing we use the opportunity of having several independent rain gauge networks in germany to evaluate the rainfall maps derived from opportunistic rainfall sensors with our mapping approach on three different scales on the country wide scale for the whole of germany on the regional scale for rhineland palatinate and on the local scale for reutlingen we expect the higher network density of the opportunistic sensors to be beneficial especially on the regional and local scale 2 2 opportunistic rainfall data we use two types of opportunistic rainfall data namely pws data from the netatmo network https weathermap netatmo com and cml data from ericsson netatmo is a company selling pwss among other smart home devices their basic pws system which provides measurements of temperature humidity air pressure can be extended with an unheated tipping bucket gauge for rainfall measurement these rain gauges have a collecting area of 125 cm 2 and a temporal resolution of five minutes de vos et al 2019 gives further technical details to netatmo pwss if the owner agrees data from the pwss is uploaded to netatmo s weather map data is then available via an api in temporal resolutions down to five minutes the used dataset consists of all freely available pwss data from netatmo in germany in 2018 and 2019 fig 1 shows their continuously growing number of up to 15 000 by the end of our study period the reason for the decreasing numbers during winter was not investigated a possible explanation could be battery failure due to cold temperatures the spatial distribution of pwss in germany follows roughly the population density with most pwss situated in urban areas as for example shown in the map in fig 4 cml data are typically not publicly available but need to be provided by telecommunication providers we receive data from 3904 cmls from ericsson in germany via a near real time data acquisition system chwala et al 2016 the cml lengths range from 0 3 to 30 km and their frequencies from 10 to 40 ghz the spatial distribution of cmls is highly unbalanced throughout germany we currently only have access to a subset of cmls which is only a small part of the more than 100 000 cmls installed in germany bundesnetzagentur 2017 the distribution of the cmls in this subset is not representative for the general distribution of cmls in germany more information on the characteristics of this cml dataset are available from graf et al 2020 the analyzed periods are the summer season from april to october 2018 and 2019 as shown in fig 1 for previous years the availability of pwss was significantly lower and our country wide data acquisition for cmls in germany started in august 2017 we excluded months with high probability of snow since performance for both sensors decreases in winter pwss are not heated and cml suffer from snow and ice on their antennas as well as from large uncertainties of the relation between attenuation and snow and melting snow melting sown for example causes a many times higher attenuation than rain resulting in large overestimation of the precipitation event an overview of all used datasets and their respective usage is given in table 1 2 3 gauge and radar data we use two different gauge datasets operated by the dwd the first gauge dataset consists of 968 automatic pluviometers we use the hourly and quality checked data from these rain gauges referred to as dwdauto from here onwards in the interpolation framework section 3 3 the second gauge dataset referred to as dwdman consists of 1062 manual rain gauges with a daily resolution the collection diameter is 200 cm 2 and the gauges are heated this dataset is used as a reference for the country wide evaluation as it is independent of the dwdauto data both dwd gauge datasets have a density of roughly one gauge per 300 km 2 a network of 169 hourly rain gauges in rhineland palatinate is used for the evaluation on a higher temporal resolution these gauges are operated by the state agrometeorological agency of rhineland palatinate this dataset has a spatial density of roughly one gauge per 100 km 2 for the evaluation on the local scale we use hourly data from ten rain gauges situated in the city of reutlingen the ott pluviometers form a dense network of one gauge per 9 km 2 we use two radar datasets in this study namely radolan rw and radklim yw provided by the dwd radolan rw is a near real time product with an hourly resolution it is updated with 30 minutes lag time the gridded dataset covers germany with 900 by 900 grid cells with a 1 km resolution it is a composite of 17 weather radars adjusted via a weighted combination of additive and multiplicative corrections from the dwdauto gauge network bartels et al 2004 winterrath et al 2012 radklim yw is based on the same radar and gauge data as radolan rw but undergoes climatological adjustments accounting for e g range dependent underestimation and radar spokes due to beam blockage winterrath et al 2018 the adjustments are carried out with hourly data radklim rw but are also applied to the 5 minute data radklim yw which we use here the performance of radar and rain gauge products from the dwd were already analysed while especially during winter and in small catchments the differences in daily areal rainfall could exceed 50 kneis and heistermann 2009 meissner et al 2012 the mean yearly rainfall sums of dwd rain gauges and radar products compare well kreklow et al 2019 3 methods 3 1 cml and pws data preparation and processing cml data cannot be converted to a rainfall estimate directly several processing steps are required to obtain rain rates from raw cml attenuation data we use the processing routine described in graf et al 2020 with the exception of the classification of wet and dry periods where we use an improved method presented by polz et al 2020 first cmls with erratic data e g from drifts jumps or high levels of noise are removed from the dataset using two filters based on monthly statistics of the cml raw data data gaps shorter than 5 minutes are interpolated linearly then wet and dry periods are classified by a convolutional neural network trained to that specific task for each identified rain event the baseline of the signal is derived from the precedent dry period using this event specific baseline attenuation values are calculated which are then corrected for the additional attenuation caused by raindrops on the cml antennas from the final rain induced attenuation the rain rate can be calculated using the k r relation where k is the specific path attenuation in db km 1 and r is the rain rate in mmh 1 a detailed description of these steps as well as a large scale analysis can be found in graf et al 2020 we chose the new classification of wet and dry periods from polz et al 2020 because it reduces the false positive rate fpr while keeping the false negative rate fnr constant which is shown along with an evaluation of the combination of both methods for one month for the whole of germany in fig 9 of polz et al 2020 all introduced cml processing routines can be found in the software package pycomlink 2021 the resulting data consists of rain rates averaged along the cmls path with one minute temporal resolution this data is then aggregated to an hourly resolution except for hours with gaps longer than 5 minutes which were not interpolated in the first step the reason for the five minute interpolation besides rare connection problems of the data acquisition system is the engineering requirements of the cml network for each cml the combination of a given path length with a microwave frequency is chosen so that on average the path attenuation due to heavy rain leads to a complete signal loss at the receiver only for some minutes per year because the choice of the frequency and the path length are constrained only certain frequency bands are available high frequencies are desired to allow more bandwidth and path length is determined by the locations of cml towers the maximum rain rate before signal loss is different for all cmls it can be as low as 40 mmh 1 but also above 150 mmh 1 e g for very short cmls 1 km or shorter or for short cmls 5 km with low frequencies 20 ghz therefore for heavy rainfalls some cmls do not provide accurate rainfall information the pws data have been acquired via the netatmo api in time steps of variable length of typically 5 minutes and aggregated to hourly resolution additional information regarding the netatmo data acquisition can be found in de vos et al 2020 compared to the hourly data of the netatmo api which accepts up to eleven missing five minute values we have removed all hours with more than one missing five minute value 3 2 indicator correlation filter event based filter and bias correction the filtering and bias correction approach introduced by bárdossy et al 2021 was the basis for filtering and bias correcting the pws data in this study the cml data was also treated with this approach even though they already were pre processed with pycomlink which removed the worst performing cmls from the dataset problems we still encountered in the cml derived rain rates were strong overestimation of melting snow evident in april and october and other false positive events caused by attenuation which was not induced by rain which the rather liberal filtering of pycomlink did not remove the main assumption behind the indicator correlation filter is that the specific pws or cml values might be wrong but their ranks are correct especially for the most intense events using a reference network such as the dwdauto rain gauges which are installed according to the wmo guidelines the dependence between the nearest neighboring stations is investigated for each location the correlation value of the indicator series between the pairs of dwdauto pws or dwdauto cml is compared to the values between the dwdauto stations for similar separation distances and time periods hereby information on how precipitation varies in space is acquired and pws or cml locations with unreliable observations for high precipitation intensities are identified for the cml data we used an extended version of the indicator correlation filter to account for the geometric line structure of the cmls which is described in appendix b while the basic principle of the filter was unchanged the indicator correlation filter is applied on a yearly basis for all hourly pws and cml data fig 2 shows the results for the year 2019 after applying the filter around 92 of the pwss and of the cmls remained the number of pwss in fig 2 refers to the overall number of pwss providing data during 2019 while fig 1 shows the availability of pws measurements at each point in time which causes the different values even though the order of the values is assumed to be correct the pws and cml values remaining after the indicator correlation filter might have an unknown bias the bias varies individually for each location and each observation therefore the real precipitation amounts need to be estimated this is done for the observed hourly data for this purpose the precipitation distribution functions of the dwdauto stations are used for a target location and a given time step using the observed quantiles pws or cml the corresponding dwdauto quantiles are derived and the corresponding precipitation amount is interpolated through this procedure the possible bias available at the pws and cml locations is reduced the resulting time series are used further on in this study a more detailed description of both the indicator correlation filter and bias correction for the cml data can be found in appendix b while the indicator correlation filter removes opportunistic sensors for a whole year some remaining sensors can suffer from erratic measurements for individual events possible reasons can be low battery or clogged funnels for pwss as well as outages in the data acquisition or attenuation induced by other sources than rain for cmls we applied an event based filter after the bias correction which uses the variogram of the next 30 dwdauto stations to cross validate each sensor in order to remove faulty values if a sensors rainfall value differs too much from the value estimated by the variogram of the 30 stations here three times the kriging standard deviation it was rejected in order to preserve higher rainfall values and to focus more on discarding false zeros this filter used the square root of the rainfall sum this was the only modification of the event based filter which first was shown in bárdossy et al 2021 overall this filter removed around 0 6 of the pws data and 1 5 of the cml data 3 3 geostatistical interpolation framework we developed a geostatistical interpolation framework which allows a combination of different data sources and their specific features and geometric properties let x 1 x n be the locations of the dwdauto observation points y 1 y m the locations of the pwss after filtering and l 1 l k be the line segments of the cmls after filtering the estimation of the precipitation amounts z at a given location x is done by a combined kriging approach in which both the increased uncertainty of the pws and cml based precipitation is taken into account and the cml s line structure is considered by using a block kriging type approach the estimation is obtained in the form 1 z x i 1 n λ i z x i i 1 m α i z y i i 1 k β i z l i with the additional condition of unbiasedness 2 i 1 n λ i i 1 m α i i 1 k β i 1 the weights w t λ 1 λ n α 1 α m β 1 β k μ can be obtained by solving the linear equation system 3 a w c μ is the lagrange multiplier introduced to ensure the fulfilment of the unbiasedness condition eq 2 the matrix a is 4 a γ x 1 x 1 γ x 1 x n γ x 1 y 1 γ x 1 y m γ x 1 l 1 γ x 1 l k 1 γ x n x 1 γ x n x n γ x

l 1 γ x l k 1 here for any pair of points γ x i y j is the variogram value corresponding to the vector x i y j the combination of a point and a line segment requires a mean variogram value over the segment 6 γ x i l j 1 l j l j γ x i u du and for the consideration of pairs of line segments l i and l j one has to calculate the corresponding mean value 7 γ l i l j 1 l i l j l i l j γ u v du dv the ε y and the ε l values in the diagonal of the matrix represent the uncertainty of measurements of the pwss and the cmls respectively in our approach we selected a 10 error experimental variograms were calculated for each one hour time step using the dwdauto only and the filtered bias corrected pws data only the variograms were subsequently normalized and a k means clustering algorithm was used to divide them into 4 different groups theoretical variograms were fitted to each center of the cluster the fitted variograms differed mainly in the range which was between 12 5 and 40 0 km the variograms based on the dwdauto data showed no nugget effect while the pws based variograms had a nugget of about 10 this was the reason why the ε was selected as 10 of the sill the consideration of the length and orientation of the line segments is fully respected in this equation if one would replace each line segment with its central point as done e g in overeem et al 2016a the weights would be significantly different see fig a1 for an example all combinations of datasets and the respective interpolated products are given in table 2 4 results and discussion 4 1 cross validation of the interpolated rainfall products a leave one out cross validation is used to compare the performance between the interpolated products among each other at the location of the dwdauto stations for temporal aggregations between one hour and 30 days for the cross validation the target stations were removed for the whole procedure the filtering the assessment of the distribution function and for the interpolation of the precipitation amounts this allows us to evaluate the performance of the different interpolation products at the location of each dwdauto independently as diagnostic measures the pearson s correlation coefficient pcc the coefficient of variation cv and the kling gupta efficiency kge as well as the false positive fpr and false negative rate fpr are used their definitions can be found in appendix c because dwdauto was also used in four of the seven interpolation products the validation was carried out as a leave one out cross validation the results are shown in fig 3 a to c for all dwdauto stations as validation stations and in d to f for a selection of ten percent of dwdauto stations defined by the density of opportunistic sensors in close vicinity which we call selected validation stations from here on two groups of interpolation products are visible for all measures and both selections of stations this distinction was larger for the selected validation stations one group contained pwsint and the other combinations with pwss whereas the other group contained dwdint cmlint and their combination pwsint and the other combinations with pwss performed better for all three performance measures the interpolated products with opportunistic sensors had higher performance measures for the selected validation stations dwdint showed the worst performance for both all and selected validation stations the performance of opportunistic sensors increased when only validations stations surrounded by many pwss and cmls were considered we think that the heterogeneous distribution of opportunistic sensor networks of cmls and pwss shown in the map in fig 4 is the reason for this better performance dwdauto with its more homogeneous distribution performed similar between both validation station sets with increasing temporal aggregation the performance of all interpolated products increased the difference between all and selected validation stations was highest at short aggregations of one to 12 hours for pcc and kge for the aggregations over days they were similar this emphasizes the influence of quality and amount of sampling points when interpolating rainfall on sub daily temporal scales overall the combinations with pwss had the highest performance values while the interpolation product which used all three possible datasets dwd pws cmlint was not the overall best performing one even though it contained the highest number of sampling points a potential explanation is that dwdint measurements are considered more reliable and hence have a higher weight in the block kriging however their spatial density is the lowest on average we conclude that the large number and the accuracy of the opportunistic sensors lead to a better interpolation the block kriging approach in the interpolation framework accounts for the integral characteristic of the cmls the comparison to kriging with the center of each cml as point measurement cml pointint done in the same manner as in fig 3 shows a higher pcc for the block kriging approach see fig a2 for temporal aggregations of one and two hours cml pointint leads to higher kge values with the variance directly affecting kge values we assume that the reduced variance in cmlint of block kriging is the reason for the lower kge values 4 2 performance of interpolated rainfall products compared to gauge datasets on different scales the performance of the interpolated datasets is analyzed for the whole of germany a regional and a local subset with different independent reference datasets additionally two radar datasets from the dwd are compared analogously to the reference data 4 2 1 country wide daily scale for germany for the country wide scale we used data from manual rain gauges with a daily resolution from the dwd dwdman the interpolated rainfall maps and radar product values for this evaluation are taken at the respective grid cell of the locations of dwdman gauges an overview of the dwdman gauges pwss locations and cmls is given in the map of fig 4 together with results of the evaluation for this scale in general the radar products match the reference data better than the interpolated products they have slightly higher pcc and kge as well as a lower fpr the comparison is not quite fair though the radar products are based on measurements directly at each reference station s location while the interpolated rainfall fields have to rely on observations at a certain distance a distance that varies from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers in the north eastern part of germany nevertheless the performance measures of the interpolated products are good looking at the two radar products radklim yw outperformed radolan rw except for fpr this leads to the assumption that the climatological adjustments of radklim yw e g seasonal correction of range dependent underestimation improve this radar product not only for longer aggregations times from which the climatological corrections are derived but also on a daily scale among the interpolated products the ones including pwss compared better to the reference than the others the worst performance was obtained by cmlint these results are in accordance with the cross validation the scatter density plots show all daily rainfall values for pws cmlint and radolan rw against dwdman the number of missed rainy days false negative rate fnr from the reference visible along the x axis in fig 4 was lower for the interpolated product than for the radar product the performance of pwsint and the other combinations with pwss is better compared to the dwdauto product the reason for this is the high spatial density resulting from the high number of os this is true even though the os are heterogeneously distributed in contrast to the more homogeneously distributed dwdman this means that hydrological modeling studies which often use data from rain gauge networks can benefit from rainfall information derived from opportunistic sensors requirements for such applications are the availability of opportunists sensors the acquisition of their data and a thorough quality control similar to the cross validation the subset of dwdman surrounded by the densest opportunistic network were examined separately see fig a3 the results differ only slightly from the country wide analysis of fig 4 the range of the individual performance measures are more narrow and pwsint and cmlint have a small improvement similar to what was observed for the daily aggregation results of the cross validation this means that the density of opportunistic sensors is sufficient for rainfall mapping in almost all parts of germany except for the north eastern part of germany 4 2 2 regional hourly scale for rhineland palatinate as reference on a regional scale 169 rain gauges with an hourly resolution operated by the state agrometeorological agency of rhineland palatinate rlp are used an overview of the rhineland palatinate gauges pws locations and cmls is given in the map of fig 5 together with results of the evaluation for this scale for the pcc all interpolated products with opportunistic sensors outperformed the dwdint product pwsint and the other combinations with pwss performed almost as good as the radar products the combination pws cmlint reached marginally higher pcc values than pwsint cmlint has the highest negative bias this can be caused for example by the integral character of the cmls underestimating the highest rainfall events and the heterogeneous distribution of the cmls the fpr not shown in the plot for the evaluation at this scale of all products is 5 times smaller than fnr with the best performance for pwsint and pws cmlint radolan rw shows more over and underestimation of the highest hourly rainfall events which can be seen in the scatter plot the pws cmlint product underestimates the highest rainfall events which could be caused by a combination of the effect of the integral character of the cml measurement and the smoothing of the field caused by the 10 nugget that is used in kriging to represent the uncertainty of the opportunistic sensors moreover despite the thorough pwss quality check there could still be some stations that were not filtered and that recorded false zeros for the intense events affecting the performance of the interpolation products the biggest difference to the country wide dwdman reference evaluation is that the comparison to rlp is based on an hourly resolution on this temporal resolution rainfall shows more variability than on a daily scale hence on the hourly scale all interpolated and radar products have lower values for pcc and kge nevertheless the agreement of the best performing interpolation products with the reference data is high it can be assumed that for all regions with similar distribution and density of opportunistic sensors in germany similar results as for rhineland palatinate could be achieved that means opportunistic sensors can provide rainfall estimates with a good quality for most parts of germany with the exception of north eastern regions where their network density is low on an hourly scale 4 2 3 local hourly scale for the city of reutlingen ten rain gauges operated by the city of reutlingen rt are used to evaluate the performance of the interpolated products and radar datasets on a local scale with a temporal resolution of one hour an overview of the rt gauges pws locations and cmls is given in the map of fig 6 together with results of the evaluation for this scale the network of 10 rain gauges in and around reutlingen has a significantly higher density than the previous gauge datasets used as reference on this small scale the high number of pwss in this urban area becomes apparent with around thirty stations in reutlingen pwsint and the combinations with pwss compared best to the reference with a high pcc cmlint and combinations reproduce the reference rainfall values slightly better than dwdint dwdint as well as the radar products show a positive bias the reason could be the large distance of the next rain gauge which is also used to adjust the radar products the next rain gauges on this local scale are more than 15 km away and not located in the area shown by fig 6 this could make a difference in the rather complex terrain at the border of the swabian alps for the os products the bias is almost zero for the most intense events shown in the scatter plot of pws cmlint the opportunistic sensors are underestimated by the interpolated product upon closer inspection all reference rainfall points above 20 mm were from an event on the 12th of june 2018 lasting 3 hours while some of the pwss resembled the reference gauges rainfall almost perfectly others underestimated this event by a factor of ten the two cmls also underestimated the peak rainfall due to a complete loss of signal for a total of 12 and 21 minutes respectively we currently do not interpolate or fill gaps of this size in our processing the rainfall sum of the hour with this data gap is treated as missing value hence the one hour with the peak rainfall sum is missing from the cml data this rainfall event is an interesting opportunity to study the ability and required processing steps to measure intense events with pwss and cmls in the future first steps in this direction could be the improvement of the event based filter for pwss or filling cml outages caused by rain with the maximum of measurable rainfall at this cml apart from the city of reutlingen there are few cities which operate such a dense and high quality network of rain gauges only with such a dense network of conventional rain gauges we were able to evaluate the performance of opportunistic sensors on such a small scale the opportunistic sensors show very good results in estimating rainfall on this local scale therefore we conclude that rainfall information from pwss and cmls are highly valuable for the rainfall estimation in other urban areas with few or no conventional rain gauges this opens the possibility to use opportunistic rainfall sensors for applications in urban hydrology for all cities with a similar density of opportunistic sensors 4 3 performance for high intensity rainfall we investigated the potential of opportunistic sensors in capturing the most intense rain events with the leave one out cross validation results we performed the same analysis as in section 4 1 but only considered rain events above the 0 99 quantile level of each aggregation interval the results in fig 7 show pcc spearman s rank correlation coefficient scc and cv the scc defined in appendix c is used here because it credits the skewed distribution of rainfall for the pcc and cv the results are similar to the cross validation results for all rain events pwsint and combinations with pwss performed best while the combination of pwss and cmls was the overall best cmlint also outperformed dwdint for these two measures considering the scc the best results were obtained from pwsint without further combination both cml and dwd data could not add further information to increase the scc one reason for this might be the increased distance between cml and especially dwd sensors opposed by the high density of pwss for the scc dwd and cml performed similarly for one hour while dwd reaches higher values for aggregations between two and 120 hours for an analysis of the performance of the interpolated products and radar datasets for high intensity rainfall for the regional and local scale we show the scc for hourly rainfall sums in fig 8 the german wide scale is not shown as it is only available with a daily temporal resolution and an hourly evaluation for the whole of germany is already covered by fig 7 the three individual interpolated products show similar results on both scales as in fig 7 pwsint shows the overall highest scc while dwdint reaches slightly higher values than cmlint the combined interpolated products show a similar scc as the radar products except for dwd cmlint this again highlights the potential of exploiting dense opportunistic sensor networks on both regional and urban scales for hydrometeorologic purposes for the radar products the climatological adjustment seems to increase the scc marginally the lower scc values for cmlint on both scales could be caused by several reasons one reason for this is the engineering requirements of the cml network which allows an outage of the systems during the strongest rainfall events for some minutes this results in a maximum rain rate before signal loss between 40 mmh 1 and more than 150 mmh 1 depending on the exact cml configuration length frequency transmit power antenna gain thus for heavy rainfalls cmls do not always provide accurate rainfall information consequently the rank correlation for high rain intensities could be decreased for cmls another reason is the integral character of the cml measurements which gives the path averaged rain rate independently of the distribution of rain rates along the cmls path this leads to an underestimation of the highest rain rates along the path finally the effect of the classification of rainy and dry periods in the cmls processing has to be considered every wrong classification which can be caused by non rain induced attenuation multi path propagation or others will influence the fpr and fnr which ultimately have a large influence on the scc considering all this the hourly scc of cmlint is still close to the one of the conventional rain gauge product dwdint 4 4 rain event example in rhineland palatinate to illustrate the interpolation framework results for the different datasets we show an example for several interpolated rainfall maps from different combinations and radolan rw in rhineland palatinate in fig 9 on 12 july 2019 at 12 00 several rain cells are visible for all interpolation products and radolan rw for some regions the dwdauto network misses rainfall because the station density is too sparse this can be seen in the map showing the opportunistic sensors and dwdauto stations locations for dwdint the underlying structure of the network is clearly visible in comparison pws cmlint shows more variability in the rainfall field and with most features related to several opportunistic sensors the opportunistic sensors miss the most intense feature measured by the dwdauto gauges in the north of rhineland palatine while pwsint has the highest intensities further south we presume that the increased variability due to the larger number of measurements should be closer to the true spatio temporal distribution of rainfall most features and structures detected by radolan rw are visible in pws cmlint while the radar product produces higher rainfall values it seems that more opportunistic sensors lead to higher spatial variability in the interpolated rainfall fields which could potentially improve hydrological applications 5 conclusion the study region of germany with two sub regions namely the state of rhineland palatinate and the city of reutlingen are hydrometeorologically well monitored compared to most locations in the world and therefore provide a suitable testing ground to evaluate opportunistic rainfall sensors in this study we demonstrate the use of two different types of such opportunistic sensors we obtain rainfall fields using a geostatistic interpolation framework incorporating block kriging from point information of pwss and line information of cmls seven combinations of cml pws and official hourly rain gauge data from the dwd are evaluated for three different reference datasets in three study regions two radar products from the dwd were evaluated in the same manner as the interpolated datasets to further quantify the performance of the interpolated rainfall maps both pws and cml data come with individual drawbacks e g unfavorable locations of pwss or erratic fluctuations in the raw cml data after the respective data retrieval and the rainfall estimation for the cmls both datasets are filtered with an indicator correlation and event based method and are bias corrected only then they are used in different combinations with and without hourly rain gauge data from the dwd for interpolation while the presented indicator correlation filter approach relies on a primary station network the data from this network could potentially come from another period as the rain rates are compared and adjusted only by their distribution functions besides very high rainfall events i e with return periods of several years the rainfall distribution for individual years as used in this study might not change this distribution too much hence this approach could be usable for opportunistic sensors in areas where the number of rain gauges was reduced over the last decades because only their distribution function is needed to use the indicator correlation filter event based filter and the bias correction for data with higher temporal resolution than one hour upcoming issues like the increasing number of zero precipitation events and the filtering of small scaled extreme events which were not observed by the primary network i e dwd gauges have to be addressed potential solutions could be the usage of advection vectors or the mutual filtering of pws and cml where one opportunistic sensor can serve as primary network for the other and vice versa in this study reliable cmls were identified using the indicator correlation and event based filter and their values were corrected using the bias correction method these methods accounted for the line characteristic of the cmls measurement a cross validation shows the ability of cmls and especially pwss for rainfall mapping this is true for hourly as well as for multi day aggregations the opportunistic sensors are able to produce reasonable rainfall maps with increased spatial variability compared to rainfall maps derived from conventional rain gauge data these rainfall maps were evaluated country wide for germany with independent daily gauge data as reference and for rhineland palatinate and reutlingen with hourly gauge data as reference to set the results of the evaluation in a perspective we used the official gauge adjusted radar datasets radolan rw and radklim yw from the dwd on the country wide daily scale the radar products had a better agreement with the reference than the interpolated products for the two sub regions with an hourly resolution the interpolated products performed similarly good as the radar products the high number of opportunistic sensors might be the most import reason for this differences between the interpolated and radar products can be found especially for the highest rainfall amounts overall interpolations incorporating pws data performed best while the usage of cmls resulted in better performance metrics as product from hourly dwd rain gauges similar results were found for the most intense rain events with the exception of cmls which performed worse than the dwd product for temporal aggregations of several hours the results show the accuracy and increased spatial variability of rainfall maps from opportunistic sensors especially on smaller spatial and temporal scales numerous hydrometeorological applications can potentially benefit from this information the almost instantanous data availability could be used to access real time rainfall information applications in urban hydrology could therefore benefit both from the potential real time accessibility and the often dense opportunistic sensor networks in this urban areas nevertheless some of the presented methods e g the indicator correlation filter cannot readily be used for real time applications but rather provide a baseline for such developments another opportunity is the combination with traditional gauge or radar datasets to derive a further improved joint product that leverages the individual advantages of all individual traditional and opportunisitc sensors authors statement

reviewers for their thorough work appendix a additional figures fig a1 fig a2 fig a3 appendix b consideration of the cml length for the indicator correlation filter and bias correction it is well known that the length area or volume of an observation or measurement has an effect on the statistical properties of this observation this so called support effect has been intensively studied in geostatistics mainly for mining applications there are several approaches which can be used to calculate the change of variance as a function of the support size and the variogramm block kriging as applied in this paper is also taking the support size into account the different lengths of the cmls have to be taken into account for the application of the indicator correlation filter and the bias correction the classical geostatistical formulas cannot be used as we consider the distribution of the values and not only their variances therefore the following simulation based approach is considered the indicator correlation between the cml and a primary station is partly influenced by the orientation and the length of the cml as the indicator correlation is independent of the marginal distribution only the dependence structure is of importance it is assumed that the spatial dependence of precipitation follows a normal copula this is a frequent assumption however not often stated explicitly this means that precipitation z x t can be obtained from the realization of a spatially stationary normal process y x t by a transformation z x t f x 1 φ y x t where f x is the distribution function of precipitation for location x and φ is the distribution function of the standard normal distribution z l t 1 l l z y t dy from the point observations the spatial correlation function of the indicators can be calculated this can be transformed to a correlation function of a normal y c y h with this correlation function realizations of y can be simulated and with the local distributions f y realizations of z x t and z l t can be derived thereafter the indicator correlations and the distribution functions f l of z l t can be calculated these distribution function can also be used for bias correction of the cmls for the indicator correlations a good approximation can be obtained by replacing the line l by a specific point u such that c i x l c i x u where d x u d x l 1 l l d x y dy this means that for the indicator correlation filter which for cmls with a primary network the cmls have to be considered as d x l and not as the central point along its path l the same assumption can be used for the bias correction to calculate the distribution of z l t as a first step the distribution functions of the precipitation observations at the primary observations are interpolated for each point y of the line l in practice l is discretized to a few points this is done the same way as for the pwss using these simulations the line averages can be calculated as follows z l t 1 l l z y t dy 1 l l f y 1 φ y y t dy so a monte carlo simulation of y can be used to obtain the distribution function of z l t due to the averaging procedure this distribution is different from the point distributions for example the probability of high values is reduced fig b1 shows the result of the bias correction for hourly rain rates appendix c diagnostic values considered in this study here all

8129,study region state of odisha a data scarce tropical savanna region in eastern india study focus this study evaluated the temporal variability in depth to groundwater dtw in the study region with heavily stressed aquifers during 1995 2015 using the modified mann kendall test subsequently shannon s entropy assessed spatial variability in dtw and determined the dominant hydrological geological and climatological hgc factor regulating the observed spatio temporal variability taking land use land cover lulc geomorphology lithology topography and rainfall as hgc factors new hydrological insights the overall and seasonal trend analysis revealed that the study region possessed both rising and declining trends with a slightly higher percentage of wells with a rising trend the spatial distribution of trends and the associated magnitude accentuated the unforeseen groundwater temporal variability and higher order susceptibility of dtw to rising and declining trends the marginal entropy revealed the higher order spatial variability associated with deeper dtw and vice versa evaluation of the hgc factors revealed that lulc could explain the maximum variability in the dtw as a dominant hgc factor it was found that the impact of lulc features on dtw variability is not straightforward necessitating impact assessment studies in the location with significant to highly significant trends this formulated approach can immensely contribute to the planning and management in attaining groundwater sustainability in data scarce regions keywords groundwater variability data

the tropics in the coming decades jasechko et al 2015 moreover during the drought and dry periods of the year groundwater becomes a vital source of water for agricultural and domestic use dams et al 2012 this necessitates comprehending the inherent variability of depth to groundwater dtw and the affecting hydrological geological and climatological hgc factors zhou et al 2016 however developing physical based models to understand the regional scale variability in highly heterogeneous geological formations especially in data scarce countries like india is almost impossible in this context the data driven approach seems to be a reasonable alternative to evaluate the insight of historic dtw variability and ascertain the factors regulating the variability observed for sustainable management of the groundwater resource the historical trend in dtw at different locations suggests valuable information on the change in recharge rate and anthropogenic activity impacts land use land cover lulc changes and climate variability despite continued dependency on the groundwater resource very limited studies have been carried out on the temporal trend analysis of dtw in the tropical savanna regions of india possibly due to the lack of reliable and continuous data monitoring ahmadi and sedghamiz 2007 machiwal and jha 2014a singh et al 2015 additionally the past studies have not considered temporal auto correlation existing in the dtw time series data while performing trend analysis machiwal and jha 2014b le brocque et al 2018 the modified mann kendall mmk test improves the trend evaluation accuracy by considering the temporal auto correlation existing in the time series hamed and rao 1997 understanding these temporal patterns and trends in the groundwater regime is essential for efficient resource management panda et al 2007 sreekanth et al 2009 zhou et al 2016 this study evaluates the dtw variability and the level of dominance the hgc factors possess in explaining the observed variability at a regional scale encompassing several aquifers and river basins a few studies have investigated the effect of topography on the spatio temporal patterns of the dtw for highland regions tilahun et al 2015 guzman et al 2017 very limited investigations are reported to understand the effects of different hgc factors on groundwater variability guzman et al 2017 some studies evaluated the effects of lulc soil texture soil hydraulic properties rainfall and topography on the spatial distribution and temporal persistence of soil moisture using various techniques joshi and mohanty 2010 baroni et al 2013 gaur and mohanty 2016 among the various techniques reported in the literature the entropy technique was a relatively simple tool that can incorporate both categorical and numerical parameters gaur and mohanty 2013 again shannon s entropy can provide information on the spatial variability in the dtw through marginal entropy values shannon s entropy technique s aforesaid advantages enable it to be an appropriate and robust technique than other statistical ones for this study from the review of the past studies it is clear that very few attempts have been made to study the spatio temporal variability of dtw at a regional scale and the pertinent hgc factors for groundwater variability the present study s motivation is to investigate the dominant factors regulating the spatio temporal variability of dtw in a data scarce tropical savanna region like india to the best of our knowledge this study is the first of its kind to address the different regulating factors of dtw variability in a tropical savanna climatic region the study firstly comprehended the variability in dtw of the study region and then the dominant hgc factors for observed spatio temporal variability were identified using shannon s entropy approach the hgc factors considered in this study were lulc geomorphology lithological structure ls topography s slope and quarterly cumulative rainfall r the proposed framework is a novel attempt to characterize spatio temporal variability in dtw in tropical regions with highly heterogeneous aquifers 2 choice of hgc factors of dtw variability in this study the hgc factors regulating the dtw variability were selected based on their influence on the infiltration capacity infiltration opportunity time recharge processes and abstraction rates additionally the hgc factors were selected such that they are the indicators of hydrogeological properties of aquifers governing the movement of water and can fill the data gap for sustainable management of groundwater for instance the lulc of an area affects dtw variability in numerous ways ilstedt et al 2016 the areas with settlements villages towns and cities and agricultural lands are likely to consume more groundwater due to tropical savanna climatic conditions due to the increase in urbanization there is a reduction in pervious surfaces thereby causing an increase in overland flow and a decrease in localized infiltration and recharge rate in low drainage density areas zipper et al 2018 jena et al 2020 the presence of dense forest cover with a shortage of rainfall can make the top surface of the soil hydrophobic and water repellent doerr et al 2000 the water repellence enhances preferential flows in unsaturated zones moreover scrub forests open forests and barren lands with scrubs resist overland flow and promote groundwater recharge the lulc classes such as water bodies reservoirs and canals enhance groundwater recharge and sometimes cause waterlogging fashae et al 2014 similarly geomorphology is an indicator of aquifer properties shaw et al 2018 sahoo and bhabagrahi 2019 structures such as pediments residual hills denudational hills and structural hills do not promote infiltration and have low hydraulic conductivity and recharge capability rajaveni et al 2017 whereas alluvial planes back swamps buried channels paleochannels flood plains and abandoned channels show higher infiltration rates recharge capability and hydraulic conductivity most importantly these geomorphology classes possess higher storage volumes for groundwater thereby affecting the dtw at a location ward et al 2002 lithology or the study of geological units is also important as it affects soil water s occurrence and movement dafny et al 2010 secondary porosity in the form of fractures and weathering promote groundwater seepage in rocky strata the hard rocks have less porosity and are classified under low groundwater prospective formations solomon and quiel 2006 the fractures with connectivity to a large water body or very good outcrop yield abundant groundwater limestone quartzite sandstone and sandstone with shale possess high porosity the water holding capacity along with the transmission capacity of these formations regulates the dtw the alluvial plains with higher recharge potential effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity ensure better groundwater availability mendicino et al 2008 similarly volcanic rocks possess huge macro pores facilitating groundwater storage and movement groundwater flow occurs from a higher potential to a lower potential which is very much connected to the slope of the area condon and maxwell 2015 therefore the topography is a controlling factor in groundwater availability tilahun et al 2016 at a regional scale groundwater recharge happens near topographic divides and discharges in valleys eakin 1966 the slope factor controls groundwater movement across many spatial scales steeper topography can be associated with deeper water table depths more regional groundwater flows and increased groundwater surface water interaction guzman et al 2017 hodgkins et al 2017 estimated the interannual correlations between mean annual dtw and hydro climatic variables such as annual precipitation temperature and streamflow to understand the factors that influence dtw in a glacial aquifer system they observed that the groundwater level was significantly correlated with precipitation at 10 4 70 2 of wells in the different parts of their study region dawes et al 2012 investigated that the rainfall declination over the decades coupled with increasing water demand from a growing population has resulted in the falling of dtw in the southwest part of western australia mccallum et al 2010 found that the most important factor influencing annual groundwater recharge is annual rainfall 3 study region climatologically india is divided into six regions tropical rainforest tropical savanna arid deserts arid steppe hot temperate warm summer and temperate dry winter cold summer peel et al 2007 in this study the spatio temporal variability and the pertinent dominant hgc factors in a tropical savanna region over the state of odisha india were investigated fig 1 the study region has a geographical area of 155 707 km2 and extends from 17 46ˈ 48ˈˈ n to 22 31ˈ 12ˈˈ n and 81 21ˈ 36ˈˈ e to 87 30ˈ 00ˈˈe fig 1 this region receives average annual rainfall ranging from 1071 to 2432 mm with an average standard deviation range of 201 867 during the study period fig 2 e the preliminary analysis on rainfall shows that there is no clear trend of increase or decrease in average annual rainfall over the region past studies over this region also have similar conclusions kumar et al 2010 and suggested that there is hardly any change in the region s future climate mohan and rajeevan 2017 there exist eleven major river basins namely kolab indumati nagabali vamsadhara bahuda rushikulya mahanadi brahmani baitarani subernarekha and budhabalanga which flow eastward into the bay of bengal these rivers are rainfed and are the main source of surface water most of these rivers show low flow in the dry period of the year owing to the tropical savanna climatic condition therefore groundwater is the mainstay for agricultural domestic and industrial water use in the dry period of the year for this region along the coast there are alluvial plains with unconsolidated formations 31 141 km2 in the deltas of the six major rivers i e rushikulya mahanadi brahmani baitarani budhabalanga and subarnarekha most of the study region 1 08 995 km2 belongs to the pre cambrian consolidated geological formation besides these there exists semi consolidated formations of 15 541 km2 in the central and western part of the study region 4 data used the study used quarterly dtw data january quarter january to march april quarter april to june august quarter july to september and november quarter october to december bhanja et al 2017 of 84 quarters at 769 observation wells in the state of odisha monitored during the 1995 2015 period the data was monitored in january may august and november respectively to represent the corresponding quarters this data was obtained from the directorate of groundwater development dgd government of odisha india the dtw is measured as meter below ground level depth to groundwater fig 1 illustrates that the 769 observation wells are fairly distributed in different elevation ranges to capture groundwater variability in the study region the information on the groundwater status of an area which is of interest to planners and decision makers at different levels is the depth to the water table from the ground surface therefore the study evaluated the groundwater in the form of depth to water table instead of elevation from a datum avoiding confusion for the readers the hgc factors for groundwater variability selected in this study were lulc geomorphology ls s and r the lulc for the year 2002 geomorphology and ls maps at a scale of 1 50000 were obtained from odisha space applications centre orsac the lulc data for the years 2005 2010 and 2015 were collected in the raster format with a pixel size of 53 53 m from the natural resources census project of national remote sensing centre isro government of india hyderabad india they are shown in fig 2 a c respectively the study region has 17 55 and 29 lulc geomorphology and ls features respectively in entropy analysis 2002 lulc data was used for the dtw from 1995 to 2002 and similarly 2005 lulc for dtw from 2003 to 2005 2010 lulc for dtw from 2006 to 2010 and 2015 lulc for dtw from 2011 to 2015 datasets the digital elevation model dem of the study region was extracted from the 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem processed by the consortium for spatial information of the consultative group for international agricultural research cgiar csi the slope map is generated using the elevation data shown in fig 2 d a major portion of the region has a slope in the range of 0 30 and a few areas having slopes in the high range 86 5 289 2 are observed in the hilly and mountainous regions additionally 0 25 resolution gridded rainfall data obtained from the india meteorology department imd were utilized for evaluating climatic factor on groundwater variability fig 2 e pai et al 2014 all the hgc factors were then converted into a raster format with a pixel size of 53 53 m for the different analyses in the presented study it was observed from the rainfall data that the percentage of annual rainfall that occurred during the monsoon july sept varies from 59 68 92 74 during the study period similarly pre monsoon apr jun and post monsoon oct dec have a range of 2 11 14 19 and 3 79 28 11 respectively in the state of odisha fig 3 5 methodology this section presents the data driven methods adopted in this study and fig 4 illustrates the conceptual framework the mmk test was applied on the dtw at 769 observation wells to examine the temporal variability in the dtw of the study region the marginal entropy evaluated the spatial variability in the dtw subsequently the dominant hgc factors regulating the observed variabilities were determined using joint entropy 5 1 modified mann kendall test and sen s slope the temporal trends in the dtw at 769 observation wells were evaluated using the mmk test the trend test statistic for the mmk test was obtained by eqs 1 4 1 s 0 k 1 n 1 k 1 n s i g n x j x k j k where x is the dtw time series n is the number of data points and j and k vary from 2 to n and 1 to n 1 respectively gocic and trajkovic 2013 a positive negative value of s 0 suggests that the observations tend to be larger smaller than observations made previously the variance of s 0 is severely underestimated overestimated when the data is positively negatively autocorrelated the modified variance calculated for a mmk test is given in eq 2 hamed and rao 1997 ahmadi et al 2018 le brocque et al 2018 merabti et al 2018 as 2 v s 0 v a r s 0 n n s n n 1 2 n 5 18 n n s where v s 0 is the modified variance and n n s is the correction factor given by eq 3 3 n n s 1 2 n n 1 n 2 i 1 n 1 n i n i 1 n i 2 ρ s i where ρ s i is the autocorrelation function of the ranks of the observations i varies from 1 to n 1 and n s is considered as an effective number of observations to account for the autocorrelation in the rank in cases where the sample size n is greater than 10 the standard normal variable z is computed as 4 z s 1 v s 0 i f s 0 0 0 i f s 0 0 s 1 v s 0 i f s 0 0 in this study positive values of z indicate an increase in dtw with time a declining trend for dtw and negative z indicates a decrease in dtw a rising trend for dtw for conducting the mmk test 1 and 5 significance levels were considered moreover sen s slope estimator sen 1968 was applied to each observation wells for estimating the slope of trend in the dtw to quantify the magnitude of the trend associated gocic and trajkovic 2013 this trend analysis was performed using matlab r2015b software this analysis presents the seasonal quarterly and overall trend in dtw during the study period of 1995 2015 5 2 shannon entropy shannon s 1948 entropy was used in the study to investigate the spatial variability in dtw and the relative dominancy of hgc factors for explaining the variability of groundwater in the tropical savanna region of india the advantage of this technique is that it could incorporate the effect of both categorical and numerical dependent or independent factors in the analysis the information an entropy analysis generates is that the dataset having lower marginal entropy would have lower variability and vice versa similarly the hgc factor on which the lower joint entropy value was based would be the greater dominant hgc factor in terms of influencing the dtw variability entropy i v for a system with a random variable v represents the uncertainty of the random variable and is expressed using eq 5 brunsell 2010 singh and cui 2015 liu et al 2016 sahoo et al 2017 5 i v p 1 p 2 p 3 p n i 1 n p i log 2 p i s t i 1 n p i 1 where pi is the probability of occurrence of vi in this study the quarterly dtw series were arranged in bins to obtain the marginal entropy values indicating the inherent variability in dtw of different quarters the scott 1979 algorithm was used for optimal binning and the frequency histograms for each quarter of the individual years were calculated the bin width h for the quarterly frequency histogram was determined using eq 6 gaur and mohanty 2013 6 h 3 49 s n 0 1 3 where h is the bin width n 0 is the total number of dtw observations in each quarter and s is the standard deviation of the quarterly dtw the average value of h across the duration of the study was chosen as the representative bin width the probability pi was then computed for each bin using eq 7 7 p i n i n 0 where n i is the number of dtw observations in the ith bin the pi values are then substituted in eq 5 to obtain quarterly marginal entropies the next step was the estimation of joint entropy i a b the dtw values were classified under different features present in the different hgc factors the dwt values in one feature class g w j of a hgc factor were paired up with the values in another feature class g w m under the same hgc factor to form an unordered pair on a quarterly basis for instance a village dense forest and open forest dense forest pairs of the form g w j g w m where j 1 2 j a n d m 1 2 m are feature classes of a factor a contingency table representing the relative frequencies fi was used to calculate the probabilities p g w j g w m given in eq 8 8 f i p g w j g w m n j m n 0 j 1 2 j m 1 2 m where njm is the number of observations in the jth from feature 1 and mth from feature 2 bins using the estimated p g w j g w m and eq 5 the joint entropy value was estimated the analysis was performed using dtw anomalies and the same was computed by subtracting the mean dtw value from the individual data points to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first attempt to evaluate hgc factors effects on groundwater variability using shannon s entropy in a tropical savanna climatic condition 6 results and discussion 6 1 temporal trend in dtw the modified mann kendall test conducted at 769 observation wells determined the wells with no trend declining trend increasing depth to the water table and rising trend decreasing depth to the water table in the study region as described in the methodology section the test was conducted at two significance levels i e at 1 and 5 according to the level of significance the points showing trend were classified as highly significant at α 0 01 and significant at α 0 05 the percentage of wells having no trend rising trend and declining trend in overall and seasonal time series at each significance level during the study period are presented in table 1 the overall trend resulted at each observation well in the study region specified that 26 and 15 of the wells have significant and highly significant trends respectively the seasonal trend for january and november quarters has an analogous percentage of wells as in the overall dtw trend whereas the april quarter shows a higher percentage of wells having trend at both the significant levels 30 and 18 the seasonal trend in the august quarter reveals that the lowest number of wells has a trend in that quarter this analysis on overall and seasonal trends revealed an important finding that the study region possessed a slightly higher percentage of wells with the rising trend than the declining trend except the august quarter additionally the rising to declining trend ratio in the april quarter was a little higher in magnitude as this quarter has a higher percentage of wells with a rising trend compared to other quarters in contrast the study region has a slightly lower percentage of wells with a rising trend than a declining trend in the august quarter these unforeseen findings are inconsistent with the general expectancy of hydrogeologists looking at the seasonal rainfall distribution pattern in particular which needs thorough investigation to identify the possible factor s causing this situation the spatial distribution of wells with the overall and seasonal quarterly trends are shown in figs 5 and 6 a d respectively the sen s slope values were obtained at each observation well indicating the magnitude of the slope of the trend lines presented in figs 5 and 6 a d it is evident from fig 5 that in the eastern north eastern and northern parts of the study region there exists a significant to a highly significant declining trend in dtw also the northwest part of odisha has a similar trend in the water table the highest rate of decline in dtw was 0 07 m quarter the highly significant trend in dtw in the north eastern and eastern districts of odisha suggests an alarming situation on the contrary the study region showed a slightly higher percentage of wells with rising dtw trends compared to declining trends it was found from fig 5 that the wells with significant and highly significant rising trends were dominated in the south and southwest part of the study region the highest rate of rising was observed to be 0 08 m quarter the spatial distribution of seasonal trends is quite similar to that of the overall trend fig 6 a d the relative magnitude ranges for seasonal trends in january and november quarters are analogous to the overall trend most of the wells in the august quarter have a trend magnitude in the range of 0 01 0 20 m year for rising and declining trends at both significant levels fig 6 c the declining and rising dtw rates in the august quarter were the lowest followed by november january and april quarters in increasing order which signifies the existence of both higher order rising and declining trends in the deeper dtw though the distribution of wells in the april quarter is similar to that of overall trend analysis the percentage of wells with higher order rising and declining trend magnitudes 0 20 0 51 m year and 0 20 0 43 m year respectively were pretty high compared to the overall trend analysis fig 6 b it was also observed that in the april quarter wells under highly significant and significant rising trends with higher order trend magnitude 0 20 m year are concentrated in the south and southwest parts in contrast the same for the declining trends are concentrated in the north and northeast part of the study region overwhelmingly this analysis accentuated the unforeseen groundwater temporal variability along with the spatial distribution of the temporal variability in the study region and highlighted the higher order susceptibility of dtw to rising and declining trends in the drier period of the year these findings suggest an alarming situation necessitating the requirement for proper planning and management of the groundwater resource the areas with highly significant trends should be considered for immediate action through different management practices for reversal of declining or rising trends to make the groundwater resource sustainable and prevent groundwater depletion and waterlogging 6 2 spatial variability in dtw the marginal entropy values for 84 datasets 4 quarters 21 years were computed taking 769 observation wells during 1995 2015 the results of marginal entropy for different quarters are presented in fig 7 it was observed that the entropy values are higher for the quarter with deeper dtw april indicating higher variability in this range and vice versa the highest mean marginal entropy value of 3 39 was obtained for the april quarter followed by january 3 35 november 3 25 and august 3 05 quarter which indicates the corresponding level of variability associated with the datasets in those quarters fig 7 this essentially indicates the spatial distribution variability of dtw in different quarters in april and january entropy values were greater than 3 3 in most of the years hence it is inferred that with increased depth to the water table below the ground surface evident in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods the variability in the dtw is the maximum the uneven extraction owing to the higher stress period of the year may be causing the spatial variability in dtw observed at different locations as the rainfall contribution to recharge is minimal during that period of the year fig 3 in the august quarter monsoon season the marginal entropy values in dtw were the lowest this could be because of the lowering of groundwater extraction due to rainfall contribution to irrigation and other water use the meticulous investigation of the factors regulating the observed variability is presented in subsequent sections 6 3 dominant hgc factors for dtw variability the joint entropy values were estimated from the dtw anomaly data for different quarters during 1995 2015 using the observation at 769 wells the topographical factor s based classification gave the maximum entropy value followed by r gm ls and lulc in decreasing order out of the hgc factors taken into consideration the lulc factor has the lowest entropy values in all the quarters since the topographical factor was found to have the lowest dominance in explaining the dtw variability with significantly higher joint entropy values compared to other variables it was discarded for further discussion the time series of joint entropy values corresponding to lulc ls gm and r is presented in fig 8 since the lulc factor is having the lowest entropy values irrespective of the quarters it best explains the variability in the dtw patterns in the study region as a dominant hgc factor as stated earlier lulc and ls directly influence groundwater recharge abstraction rate storage and transmissivity thereby regulating the groundwater variability to a higher degree moreover the joint entropy values obtained through this analysis also confirmed the dominance of these two factors while evaluating the relative importance of these two it was observed that ls s joint entropy values are approximately 50 higher than that of lulc this implies that the lulc is much superior in capturing the variability in dtw compare to ls the joint entropy values for gm were also in the higher range signifying the poorer performance compared to lulc and ls for explaining the dtw variability conclusively it is evident from fig 8 that lulc with the lowest joint entropy values throughout the study period is the most dominant among the hgc factor past studies revealed that rainfall possesses a direct impact on groundwater recharge therefore the joint entropy values for the rainfall were compared with the hydrogeological factor based entropy values it was observed that in the august quarter the entropy value associated with r is highest among the dominant hgc factors the magnitude of entropy value for r in the august quarter is almost double that of lulc this essentially signifies the poor performance of r compared to lulc in explaining the variability in dtw in the august quarter though the major portion of the study region receives around 90 of the annual average rainfall during this period fig 3 the climatic factor has a similar influence as that of the ls factor in the january quarter whereas in the april quarter it was as important as the gm factor fig 8 moreover as presented in fig 3 and section 4 during january april and november quarters the majority of the study region receives a total rainfall of around 10 of the annual average rainfall owing to tropical savanna climatic conditions the entropy results associated with r during these three quarters have shown slightly lower values which indicated that the lower r sometimes very much negligible amount in various locations could explain the higher range of variability in dtw of these quarters these results suggested that r could very poorly capture the variability associated with dtw in the tropical savanna climatic region these findings also suggested that the higher range of dtw variability happening during these three quarters is due to the abstraction of groundwater which essentially indicated that lulc is the dominant factor for dtw variability in these quarters the correlation coefficient r between the mean dtw and joint entropy values of lulc in corresponding years were determined fig 9 it was observed that the august quarter had the highest correlation r 0 91 followed by january november and april with r values to be 0 83 0 8 and 0 5 respectively it is observed from fig 9 that the correlation between the joint entropy values under lulc based classification and dtw decreased for deeper dtw it can be inferred from the above results that the lulc was consistently able to explain the variability associated with dtw of august november and january quarters in the study period whereas it showed slightly poor performance for the april quarter figs 8 and 9 further an attempt was made to establish the possible connection between the observed temporal trend in this region and the most dominant hgc factor i e lulc we evaluated the distribution of wells with significant to highly significant rising and declining trends in different lulc features it was observed that more than 75 of the wells with rising and declining trends at both the significant levels are under four major lulc features viz kharif monsoon cropland villages towns cities and kharif rabi post monsoon cropland fig 10 the kharif cropland has approximately 40 of the wells with rising and declining trends fig 10 illustrates that it is difficult to claim any lulc features contribution independently for the observed rising or declining trend it was also noticed that the kharif cropland and villages have contributed to the declining and rising trend almost evenly whereas the kharif rabi croplands and towns cities have relatively more contribution towards the rising trend this finding again competes against the hydrogeologist s general acuity of groundwater decline because of agricultural pumping in the non monsoon period rabi season the above discussion signifies that the croplands possessed the major portion of the wells with either of the trends again irrigation is the regulating factor for the stress caused by the croplands so we evaluated the distribution of wells with a trend in irrigated and non irrigated croplands we obtained the spatial information on irrigated and non irrigated land from ambika et al 2016 the distribution of rising and declining trends at both significant levels is presented in fig 11 it is also observed that the clear distinction of contributions of irrigated or non irrigated cropland to the rising and declining trends is difficult from the above discussion it is clear that the groundwater variability and the association of the same with the regulating lulc features are not straightforward even though it is clear that lulc dominantly regulates the dtw variability further it can also be found that the water supply system in the towns cities in the study region gets a significant portion of the supply from the river water lifting the unplanned and pseudoscientific sewerage management systems in the towns cities of developing countries like india are also contributing to the localized recharge of groundwater systems in the towns cities the small scale private groundwater extraction could be contributing to the declination of the dtw whereas the reduced use of groundwater for domestic purposes by the major portion of the population and enhanced recharge by sewerage might be contributing to the rising groundwater trend similarly under the edges of the rural water supply and sanitization program of the government of india the villages are being connected through pipe water supply in the last two decades the water supply system majorly depends upon the groundwater which might be resulting in a localized declination of the groundwater and the rising trend of dtw in other portions due to reduced groundwater utilization there similar effects of unbalanced surface and groundwater utilization for agriculture practice might be contributing to the trends observed in different parts of the study region so the scientific planning and management of water resources should be the pressing priority for long term sustainability it is also recommended to conduct rigorous impact assessment studies before implementing water supply utilization projects in the study region additionally through the process based modeling studies a more precise assessment of impacts of lulc and thereby the pumping on groundwater can be ascertained this will immensely contribute to the planning and management of water resources though it is challenging due to the data scarcity in this part of the world 7 conclusions a novel data driven framework was developed adopting mmk and shannon s entropy to address the groundwater variability and identify the dominant hgc factor among lulc gm ls s and r regulating the observed variability in the heavily stressed data scarce tropical savanna region of eastern india the reported study used quarterly dtw data for the period 1995 2015 the mmk test conducted at 769 observation wells determined the wells with no trend declining trend and rising trend in the study region at two significance levels i e at 1 and 5 the overall and seasonal trend analysis revealed that the study region possessed a considerable percentage of wells with rising and declining trends at both the significance level the study region shows a slightly higher percentage of wells with a rising trend additionally the rising to declining trend ratio was highest in april and lowest in the august quarter which is unforeseen but a breakthrough finding vital for the regional groundwater management the rising and declining rates in the august quarter were the lowest followed by november january and april quarter signifying the existence of both higher order rising and declining trends in the deeper dtw the spatial distribution of wells with trends presented through this analysis will have immense importance for decision makers decisively this analysis accentuated the unforeseen groundwater temporal variability in the study region and highlighted the higher order susceptibility of dtw to rising and declining trends which necessitated the requirement for proper planning and management of the groundwater resource the marginal entropy values indicated that the shallower dtw august has the lowest spatial variability whereas the april quarter with deeper dtw has the highest variability while evaluating the effect of hgc factors such as lulc gm ls s and r on the observed spatio temporal variability of the dtw it was concluded that lulc could explain the maximum variability in the groundwater in the study region it was also observed that the relationship between groundwater variability and the physical processes of recharge and abstraction governed by the features in the dominant hgc factor is not straightforward so it is recommended to conduct rigorous finer scale impact assessment studies through process based modeling at the locations with rising and declining trends in the study region however it is challenging due to the data scarcity conclusively the reported study can immensely contribute to the planning and management of sustainable water resources the formulated approach can assist the scientific community and decision makers in attaining groundwater sustainability in similar data scarce regions funding

8129,study region state of odisha a data scarce tropical savanna region in eastern india study focus this study evaluated the temporal variability in depth to groundwater dtw in the study region with heavily stressed aquifers during 1995 2015 using the modified mann kendall test subsequently shannon s entropy assessed spatial variability in dtw and determined the dominant hydrological geological and climatological hgc factor regulating the observed spatio temporal variability taking land use land cover lulc geomorphology lithology topography and rainfall as hgc factors new hydrological insights the overall and seasonal trend analysis revealed that the study region possessed both rising and declining trends with a slightly higher percentage of wells with a rising trend the spatial distribution of trends and the associated magnitude accentuated the unforeseen groundwater temporal variability and higher order susceptibility of dtw to rising and declining trends the marginal entropy revealed the higher order spatial variability associated with deeper dtw and vice versa evaluation of the hgc factors revealed that lulc could explain the maximum variability in the dtw as a dominant hgc factor it was found that the impact of lulc features on dtw variability is not straightforward necessitating impact assessment studies in the location with significant to highly

geomorphology r correlation coefficient 1 introduction the dependency on groundwater to meet ever increasing agricultural domestic and industrial water demand is expected to rise substantially across the tropics in the coming decades jasechko et al 2015 moreover during the drought and dry periods of the year groundwater becomes a vital source of water for agricultural and domestic use dams et al 2012 this necessitates comprehending the inherent variability of depth to groundwater dtw and the affecting hydrological geological and climatological hgc factors zhou et al 2016 however developing physical based models to understand the regional scale variability in highly heterogeneous geological formations especially in data scarce countries like india is almost impossible in this context the data driven approach seems to be a reasonable alternative to evaluate the insight of historic dtw variability and ascertain the factors regulating the variability observed for sustainable management of the groundwater resource the historical trend in dtw at different locations suggests valuable information on the change in recharge rate and anthropogenic activity impacts land use land cover lulc changes and climate variability despite continued dependency on the groundwater resource very limited studies have been carried out on the temporal trend analysis of dtw in the tropical savanna regions of india possibly due to the lack of reliable and continuous data monitoring ahmadi and sedghamiz 2007 machiwal and jha 2014a singh et al 2015 additionally the past studies have not considered temporal auto correlation existing in the dtw time series data while performing trend analysis machiwal and jha 2014b le brocque et al 2018 the modified mann kendall mmk test improves the trend evaluation accuracy by considering the temporal auto correlation existing in the time series hamed and rao 1997 understanding these temporal patterns and trends in the groundwater regime is essential for efficient resource management panda et al 2007 sreekanth et al 2009 zhou et al 2016 this study evaluates the dtw variability and the level of dominance the hgc factors possess in explaining the observed variability at a regional scale encompassing several aquifers and river basins a few studies have investigated the effect of topography on the spatio temporal patterns of the dtw for highland regions tilahun et al 2015 guzman et al 2017 very limited investigations are reported to understand the effects of different hgc factors on groundwater variability guzman et al 2017 some studies evaluated the effects of lulc soil texture soil hydraulic properties rainfall and topography on the spatial distribution and temporal persistence of soil moisture using various techniques joshi and mohanty 2010 baroni et al 2013 gaur and mohanty 2016 among the various techniques reported in the literature the entropy technique was a relatively simple tool that can incorporate both categorical and numerical parameters gaur and mohanty 2013 again shannon s entropy can provide information on the spatial variability in the dtw through marginal entropy values shannon s entropy technique s aforesaid advantages enable it to be an appropriate and robust technique than other statistical ones for this study from the review of the past studies it is clear that very few attempts have been made to study the spatio temporal variability of dtw at a regional scale and the pertinent hgc factors for groundwater variability the present study s motivation is to investigate the dominant factors regulating the spatio temporal variability of dtw in a data scarce tropical savanna region like india to the best of our knowledge this study is the first of its kind to address the different regulating factors of dtw variability in a tropical savanna climatic region the study firstly comprehended the variability in dtw of the study region and then the dominant hgc factors for observed spatio temporal variability were identified using shannon s entropy approach the hgc factors considered in this study were lulc geomorphology lithological structure ls topography s slope and quarterly cumulative rainfall r the proposed framework is a novel attempt to characterize spatio temporal variability in dtw in tropical regions with highly heterogeneous aquifers 2 choice of hgc factors of dtw variability in this study the hgc factors regulating the dtw variability were selected based on their influence on the infiltration capacity infiltration opportunity time recharge processes and abstraction rates additionally the hgc factors were selected such that they are the indicators of hydrogeological properties of aquifers governing the movement of water and can fill the data gap for sustainable management of groundwater for instance the lulc of an area affects dtw variability in numerous ways ilstedt et al 2016 the areas with settlements villages towns and cities and agricultural lands are likely to consume more groundwater due to tropical savanna climatic conditions due to the increase in urbanization there is a reduction in pervious surfaces thereby causing an increase in overland flow and a decrease in localized infiltration and recharge rate in low drainage density areas zipper et al 2018 jena et al 2020 the presence of dense forest cover with a shortage of rainfall can make the top surface of the soil hydrophobic and water repellent doerr et al 2000 the water repellence enhances preferential flows in unsaturated zones moreover scrub forests open forests and barren lands with scrubs resist overland flow and promote groundwater recharge the lulc classes such as water bodies reservoirs and canals enhance groundwater recharge and sometimes cause waterlogging fashae et al 2014 similarly geomorphology is an indicator of aquifer properties shaw et al 2018 sahoo and bhabagrahi 2019 structures such as pediments residual hills denudational hills and structural hills do not promote infiltration and have low hydraulic conductivity and recharge capability rajaveni et al 2017 whereas alluvial planes back swamps buried channels paleochannels flood plains and abandoned channels show higher infiltration rates recharge capability and hydraulic conductivity most importantly these geomorphology classes possess higher storage volumes for groundwater thereby affecting the dtw at a location ward et al 2002 lithology or the study of geological units is also important as it affects soil water s occurrence and movement dafny et al 2010 secondary porosity in the form of fractures and weathering promote groundwater seepage in rocky strata the hard rocks have less porosity and are classified under low groundwater prospective formations solomon and quiel 2006 the fractures with connectivity to a large water body or very good outcrop yield abundant groundwater limestone quartzite sandstone and sandstone with shale possess high porosity the water holding capacity along with the transmission capacity of these formations regulates the dtw the alluvial plains with higher recharge potential effective porosity and hydraulic conductivity ensure better groundwater availability mendicino et al 2008 similarly volcanic rocks possess huge macro pores facilitating groundwater storage and movement groundwater flow occurs from a higher potential to a lower potential which is very much connected to the slope of the area condon and maxwell 2015 therefore the topography is a controlling factor in groundwater availability tilahun et al 2016 at a regional scale groundwater recharge happens near topographic divides and discharges in valleys eakin 1966 the slope factor controls groundwater movement across many spatial scales steeper topography can be associated with deeper water table depths more regional groundwater flows and increased groundwater surface water interaction guzman et al 2017 hodgkins et al 2017 estimated the interannual correlations between mean annual dtw and hydro climatic variables such as annual precipitation temperature and streamflow to understand the factors that influence dtw in a glacial aquifer system they observed that the groundwater level was significantly correlated with precipitation at 10 4 70 2 of wells in the different parts of their study region dawes et al 2012 investigated that the rainfall declination over the decades coupled with increasing water demand from a growing population has resulted in the falling of dtw in the southwest part of western australia mccallum et al 2010 found that the most important factor influencing annual groundwater recharge is annual rainfall 3 study region climatologically india is divided into six regions tropical rainforest tropical savanna arid deserts arid steppe hot temperate warm summer and temperate dry winter cold summer peel et al 2007 in this study the spatio temporal variability and the pertinent dominant hgc factors in a tropical savanna region over the state of odisha india were investigated fig 1 the study region has a geographical area of 155 707 km2 and extends from 17 46ˈ 48ˈˈ n to 22 31ˈ 12ˈˈ n and 81 21ˈ 36ˈˈ e to 87 30ˈ 00ˈˈe fig 1 this region receives average annual rainfall ranging from 1071 to 2432 mm with an average standard deviation range of 201 867 during the study period fig 2 e the preliminary analysis on rainfall shows that there is no clear trend of increase or decrease in average annual rainfall over the region past studies over this region also have similar conclusions kumar et al 2010 and suggested that there is hardly any change in the region s future climate mohan and rajeevan 2017 there exist eleven major river basins namely kolab indumati nagabali vamsadhara bahuda rushikulya mahanadi brahmani baitarani subernarekha and budhabalanga which flow eastward into the bay of bengal these rivers are rainfed and are the main source of surface water most of these rivers show low flow in the dry period of the year owing to the tropical savanna climatic condition therefore groundwater is the mainstay for agricultural domestic and industrial water use in the dry period of the year for this region along the coast there are alluvial plains with unconsolidated formations 31 141 km2 in the deltas of the six major rivers i e rushikulya mahanadi brahmani baitarani budhabalanga and subarnarekha most of the study region 1 08 995 km2 belongs to the pre cambrian consolidated geological formation besides these there exists semi consolidated formations of 15 541 km2 in the central and western part of the study region 4 data used the study used quarterly dtw data january quarter january to march april quarter april to june august quarter july to september and november quarter october to december bhanja et al 2017 of 84 quarters at 769 observation wells in the state of odisha monitored during the 1995 2015 period the data was monitored in january may august and november respectively to represent the corresponding quarters this data was obtained from the directorate of groundwater development dgd government of odisha india the dtw is measured as meter below ground level depth to groundwater fig 1 illustrates that the 769 observation wells are fairly distributed in different elevation ranges to capture groundwater variability in the study region the information on the groundwater status of an area which is of interest to planners and decision makers at different levels is the depth to the water table from the ground surface therefore the study evaluated the groundwater in the form of depth to water table instead of elevation from a datum avoiding confusion for the readers the hgc factors for groundwater variability selected in this study were lulc geomorphology ls s and r the lulc for the year 2002 geomorphology and ls maps at a scale of 1 50000 were obtained from odisha space applications centre orsac the lulc data for the years 2005 2010 and 2015 were collected in the raster format with a pixel size of 53 53 m from the natural resources census project of national remote sensing centre isro government of india hyderabad india they are shown in fig 2 a c respectively the study region has 17 55 and 29 lulc geomorphology and ls features respectively in entropy analysis 2002 lulc data was used for the dtw from 1995 to 2002 and similarly 2005 lulc for dtw from 2003 to 2005 2010 lulc for dtw from 2006 to 2010 and 2015 lulc for dtw from 2011 to 2015 datasets the digital elevation model dem of the study region was extracted from the 90 m shuttle radar topography mission srtm dem processed by the consortium for spatial information of the consultative group for international agricultural research cgiar csi the slope map is generated using the elevation data shown in fig 2 d a major portion of the region has a slope in the range of 0 30 and a few areas having slopes in the high range 86 5 289 2 are observed in the hilly and mountainous regions additionally 0 25 resolution gridded rainfall data obtained from the india meteorology department imd were utilized for evaluating climatic factor on groundwater variability fig 2 e pai et al 2014 all the hgc factors were then converted into a raster format with a pixel size of 53 53 m for the different analyses in the presented study it was observed from the rainfall data that the percentage of annual rainfall that occurred during the monsoon july sept varies from 59 68 92 74 during the study period similarly pre monsoon apr jun and post monsoon oct dec have a range of 2 11 14 19 and 3 79 28 11 respectively in the state of odisha fig 3 5 methodology this section presents the data driven methods adopted in this study and fig 4 illustrates the conceptual framework the mmk test was applied on the dtw at 769 observation wells to examine the temporal variability in the dtw of the study region the marginal entropy evaluated the spatial variability in the dtw subsequently the dominant hgc factors regulating the observed variabilities were determined using joint entropy 5 1 modified mann kendall test and sen s slope the temporal trends in the dtw at 769 observation wells were evaluated using the mmk test the trend test statistic for the mmk test was obtained by eqs 1 4 1 s 0 k 1 n 1 k 1 n s i g n x j x k j k where x is the dtw time series n is the number of data points and j and k vary from 2 to n and 1 to n 1 respectively gocic and trajkovic 2013 a positive negative value of s 0 suggests that the observations tend to be larger smaller than observations made previously the variance of s 0 is severely underestimated overestimated when the data is positively negatively autocorrelated the modified variance calculated for a mmk test is given in eq 2 hamed and rao 1997 ahmadi et al 2018 le brocque et al 2018 merabti et al 2018 as 2 v s 0 v a r s 0 n n s n n 1 2 n 5 18 n n s where v s 0 is the modified variance and n n s is the correction factor given by eq 3 3 n n s 1 2 n n 1 n 2 i 1 n 1 n i n i 1 n i 2 ρ s i where ρ s i is the autocorrelation function of the ranks of the observations i varies from 1 to n 1 and n s is considered as an effective number of observations to account for the autocorrelation in the rank in cases where the sample size n is greater than 10 the standard normal variable z is computed as 4 z s 1 v s 0 i f s 0 0 0 i f s 0 0 s 1 v s 0 i f s 0 0 in this study positive values of z indicate an increase in dtw with time a declining trend for dtw and negative z indicates a decrease in dtw a rising trend for dtw for conducting the mmk test 1 and 5 significance levels were considered moreover sen s slope estimator sen 1968 was applied to each observation wells for estimating the slope of trend in the dtw to quantify the magnitude of the trend associated gocic and trajkovic 2013 this trend analysis was performed using matlab r2015b software this analysis presents the seasonal quarterly and overall trend in dtw during the study period of 1995 2015 5 2 shannon entropy shannon s 1948 entropy was used in the study to investigate the spatial variability in dtw and the relative dominancy of hgc factors for explaining the variability of groundwater in the tropical savanna region of india the advantage of this technique is that it could incorporate the effect of both categorical and numerical dependent or independent factors in the analysis the information an entropy analysis generates is that the dataset having lower marginal entropy would have lower variability and vice versa similarly the hgc factor on which the lower joint entropy value was based would be the greater dominant hgc factor in terms of influencing the dtw variability entropy i v for a system with a random variable v represents the uncertainty of the random variable and is expressed using eq 5 brunsell 2010 singh and cui 2015 liu et al 2016 sahoo et al 2017 5 i v p 1 p 2 p 3 p n i 1 n p i log 2 p i s t i 1 n p i 1 where pi is the probability of occurrence of vi in this study the quarterly dtw series were arranged in bins to obtain the marginal entropy values indicating the inherent variability in dtw of different quarters the scott 1979 algorithm was used for optimal binning and the frequency histograms for each quarter of the individual years were calculated the bin width h for the quarterly frequency histogram was determined using eq 6 gaur and mohanty 2013 6 h 3 49 s n 0 1 3 where h is the bin width n 0 is the total number of dtw observations in each quarter and s is the standard deviation of the quarterly dtw the average value of h across the duration of the study was chosen as the representative bin width the probability pi was then computed for each bin using eq 7 7 p i n i n 0 where n i is the number of dtw observations in the ith bin the pi values are then substituted in eq 5 to obtain quarterly marginal entropies the next step was the estimation of joint entropy i a b the dtw values were classified under different features present in the different hgc factors the dwt values in one feature class g w j of a hgc factor were paired up with the values in another feature class g w m under the same hgc factor to form an unordered pair on a quarterly basis for instance a village dense forest and open forest dense forest pairs of the form g w j g w m where j 1 2 j a n d m 1 2 m are feature classes of a factor a contingency table representing the relative frequencies fi was used to calculate the probabilities p g w j g w m given in eq 8 8 f i p g w j g w m n j m n 0 j 1 2 j m 1 2 m where njm is the number of observations in the jth from feature 1 and mth from feature 2 bins using the estimated p g w j g w m and eq 5 the joint entropy value was estimated the analysis was performed using dtw anomalies and the same was computed by subtracting the mean dtw value from the individual data points to the best of the authors knowledge this is the first attempt to evaluate hgc factors effects on groundwater variability using shannon s entropy in a tropical savanna climatic condition 6 results and discussion 6 1 temporal trend in dtw the modified mann kendall test conducted at 769 observation wells determined the wells with no trend declining trend increasing depth to the water table and rising trend decreasing depth to the water table in the study region as described in the methodology section the test was conducted at two significance levels i e at 1 and 5 according to the level of significance the points showing trend were classified as highly significant at α 0 01 and significant at α 0 05 the percentage of wells having no trend rising trend and declining trend in overall and seasonal time series at each significance level during the study period are presented in table 1 the overall trend resulted at each observation well in the study region specified that 26 and 15 of the wells have significant and highly significant trends respectively the seasonal trend for january and november quarters has an analogous percentage of wells as in the overall dtw trend whereas the april quarter shows a higher percentage of wells having trend at both the significant levels 30 and 18 the seasonal trend in the august quarter reveals that the lowest number of wells has a trend in that quarter this analysis on overall and seasonal trends revealed an important finding that the study region possessed a slightly higher percentage of wells with the rising trend than the declining trend except the august quarter additionally the rising to declining trend ratio in the april quarter was a little higher in magnitude as this quarter has a higher percentage of wells with a rising trend compared to other quarters in contrast the study region has a slightly lower percentage of wells with a rising trend than a declining trend in the august quarter these unforeseen findings are inconsistent with the general expectancy of hydrogeologists looking at the seasonal rainfall distribution pattern in particular which needs thorough investigation to identify the possible factor s causing this situation the spatial distribution of wells with the overall and seasonal quarterly trends are shown in figs 5 and 6 a d respectively the sen s slope values were obtained at each observation well indicating the magnitude of the slope of the trend lines presented in figs 5 and 6 a d it is evident from fig 5 that in the eastern north eastern and northern parts of the study region there exists a significant to a highly significant declining trend in dtw also the northwest part of odisha has a similar trend in the water table the highest rate of decline in dtw was 0 07 m quarter the highly significant trend in dtw in the north eastern and eastern districts of odisha suggests an alarming situation on the contrary the study region showed a slightly higher percentage of wells with rising dtw trends compared to declining trends it was found from fig 5 that the wells with significant and highly significant rising trends were dominated in the south and southwest part of the study region the highest rate of rising was observed to be 0 08 m quarter the spatial distribution of seasonal trends is quite similar to that of the overall trend fig 6 a d the relative magnitude ranges for seasonal trends in january and november quarters are analogous to the overall trend most of the wells in the august quarter have a trend magnitude in the range of 0 01 0 20 m year for rising and declining trends at both significant levels fig 6 c the declining and rising dtw rates in the august quarter were the lowest followed by november january and april quarters in increasing order which signifies the existence of both higher order rising and declining trends in the deeper dtw though the distribution of wells in the april quarter is similar to that of overall trend analysis the percentage of wells with higher order rising and declining trend magnitudes 0 20 0 51 m year and 0 20 0 43 m year respectively were pretty high compared to the overall trend analysis fig 6 b it was also observed that in the april quarter wells under highly significant and significant rising trends with higher order trend magnitude 0 20 m year are concentrated in the south and southwest parts in contrast the same for the declining trends are concentrated in the north and northeast part of the study region overwhelmingly this analysis accentuated the unforeseen groundwater temporal variability along with the spatial distribution of the temporal variability in the study region and highlighted the higher order susceptibility of dtw to rising and declining trends in the drier period of the year these findings suggest an alarming situation necessitating the requirement for proper planning and management of the groundwater resource the areas with highly significant trends should be considered for immediate action through different management practices for reversal of declining or rising trends to make the groundwater resource sustainable and prevent groundwater depletion and waterlogging 6 2 spatial variability in dtw the marginal entropy values for 84 datasets 4 quarters 21 years were computed taking 769 observation wells during 1995 2015 the results of marginal entropy for different quarters are presented in fig 7 it was observed that the entropy values are higher for the quarter with deeper dtw april indicating higher variability in this range and vice versa the highest mean marginal entropy value of 3 39 was obtained for the april quarter followed by january 3 35 november 3 25 and august 3 05 quarter which indicates the corresponding level of variability associated with the datasets in those quarters fig 7 this essentially indicates the spatial distribution variability of dtw in different quarters in april and january entropy values were greater than 3 3 in most of the years hence it is inferred that with increased depth to the water table below the ground surface evident in the pre monsoon and post monsoon periods the variability in the dtw is the maximum the uneven extraction owing to the higher stress period of the year may be causing the spatial variability in dtw observed at different locations as the rainfall contribution to recharge is minimal during that period of the year fig 3 in the august quarter monsoon season the marginal entropy values in dtw were the lowest this could be because of the lowering of groundwater extraction due to rainfall contribution to irrigation and other water use the meticulous investigation of the factors regulating the observed variability is presented in subsequent sections 6 3 dominant hgc factors for dtw variability the joint entropy values were estimated from the dtw anomaly data for different quarters during 1995 2015 using the observation at 769 wells the topographical factor s based classification gave the maximum entropy value followed by r gm ls and lulc in decreasing order out of the hgc factors taken into consideration the lulc factor has the lowest entropy values in all the quarters since the topographical factor was found to have the lowest dominance in explaining the dtw variability with significantly higher joint entropy values compared to other variables it was discarded for further discussion the time series of joint entropy values corresponding to lulc ls gm and r is presented in fig 8 since the lulc factor is having the lowest entropy values irrespective of the quarters it best explains the variability in the dtw patterns in the study region as a dominant hgc factor as stated earlier lulc and ls directly influence groundwater recharge abstraction rate storage and transmissivity thereby regulating the groundwater variability to a higher degree moreover the joint entropy values obtained through this analysis also confirmed the dominance of these two factors while evaluating the relative importance of these two it was observed that ls s joint entropy values are approximately 50 higher than that of lulc this implies that the lulc is much superior in capturing the variability in dtw compare to ls the joint entropy values for gm were also in the higher range signifying the poorer performance compared to lulc and ls for explaining the dtw variability conclusively it is evident from fig 8 that lulc with the lowest joint entropy values throughout the study period is the most dominant among the hgc factor past studies revealed that rainfall possesses a direct impact on groundwater recharge therefore the joint entropy values for the rainfall were compared with the hydrogeological factor based entropy values it was observed that in the august quarter the entropy value associated with r is highest among the dominant hgc factors the magnitude of entropy value for r in the august quarter is almost double that of lulc this essentially signifies the poor performance of r compared to lulc in explaining the variability in dtw in the august quarter though the major portion of the study region receives around 90 of the annual average rainfall during this period fig 3 the climatic factor has a similar influence as that of the ls factor in the january quarter whereas in the april quarter it was as important as the gm factor fig 8 moreover as presented in fig 3 and section 4 during january april and november quarters the majority of the study region receives a total rainfall of around 10 of the annual average rainfall owing to tropical savanna climatic conditions the entropy results associated with r during these three quarters have shown slightly lower values which indicated that the lower r sometimes very much negligible amount in various locations could explain the higher range of variability in dtw of these quarters these results suggested that r could very poorly capture the variability associated with dtw in the tropical savanna climatic region these findings also suggested that the higher range of dtw variability happening during these three quarters is due to the abstraction of groundwater which essentially indicated that lulc is the dominant factor for dtw variability in these quarters the correlation coefficient r between the mean dtw and joint entropy values of lulc in corresponding years were determined fig 9 it was observed that the august quarter had the highest correlation r 0 91 followed by january november and april with r values to be 0 83 0 8 and 0 5 respectively it is observed from fig 9 that the correlation between the joint entropy values under lulc based classification and dtw decreased for deeper dtw it can be inferred from the above results that the lulc was consistently able to explain the variability associated with dtw of august november and january quarters in the study period whereas it showed slightly poor performance for the april quarter figs 8 and 9 further an attempt was made to establish the possible connection between the observed temporal trend in this region and the most dominant hgc factor i e lulc we evaluated the distribution of wells with significant to highly significant rising and declining trends in different lulc features it was observed that more than 75 of the wells with rising and declining trends at both the significant levels are under four major lulc features viz kharif monsoon cropland villages towns cities and kharif rabi post monsoon cropland fig 10 the kharif cropland has approximately 40 of the wells with rising and declining trends fig 10 illustrates that it is difficult to claim any lulc features contribution independently for the observed rising or declining trend it was also noticed that the kharif cropland and villages have contributed to the declining and rising trend almost evenly whereas the kharif rabi croplands and towns cities have relatively more contribution towards the rising trend this finding again competes against the hydrogeologist s general acuity of groundwater decline because of agricultural pumping in the non monsoon period rabi season the above discussion signifies that the croplands possessed the major portion of the wells with either of the trends again irrigation is the regulating factor for the stress caused by the croplands so we evaluated the distribution of wells with a trend in irrigated and non irrigated croplands we obtained the spatial information on irrigated and non irrigated land from ambika et al 2016 the distribution of rising and declining trends at both significant levels is presented in fig 11 it is also observed that the clear distinction of contributions of irrigated or non irrigated cropland to the rising and declining trends is difficult from the above discussion it is clear that the groundwater variability and the association of the same with the regulating lulc features are not straightforward even though it is clear that lulc dominantly regulates the dtw variability further it can also be found that the water supply system in the towns cities in the study region gets a significant portion of the supply from the river water lifting the unplanned and pseudoscientific sewerage management systems in the towns cities of developing countries like india are also contributing to the localized recharge of groundwater systems in the towns cities the small scale private groundwater extraction could be contributing to the declination of the dtw whereas the reduced use of groundwater for domestic purposes by the major portion of the population and enhanced recharge by sewerage might be contributing to the rising groundwater trend similarly under the edges of the rural water supply and sanitization program of the government of india the villages are being connected through pipe water supply in the last two decades the water supply system majorly depends upon the groundwater which might be resulting in a localized declination of the groundwater and the rising trend of dtw in other portions due to reduced groundwater utilization there similar effects of unbalanced surface and groundwater utilization for agriculture practice might be contributing to the trends observed in different parts of the study region so the scientific planning and management of water resources should be the pressing priority for long term sustainability it is also recommended to conduct rigorous impact assessment studies before implementing water supply utilization projects in the study region additionally through the process based modeling studies a more precise assessment of impacts of lulc and thereby the pumping on groundwater can be ascertained this will immensely contribute to the planning and management of water resources though it is challenging due to the data scarcity in this part of the world 7 conclusions a novel data driven framework was developed adopting mmk and shannon s entropy to address the groundwater variability and identify the dominant hgc factor among lulc gm ls s and r regulating the observed variability in the heavily stressed data scarce tropical savanna region of eastern india the reported study used quarterly dtw data for the period 1995 2015 the mmk test conducted at 769 observation wells determined the wells with no trend declining trend and rising trend in the study region at two significance levels i e at 1 and 5 the overall and seasonal trend analysis revealed that the study region possessed a considerable percentage of wells with rising and declining trends at both the significance level the study region shows a slightly higher percentage of wells with a rising trend additionally the rising to declining trend ratio was highest in april and lowest in the august quarter which is unforeseen but a breakthrough finding vital for the regional groundwater management the rising and declining rates in the august quarter were the lowest followed by november january and april quarter signifying the existence of both higher order rising and declining trends in the deeper dtw the spatial distribution of wells with trends presented through this analysis will have immense importance for decision makers decisively this analysis accentuated the unforeseen groundwater temporal variability in the study region and highlighted the higher order susceptibility of dtw to rising and declining trends which necessitated the requirement for proper planning and management of the groundwater resource the marginal entropy values indicated that the shallower dtw august has the lowest spatial variability whereas the april quarter with deeper dtw has the highest variability while evaluating the effect of hgc factors such as lulc gm ls s and r on the observed spatio temporal variability of the dtw it was concluded that lulc could explain the maximum variability in the groundwater in the study region it was also observed that the relationship between groundwater variability and the physical processes of recharge and abstraction governed by the features in the dominant hgc factor is not straightforward so it is recommended to conduct rigorous finer scale impact assessment studies through process based modeling at the locations with rising and declining trends in the study region however it is challenging due to the data scarcity conclusively the reported study can immensely contribute to the planning and management of sustainable water resources the formulated approach can assist the scientific community and decision makers in attaining groundwater sustainability in similar data scarce regions funding
