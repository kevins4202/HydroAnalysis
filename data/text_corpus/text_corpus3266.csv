16330,chlorinated cyanurates prepared by application of hypochlorite to cyanuric acid at different ratios have been commonly employed for disinfection combining uv with chlorinated cyanurates uv cl cyanurates can be a novel and effective advanced oxidation process aop because 1 cl cyanurates structurally resemble chlorinated amides that feature low reactivity with radicals and 2 cl cyanurates which bear multiple cl may exhibit high molar absorptivity at 254 nm due to red shifting absorption those chemiphysical properties of cl cyanurates may facilitate oxidant photolysis rate and lower radical scavenging rates in an aop thereby increasing steady state concentrations of radicals in this study uv spectra measured for cl cyanurates highlighted molar absorptivities at 254 nm 200 m 1cm 1 much higher than free chlorine or h2o2 while k oh determined using competition kinetics suggests low oh reactivity 1 95 107 m 1s 1 for cl cyanurates photolysis of cl cyanurates forms cl i e cl n cleavage and cl converts to oh formation of oh during a uv cl cyanurates aop was evaluated using terephthalate as a probe compound experiments systematically investigated the effects of ph cl2 dosage and cyanuric concentration three key factors affecting the equilibrium concentrations of chlorinated cynaurate species on the efficacy of removing three indicator contaminants by uv cl cyanurates aop uv cl cyanurates aop conducted in phosphate buffers or authentic surface waters highlighted efficiencies up to 170 higher than uv cl2 aop at neutral ph when the same dosage of oxidants was employed and the presence of certain levels of background ammonia or chloramines further enhanced its performance transformation of cyanuric acid or cl cyanurates by reacting with radicals during a uv cl cyanurates aop treatment was minimum toxicity assay indicated that uv cl cyanurates aop treated water was comparable or less toxicity than uv h2o2 or uv cl2 aop treated water and the initial cost

2013 and in a more limited case drinking water treatment kruithof et al 2007 typically aops work by combining low pressure ultraviolet lpuv with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radicals which in turn react with contaminants lately utilities are exploring alternative oxidants for uv h2o2 aop processes because 1 h2o2 features relatively low molar absorptivity at 254 nm ε254nm 18 6 m 1cm 1 and only a small fraction of the dosed h2o2 is consumed during treatment and 2 additional chlorine is required to quench excess h2o2 and maintain chlorine residual instead the uv chlorine uv cl2 aop and the uv chloramines aop are emerging alternatives to uv h2o2 aops as they are postulated to generate radicals more effectively feng et al 2014 and result in lower aop costs fang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a aop performance is dependent on the water treatment conditions although lab scale testing showed that the uv cl2 aop removed contaminants more effectively than the uv h2o2 aop at acidic ph which is relevant to reverse osmosis based potable reuse trains chuang et al 2017 fang et al 2014 a few drawbacks limit its broader application for different water treatment scenarios first the performance of uv cl2 aop is lowered as ph increases from acidic to neutral driven by enhanced radical scavenging by oxidants or by the intermediates formed from free chlorine chain decomposition chuang et al 2017 for instance pilot scale tests that compared the removals of methyl isoborneol in drinking waters by the two aops revealed much lower removal rates in uv cl2 than in uv h2o2 at ph 7 5 rosenfeldt et al 2013 this hinders the applications of uv cl2 aop in scenarios relevant to drinking water treatments or non ro based reuse trains e g o3 bac trains where the waters are typically at neutral or slightly alkaline ph summers et al 1996 szczuka et al 2021 vatankhah et al 2019 second when chloramines or ammonia are present in the background matrix free chlorine converts ammonia or chloramines to highly chlorinated chloramines e g dichloramine or trichloramine the presence of chloramines can lower contaminant removal during uv cl2 aop szczuka et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b because of strong radical scavenging by chloramines k oh for nh2cl 1 02 109 m 1s 1 compared to k oh for hocl 5 0 108 m 1s 1 chuang et al 2017 the performance of uv based aops is a function of the steady state concentration of radicals which are dependent on the ratio of the radical formation rate to scavenging rate crittenden et al 2012 zhang et al 2019a eq 1 exemplifies the steady state concentration of oh during uv cl2 or uv h2o2 aop treatment of trace contaminants in water where puv and f oxidant denote uv light intensity and fraction of light absorbed by the oxidant respectively a represents total absorbance in the treated water ki represents oh rate constant and s i denotes the concentration for a radical scavenger while radical formation rate is linked to molar absorption coefficient ε and innate quantum yield φ for oxidant photolysis radical scavenging can be attributable to the reactions with the oxidant k oxidant oxidant in eq 1 contaminant k c contaminant or the intermediates

if the oxidant is the predominant radical scavenger in an aop see modeling results in text s1 in the supplementary materials aligning with previous observations fang et al 2014 guo et al 2018 zhang et al 2019b guo et al 2018 evaluated the degradation kinetics of an array of contaminants in uv cl2 aop treatment their results demonstrated that increasing cl2 concentrations from 10 to 50 µm did not significantly change the k obs for contaminants whose degradation was attributable to oh i e ibuprofen metronidazole and ronidazole note that the oxidants i e hocl and ocl were the main oh scavengers in the uv cl2 aop systems such that the oh ss remained nearly constant over the range of 10 50 µm cl2 this further holds in aops with mixed oxidants for instance zhang et al 2019b tested the removal of 1 4 dioxane by treating ro reverse osmosis permeates with uv cl2 aop at pilot scale wherein 3 4 mg l as cl2 chloramines were already present this study revealed a marginal increase 5 in 1 4 dioxane removal even when the cl2 concentration was more than doubled from 2 4 to 6 3 mg l as cl2 eq 1 suggests that maximizing radical formation rate and minimizing oxidant scavenging are key to enhancing radical steady state concentrations and hence contaminant removal in uv based aops more efficient aops would rely on alternative oxidants that exhibit high molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm the wavelength predominantly emitted by lpuv high quantum yields of radical generations and low reactivities towards the radicals formed upon an oxidant s direct photolysis herein we propose chlorinated cyanurates as the alternative oxidants for aop treatment referred as the uv cl cyanurates aop below adding free chlorine to cyanuric acid at different ratios is a common approach to generate chlorinated cyanurates and a rapid equilibrium is reached among cyanuric acid and its dissociation products cyanurates free chlorine i e hocl and ocl and various chlorinated cyanurate species fig 1 wahman 2018 chlorinated cyanurates in particular sodium dichloroisocyanurate equivalent of a mixture of cl2 cyanuric acid at 2 1 ratio are commonly employed for swimming pool or drinking water disinfection clasen and edmondson 2006 clasen et al 2007 wahman 2018 two factors prompted us to investigate the uv cl cyanurates aop first chlorinated cyanurates resemble chlorinated amides structurally fig 1 which feature k oh values 106 m 1s 1 several orders of magnitude lower than those for hocl or ocl 109 m 1s 1 bulman et al 2019 and would thereby lower oxidant scavenging in a uv based aop second chlorinated cyanurates which feature multiple chlorine functional groups likely exhibit higher molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm than free chlorine does because of red shifting absorption chuang et al 2016 westerhoff et al 2004 resulting in a higher radical formation rate in this study we combined a chemical equilibrium model and the uv absorption spectra taken from mixtures of free chlorine and cyanuric acid to determine the molar absorption coefficients for three major chlorinated cyanurates the quantum yield for direct photolysis of the most abundant chlorinated cyanurate hydrochlorocyanurate hclcy was experimentally determined lab scale experiments were performed to systematically evaluate the performance of uv cl cyanurates aop with respect to the degradation of three low molecular weight indicator contaminants that featured different reactivity toward radicals predicted to exist in a uv cl cyanurates aop the impacts of ammonia and chloramines on the performance of uv cl cyanurates aop and toxicity determined by n acetylcysteine thiol reactivity assay in aop treated waters were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals information about the chemicals used in this study is provided in table s1 in the supplementary materials 2 2 experiments uv irradiation was conducted with a bench scale semi collimated beam apparatus with three 15 w uv low pressure mercury lamps sankyo denki co japan as described previously chuang et al 2017 mccurry et al 2016 briefly light shone through a 12 cm diameter aperture down 38 cm onto an open top 500 ml crystallization dish wrapped with black duct tape containing a 120 ml solution a magnetic stir bar was used to continuously mix the solution throughout the experiment incident photon flux determined by iodide iodate actinometry bolton et al 2011 was 8 6 10 7 me cm2 s and the uv intensity was 8 1 10 7 e l s assuming a semi collimated beam effective path length solution depth uv fluence mj cm2 was calculated as the average fluence rate incident irradiance corrected for the water absorbance and path length irradiation time sharpless and linden 2003 to initiate an experiment the water spiked with three indicator compounds at concentrations between 0 1 and 0 3 µm each were dosed with cyanuric acid and sodium hypochlorite at target concentrations aliquots 3 ml each were periodically taken for analysis and the total volume altered was less than 15 unless otherwise stated the concentrations of oxidants were controlled such that the total absorbance εl c was 0 02 during the experiments 2 3 analytical methods details for analyzing 1 4 dioxane deet and caffeine were provided in text s2 chlorine concentrations were analyzed by the dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 note that this method cannot isolate chlorinated cyanurates from free chlorine hocl and ocl such that chlorine concentrations measured in this study encompass all chlorine species text s2 uv vis spectra for free chlorine and chlorinated cyanurates were determined using an agilent cary 60 uv vis spectrophotometer 2 4 chemical equilibrium model and kinetic modeling the equilibrium concentrations of free chlorine chlorinated cyanurates and cyanuric acid and their dissociated products in a system containing sodium hypochlorite and cyanuric acid were calculated using a chemical equilibrium model adapted from the literature text s3 wahman 2018 with the main reactions listed in fig 1 a kinetic model combing the elementary reactions obtained from the literature or from this study was implemented by kintecus 6 8 ianni 2019 to simulate the formation of 2 hydroxyterephthalate during the treatment of terephthalate a probe compound for oh by uv cl cyanurates aop 3 results and discussion 3 1 radical formation rate and radical scavenging rate radical formation rate in a photocatalytic aop is directly associated with the molar absorption coefficient of the oxidant and the quantum yield for oxidant photolysis fig 2 provides the uv absorption spectra for 42 3 µm cl2 3 mg l as cl2 with and without cyanuric acid while 42 3 µm cyanuric acid absorbed negligible light at wavelengths 240 nm at ph 5 5 8 0 the mixtures of 42 3 µm cl2 21 1 µm 2 73 mg l or 42 3 µm 5 46 mg l cyanuric acid featured 35 62 higher absorbance at 254 nm than the 42 3 µm cl2 alone fig 2a c reflecting higher ε254nm for chlorinated cyanurates a total of eight chlorine species including six chlorinated cyanurates and two free chlorines i e hocl and ocl are in equilibrium in a system containing hypochlorite and cyanuric acid fig 1 the equilibrium concentrations of different species are dependent on ph cl2 dosage and cyanuric acid concentration using a chemical equilibrium model wahman 2018 we identified that dihydrogenchloroisocyanuric acid h2clcy hydrogenchloroisocyanurate hclcy and dichloroisocyanurate cl2cy are the predominant chlorinated cyanurates at conditions relevant to water treatment e g 14 1 42 3 µm cl2 and 7 42 3 µm cyanuric acid at ph 5 5 8 text s3 for example in the mixture of 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid at ph 6 8 hclcy and cl2cy are present at 21 6 µm and 5 4 µm respectively accounting for 77 of total chlorine while free chlorine hocl and ocl in combined constitutes 22 of total chlorine the percentage of free chlorine decreases as the molar ratio of cl2 cyanuric acid decreases fig s3 note that we defined total chlorine as the sum of the molar concentrations of free chlorine and each chlorinated cyanurate eq 2 although more than one cl were bound in a molecule of trichlorinated or dichlorinated cyanurate as discussed below this facilitates the comparison of the efficacy of uv cl cyanurates aops under different conditions because a multi chlorinated cyanurate might only generate one reactive radical upon direct photolysis 2 total chlorine μ m free chlorine cl cyanurates hocl oc l σ a b h a cl b cy 3 a b b 1 a b 3 to obtain the molar absorption coefficients for h2clcy hclcy and cl2cy we measured light absorbance for the mixtures of cl2 and cyanuric acid at different molar ratios first uv spectra 240 270 nm of hocl and ocl were taken with diluted sodium hypochlorite solution in 2 mm phosphate adjusted to ph 5 or 10 to obtain ε λ for hocl or ocl then spectrum measurements were repeated for four additional mixtures the mixtures of 141 µm free chlorine 10 mg l as cl2 and 70 5 µm cyanuric acid 9 1 mg l at ph 6 8 or 5 5 and the mixtures of 282 µm free chlorine 20 mg l as cl2 and 141 µm cyanuric acid 18 2 mg l at ph 6 8 or 5 5 mixture 1 4 table s4 for these mixtures the chemical equilibrium model revealed hclcy as the predominant 99 species of monochlorinated cyanurates and cl2cy as the predominant 96 species of dichlorinated cyanurates at ph 6 8 table s4 at ph 5 5 while cl2cy accounts for 98 of the dichlorinated cyanurates h2clcy and hclcy constitute 60 and 40 respectively of the monochlorinated cyanurates the measured absorbance aλ were combined within the framework of eq 3 to obtain ε λ for h2clcy hclcy and cl2cy the εhocl λ εocl λ and εcl cyi λ in eq 3 denote the molar absorption coefficients for hocl ocl and different species of chlorinated cyanurates respectively and cl cy denotes chlorinated cyanurates 3 a λ ε hocl λ hocl ε oc l λ oc l ε cl cy i λ cl cy uv absorption spectrum at 240 270 nm fig 2d illustrates that ε254 nm for h2clcy 214 m 1cm 1 hclcy 202 m 1cm 1 and cl2cy 202 m 1cm 1 were 3 5 fold higher than that for hocl or ocl 60 m 1cm 1 concurring with high absorbance measured in the mixtures of free chlorine and cyanuric acid fig 2a c molar absorption coefficients for the chlorinated cyanurates dropped as wavelength increases leaving ελ 80 m 1cm 1 at 274 nm and concurring with the fact that chlorinated cyanurates are not susceptible to solar photolysis wahman 2018 determining innate quantum yields for direct photolysis of chlorinated cyanurates is more challenging because of complex equilibria among chlorinated cyanurate species nevertheless we examined the k obs for total chlorine loss to estimate the quantum yield for hclcy by treating the mixture of 28 2 µm cl2 141 µm cyanuric acid at ph 7 2 with lpuv irradiation with and without 5 mm acetate hclcy accounts for approximately 90 of the total chlorine under these conditions mixture 5 table s4 and the 5 mm acetate quenches radicals chuang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a which helped to isolate the innate quantum yield for direct photolysis from subsequent chain reactions experimental results indicated that the k obs for total chlorine loss in the presence of 5 mm acetate 4 8 0 1 10 3 min 1 was 34 lower than of that observed in the absence of acetate 7 2 0 4 10 3 min 1 corresponding to a observed quantum yield of 0 3 0 004 accordingly the innate quantum yield for hclcy photolysis was estimated to be 0 2 based on k obs for total chlorine loss with acetate although quantum yield for hclcy photolysis was only 32 of that for hocl photolysis chuang et al 2017 the calculated direct photolysis rate for hclcy is 10 faster than for hocl driven by much higher molar absorption coefficient for hclcy however because one molecule of hocl or ocl produces two reactive radicals cl and oh or o the formation rate of total reactive radicals in uv cl2 aop may still be faster than that in uv cl cyanurates aop assuming photolysis of chlorinated cyanurate only generates one reactive radical cl in a fashion similar to n haloamide photolysis i e by the cleavage of n cl lessard et al 1981 because cl rapidly converts to oh by reacting with water r1 r2 jayson et al 1973 mcelroy 1990 oh may outweigh cl with respect to the steady state concentrations in a uv cl cyanurates aop this is confirmed by our experiments using terephthalate as a probe compound to measure the formation of oh in uv cl cyanurates see section 3 3 r1 cl h 2 o clo h h k 2 5 1 0 5 s 1 r2 clo h oh c l k 6 10 9 s 1 using competition kinetics text s4 we experimentally determined the oh rate constant for dihydrogen cyanurate h2cy to be 1 95 107 m 1s 1 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for free chlorine 5 108 6 5 109 m 1s 1 bulman et al 2019 chuang et al 2017 or 30 lower than that for h2o2 2 7 107 m 1s 1 crittenden et al 1999 although oh rate constants for the three major species of chlorinated cyanurates h2clcy hclcy and cl2cy were not measured we suspect that their k oh values are lower than k oh for h2cy that is because the electron withdrawing nature of cl functional group tends to reduce k oh chuang et al 2016 minakata et al 2009 and because protonated neutral species are less reactive toward oh than the deprotonated negatively charged counterparts the nist database overall these results highlighted the low radical scavenging by oxidants in a uv cl cyanurates aop 3 2 efficacy of uv cl cyanurates aop on degrading model compounds derived from eq 1 eq 4 provides an estimate of the steady state concentration of a given reactive radical r oh or cl during the uv cl cyanurates aop treatments of water featuring low total absorbance 0 02 r ss is associated with the concentrations of organic inorganic constituents and the concentrations of various chlorine species given that the concentrations of each chlorine species are functions of ph cl2 dosage and cyanuric acid concentration a total of 30 experiments were conducted to systematically evaluate these factors on the performance of the uv cl cyanurates aop with respect to contaminant degradations the purpose was not to accurately model the radical concentrations which would require a kinetics model accounting for chemical reactions in their real time dynamics as a function of ph oxidant speciation and concentration the goal was to provide an estimate for the steady state concentrations of reactive radicals during an aop treatment based on the initial equilibrium concentrations of various chlorine species and other constituents under the framework of eq 4 and to correlate the estimates with the observed degradation efficiency of contaminants 4 r ss 2 303 i 0 ε hocl φ hocl hocl ε oc l φ oc l oc l ε cl cy φ cl cy cl cy k hocl hocl k oc

drinking water treatments indicator compounds tested in this study included 1 4 dioxane n n diethyl meta toluamide deet and caffeine improper disposal of industrial waste has resulted in contamination of 1 4 dioxane an industrial solvent in surface water zenker et al 2003 1 4 dioxane and deet are poorly removed by conventional drinking water wastewater treatment trains frequently detected in drinking water effluents or potable reuse trains alturki et al 2010 fujioka et al 2018 roback et al 2018 stepien et al 2014 these compounds feature different reactivities with radicals potentially existing in uv cl cyanurates aop or uv chlorine aop systems i e oh cl clo cl2 as summarized in table s5 k oh for the indicator compounds are comparable 3 1 109 to 6 1 109 m 1s 1 while k cl spans 4 orders of magnitude ranging from 4 4 106 m 1s 1 for 1 4 dioxane to 3 9 1010 m 1s 1 for caffeine caffeine exhibits high reaction rate constants for cl2 2 2 9 3 108 m 1s 1 compared to a k cl2 of 3 3 106 m 1s 1 for 1 4 dioxane patton et al 2017 moreover caffeine is known to be reactive with clo related radicals guo et al 2017 sun et al 2016 such that caffeine can serve as a surrogate for evaluating the degradation behaviors of clo reactive compounds e g carbamazepine gemfibrozil etc guo et al 2017 in a uv cl cyanurated aop in all experiments trace amount of phenolic compounds 0 3 µm phenol and 0 3 µm bisphenol a were amended as the other constituents in the systems eq 4 the σk i s i mimicking the organic matters in waters of different treatment scenarios these compounds were selected because their reactivity with oh or cl i e k oh and k cl are well defined facilitating the comparisons between the estimates of radical steady state concentration eq 4 and the observed contaminant removal rates note that the three indicator compounds were at sub µm levels such that they were a minor source of radical scavenging previous research has shown that the concentrations of target contaminants may impact the steady state concentrations of radicals and thus the observed contaminant removal rates if those compounds are the main radical scavengers zhang et al 2019a initial experiments evaluated the degradation of the indicator contaminants added at a concentration of 0 3 µm each in uv cl cyanurates aops with the cl2 cyanuric acid molar ratio fixed at 2 1 the composition ratio of sodium dichloroisocyanurate the chemical equilibrium model indicated that the initial equilibrium concentrations of free chlorine i e hocl ocl and total cl cyanurates are each linearly correlated with the cl2 dosage employed fig s5 plotting ln c c0 for contaminants vs t demonstrated first order decay for 1 4 dioxane and deet fig s6 but not for caffeine decay discussed in later sections increasing the ph substantially reduced the experimentally measured fluence based pseudo first order rate constants k obs for the degradation of 1 4 dioxane and deet k obs dropped by 5 fold as ph increased from 5 5 to 6 8 and further decreased by factors of 4 as ph increased from 6 8 to 7 8 fig s7 leaving 0 1 log removals for 1 4 dioxane at ph 7 8 after 700 mj cm2 exposure relevant to aop systems increasing the cl2 dosage only resulted in limited enhancement of k obs for the degradations of 1 4 dioxane and deet fig s7 compared with the uv cl2 aop k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet in uv cl cyanurates aops with the cl2 cyanuric acid molar ratio fixed at 2 1 were comparable or slightly higher 0 30 than uv cl2 aop when the same cl2 dosage was employed fig s7 these results suggest marginal benefits for contaminant s removals by using sodium dichloroisocyanurate in lieu of sodium hypochlorite during the uv aop treatments of drinking water potable reuse water limited increases in k obs for the losses of contaminants when a cl2 dose higher than 28 2 µm was employed reflected the enhancement of radical formation rate by increasing cl2 dosage was offset by an increase of radical scavenging by oxidants these results also suggest that radical scavenging by oxidants was the predominant radical scavenging reactions indeed percentage of oh scavenging by different constituents which can be estimated by comparing the product k oh constituent indicated that hocl and ocl together dominated oh scavenging reactions 73 96 under these experimental conditions text s5 additional experiments evaluated the performance of uv cl cyanurates aop with a fixed cl2 of 42 3 µm but with varied cyanuric acid 21 2 42 3 µm leaving the molar ratio of cl2 cyanuric acid 2 1 raising cyanuric acid increases the equilibrium concentration of total cl cyanurates at the expense of free chlorine fig s8 for instance with 42 3 µm cl2 at ph 5 5 increasing cyanuric acid from 21 2 to 42 3 µm increases equilibrium concentration of total cl cyanurates from 11 4 to 18 µm but decreases the free chlorine concentration from 27 to 19 4 µm our experimental results showed that k obs for the loss of 1 4 dioxane or deet remained relatively stable as increasing the cyanuric acid from 21 2 to 42 3 µm during the uv cl cyanurates aop treatments at ph 5 5 while k obs enhanced by 62 and 108 for 1 4 dioxane and deet respectively when repeating the experiments at ph 6 8 fig s9 the discrepancy observed at ph 5 5 and ph 6 8 can be partly attributable to different extents of radical scavenging by free chlorine the equilibrium concentration of free chlorine in the mixture of 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid is 9 µm at ph 6 8 accounting for only 25 of total chlorine calculation for the percentage of oh scavenging by different constituents suggests that radical scavenging by free chlorine was lower at ph 6 8 than at ph 5 5 when the same dosage of cl2 42 3 µm and cyanuric acid 21 2 to 42 3 µm were employed in the systems table s7 to further explore the effect of equilibrium concentration of free chlorine on the performance of the uv cl cyanurates aop experiments were conducted with a fixed cyanuric acid at 42 3 µm but varying cl2 from 42 4 to 14 1 µm such conditions featured the cl2 cyanuric acid ratios 1 1 shifting the equilibrium toward cl cyanurates and resulting in much higher equilibrium concentration for cl cyanurates than free chlorine particularly at neutral ph table s6 with 42 3 µm cyanuric acid at ph 5 5 or 6 8 k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet increased by increasing cl2 from 14 1 to 42 3 µm fig 3 moreover uv cl cyanurates aops with 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid were remarkably more efficient compared to uv cl2 aops with 42 3 µm cl2 in terms of removing contaminants k obs values for 1 4 dioxane and deet losses were 100 to 170 higher in uv cl cyanurates than in uv cl2 at ph 6 8 fig 3 a rough estimate for the steady state concentration of oh in a uv cl cyanurates aop can be obtained by incorporating the molar absorption coefficients quantum yields and k oh values for cl cyanurates and free chlorine obtained in this study or adapted from previous works into the framework of eq 4 detailed in text s6 assuming cl formed from the photolysis of cl cyanurates rapidly transforms to oh by reacting with h2o i e reactions r1 r2 the calculation encompasses the radical formation from free chlorine and hcycl due to the unavailability of quantum yields for other cl cyanurates such that the calculated value remained a conservative estimate nevertheless the oh ss estimates correlate well with the experimental k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet fig 4 the degradation of caffeine accelerates with increased fluence deviating from pseudo first order kinetics in all aop treatments the acceleration of caffeine degradation was more pronounced in uv cl2 or uv cl cyanurates aop systems with elevated concentration of free chlorine fig s11 comparisons of the removal efficiency of caffeine at 170 mj cm2 exposure in uv cl2 aop show enhanced removal efficiencies with increased cl2 dosage in agreement with a previous study sun et al 2016 the uv cl cyanurates aop was less efficient at degrading caffeine than uv cl2 aop when the same cl2 dosage was employed fig 3 reflecting greater contribution of clo related radicals on degrading the imidazole moiety on caffeine in uv cl2 aop than in uv cl cyanurates aop sun et al 2016 while oh or cl induced hocl chain decomposition reactions is critical for the formation of clo related radicals high cl2 dosage facilitates their formation sun et al 2016 and thus results in greater removals of caffeine such hocl chain decomposition reactions would be less extensive in uv cl cyanurates aop than in uv cl2 aop 3 3 steady state concentrations of radicals and oh formation the steady state concentrations of oh cl and cl2 in selected aop conditions were experimentally measured using benzoate and nitrobenzene as probe compounds 0 5 µm each in the absence of indicator contaminants bulman et al 2019 experimentally measured oh ss were 10 to 20 fold higher than the measured cl ss in uv cl cyanurates aop with 42 3 µm cl2 21 1 µm or 42 3 µm cyanuric acid table s8 while the background chloride concentrations were 0 16 0 01 mm cl2 ss were ca 2 3 folds higher than oh ss under all experimental conditions the uv cl cyanurates aop highlighted higher steady state concentrations of oh and cl than uv cl2 aops when the same cl2 dosage was applied particularly at neutral ph at ph 6 8 the measured oh ss and cl ss were 1 5 0 01 10 13 m and 2 4 0 03 10 14 m respectively in a uv cl cyanurates aop with 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid nearly doubled to the oh ss of 8 4 0 01 10 14 m and the cl ss of 1 0 0 02 10 14 m measured in a uv cl2 aop with 42 3 µm cl2 alone the contribution of a radical r on degrading contaminants evaluated based on the values of k r r ss indicated major contributions of oh and to a much lower extent cl2 5 on degrading 1 4 dioxane and deet fig s12 concurring with the linear correlations observed between oh ss estimates and k obs for compounds losses fig 4 to confirm cl induced oh formation during a uv cl cyanurates aop i e reactions r1 r2 we evaluated 2 hydroxyterephthalate formation using terephthalate as a probe compound previous research has demonstrated that terephthalate is a specific and sensitive probe for oh fang et al 1996 page et al 2010 with a yield of 0 21 for the formation of 2 hydroxyterephthalate at ph 6 8 charbouillot et al 2011 briefly a 2 mm phosphate buffer containing 4 7 µm terephthalate was treated by uv cl cyanurates aop with 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid experimental results indicated that 2 hydroxyterephthalate increased from 0 µm to 0 18 0 01 µm after 10 min while the 4 7 0 1 µm terephthalate dropped to 2 7 0 1 µm fig s13 the decay of terephthalate and the formation of 2 hydroxyterephthalate in a uv cl cyanurates aop system can be kinetically expressed by eqs 5 6 wherein y denotes the yield of 2 hydroxyterephthalate hta from the reaction between

ammonia and chloramines ammonia and or chloramines are prevalent in drinking water or potable reuse systems previous studies revealed a median nh4 of 0 1 mg l n in influents of drinking water treatment plants dwtp in north america or in china and similar levels in finished drinking waters bei et al 2016 leavey roback et al 2016 furthermore chloramines were frequently employed prior to the microfiltration unit for biofouling control leaving chloramine residuals of 1 5 4 mg l as cl2 in the ro permeates within potable reuse treatment trains kwon et al 2020 the background ammonia or chloramines in waters may impact the performance of a uv cl cyanurates aop because of breakpoint reactions altering oxidant speciation during the aop treatments reaction of free chlorine with ammonia features a high reaction rate constant r3 while rate constant for the reaction between free chlorine and nh2cl or nhcl2 is orders of magnitude lower r4 r5 when cyanuric acid is added prior to the chlorination of a water containing ammonia or chloramines cyanuric acid competes with the background ammonia chloramines for free chlorine i e r3 r6 but the rate constant for the reaction between free chlorine and cyanuric acid kr6 remains unclear experiments evaluated kr6 relative to the reactivity of free chlorine for ammonia kr3 by application of 42 3 µm cl2 to 0 2 mg l n 14 3 µm nh4 in 2 mm phosphate buffered deionized water at ph 6 8 with and without 42 3 µm cyanuric acid for experiments with cyanuric acid free chlorine cl cyanurates rapidly decreased from 42 3 µm to 20 µm in the first 90 s with concomitant formation of 11 7 µm chloramines which accounted for 80 n of the 0 2 mg l n ammonia fig 5 a this concurred with the observation in experiments without cyanuric acid fig 5b suggesting a much faster rate constant for the reaction of free chlorine with ammonia than the reaction of free chlorine with cyanuric acid i e kr6 4 2 106 m 1s 1 such results also suggest that ammonia if any would be rapidly converted to chloramines i e within a timescale of seconds by reacting with hocl ocl during the uv cl cyanurates treatments in different treatment scenarios r3 hocl n h

output lpuv apparatus used in this study necessitated a 30 min illumination time to achieve a practically relevant uv fluence 700 1300 mj cm2 over which oxidant speciation can change significantly therefore efforts were made to investigate the dynamic concentrations of oxidants during application of free chlorine to nh2cl over the 30 min timescale with and without cyanuric acid when treating 1 5 mg l as cl2 nh2cl equivalent of 0 3 mg l n by 42 3 µm cl2 in the absence of cyanuric acid at ph 6 8 free chlorine dropped by 56 to 18 5 µm within the first 7 min followed by a slow decay thenceforth fig 5c in contrast experiments performed in the presence of 42 3 µm cyanuric acid highlighted a much rapid decrease in free chlorine cl cyanurates from 42 3 to 20 µm within the first 3 min followed by a plateau chloramine decay was slightly slower with cyanuric acid than without cyanuric acid at ph 6 8 plausibly driven by lower conversion rates i e r4 r5 resulting from lower free chlorine concentrations although these experiments were conducted without uv illumination oxidant decay free chlorine nh2cl nhcl2 cl cyanurates attributable to photolysis would be minimal 5 20 after a 170 mj cm2 exposure i e 7 min reaction time chuang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a nitrobenzene and benzoate were first used as the probe compounds to examine the effect of breakpoint reactions on the performance of aops over the 30 min timescale experiments involved treating a mixture of nitrobenzene and benzoate at 0 5 µm each and 1 5 mg l as cl2 nh2cl in 2 mm phosphate buffer at ph 6 8 by 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid followed by immediate uv irradiation results showed a clear biphasic trend a fast degradation kinetics for the first 7 min followed by a slow decay for the losses of nitrobenzene and benzoate during the uv cl cyanurates aop treatments fig s14 possible mechanisms for slower degradation kinetics in the timeframe of 10 30 min include 1 loss of oxidant concentrations due to breakpoint reactions and 2 the evolution of byproducts from breakpoint reactions competing with probe compounds for radicals jafvert and valentine 1992 pham et al 2021 given that illumination time required for achieving 700 1300 mj cm2 exposure in a pilot full scale aop unit is usually less than a minute chuang et al 2019 kwon et al 2020 mangalgiri et al 2019 over which changes in oxidant speciation and byproduct formation from breakpoint reactions are limited the degradation kinetics of contaminants in a pilot full scale unit can be conservatively represented by the fast degradation kinetics obtained in our lab scale testing further experiments evaluated the impact of 0 0 2 mg l n nh4 or 0 1 5 mg l as cl2 chloramines equivalent of 0 0 3 mg l n on the degradation kinetics of indicator contaminants in uv cl cyanurates aop like benzoate or nitrobenzene the degradations for 1 4 dioxane and deet also featured biphasic degradation kinetics fig 6 a b comparison of k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet obtained from the first 7 min of the uv cl cyanurates aop treatments demonstrated a downtrend as increasing nh4 from 0 to 0 2 mg l n at ph 5 5 fig 6c in contrast k obs for the degradations of 1 4 dioxane at ph 6 8 nearly doubled as increasing nh4 from 0 to 0 2 mg l n at ph 6 8 exceeding those observed at ph 5 5 in the presence of the same nh4 fig 6d results from experiments repeated in the presence of 0 1 5 mg l as cl2 equivalent of 0 0 3 mg l n chloramines also show similar trends fig s15 suggesting the presence of a certain level of background ammonia chloramines may enhance the efficacy of a uv cl cyanurates aop at neutral ph 3 5 effects of background matrix in authentic surface waters the removal efficacy for indicator compound in uv cl cyanurates aop was tested in rapid sand filter rsf effluents collected from two domestic water treatment facilities in taiwan and was compared to those in uv cl2 aop and uv h2o2 aop rsf effluents were tested given that an aop is usually employed for the abatements of micropollutants at the end of the treatment trains kruithof et al 2007 both effluents featured low concentrations of dissolved organic carbons 0 4 mg l c and ammonia 0 08 mg l n table s9 while concentration of inorganic carbon in effluent b 19 mg l c was 4 fold higher than that in effluent a 4 5 mg l c the background matrices in these waters were less complex compared to that in the secondary effluents of wastewater treatment plants facilitating the comparison between oh estimates eq 4 and the degradation efficiency of indicator compounds the rsf effluents were amended with three indicator compounds at 0 2 µm or 0 1 µm each and were treated by uv aops with the same concentration of oxidants on a molar basis or on a weight basis similar to the experiments conducted in phosphate buffer the addition of 42 3 µm cyanuric acid to uv cl2 aop i e uv cl cyanurates aop increased k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet by 27 50 and 65 144 respectively fig s16 however the increases were less than those observed in phosphate buffer partly attributable to enhanced oh scavenging by inorganic carbons e g hco3 k oh 8 5 106 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 during the aop treatments of effluents notably oh ss estimated from eq 4 correlated well with k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet across three different aops and two different rsf effluents fig s17 and text s8 highlighting the potent application of eq 4 in the optimization of operation conditions for aops see section 3 6 although efficacies of uv cl cyanurates aop on degrading 1 4 dioxane and deet were only 33 60 of those found in uv h2o2 aop uv cl cyanurates aop highlighted high degradation rates for caffeine 3 6 byproduct formation and environmental relevance the use of chlorinated isocyanurates for routine treatment of drinking water has been approved by u s environmental protection agency in 2001 kuechler 2009 wahman 2018 while the presence of cyanuric acid is a feature of the chlorinated isocyanurates cyanuric acid possesses no fetotoxicity teratogenicity mutagenicity or carcinogenicity and does not bioaccumulate kuechler 2009 the guidelines for the addition of cyanuric acid to drinking water provided by the world health organization specifies a maximum concentration of 40 mg l 308 µm who 2008 concentration of cyanuric acid added in the aop to enhance its performance up to 5 46 mg l or 42 3 µm was much lower than the guideline value operation conditions for uv cl cyanurates aop can be further optimized by estimating oh ss for example eq 4 predicted that increasing cyanuric acid concentration rather than increasing cl2 dosage can enhance oh ss more effectively text s6 indeed compared to a uv cl cyanurates aop with 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid the experimentally measured oh ss increased by 58 in the aop with 42 3 µm cl2 56 4 µm cyanuric acid higher than a 25 increase in oh ss observed in the aop with 63 4 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid table s10 byproducts derived from direct photolysis of cl cyanurates or from radical scavenging by cyanuric acid or cl cyanurates may be problematic for the implementation of uv cl cyanurates aop however a theoretical investigation using density function theory suggested thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable reaction of cyanuric acid with oh liu 2014 concurring with the low k oh for dihydrogen cyanurate 1 9 107 m 1s 1 measured in this study when we analyzed the concentration of intact cyanuric acid which encompasses free cyanuric acid and cyanuric acid bonded with chlorine i e cl cyanurates that can be measured after quenching with stoichiometric amount of thiosulfate details provided in text s9 the results demonstrated nearly unchanged concentrations of the intact cyanuric acid even after a 1200 mj cm2 exposure at which 30 of total chlorine depleted fig s18 total chlorine depletions in uv cl cyanurates were generally less than those observed in uv cl2 aop reflecting minimum oxidant decay via oxidant scavenging by radicals fig s18 this result reflects negligible transformation of cyanuric acid by reacting with radicals during a uv cl cyanurates aop treatment and suggests cyanuric acid as the end product from the photolysis of cl cyanurates patton et al 2018 reported nh3 or nh4 as the major product during the photolysis of nh2cl the formation of cyanuric acid as the byproduct from photolysis of cl cyanurates may involve similar mechanisms which however remain unclear and need further research intact cyanuric acid can be reused in the finished water wherein additional chlorine is employed i e forming chlorinated cyanurates again as shown in fig 1 such that cyanuric acid is not likely to serve as the precursors of disinfection byproducts although formation of ammonia and other products resulting from anaerobic biodegradation of cyanuric acid has been reported in pure bacterial isolates jessee et al 1983 the importance of the degradation pathways in drinking water potable reuse systems remains poorly understood furthermore while chlorate is one of the major byproducts in a uv cl2 aop our results demonstrate that chlorate formation in a uv cl cyanurates aop was comparable to that in a uv cl2 aop text s10 we also evaluated the effects of aop treatments on the toxicity change in a synthetic surface water the toxicity of a synthetic surface water which contained 2 mg l c suwannee river nom 200 µg l br and 5 µg l i in 2 mm phosphate buffer at ph 7 0 treated by the uv cl cyanurates aop with 42 3 µm cyanuric acid was evaluated by n acetylcysteine thiol reactivity assay text s11 the results were compared to those measured in waters treated by uv h2o2 aop or uv cl2 aop wherein the same concentration of oxidants i e 3 mg l h2o2 or 3 mg l as cl2 were employed toxicity index for the uv cl cyanurates aop treated water was comparable with that for the uv cl2 aop treated water fig s20 while both of them were slightly 15 lower than that observed in uv h2o2 treated water the initial cost estimate text s12 indicates that uv cl cyanurates aop can be as cost effective as uv h2o2 aop at pilot scale the cost for achieving 0 5 log removal of deet in effluent b using uv cl cyanurates aop was 24 lower than that using uv h2o2 aop while further research is needed to optimize the operation conditions and thus improve its cost efficiency our results suggest that uv cl cyanurates aop suitable for water treatment scenarios relevant to treatment trains for drinking water or non ro based potable reuse in particular in the presence of background ammonia chloramines conclusions in this study we systematically investigated the efficiency of uv cl cyanurates aop on the removals of 1 4 dioxane deet and caffeine at conditions relevant to water treatments cl cyanurates feature molar absorptivities at 254 nm three times higher than free chlorine and exhibit k oh values 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than k oh values for free chlorine while ph chlorine concentration and cyanuric acid concentration affect oxidant speciation in a uv cl cyanurates aop system the equilibrium concentrations of free chlorine and cl cyuanurates significantly affect the perforamnce of a uv cl cyanurates aop with respect to contaminant degradations at netural ph a low cl2 cyanuric acid favors equilibria shiftting toward cl cyanurates rather than free chlorine and thus enhance the degradation efficiencies of contaminants the simplified pseudo steady state model eq 4 predicts k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet well during the treatments of uv cl cyanurates aop uv cl2 aop and uv h2o2 aop cyanuric acid and its dissociation products are the main products from the photolysis of cl cyanurates and radical scavenging by cl cyanurates are limited in a uv cl cyanurates aop results from toxicity assay demonstrate that the toxicity index in the uv cl cyanurates aop treated water is

16330,chlorinated cyanurates prepared by application of hypochlorite to cyanuric acid at different ratios have been commonly employed for disinfection combining uv with chlorinated cyanurates uv cl cyanurates can be a novel and effective advanced oxidation process aop because 1 cl cyanurates structurally resemble chlorinated amides that feature low reactivity with radicals and 2 cl cyanurates which bear multiple cl may exhibit high molar absorptivity at 254 nm due to red shifting absorption those chemiphysical properties of cl cyanurates may facilitate oxidant photolysis rate and lower radical scavenging rates in an aop thereby increasing steady state concentrations of radicals in this study uv spectra measured for cl cyanurates highlighted molar absorptivities at 254 nm 200 m 1cm 1 much higher than free chlorine or h2o2 while k oh determined using competition kinetics suggests low oh reactivity 1 95 107 m 1s 1 for cl cyanurates photolysis of cl cyanurates forms cl i e cl n cleavage and cl converts to oh formation of oh during a uv cl cyanurates aop was evaluated using terephthalate as a probe compound experiments systematically investigated the effects of ph cl2 dosage and cyanuric concentration three key factors affecting the equilibrium concentrations of chlorinated cynaurate species on the efficacy of removing three indicator contaminants by uv cl cyanurates aop uv cl cyanurates aop conducted in phosphate buffers or authentic surface waters highlighted efficiencies up to 170 higher than uv cl2 aop at neutral ph when the same dosage of oxidants was employed and the presence of certain levels of background ammonia or chloramines further enhanced its performance transformation of cyanuric acid or cl cyanurates by reacting with radicals during a uv cl cyanurates aop treatment was minimum toxicity assay indicated that uv cl cyanurates aop treated water was comparable or less toxicity than uv h2o2 or uv cl2 aop treated water and the initial cost

2013 and in a more limited case drinking water treatment kruithof et al 2007 typically aops work by combining low pressure ultraviolet lpuv with hydrogen peroxide h2o2 to generate hydroxyl radicals which in turn react with contaminants lately utilities are exploring alternative oxidants for uv h2o2 aop processes because 1 h2o2 features relatively low molar absorptivity at 254 nm ε254nm 18 6 m 1cm 1 and only a small fraction of the dosed h2o2 is consumed during treatment and 2 additional chlorine is required to quench excess h2o2 and maintain chlorine residual instead the uv chlorine uv cl2 aop and the uv chloramines aop are emerging alternatives to uv h2o2 aops as they are postulated to generate radicals more effectively feng et al 2014 and result in lower aop costs fang et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a aop performance is dependent on the water treatment conditions although lab scale testing showed that the uv cl2 aop removed contaminants more effectively than the uv h2o2 aop at acidic ph which is relevant to reverse osmosis based potable reuse trains chuang et al 2017 fang et al 2014 a few drawbacks limit its broader application for different water treatment scenarios first the performance of uv cl2 aop is lowered as ph increases from acidic to neutral driven by enhanced radical scavenging by oxidants or by the intermediates formed from free chlorine chain decomposition chuang et al 2017 for instance pilot scale tests that compared the removals of methyl isoborneol in drinking waters by the two aops revealed much lower removal rates in uv cl2 than in uv h2o2 at ph 7 5 rosenfeldt et al 2013 this hinders the applications of uv cl2 aop in scenarios relevant to drinking water treatments or non ro based reuse trains e g o3 bac trains where the waters are typically at neutral or slightly alkaline ph summers et al 1996 szczuka et al 2021 vatankhah et al 2019 second when chloramines or ammonia are present in the background matrix free chlorine converts ammonia or chloramines to highly chlorinated chloramines e g dichloramine or trichloramine the presence of chloramines can lower contaminant removal during uv cl2 aop szczuka et al 2020 zhang et al 2019b because of strong radical scavenging by chloramines k oh for nh2cl 1 02 109 m 1s 1 compared to k oh for hocl 5 0 108 m 1s 1 chuang et al 2017 the performance of uv based aops is a function of the steady state

al 2019b guo et al 2018 evaluated the degradation kinetics of an array of contaminants in uv cl2 aop treatment their results demonstrated that increasing cl2 concentrations from 10 to 50 µm did not significantly change the k obs for contaminants whose degradation was attributable to oh i e ibuprofen metronidazole and ronidazole note that the oxidants i e hocl and ocl were the main oh scavengers in the uv cl2 aop systems such that the oh ss remained nearly constant over the range of 10 50 µm cl2 this further holds in aops with mixed oxidants for instance zhang et al 2019b tested the removal of 1 4 dioxane by treating ro reverse osmosis permeates with uv cl2 aop at pilot scale wherein 3 4 mg l as cl2 chloramines were already present this study revealed a marginal increase 5 in 1 4 dioxane removal even when the cl2 concentration was more than doubled from 2 4 to 6 3 mg l as cl2 eq 1 suggests that maximizing radical formation rate and minimizing oxidant scavenging are key to enhancing radical steady state concentrations and hence contaminant removal in uv based aops more efficient aops would rely on alternative oxidants that exhibit high molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm the wavelength predominantly emitted by lpuv high quantum yields of radical generations and low reactivities towards the radicals formed upon an oxidant s direct photolysis herein we propose chlorinated cyanurates as the alternative oxidants for aop treatment referred as the uv cl cyanurates aop below adding free chlorine to cyanuric acid at different ratios is a common approach to generate chlorinated cyanurates and a rapid equilibrium is reached among cyanuric acid and its dissociation products cyanurates free chlorine i e hocl and ocl and various chlorinated cyanurate species fig 1 wahman 2018 chlorinated cyanurates in particular sodium dichloroisocyanurate equivalent of a mixture of cl2 cyanuric acid at 2 1 ratio are commonly employed for swimming pool or drinking water disinfection clasen and edmondson 2006 clasen et al 2007 wahman 2018 two factors prompted us to investigate the uv cl cyanurates aop first chlorinated cyanurates resemble chlorinated amides structurally fig 1 which feature k oh values 106 m 1s 1 several orders of magnitude lower than those for hocl or ocl 109 m 1s 1 bulman et al 2019 and would thereby lower oxidant scavenging in a uv based aop second chlorinated cyanurates which feature multiple chlorine functional groups likely exhibit higher molar absorption coefficients at 254 nm than free chlorine does because of red shifting absorption chuang et al 2016 westerhoff et al 2004 resulting in a higher radical formation rate in this study we combined a chemical equilibrium model and the uv absorption spectra taken from mixtures of free chlorine and cyanuric acid to determine the molar absorption coefficients for three major chlorinated cyanurates the quantum yield for direct photolysis of the most abundant chlorinated cyanurate hydrochlorocyanurate hclcy was experimentally determined lab scale experiments were performed to systematically evaluate the performance of uv cl cyanurates aop with respect to the degradation of three low molecular weight indicator contaminants that featured different reactivity toward radicals predicted to exist in a uv cl cyanurates aop the impacts of ammonia and chloramines on the performance of uv cl cyanurates aop and toxicity determined by n acetylcysteine thiol reactivity assay in aop treated waters were also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals

the water spiked with three indicator compounds at concentrations between 0 1 and 0 3 µm each were dosed with cyanuric acid and sodium hypochlorite at target concentrations aliquots 3 ml each were periodically taken for analysis and the total volume altered was less than 15 unless otherwise stated the concentrations of oxidants were controlled such that the total absorbance εl c was 0 02 during the experiments 2 3 analytical methods details for analyzing 1 4 dioxane deet and caffeine were provided in text s2 chlorine concentrations were analyzed by the dpd colorimetric method apha 1998 note that this method cannot isolate chlorinated cyanurates from free chlorine hocl and ocl such that chlorine concentrations measured in this study encompass all chlorine species text s2 uv vis spectra

radical formation rate and radical scavenging rate radical formation rate in a photocatalytic aop is directly associated with the molar absorption coefficient of the oxidant and the quantum yield for oxidant photolysis fig 2 provides the uv absorption spectra for 42 3 µm cl2 3 mg l as cl2 with and without cyanuric acid while 42 3 µm cyanuric acid absorbed negligible light at wavelengths 240 nm at ph 5 5 8 0 the mixtures of 42 3 µm cl2 21 1 µm 2 73 mg l or 42 3 µm 5 46 mg l cyanuric acid featured 35 62 higher absorbance at 254 nm than the 42 3 µm cl2 alone fig 2a c reflecting higher ε254nm for chlorinated cyanurates a total of eight chlorine species including six chlorinated cyanurates and two free chlorines i e hocl and ocl are in equilibrium in a system containing hypochlorite and cyanuric acid fig 1 the equilibrium concentrations of different species are dependent on ph cl2 dosage and cyanuric acid concentration using a chemical equilibrium model wahman 2018 we identified that dihydrogenchloroisocyanuric acid h2clcy hydrogenchloroisocyanurate hclcy and dichloroisocyanurate cl2cy are the predominant chlorinated cyanurates at conditions relevant to water treatment e g 14 1 42

accounting for 77 of total chlorine while free chlorine hocl and ocl in combined constitutes 22 of total chlorine the percentage of free chlorine decreases as the molar ratio of cl2 cyanuric acid decreases fig s3 note that we defined total chlorine as the sum of the molar concentrations of free chlorine and each chlorinated cyanurate eq 2 although more than one cl were bound in a molecule of trichlorinated or dichlorinated cyanurate as discussed below this facilitates the comparison of the efficacy of uv cl cyanurates aops under different conditions because a multi chlorinated cyanurate

for h2clcy hclcy and cl2cy we measured light absorbance for the mixtures of cl2 and cyanuric acid at different molar ratios first uv spectra 240 270 nm of hocl and ocl were taken with diluted sodium hypochlorite solution in 2 mm phosphate adjusted to ph 5 or 10 to obtain ε λ for hocl or ocl then spectrum measurements were repeated for four additional mixtures the mixtures of 141 µm free chlorine 10 mg l as cl2 and 70 5 µm cyanuric acid 9 1 mg l at ph 6 8 or 5 5 and the mixtures of 282 µm free chlorine 20 mg l as cl2 and 141 µm cyanuric acid 18 2 mg l at ph 6 8 or 5 5 mixture 1 4 table s4 for these mixtures the chemical equilibrium model revealed hclcy as the predominant 99 species of monochlorinated cyanurates and cl2cy as the predominant 96 species of dichlorinated cyanurates at ph 6 8 table s4 at ph 5 5 while cl2cy accounts for 98 of the dichlorinated cyanurates h2clcy and hclcy constitute 60 and 40 respectively of the monochlorinated cyanurates the measured absorbance aλ were combined within the framework of eq 3 to obtain ε λ for h2clcy hclcy and cl2cy the εhocl λ εocl λ and εcl cyi λ in eq 3 denote the molar absorption coefficients for hocl ocl and different species of

cyanuric acid fig 2a c molar absorption coefficients for the chlorinated cyanurates dropped as wavelength increases leaving ελ 80 m 1cm 1 at 274 nm and concurring with the fact that chlorinated cyanurates are not susceptible to solar photolysis wahman 2018 determining innate quantum yields for direct photolysis of chlorinated cyanurates is more challenging because of complex equilibria among chlorinated cyanurate species nevertheless we examined the k obs for total chlorine loss to estimate the quantum yield for hclcy by treating the mixture of 28 2 µm cl2 141 µm cyanuric acid at ph 7 2 with lpuv irradiation with and without 5 mm acetate hclcy accounts for approximately 90 of the total chlorine under these conditions mixture 5 table s4 and the 5 mm acetate quenches radicals chuang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a which helped to isolate the innate quantum yield for direct photolysis from subsequent chain reactions experimental results indicated that the k obs for total chlorine loss in the presence of 5 mm acetate 4 8 0 1 10 3 min 1 was 34 lower than of that observed in the absence of acetate 7 2 0 4 10 3 min 1 corresponding to a observed quantum yield of 0 3 0 004 accordingly the innate quantum yield for hclcy photolysis was estimated to be 0 2 based on k obs for total chlorine loss with acetate although quantum yield for hclcy photolysis was only 32 of that for hocl photolysis chuang et al 2017 the calculated direct photolysis rate for hclcy is 10 faster than for hocl driven by much higher molar absorption coefficient for hclcy however because one molecule of hocl or ocl produces two reactive radicals cl and oh or o the formation rate of total reactive radicals in uv cl2 aop may still be faster than that in uv cl cyanurates aop assuming photolysis of chlorinated cyanurate only generates one reactive radical cl in a fashion similar to n haloamide photolysis i e by the cleavage of n cl lessard et al 1981 because cl rapidly converts to oh by reacting with water r1 r2 jayson et al 1973 mcelroy 1990 oh may outweigh cl with respect to the steady state concentrations in a uv cl cyanurates aop this is confirmed by our experiments using terephthalate as a probe compound to measure the formation of oh in uv cl cyanurates see section 3 3 r1 cl h 2 o clo h h k 2 5 1 0 5 s 1 r2 clo h oh c l k 6 10 9 s 1 using competition kinetics text s4 we experimentally determined the oh rate constant for dihydrogen cyanurate h2cy to be 1 95 107 m 1s 1 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than that for free chlorine 5 108 6 5 109 m 1s 1 bulman et al 2019 chuang et al 2017 or 30 lower than that for h2o2 2 7 107 m 1s 1 crittenden et al 1999 although oh rate constants for the three major species of chlorinated cyanurates h2clcy hclcy and cl2cy were not measured we suspect that their k oh values are lower than k oh for h2cy that is because the electron withdrawing nature of cl functional group tends to reduce k oh chuang et al 2016 minakata et al 2009 and because protonated neutral species are less reactive toward oh than the deprotonated negatively charged counterparts the nist database overall these results highlighted the low radical scavenging by oxidants in a uv cl cyanurates aop 3 2 efficacy of uv cl cyanurates aop on degrading model compounds derived from eq 1 eq 4 provides an estimate of the steady state concentration of a given reactive radical r oh or cl during the uv cl cyanurates aop treatments of water featuring low total absorbance 0 02 r ss is associated with the concentrations of organic inorganic constituents and the concentrations of various chlorine species given that the concentrations of each chlorine species are functions of ph cl2 dosage and cyanuric acid concentration a total of 30 experiments were conducted to systematically evaluate these factors on the performance of the uv cl cyanurates aop with respect to contaminant degradations the purpose was not to accurately model the radical concentrations which would require a kinetics model accounting for chemical reactions in their real time dynamics as a function of ph oxidant speciation and concentration the goal was to provide an estimate for the steady state concentrations of reactive radicals during an aop treatment based on the initial equilibrium concentrations of various chlorine species and other constituents under the framework of eq 4 and to correlate the estimates with the observed degradation efficiency of contaminants 4 r ss 2 303 i 0 ε hocl φ hocl hocl ε oc l φ oc l oc l ε cl cy φ cl cy cl cy k hocl hocl k oc

drinking water treatments indicator compounds tested in this study included 1 4 dioxane n n diethyl meta toluamide deet and caffeine improper disposal of industrial waste has resulted in contamination of 1 4 dioxane an industrial solvent in surface water zenker et al 2003 1 4 dioxane and deet are poorly removed by conventional drinking water wastewater treatment trains frequently detected in drinking water effluents or potable reuse trains alturki et al 2010 fujioka et al 2018 roback et al 2018 stepien et al 2014 these compounds feature different reactivities with radicals potentially existing in uv cl cyanurates aop or uv chlorine aop systems i e oh cl clo cl2 as summarized in table s5 k oh for the indicator compounds are comparable 3 1 109 to 6 1 109 m 1s 1 while k cl spans 4 orders of magnitude ranging from 4 4 106 m 1s 1 for 1 4 dioxane to 3 9 1010 m 1s 1 for caffeine caffeine exhibits high reaction rate constants for cl2 2 2 9 3 108 m 1s 1 compared to a k cl2 of 3 3 106 m 1s 1 for 1 4 dioxane patton et al 2017 moreover caffeine is known to be reactive with clo related radicals guo et al 2017 sun et al 2016 such that caffeine can serve as a surrogate for evaluating the degradation behaviors of clo reactive compounds e g carbamazepine gemfibrozil etc guo et al 2017 in a uv cl cyanurated aop in all experiments trace amount of phenolic compounds 0 3 µm phenol and 0 3 µm bisphenol a were amended as the other constituents in the systems eq 4 the σk i s i mimicking the organic matters in waters of different treatment scenarios these compounds were selected because their reactivity with oh or cl i e k oh and k cl are well defined facilitating the comparisons between the estimates of radical steady state concentration eq 4 and the observed contaminant removal rates note that the three indicator compounds were at sub µm levels such that they were a minor source of radical scavenging previous research has shown that the concentrations of target contaminants may impact the steady state concentrations of radicals and thus the observed contaminant removal rates if those compounds are the main radical scavengers zhang et al 2019a initial experiments evaluated the degradation of the indicator contaminants added at a concentration of 0 3 µm each in uv cl cyanurates aops with the cl2 cyanuric acid molar ratio fixed at 2 1 the composition ratio of sodium dichloroisocyanurate the chemical equilibrium model indicated that the initial equilibrium concentrations of free chlorine i e hocl ocl and total cl cyanurates are each linearly correlated with the cl2 dosage employed fig s5 plotting ln c c0 for contaminants vs t demonstrated first order decay for 1 4 dioxane and deet fig s6 but not for caffeine decay discussed in later sections increasing the ph substantially reduced the experimentally measured fluence based pseudo first order rate constants k obs for the degradation of 1 4 dioxane and deet k obs dropped by 5 fold as ph increased from 5 5 to 6 8 and further decreased by factors of 4 as ph increased from 6 8 to 7 8 fig s7 leaving 0 1 log removals for 1 4 dioxane at ph 7 8 after 700 mj cm2 exposure relevant to aop systems increasing the cl2 dosage only resulted in limited enhancement of k obs for the degradations of 1 4 dioxane and deet fig s7 compared with the uv cl2 aop k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet in uv cl cyanurates aops with the cl2 cyanuric acid molar ratio fixed at 2 1 were comparable or slightly higher 0 30 than uv cl2 aop when the same cl2 dosage was employed fig s7 these results suggest marginal benefits for contaminant s removals by using sodium dichloroisocyanurate in lieu of sodium hypochlorite during the uv aop treatments of drinking water potable reuse water limited increases in k obs for the losses of contaminants when a cl2 dose higher than 28 2 µm was employed reflected the enhancement of radical formation rate by increasing cl2 dosage was offset by an increase of radical scavenging by oxidants these results also suggest that radical scavenging by oxidants was the predominant radical scavenging reactions indeed percentage of oh scavenging by different constituents which can be estimated by comparing the product k oh constituent indicated that hocl and ocl together dominated oh scavenging reactions 73 96 under these experimental conditions text s5 additional experiments evaluated the performance of uv cl cyanurates aop with a fixed cl2 of 42 3 µm but with varied cyanuric acid 21 2 42 3 µm leaving the molar ratio of cl2 cyanuric acid 2 1 raising cyanuric acid increases the equilibrium concentration of total cl cyanurates at the expense of free chlorine fig s8 for instance with 42 3 µm cl2 at ph 5 5 increasing cyanuric acid from 21 2 to 42 3 µm increases equilibrium concentration of total cl cyanurates from 11 4 to 18 µm but decreases the free chlorine concentration from 27 to 19 4 µm our experimental results showed that k obs for the loss of 1 4 dioxane or deet remained relatively stable as increasing the cyanuric acid from 21 2 to 42 3 µm during the uv cl cyanurates aop treatments at ph 5 5 while k obs enhanced by 62 and 108 for 1 4 dioxane and deet respectively when repeating the experiments at ph 6 8 fig s9 the discrepancy observed at ph 5 5 and ph 6 8 can be partly attributable to different extents of radical scavenging by free chlorine the equilibrium concentration of free chlorine in the mixture of 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid is 9 µm at ph 6 8 accounting for only 25 of total chlorine calculation for the percentage of oh scavenging by different constituents suggests that radical scavenging by free chlorine was lower at ph 6 8 than at ph 5 5 when the same dosage of cl2 42 3 µm and cyanuric acid 21 2 to 42 3 µm were employed in the systems table s7 to further explore the effect of equilibrium concentration of free chlorine on the performance of the uv cl cyanurates aop experiments were conducted with a fixed cyanuric acid at 42 3 µm but varying cl2 from 42 4 to 14 1 µm such conditions featured the cl2 cyanuric acid ratios 1 1 shifting the equilibrium toward cl cyanurates and resulting in much higher equilibrium concentration for cl cyanurates than free chlorine particularly at neutral ph table s6 with 42 3 µm cyanuric acid at ph 5 5 or 6 8 k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet increased by increasing cl2 from 14 1 to 42 3 µm fig 3 moreover uv cl cyanurates aops with 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid were remarkably more efficient compared to uv cl2 aops with 42 3 µm cl2 in terms of removing contaminants k obs values for 1 4 dioxane and deet losses were 100 to 170 higher in uv cl cyanurates than in uv cl2 at ph 6 8 fig 3 a rough estimate for the steady state concentration of oh in a uv cl cyanurates aop can be obtained by incorporating the molar absorption coefficients quantum yields and k oh values for cl cyanurates and free chlorine obtained in this study or adapted from previous works into the framework of eq 4 detailed in text s6 assuming cl formed from the photolysis of cl cyanurates rapidly transforms to oh by reacting with h2o i e reactions r1 r2 the calculation encompasses the radical formation from free chlorine and hcycl due to the unavailability of quantum yields for other cl cyanurates such that the calculated value remained a conservative estimate nevertheless the oh ss estimates correlate well with the experimental k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet fig 4 the degradation of caffeine accelerates with increased fluence deviating from pseudo first order kinetics in all aop treatments the acceleration of caffeine degradation was more pronounced in uv cl2 or uv cl cyanurates aop systems with elevated concentration of free chlorine fig s11 comparisons of the removal efficiency of caffeine at 170 mj cm2 exposure in uv cl2 aop show enhanced removal efficiencies with increased cl2 dosage in agreement with a previous study sun et al 2016 the uv cl cyanurates aop was less efficient at degrading caffeine than uv cl2 aop when the same cl2 dosage was employed fig 3 reflecting greater contribution of clo related radicals on degrading the imidazole moiety on caffeine in uv cl2 aop than in uv cl cyanurates aop sun et al 2016 while oh or cl induced hocl chain decomposition reactions is critical for the formation of clo related radicals high cl2 dosage facilitates their formation sun et al 2016 and thus results in greater removals of caffeine such hocl chain decomposition reactions would be less extensive in uv cl cyanurates aop than in uv cl2 aop 3 3 steady state concentrations of radicals and oh formation the steady state concentrations of oh cl and cl2 in selected aop conditions were experimentally measured using benzoate and nitrobenzene as probe compounds 0 5 µm each in the absence of indicator contaminants bulman et al 2019 experimentally measured oh ss were 10 to 20 fold higher than the measured cl ss in uv cl cyanurates aop with 42 3 µm cl2 21 1 µm or 42 3 µm cyanuric acid table s8 while the background chloride concentrations were 0 16 0 01 mm cl2 ss were ca 2 3 folds higher than oh ss under all experimental conditions the uv cl cyanurates aop highlighted higher steady state concentrations of oh and cl than uv cl2 aops when the same cl2 dosage was applied particularly at neutral ph at ph 6 8 the measured oh ss and cl ss were 1 5 0 01 10 13 m and 2 4 0 03 10 14 m respectively in a uv cl cyanurates aop with 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid nearly doubled to the oh ss of 8 4 0 01 10 14 m and the cl ss of 1 0 0 02 10 14 m measured in a uv cl2 aop with 42 3 µm cl2 alone the contribution of a radical r on degrading contaminants evaluated based on the values of k r r ss indicated major contributions of oh and to a much lower extent cl2 5 on degrading 1 4 dioxane and deet fig s12 concurring with the linear correlations observed between oh ss estimates and k obs for compounds losses fig 4 to confirm cl induced oh formation during a uv cl cyanurates aop i e reactions r1 r2 we evaluated 2 hydroxyterephthalate formation using terephthalate as a probe compound previous research has demonstrated that terephthalate is a specific and sensitive probe for oh fang et al 1996 page et al 2010 with a yield of 0 21 for the formation of 2 hydroxyterephthalate at ph 6 8 charbouillot et al 2011 briefly a 2 mm phosphate buffer containing 4 7 µm terephthalate was treated by uv cl cyanurates aop with 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid experimental results indicated that 2 hydroxyterephthalate increased from 0 µm to 0 18 0 01 µm after 10 min while the 4 7 0 1 µm terephthalate dropped to 2 7 0 1 µm fig s13 the decay of terephthalate and the formation of 2 hydroxyterephthalate in a uv cl cyanurates aop system can be kinetically expressed by eqs 5 6 wherein y denotes the yield of 2 hydroxyterephthalate hta from the reaction between

ammonia and chloramines ammonia and or chloramines are prevalent in drinking water or potable reuse systems previous studies revealed a median nh4 of 0 1 mg l n in influents of drinking water treatment plants dwtp in north america or in china and similar levels in finished drinking waters bei et al 2016 leavey roback et al 2016 furthermore chloramines were frequently employed prior to the microfiltration unit for biofouling control leaving chloramine residuals of 1 5 4 mg l as cl2 in the ro permeates within potable reuse treatment trains kwon et al 2020 the background ammonia or chloramines in waters may impact the performance of a uv cl cyanurates aop because of breakpoint reactions altering oxidant speciation during the aop treatments reaction of free chlorine with ammonia features a high reaction rate constant r3 while rate constant for the reaction between free chlorine and nh2cl or nhcl2 is orders of magnitude lower r4 r5 when cyanuric acid is added prior to the chlorination of a water containing ammonia or chloramines cyanuric acid competes with the background ammonia chloramines for free chlorine i e r3 r6 but the rate constant for the reaction between free chlorine and cyanuric acid kr6 remains unclear experiments evaluated kr6 relative to the reactivity of free chlorine for ammonia kr3 by application of 42 3 µm cl2 to 0 2 mg l n 14 3 µm nh4 in 2 mm phosphate buffered deionized water at ph 6 8 with and without 42 3 µm cyanuric acid for experiments with cyanuric acid free chlorine cl cyanurates rapidly decreased from 42 3 µm to 20 µm in the first 90 s with concomitant formation of 11 7 µm chloramines which accounted for 80 n of the 0 2 mg l n ammonia fig 5 a this concurred with the observation in experiments without cyanuric acid fig 5b suggesting a much faster rate constant for the reaction of free chlorine with ammonia than the reaction of free chlorine with cyanuric acid i e kr6 4 2 106 m 1s 1 such results also suggest that ammonia if any would be rapidly converted to chloramines i e within a timescale of seconds by reacting with hocl ocl during the uv cl cyanurates treatments in different treatment scenarios r3 hocl n h

output lpuv apparatus used in this study necessitated a 30 min illumination time to achieve a practically relevant uv fluence 700 1300 mj cm2 over which oxidant speciation can change significantly therefore efforts were made to investigate the dynamic concentrations of oxidants during application of free chlorine to nh2cl over the 30 min timescale with and without cyanuric acid when treating 1 5 mg l as cl2 nh2cl equivalent of 0 3 mg l n by 42 3 µm cl2 in the absence of cyanuric acid at ph 6 8 free chlorine dropped by 56 to 18 5 µm within the first 7 min followed by a slow decay thenceforth fig 5c in contrast experiments performed in the presence of 42 3 µm cyanuric acid highlighted a much rapid decrease in free chlorine cl cyanurates from 42 3 to 20 µm within the first 3 min followed by a plateau chloramine decay was slightly slower with cyanuric acid than without cyanuric acid at ph 6 8 plausibly driven by lower conversion rates i e r4 r5 resulting from lower free chlorine concentrations although these experiments were conducted without uv illumination oxidant decay free chlorine nh2cl nhcl2 cl cyanurates attributable to photolysis would be minimal 5 20 after a 170 mj cm2 exposure i e 7 min reaction time chuang et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a nitrobenzene and benzoate were first used as the probe compounds to examine the effect of breakpoint reactions on the performance of aops over the 30 min timescale experiments involved treating a mixture of nitrobenzene and benzoate at 0 5 µm each and 1 5 mg l as cl2 nh2cl in 2 mm phosphate buffer at ph 6 8 by 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid followed by immediate uv irradiation results showed a clear biphasic trend a fast degradation kinetics for the first 7 min followed by a slow decay for the losses of nitrobenzene and benzoate during the uv cl cyanurates aop treatments fig s14 possible mechanisms for slower degradation kinetics in the timeframe of 10 30 min include 1 loss of oxidant concentrations due to breakpoint reactions and 2 the evolution of byproducts from breakpoint reactions competing with probe compounds for radicals jafvert and valentine 1992 pham et al 2021 given that illumination time required for achieving 700 1300 mj cm2 exposure in a pilot full scale aop unit is usually less than a minute chuang et al 2019 kwon et al 2020 mangalgiri et al 2019 over which changes in oxidant speciation and byproduct formation from breakpoint reactions are limited the degradation kinetics of contaminants in a pilot full scale unit can be conservatively represented by the fast degradation kinetics obtained in our lab scale testing further experiments evaluated the impact of 0 0 2 mg l n nh4 or 0 1 5 mg l as cl2 chloramines equivalent of 0 0 3 mg l n on the degradation kinetics of indicator contaminants in uv cl cyanurates aop like benzoate or nitrobenzene the degradations for 1 4 dioxane and deet also featured biphasic degradation kinetics fig 6 a b comparison of k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet obtained from the first 7 min of the uv cl cyanurates aop treatments demonstrated a downtrend as increasing nh4 from 0 to 0 2 mg l n at ph 5 5 fig 6c in contrast k obs for the degradations of 1 4 dioxane at ph 6 8 nearly doubled as increasing nh4 from 0 to 0 2 mg l n at ph 6 8 exceeding those observed at ph 5 5 in the presence of the same nh4 fig 6d results from experiments repeated in the presence of 0 1 5 mg l as cl2 equivalent of 0 0 3 mg l n chloramines also show similar trends fig s15 suggesting the presence of a certain level of background ammonia chloramines may enhance the efficacy of a uv cl cyanurates aop at neutral ph 3 5 effects of background matrix in authentic surface waters the removal efficacy for indicator compound in uv cl cyanurates aop was tested in rapid sand filter rsf effluents collected from two domestic water treatment facilities in taiwan and was compared to those in uv cl2 aop and uv h2o2 aop rsf effluents were tested given that an aop is usually employed for the abatements of micropollutants at the end of the treatment trains kruithof et al 2007 both effluents featured low concentrations of dissolved organic carbons 0 4 mg l c and ammonia 0 08 mg l n table s9 while concentration of inorganic carbon in effluent b 19 mg l c was 4 fold higher than that in effluent a 4 5 mg l c the background matrices in these waters were less complex compared to that in the secondary effluents of wastewater treatment plants facilitating the comparison between oh estimates eq 4 and the degradation efficiency of indicator compounds the rsf effluents were amended with three indicator compounds at 0 2 µm or 0 1 µm each and were treated by uv aops with the same concentration of oxidants on a molar basis or on a weight basis similar to the experiments conducted in phosphate buffer the addition of 42 3 µm cyanuric acid to uv cl2 aop i e uv cl cyanurates aop increased k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet by 27 50 and 65 144 respectively fig s16 however the increases were less than those observed in phosphate buffer partly attributable to enhanced oh scavenging by inorganic carbons e g hco3 k oh 8 5 106 m 1s 1 buxton et al 1988 during the aop treatments of effluents notably oh ss estimated from eq 4 correlated well with k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet across three different aops and two different rsf effluents fig s17 and text s8 highlighting the potent application of eq 4 in the optimization of operation conditions for aops see section 3 6 although efficacies of uv cl cyanurates aop on degrading 1 4 dioxane and deet were only 33 60 of those found in uv h2o2 aop uv cl cyanurates aop highlighted high degradation rates for caffeine 3 6 byproduct formation and environmental relevance the use of chlorinated isocyanurates for routine treatment of drinking water has been approved by u s environmental protection agency in 2001 kuechler 2009 wahman 2018 while the presence of cyanuric acid is a feature of the chlorinated isocyanurates cyanuric acid possesses no fetotoxicity teratogenicity mutagenicity or carcinogenicity and does not bioaccumulate kuechler 2009 the guidelines for the addition of cyanuric acid to drinking water provided by the world health organization specifies a maximum concentration of 40 mg l 308 µm who 2008 concentration of cyanuric acid added in the aop to enhance its performance up to 5 46 mg l or 42 3 µm was much lower than the guideline value operation conditions for uv cl cyanurates aop can be further optimized by estimating oh ss for example eq 4 predicted that increasing cyanuric acid concentration rather than increasing cl2 dosage can enhance oh ss more effectively text s6 indeed compared to a uv cl cyanurates aop with 42 3 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid the experimentally measured oh ss increased by 58 in the aop with 42 3 µm cl2 56 4 µm cyanuric acid higher than a 25 increase in oh ss observed in the aop with 63 4 µm cl2 42 3 µm cyanuric acid table s10 byproducts derived from direct photolysis of cl cyanurates or from radical scavenging by cyanuric acid or cl cyanurates may be problematic for the implementation of uv cl cyanurates aop however a theoretical investigation using density function theory suggested thermodynamically and kinetically unfavorable reaction of cyanuric acid with oh liu 2014 concurring with the low k oh for dihydrogen cyanurate 1 9 107 m 1s 1 measured in this study when we analyzed the concentration of intact cyanuric acid which encompasses free cyanuric acid and cyanuric acid bonded with chlorine i e cl cyanurates that can be measured after quenching with stoichiometric amount of thiosulfate details provided in text s9 the results demonstrated nearly unchanged concentrations of the intact cyanuric acid even after a 1200 mj cm2 exposure at which 30 of total chlorine depleted fig s18 total chlorine depletions in uv cl cyanurates were generally less than those observed in uv cl2 aop reflecting minimum oxidant decay via oxidant scavenging by radicals fig s18 this result reflects negligible transformation of cyanuric acid by reacting with radicals during a uv cl cyanurates aop treatment and suggests cyanuric acid as the end product from the photolysis of cl cyanurates patton et al 2018 reported nh3 or nh4 as the major product during the photolysis of nh2cl the formation of cyanuric acid as the byproduct from photolysis of cl cyanurates may involve similar mechanisms which however remain unclear and need further research intact cyanuric acid can be reused in the finished water wherein additional chlorine is employed i e forming chlorinated cyanurates again as shown in fig 1 such that cyanuric acid is not likely to serve as the precursors of disinfection byproducts although formation of ammonia and other products resulting from anaerobic biodegradation of cyanuric acid has been reported in pure bacterial isolates jessee et al 1983 the importance of the degradation pathways in drinking water potable reuse systems remains poorly understood furthermore while chlorate is one of the major byproducts in a uv cl2 aop our results demonstrate that chlorate formation in a uv cl cyanurates aop was comparable to that in a uv cl2 aop text s10 we also evaluated the effects of aop treatments on the toxicity change in a synthetic surface water the toxicity of a synthetic surface water which contained 2 mg l c suwannee river nom 200 µg l br and 5 µg l i in 2 mm phosphate buffer at ph 7 0 treated by the uv cl cyanurates aop with 42 3 µm cyanuric acid was evaluated by n acetylcysteine thiol reactivity assay text s11 the results were compared to those measured in waters treated by uv h2o2 aop or uv cl2 aop wherein the same concentration of oxidants i e 3 mg l h2o2 or 3 mg l as cl2 were employed toxicity index for the uv cl cyanurates aop treated water was comparable with that for the uv cl2 aop treated water fig s20 while both of them were slightly 15 lower than that observed in uv h2o2 treated water the initial cost estimate text s12 indicates that uv cl cyanurates aop can be as cost effective as uv h2o2 aop at pilot scale the cost for achieving 0 5 log removal of deet in effluent b using uv cl cyanurates aop was 24 lower than that using uv h2o2 aop while further research is needed to optimize the operation conditions and thus improve its cost efficiency our results suggest that uv cl cyanurates aop suitable for water treatment scenarios relevant to treatment trains for drinking water or non ro based potable reuse in particular in the presence of background ammonia chloramines conclusions in this study we systematically investigated the efficiency of uv cl cyanurates aop on the removals of 1 4 dioxane deet and caffeine at conditions relevant to water treatments cl cyanurates feature molar absorptivities at 254 nm three times higher than free chlorine and exhibit k oh values 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than k oh values for free chlorine while ph chlorine concentration and cyanuric acid concentration affect oxidant speciation in a uv cl cyanurates aop system the equilibrium concentrations of free chlorine and cl cyuanurates significantly affect the perforamnce of a uv cl cyanurates aop with respect to contaminant degradations at netural ph a low cl2 cyanuric acid favors equilibria shiftting toward cl cyanurates rather than free chlorine and thus enhance the degradation efficiencies of contaminants the simplified pseudo steady state model eq 4 predicts k obs for the losses of 1 4 dioxane and deet well during the treatments of uv cl cyanurates aop uv cl2 aop and uv h2o2 aop cyanuric acid and its dissociation products are the main products from the photolysis of cl cyanurates and radical scavenging by cl cyanurates are limited in a uv cl cyanurates aop results from toxicity assay demonstrate that the toxicity index in the uv cl cyanurates aop treated water is comparable or less than those in the uv cl2 or uv h2o2 aop treated waters declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

contaminated beach water are of great concern nevers et al 2014 therefore it is critical to monitor beach water quality and make advisory and closing notifications fecal indicator bacteria fib have been used as indicators of pathogen contamination among which e coli and enterococci are the most commonly used epa 2012 culture based methods for fib testing not only present an economic burden but more importantly cause a time lag of 18 24 hours before any warning is given predictive modeling especially data driven machine learning approaches has become an important complement to fib testing in the assessment of beach water quality de brauwere et al 2014 francy et al 2020 panidhapu et al 2020 searcy and boehm 2021 zhang et al 2018 2012 the machine learning models use a set of environmental conditions e g water temperature turbidity etc as explanatory variables to predict fib concentrations palazón et al 2017 during the past decade researchers have compared different machine learning models aiming at finding the best model for the beach sites in their studies brooks et al 2013 nevers and whitman 2011 zhang et al 2012 tree based models especially classification tree ct and random forest rf have shown great promise in outperforming other widely used regression models such as multiple linear regression mlr and partial least square pls brooks et al 2016 searcy and boehm 2021 thoe et al 2014 2015 wang et al 2021a zimmer faust et al 2018 other more recent and advanced tree based models such as extreme gradient boosting xgboost categorical boosting catboost and light gradient boosting machine lightgbm were rarely applied to predict beach water quality machine learning models are trained on data collected by humans meaning that these models reflect human biases and prejudices when a black box model fails we are neither able to know why it fails nor to trace the source of failure from the bias in training data besides predictability another challenge for the utility of a machine learning model is its transparency i e the ability of humans to understand how environmental features influence the prediction of fib concentrations both predictability and transparency are key constituting elements of model interpretability devane et al 2020 panidhapu et al 2020 poulin et al 2020 wang et al 2021b weller et al 2021 it has been well noted that tree based machine learning models despite their promising predictability are severely limited by their transparency lundberg et al 2020 for example gaining a full understanding of the decision process of a forest of deep trees with each tree trained on randomly selected environmental features is very difficult in this regard simpler models such as mlr and ct were employed often due to their high transparency madani and seth 2020 zimmer faust et al 2018 the use of black box models for decision making can be problematic the potential bias inherited from the training data may lead to unfair or wrong decisions and even worse the lack of transparency prevents us from understanding the source of bias although there are a number of global interpretation methods e g gini impurity index that summarize the averaged importance of the input features the local interpretation approaches that explain the impact of each feature on a per sample basis only begin to emerge recently lundberg et al 2020 two such approaches are lime local interpretable model agnostic explanation ribeiro et al 2016 and shap shapley additive explanations lundberg and lee 2017 where the latter decomposes the global prediction into additive contributions of local features such that the global and local interpretations are consistent we aim to overcome the under appreciated issue of model interpretability for predicting fib concentrations by developing machine learning models that are both predictive and transparent towards this goal we employed and compared five tree based machine learning models namely ct breiman et al 1984 rf breiman 2001 xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 catboost prokhorenkova et al 2017 and lightgbm ke et al 2017 we also expanded our comparison by including six regression models tested in wang et al 2021a including the ensemble stacking model we have previously developed using shap we then performed global and local feature importance analyses with the best models to predict the most important environmental factors for beach closure to evaluate the robustness of those important factors and to dissect their interactions with other environmental variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and data sand beach is the most common type of the laurentian great lakes shoreline and provide valuable recreational sites nevers et al 2014 song et al 2010 the study sites include three sand beaches i e woodlawn hamburg and bennett along lake erie shores in western new york state in the united states fig 1 they are the most popular beaches in this region especially the 1 5 km long woodlawn beach that has over 100 000 visitors every year however they all face frequent closing issues due to high fib levels the new york state requires water quality monitoring for all bathing beaches by surveys or water quality models e coli concentration values in a unit of cfu 100 ml for the three sites were obtained from the erie county department of health they were collected on almost a daily basis during the swimming season from late may to early september specifically the data set of the woodlawn beach contains 689 observations between 2011 and 2018 while hamburg and bennett beaches contain 438 and 367 observations between 2013 and 2017 respectively for model development we binarized the e coli concentration values using the threshold of 235 cfu 100 ml the beach action value bav recommended by the us epa and adopted by the new york state department of health to indicate whether beach closures are needed therefore positive and negative output variables represent unsafe and safe days when e coli concentrations are larger and smaller than bav respectively shown in fig 1 environmental variables that are used in the predictive models are categorized into four groups lake related weather related stream related and others see supporting information table s1 for the summary of the variables considered in this study and other recent studies generally 29 environmental variables collected by the u s geological survey are available for all of the three sites at a daily basis in this study they include lake turbidity wind speed and direction nearby airport rainfall bar pressure lake water level wave height and direction cloud cover water temperature and so on the complete list and detailed explanations of the variables are in supporting information table s2 other than the 29 shared variables woodlawn has 14 unique variables including four predictors related to the water quality of a nearby stream outlet in contact with the beach i e stream turbidity temperature and stream gage heights on the current and previous days and another 10 variables that are only monitored at woodlawn by the erie county department of health e g local rainfall wave height etc since environmental variables are available on a daily basis while the e coli concentration values are not we tailored the entire dataset by choosing the days when both types of data were measured therefore gap filling data imputation was not needed 2 2 classification models five tree based classification models ct rf xgboost catboost and lightgbm were employed ct is the most basic tree based model and the simplest to interpret breiman et al 1984 tree structured classifiers are constructed by splitting the parent data set into child subsets according to the gini index rf is an ensemble of a family of individual tree based classifiers breiman 2001 each individual classifier in a rf model is built as a ct with bootstrapped data and feature space rf takes advantage of the strength of individual classifiers as the generalization error converges as the number of trees in the forest increases rf can reduce variance of a predictor significantly however a rf bias remains the same as individual ones since each tree is constructed in an identically distributed way each tree in the forest works and predicts independently despite its limitation on combating bias rf has shown good performances in many applications xgboost is an extreme gradient boosting method that introduces a new strategy of adding a regularized objective chen and guestrin 2016 it is also an ensemble algorithm that utilizes weak learners ability to achieve strong performance shrinkage and column subsampling strategies are used to reduce model bias and variance in xgboost shrinkage reduces the influence of individual trees which leads to the decrease of bias and column subsampling introduces randomization into the model and effectively reduce variance as boosting iteratively averages base learners ct is used as the base learner catboost like xgboost is a member of gradient boosting decision tree gbdt algorithms with a novel handling of categorical features and a strategy of avoiding intrinsic prediction shift in gbdt algorithms dorogush et al 2018 prokhorenkova et al 2017 ordered boosting randomly permutes training examples and the residual of sample j is computed according to the weak learner learned by j 1 samples that was ordered by randomly permuted samples the residuals will not suffer prediction shift which leads to a better model regularization symmetric oblivious decision trees are grown in catboost which suggests that every node on the same level of a tree shares the same splitting criterion prokhorenkova et al 2017 lightgbm is also a gbdt algorithm with two novel features gradient based one sided sample goss and exclusive feature bundling efb ke et al 2017 these two features help reduce the data sample size and feature size during model training without losing accuracy or efficiency significantly goss reduces sample size by random sampling the data instances with small gradients while keeping the ones with large gradients this method also outperforms random sub sampling efb bundles sparse features into dense ones that can help improve computing efficiency a leaf wise best first tree growth strategy is employed in this algorithm at each level of the tree the leaf with max reduction of impurity is chosen to grow for the next node 2 3 model performance metrics and hyperparameter tuning all possible outputs of a binary classification model fall into four categories true positive is an output where the model correctly predicts the positive cases false positive is an output where the model incorrectly predicts the positive cases true negative is an output where the model correctly predicts the negative cases false negative is an output where the model incorrectly predicts the negative cases in this study positive cases represent unsafe days when e coli concentration is equal to or larger than bav while negative cases represent safe days when e coli concentration is smaller than bav since unsafe days are more important to accurately predict than safe days model performances were assessed using recall true positive rate or sensitivity precision positive predictive value and f1 score defined as follows 1 recall r true positives true positives false negatives 2 precision p true positives true positives false positives 3 f 1 score f 1 2 p r p r recall r represents the portion of real unsafe days that are correctly predicted by the model recall is of vital importance because a model with a low recall rate will result in a poor decision making for closing the beach which will put the lives of beach goers at risk precision p represents the fraction of correctly predicted real unsafe days to all correctly and incorrectly predicted unsafe days it is also very important because a model with low precision tends to make conservative decisions i e closing beach when it is not necessary which may ensure the safety of the beach goers but have negative impacts on the socioeconomic values of a beach f1 score combines r and p so it is selected as the refit score when choosing the best model for each classifier during model training the data modeling and analysis approaches employed in this study were summarized in fig 2 and implemented in the python scikit learn package the entire dataset was split into training 70 and testing 30 sets stratified by the binary output variable hyperparameter tuning was performed in two steps while keeping the default values for other parameters we first determined the number of trees i e n estimators for all models except ct using a stratified k fold cross validation approach 5 folds and 100 repeats we found that 100 trees are sufficient and no significant improvement of model performance was achieved by using more trees after fixing the number of trees other hyperparameters of each model were optimized using the k fold k 5 cross validation approach we selectively tuned 6 parameters for ct and rf 4 parameters for catboost 6 parameters for lightgbm and 7 parameters for xgboost see supporting information table s3 for these parameters gridsearchcv a python package from sklearn model selection was used to tune the parameters by exhaustively searching over pre specified parameter values for each classifier gridsearchcv goes through every possible combination of those values evaluates model performance and identifies the best model and its optimized parameter values to generate initial guesses we started from a large range for each parameter and gradually narrowed the range by checking the outputs of the previous tuning 2 4 shapley additive explanations shap for each prediction the shap values of environmental variables quantify their local contributions to the specific prediction the mathematical definition of shap value is given below 4 i f x z x z m z 1 f z f z i z x z 1 m z m f z f z i where i f x is the shap value for feature i given any model f built on a set of features x m is the number of all input features x is the set of all possible feature combinations that include feature i and z is the number of features in feature combination z f z and f z i are distinct predictive models trained on z and z i remove feature i from z respectively therefore shap value is calculated by aggregating marginal contributions f z f z i from all possible combinations of features z through a weighted average the shap values of a variable can be further decomposed into its main effects plus its shap interaction values with all other variables the shap interaction values between variable i and j are the difference between shap values of variable i in the presence of variable j and shap values of variable i in the absence of variable j both shap values and shap interaction values were computed using the python implementation of shap lundberg and lee 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli concentrations and environmental variables the histogram of e coli concentrations fig 1 shows that the three beaches have distinct distributions the pairwise jensen shannon distance indicates that bennett and woodlawn have the most dissimilar distributions and their geographical distance is the furthest too overall woodlawn beach has the worst water quality i e on average 28 4 196 out of 689 of historically observed e coli concentration values larger than bav fig 1 the exceedance rate for hamburg and bennett beach are 25 8 113 out of 438 and 20 2 74 out of 367 respectively woodlawn and hamburg have higher yearly averaged e coli concentrations than that of bennett fig 3 a notably the e coli concentrations peak in the year 2015 at all three beaches and the annual average changes suggest periodicity we next sought to understand the temporal pattern of e coli concentrations at short term period within a year from may to august by averaging e coli concentrations over multiple years fig 3b clearly the short term changes are more frequent and dramatic than long term annual changes to test whether the short term patterns also show periodicity we calculated the auto correlation coefficients and found that they decrease rapidly to zero for all three sites fig 3c suggesting no periodicity in e coli concentrations during the swimming season beach s geographic setting influences its e coli concentrations haack et al 2013 to explore whether the differences in e coli concentrations across beaches are associated with the environmental variables we plotted 29 environmental variables shared by the three beaches in a 2 dimensional space following dimensionality reduction fig 4 we used umap uniform manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction mcinnes et al 2018 as it searches for a low dimensional data representation that preserves the high dimensional topological structure as much as possible we found that environmental conditions of the three beaches especially between bennett and woodlawn greatly overlap in the umap space despite their greatest differences in e coli concentration distributions we also noticed that the similar environments often occurred closer in time symbols of different color when clustered tend to have similar size indicating that the three sites have undergone similar environmental changes within a year despite the similarity hamburg also shows unique combinations of environmental variables that have not been observed in the other two sites region r1 these unique environments were measured in multiple years and characterized by ll preday which represents the changes in lake level between today and the previous day overall visualization of the 29 shared environmental variables in the umap space indicates that woodlawn and bennett have similar profiles of those variables while hamburg is very different from the two sites and the characteristic of high lake level changes between consecutive days it is worth noting that profiles of environmental variables may not simply follow geographical distances as geographically hamburg is in the middle between woodlawn and bennett along the coastline fig 1 the environmental conditions that are associated with high e coli concentrations 235 cfu 100 ml as indicated by symbol plus in fig 4 are scattered all over the place suggesting complex relationship between environmental variables and e coli concentrations 3 2 assessment of machine learning models the complex associations of e coli concentrations with the environmental variables justify the use of machine learning models for determining the most predictive factors we employed five classification models in this study ct rf catboost lightgbm and xgboost the optimal hyperparameter values for each classifier and each site are shown in supporting information table s4 with a relatively long history both ct and rf have been extensively used in predicting beach water quality for example thoe et al 2014 determined ct as the best among 5 models at santa monica beach in california usa brooks et al 2016 showed that rf has an overall highest accuracy among 14 regression models tested at seven beaches in wisconsin usa catboost and xgboost are relatively new tree based boosting models and have been rarely employed for predicting fib levels in water grbčić et al 2021 weller et al 2021 to our best knowledge lightgbm has not been used for predicting microbial water quality before other than the abovementioned classification models our previous study trained an ensemble stacking regression model using the same dataset wang et al 2021a although it performs more robustly across years rf again turned out to be the best among 5 regression models multiple linear regression mlr partial linear regression pls sparse pls spls bayesian network bn and rf plus the stacking model wang et al 2021a all these regression models were included in our model comparison we used f1 score to evaluate model performance f1 score combines precision and recall precision refers to the ratio of correctly predicted unsafe days to all days that are predicted to be unsafe whether correctly or incorrectly and recall refers the proportion of unsafe days that are correctly predicted by the model a model with low recall rate will put the lives of beach goers at risk while a conservative model with low precision may ensure their safety but have negative socioeconomic impacts for all three beaches lightgbm and xgboost outperform catboost rf ct the five regression models and the stacking model by achieving the highest f1 scores table 1 specifically lightgbm has the highest precision and recall for woodlawn and has the highest precision for hamburg and bennett xgboost and ct have the highest recall for hamburg and bennett respectively overall lightgbm was the best model for the three beach sites as its f1 score was the highest for woodlawn and bennett and only second to xgboost for hamburg by a difference of 0 01 lightgbm also had the highest accuracy for all three beaches equal to xgboost for hamburg which was comparable to and slightly better than most other models in the literature see fig s1 in supporting information in terms of f1 score the regression models and the stacking model were generally worse than lightgbm and xgboost the best regression model was comparable to catboost and generally better than rf as a classifier and ct it is worth noting that the regression models were trained by minimizing mean square error mse between measured and predicted e coli concentrations while the classifications models were trained by maximizing f1 score the mse and coefficient of determination r2 of these regression models are presented in supporting information table s5 clearly the stacking models had the lowest mse for all three sites but had the highest r2 in two out of three sites for bennett the stacking model was even the worst in terms of f1 score dichotomization usually causes a loss of information therefore it s often considered unwise to practice dichotomization if continuous measurements are available however for the situation when there are systematic noises in the measurement of e coli concentrations dichotomization can reduce random fluctuations associated with input variables if the reduction in the input of the random contamination outweighs the loss of information due to dichotomization the model development based on dichotomization may provide better performances shentu and xie 2010 moreover we tested variable selection using logistic regression with l1 penalty as shown in table s6 in supporting information 9 out of 29 variables for hamburg 4 of 29 variables for bennett and 9 out of 43 variables for woodlawn can be removed after removing those variables we followed the same flowchart to redo the model development and evaluation table s7 in supporting information shows the comparison of lightgbm and xgboost model performance with and without the variable selection for three beach sites for woodlawn both xgboost and lightgbm models became worse after variable selection for hamburg variable selection improved f1 score slightly from 0 67 0 68 to 0 69 for bennett xgboost model f1 score did improve from 0 46 to 0 53 but lightgbm model f1 score decreased from 0 48 to 0 37 indicating uncertainty with variable selection overall no significant improvement was seen to justify the necessity of variable selection 3 3 global feature importance the importance of environmental variables was analyzed and ranked by using the top 2 models xgboost and lightgbm with two feature importance metrics f score i e how many times each feature is split on please note this is different from the f1 score and mean absolute shap value shap is a relatively new explanation method to interpret the predictions of machine learning models and the shap values can reveal local case dependent contributions of the predictors chen and guestrin 2016 we reported the top 5 predictors with the highest metric scores in fig 5 the lake turbidity lake turb ntu was consistently predicted as the most important environmental variable except for the combination of xgboost model and f score for hamburg where the lake level difference between today and yesterday ll preday was the most important indeed the joint distributions fig 6 show that the log transformed values of lake turbidity and e coli concentrations correlate positively r2 0 29 with each other and this positive relationship is largely independent of the beach sites despite the consistency the other top features did not agree well across the three beaches for example the 2nd to 5th features predicted by lightgbm and mean absolute shap value share no overlap across the three beach sites fig 5d except for lake turbidity the difference in f score and mean absolute shap value among the other top features was small turbidity levels may be related to e coli concentrations for several reasons higher turbidity levels may indicate lower light penetration levels and thus lower solar insolation nevers and whitman 2005 rochelle newall et al 2015 increased turbidity also indicates higher volumes of suspended particles which may be resulted from sediment resuspension or runoff from the surrounding land surface herrig et al 2015 pandey et al 2012 rehmann and soupir 2009 in lake erie wind and associated waves are the main drivers of high turbidity high e coli concentrations may be caused by resuspension of sediment associated e coli since the different forms of disturbance will enhance the resuspension process similar phenomena have been observed in previous beach water quality studies at the great lakes for example ishii et al 2007 discovered that wave action has a potential influence on e coli colonization and distribution at lake superior beaches due to the resuspension of sand and sediments associated frick et al 2008 found that turbidity was the last remaining variable by variable elimination and thus served as the best explanatory variable at huntington beach ohio on the western shore of lake erie one characteristic feature of hamburg was ll preday which ranked among the top 5 features in three out of the four combinations of models and feature importance metrics fig 5 however it may be a predictor only informative to hamburg as woodlawn and bennett had much less lake level changes from day to day fig 4 hydrometeorological variables also play important roles in the predictions cloud cover cloudcover 24hr can be an important feature as it directly influences solar radiation intensity since runoffs resulted from rainfall carry e coli or pollutants beneficial for bacterial reproduction into the beach water rainfall data may also be important shrestha et al 2020 for example thoe et al 2014 suggested that storm events and tide levels are critical factors in modeling e coli concentrations in californian beaches weller et al 2021 also found turbidity rainfall and temperature to be the most important factors to predict e coli concentrations in agricultural water in new york state 3 4 robust association of lake turbidity with e coli concentrations one of the most important advantages of shap is that for any model variable it outputs a local shap importance for each individual value of this variable as shown in fig 7 we found that the local shap values of lake turbidity increase nearly monotonically with its actual values suggesting a simple positive relationship between lake turbidity and binarized e coli concentrations notably lake turbidity only positively contributes to measured e coli concentration when it is larger than 10 ntu more importantly the shap dependence plot of lake turbidity suggests that lake turbidity is a robust predictor of beach water quality the robustness is reflected at two levels 1 the local shap values of lake turbidity distributed narrowly around the mean indicating the contribution of this variable to the overall model performance is mostly dependent on its own values and secondarily affected by other environmental factors in other words the importance of lake turbidity i e shap value is insensitive to the fluctuations of its value which is nontrivial as the shap value distributions of other variables are generally non monotonic and exhibit much more scattered plots fig 7 2 the importance of lake turbidity has similar trends with its values across the three beach sites clearly the insight of robust association between lake turbidity and water quality cannot be drawn from global importance scores e g gini importance without local explanation methods such as shap the importance of an individual feature can be decomposed into the direct effects from the feature itself and the indirect effects based on feature feature interactions detection and quantification of feature interactions has been a central topic in machine learning lundberg et al 2020 when features interact with each other and the interaction effects are not negligible the predictions cannot be simply understood from the effects of individual features the shap dependence plots of lake turbidity fig 8 a are decomposed into main effects fig 8b plus interaction effects with specific variables e g dayofyear in fig 8c plus interaction effects with all other remaining variables fig 8d lundberg et al 2020 for all three beach sites the main effects of lake turbidity are piecewise continuous with two important thresholds at roughly 30 and 100 ntu values nearby the thresholds have similar impacts on beach closure open predictions by the variable alone interestingly the shap interaction values between lake turbidity and day of year dayofyear show an opposite direction in the deviation of the main effects of lake turbidity for different periods of a year this data pattern consistent across the three beaches indicates that lake turbidity has a stronger positive impact on e coli concentration in june and july than in august it is difficult to reveal the interaction effect between lake turbidity and day of year without shap interaction values even though both variables have been repeatedly included in the final models of microbial water quality heasley et al 2021 while lake turbidity has been extensively studied the role day of year plays as a model variable on e coli concentration is much less understood heasley et al 2021 for most studies day of year was included in the model as a proxy of any temporal variable such as temperature and solar radiation since direct measurement of temperature was incorporated it is likely that day of year to a large degree represents solar radiation in our study in geographical locations nearby buffalo solar radiation is relatively stronger in june and july compared to august and may affect lake turbidity differently during the two periods however solar inactivation is only one effect in our study and by itself cannot explain the observed mean changes in e coli concentration fig 3b purple dashed line which increase from mid may to mid june but decrease from mid july to august 3 5 impacts of beach site unique variables on model performance generally both lightgbm and xgboost models had the best performances at woodlawn and the worst at bennett it is notable that several features that were only collected for woodlawn appeared in the top 5 features in fig 5 including waveht ft wave height local rain24 in local 24 h rainfall stream turb ntu streamflow turbidity and stream turb preday the difference in streamflow turbidity between present and previous days we hypothesized that the model performance differences might be attributed to the 14 environmental variables that were collected at woodlawn but unavailable at bennett and hamburg to test this hypothesis we retrained lightgbm and xgboost models for woodlawn using only the 29 shared variables among three beaches as expected both models drastically reduced performances in terms of all model evaluation metrics with f1 score dropping from 0 76 to 0 60 for lightgbm and 0 71 to 0 57 for xgboost table 1 since bennett and woodlawn have similar distributions of the shared variables fig 4 removal of the 14 woodlawn specific variables leading to substantially reduced predictability at woodlawn at least partially accounts for the worse model performances at bennett it is interesting to mention that the feature information of some woodlawn specific variables such as waveh ft and local rain24 in is also contained in the shared variables as a proxy for example waveheight 24hr is wave height data predicted from the noaa glcfs model and airportrain24 in measures daily rainfall amount in the nearest airport to each beach site rather than local values the locally measured wave height waveht ft and rain local rain24 in maybe correlated better with the e coli concentration and thus helped improve the model performance we therefore emphasize the importance of collecting locally accurate information about environmental features for building predictive models 4 conclusions decision making for beach advisories and closures is a sensitive domain where wrong decisions may lead to severe consequences in public health and economy we employed five classification models including three rising gradient boosting decision tree algorithms to predict the safety of water quality at three geographically close lake erie beaches we found that lightgbm performed the best overall followed by xgboost and both lightgbm and xgboost have much better performances than catboost rf and ct global feature importance analysis using mean absolute shap value and f1 score revealed that lake turbidity was the most important predictor local shap values of lake turbidity further indicated that lake turbidity was not only the most important but also a very robust predictor the contribution of lake turbidity to the prediction results was mostly dependent on its own values and secondarily affected by the values of other environmental factors decomposing the shap values of lake turbidity allowed us to recover an interesting though maybe secondary interaction between day of year and lake turbidity the opposite interactions between may july and july august suggest that the predictability of lake turbidity may change before and after july each year other than lake turbidity our study also elucidated the importance of collecting accurate local information of wave height and rainfall for developing predictive models at lake erie and other great lakes beaches despite the above insights it remains challenge to understand the associations between environmental variables and e coli concentration particularly the source of lake turbidity and its interactions with other variables to collectively inform e coli concentrations and beach closure decisions as this study focused on the performance and interpretation of predictive models identifying sources releasing e coli into the beach waters is beyond the scope of this paper however there may be multiple human and non human sources at those beaches so microbial source tracking e g dubinsky et al 2016 shrestha et al 2020 can be very helpful for making better models and decisions last but not the least although the classification approach was used those tree based models including lightgbm and xgboost can also be used for regression even though regression models had worse performance in prediction accuracy it should not be neglected

models aiming at finding the best model for the beach sites in their studies brooks et al 2013 nevers and whitman 2011 zhang et al 2012 tree based models especially classification tree ct and random forest rf have shown great promise in outperforming other widely used regression models such as multiple linear regression mlr and partial least square pls brooks et al 2016 searcy and boehm 2021 thoe et al 2014 2015 wang et al 2021a zimmer faust et al 2018 other more recent and advanced tree based models such as extreme gradient boosting xgboost categorical boosting catboost and light gradient boosting machine lightgbm were rarely applied to predict beach water quality machine learning models are trained on data collected by humans meaning that these models reflect human biases and prejudices when a black box model fails we are neither able to know why it fails nor to trace the source of failure from the bias in training data besides predictability another challenge for the utility of a machine learning model is its transparency i e the ability of humans to understand how environmental features influence the prediction of fib concentrations both predictability and transparency are key constituting elements of model interpretability devane et al 2020 panidhapu et al 2020 poulin et al 2020 wang et al 2021b weller et al 2021 it has been well noted that tree based machine learning models despite their promising predictability are severely limited by their transparency lundberg et al 2020 for example gaining a full understanding of the decision process of a forest of deep trees with each tree trained on randomly selected environmental features is very difficult in this regard simpler models such as mlr and ct were employed often due to their high transparency madani and seth 2020 zimmer faust et al 2018 the use of black box models for decision making can be problematic the potential bias inherited from the training data may lead to unfair or wrong decisions and even worse the lack of transparency prevents us from understanding the source of bias although there are a number of global interpretation methods e g gini impurity index that summarize the averaged importance of the input features the local interpretation approaches that explain the impact of each feature on a per sample basis only begin to emerge recently lundberg et al 2020 two such approaches are lime local interpretable model agnostic explanation ribeiro et al 2016 and shap shapley additive explanations lundberg and lee 2017 where the latter decomposes the global prediction into additive contributions of local features such that the global and local interpretations are consistent we aim to overcome the under appreciated issue of model interpretability for predicting fib concentrations by developing machine learning models that are both predictive and transparent towards this goal we employed and compared five tree based machine learning models namely ct breiman et al 1984 rf breiman 2001 xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 catboost prokhorenkova et al 2017 and lightgbm ke et al 2017 we also expanded our comparison by including six regression models tested in wang et al 2021a including the ensemble stacking model we have previously developed using shap we then performed global and local feature importance analyses with the best models to predict the most important environmental factors for beach closure to evaluate the robustness of those important factors and to dissect their interactions with other environmental variables 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and data sand beach is the most common type of the laurentian great lakes shoreline and provide valuable recreational sites nevers et al 2014 song et al 2010 the study sites include three sand beaches i e woodlawn hamburg and bennett along lake erie shores in western new york state in the united states fig 1 they are the most popular beaches in this region especially the 1 5 km long woodlawn beach that has over 100 000 visitors every year however they all face frequent closing issues due to high fib levels the new york state requires water quality monitoring for all bathing beaches by surveys or water quality models e coli concentration values in a unit of cfu 100 ml for the three sites were obtained from the erie county department of health they were collected on almost a daily basis during the swimming season from late may to early september specifically the data set of the woodlawn beach contains 689 observations between 2011 and 2018 while hamburg and bennett beaches contain 438 and 367 observations between 2013 and 2017 respectively for model development we binarized the e coli concentration values using the threshold of 235 cfu 100 ml the beach action value bav recommended by the us epa and adopted by the new york state department of health to indicate whether beach closures are needed therefore positive and negative output variables represent unsafe and safe days when e coli concentrations are larger and smaller than bav respectively shown in fig 1 environmental variables that are used in the predictive models are categorized into four groups lake related weather related stream related and others see supporting information table s1 for the summary of the variables considered in this study and other recent studies generally 29 environmental variables collected by the u s geological survey are available for all of the three sites at a daily basis in this study they include lake turbidity wind speed and direction nearby airport rainfall bar pressure lake water level wave height and direction cloud cover water temperature and so on the complete list and detailed explanations of the variables are in supporting information table s2 other than the 29 shared variables woodlawn has 14 unique variables including four predictors related to the water quality of a nearby stream outlet in contact with the beach i e stream turbidity temperature and stream gage heights on the current and previous days and another 10 variables that are only monitored at woodlawn by the erie county department of health e g local rainfall wave height etc since environmental variables are available on a daily basis while the e coli concentration values are not we tailored the entire dataset by choosing the days when both types of data were measured therefore gap filling data imputation was not needed 2 2 classification models five tree based classification models ct rf xgboost catboost and lightgbm were employed ct is the most basic tree based model and the simplest to interpret breiman et al 1984 tree structured classifiers are constructed by splitting the parent data set into child subsets according to the gini index rf is an ensemble of a family of individual tree based classifiers breiman 2001 each individual classifier in a rf model is built as a ct with bootstrapped data and feature space rf takes advantage of the strength of individual classifiers as the generalization error converges as the number of trees in the forest increases rf can reduce variance of a predictor significantly however a rf bias remains the same as individual ones since each tree is constructed in an identically distributed way each tree in the forest works and predicts independently despite its limitation on combating bias rf has shown good performances in many applications xgboost is an extreme gradient boosting method that introduces a new strategy of adding a regularized objective chen and guestrin 2016 it is also an ensemble algorithm that utilizes weak learners ability to achieve strong performance shrinkage and column subsampling strategies are used to reduce model bias and variance in xgboost shrinkage reduces the influence of individual trees which leads to the decrease of bias and column subsampling introduces randomization into the model and effectively reduce variance as boosting iteratively averages base learners ct is used as the base learner catboost like xgboost is a member of gradient boosting decision tree gbdt algorithms with a novel handling of categorical features and a strategy of avoiding intrinsic prediction shift in gbdt algorithms dorogush et al 2018 prokhorenkova et al 2017 ordered boosting randomly permutes training examples and the residual of sample j is computed according to the weak learner learned by j 1 samples that was ordered by randomly permuted samples the residuals will not suffer prediction shift which leads to a better model regularization symmetric oblivious decision trees are grown in catboost which suggests that every node on the same level of a tree shares the same splitting criterion prokhorenkova et al 2017 lightgbm is also a gbdt algorithm with two novel features gradient based one sided sample goss and exclusive feature bundling efb ke et al 2017 these two features help reduce the data sample size and feature size during model training without losing accuracy or efficiency significantly goss reduces sample size by random sampling the data instances with small gradients while keeping the ones with large gradients this method also outperforms random sub sampling efb bundles sparse features into dense ones that can help improve computing efficiency a leaf wise best first tree growth strategy is employed in this algorithm at each level of the tree the leaf with max reduction of impurity is chosen to grow for the next node 2 3 model performance metrics and hyperparameter tuning all possible outputs of a binary classification model fall into four categories true positive is an output where the model correctly predicts the positive cases false positive is an output where the model incorrectly predicts the positive cases true negative is an output where the model correctly predicts the negative cases false negative is an output where the model incorrectly predicts the negative cases in this study positive cases represent unsafe days when e coli concentration is equal to or larger than bav while negative cases represent safe days when e coli concentration is smaller than bav since unsafe days are more important to accurately predict than safe days model performances were assessed using recall true positive rate or sensitivity precision positive predictive value and f1 score defined as follows 1 recall r true positives true positives false negatives 2 precision p true positives true positives false positives 3 f 1 score f 1 2 p r p r recall r represents the portion of real unsafe days that are correctly predicted by the model recall is of vital importance because a model with a low recall rate will result in a poor decision making for closing the beach which will put the lives of beach goers at risk precision p represents the fraction of correctly predicted real unsafe days to all correctly and incorrectly predicted unsafe days it is also very important because a model with low precision tends to make conservative decisions i e closing beach when it is not necessary which may ensure the safety of the beach goers but have negative impacts on the socioeconomic values of a beach f1 score combines r and p so it is selected as the refit score when choosing the best model for each classifier during model training the data modeling and analysis approaches employed in this study were summarized in fig 2 and implemented in the python scikit learn package the entire dataset was split into training 70 and testing 30 sets stratified by the binary output variable hyperparameter tuning was performed in two steps while keeping the default values for other parameters we first determined the number of trees i e n estimators for all models except ct using a stratified k fold cross validation approach 5 folds and 100 repeats we found that 100 trees are sufficient and no significant improvement of model performance was achieved by using more trees after fixing the number of trees other hyperparameters of each model were optimized using the k fold k 5 cross validation approach we selectively tuned 6 parameters for ct and rf 4 parameters for catboost 6 parameters for lightgbm and 7 parameters for xgboost see supporting information table s3 for these parameters gridsearchcv a python package from sklearn model selection was used to tune the parameters by exhaustively searching over pre specified parameter values for each classifier gridsearchcv goes through every possible combination of those values evaluates model performance and identifies the best model and its optimized parameter values to generate initial guesses we started from a large range for each parameter and gradually narrowed the range by checking the outputs of the previous tuning 2 4 shapley additive explanations shap for each prediction the shap values of environmental variables quantify their local contributions to the specific prediction the mathematical definition of shap value is given below 4 i f x z x z m z 1 f z f z i z x z 1 m z m f z f z i where i f x is the shap value for feature i given any model f built on a set of features x m is the number of all input features x is the set of all possible feature combinations that include feature i and z is the number of features in feature combination z f z and f z i are distinct predictive models trained on z and z i remove feature i from z respectively therefore shap value is calculated by aggregating marginal contributions f z f z i from all possible combinations of features z through a weighted average the shap values of a variable can be further decomposed into its main effects plus its shap interaction values with all other variables the shap interaction values between variable i and j are the difference between shap values of variable i in the presence of variable j and shap values of variable i in the absence of variable j both shap values and shap interaction values were computed using the python implementation of shap lundberg and lee 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli concentrations and environmental variables the histogram of e coli concentrations fig 1 shows that the three beaches have distinct distributions the pairwise jensen shannon distance indicates that bennett and woodlawn have the most dissimilar distributions and their geographical distance is the furthest too overall woodlawn beach has the worst water quality i e on average 28 4 196 out of 689 of historically observed e coli concentration values larger than bav fig 1 the exceedance rate for hamburg and bennett beach are 25 8 113 out of 438 and 20 2 74 out of 367 respectively woodlawn and hamburg have higher yearly averaged e coli concentrations than that of bennett fig 3 a notably the e coli concentrations peak in the year 2015 at all three beaches and the annual average changes suggest periodicity we next sought to understand the temporal pattern of e coli concentrations at short term period within a year from may to august by averaging e coli concentrations over multiple years fig 3b clearly the short term changes are more frequent and dramatic than long term annual changes to test whether the short term patterns also show periodicity we calculated the auto correlation coefficients and found that they decrease rapidly to zero for all three sites fig 3c suggesting no periodicity in e coli concentrations during the swimming season beach s geographic setting influences its e coli concentrations haack et al 2013 to explore whether the differences in e coli concentrations across beaches are associated with the environmental variables we plotted 29 environmental variables shared by the three beaches in a 2 dimensional space following dimensionality reduction fig 4 we used umap uniform manifold approximation and projection for dimension reduction mcinnes et al 2018 as it searches for a low dimensional data representation that preserves the high dimensional topological structure as much as possible we found that environmental conditions of the three beaches especially between bennett and woodlawn greatly overlap in the umap space despite their greatest differences in e coli concentration distributions we also noticed that the similar environments often occurred closer in time symbols of different color when clustered tend to have similar size indicating that the three sites have undergone similar environmental changes within a year despite the similarity hamburg also shows unique combinations of environmental variables that have not been observed in the other two sites region r1 these unique environments were measured in multiple years and characterized by ll preday which represents the changes in lake level between today and the previous day overall visualization of the 29 shared environmental variables in the umap space indicates that woodlawn and bennett have similar profiles of those variables while hamburg is very different from the two sites and the characteristic of high lake level changes between consecutive days it is worth noting that profiles of environmental variables may not simply follow geographical distances as geographically hamburg is in the middle between woodlawn and bennett along the coastline fig 1 the environmental conditions that are associated with high e coli concentrations 235 cfu 100 ml as indicated by symbol plus in fig 4 are scattered all over the place suggesting complex relationship between environmental variables and e coli concentrations 3 2 assessment of machine learning models the complex associations of e coli concentrations with the environmental variables justify the use of machine learning models for determining the most predictive factors we employed five classification models in this study ct rf catboost lightgbm and xgboost the optimal hyperparameter values for each classifier and each site are shown in supporting information table s4 with a relatively long history both ct and rf have been extensively used in predicting beach water quality for example thoe et al 2014 determined ct as the best among 5 models at santa monica beach in california usa brooks et al 2016 showed that rf has an overall highest accuracy among 14 regression models tested at seven beaches in wisconsin usa catboost and xgboost are relatively new tree based boosting models and have been rarely employed for predicting fib levels in water grbčić et al 2021 weller et al 2021 to our best knowledge lightgbm has not been used for predicting microbial water quality before other than the abovementioned classification models our previous study trained an ensemble stacking regression model using the same dataset wang et al 2021a although it performs more robustly across years rf again turned out to be the best among 5 regression models multiple linear regression mlr partial linear regression pls sparse pls spls bayesian network bn and rf plus the stacking model wang et al 2021a all these regression models were included in our model comparison we used f1 score to evaluate model performance f1 score combines precision and recall precision refers to the ratio of correctly predicted unsafe days to all days that are predicted to be unsafe whether correctly or incorrectly and recall refers the proportion of unsafe days that are correctly predicted by the model a model with low recall rate will put the lives of beach goers at risk while a conservative model with low precision may ensure their safety but have negative socioeconomic impacts for all three beaches lightgbm and xgboost outperform catboost rf ct the five regression models and the stacking model by achieving the highest f1 scores table 1 specifically lightgbm has the highest precision and recall for woodlawn and has the highest precision for hamburg and bennett xgboost and ct have the highest recall for hamburg and bennett respectively overall lightgbm was the best model for the three beach sites as its f1 score was the highest for woodlawn and bennett and only second to xgboost for hamburg by a difference of 0 01 lightgbm also had the highest accuracy for all three beaches equal to xgboost for hamburg which was comparable to and slightly better than most other models in the literature see fig s1 in supporting information in terms of f1 score the regression models and the stacking model were generally worse than lightgbm and xgboost the best regression model was comparable to catboost and generally better than rf as a classifier and ct it is worth noting that the regression models were trained by minimizing mean square error mse between measured and predicted e coli concentrations while the classifications models were trained by maximizing f1 score the mse and coefficient of determination r2 of these regression models are presented in supporting information table s5 clearly the stacking models had the lowest mse for all three sites but had the highest r2 in two out of three sites for bennett the stacking model was even the worst in terms of f1 score dichotomization usually causes a loss of information therefore it s often considered unwise to practice dichotomization if continuous measurements are available however for the situation when there are systematic noises in the measurement of e coli concentrations dichotomization can reduce random fluctuations associated with input variables if the reduction in the input of the random contamination outweighs the loss of information due to dichotomization the model development based on dichotomization may provide better performances shentu and xie 2010 moreover we tested variable selection using logistic regression with l1 penalty as shown in table s6 in supporting information 9 out of 29 variables for hamburg 4 of 29 variables for bennett and 9 out of 43 variables for woodlawn can be removed after removing those variables we followed the same flowchart to redo the model development and evaluation table s7 in supporting information shows the comparison of lightgbm and xgboost model performance with and without the variable selection for three beach sites for woodlawn both xgboost and lightgbm models became worse after variable selection for hamburg variable selection improved f1 score slightly from 0 67 0 68 to 0 69 for bennett xgboost model f1 score did improve from 0 46 to 0 53 but lightgbm model f1 score decreased from 0 48 to 0 37 indicating uncertainty with variable selection overall no significant improvement was seen to justify the necessity of variable selection 3 3 global feature importance the importance of environmental variables was analyzed and ranked by using the top 2 models xgboost and lightgbm with two feature importance metrics f score i e how many times each feature is split on please note this is different from the f1 score and mean absolute shap value shap is a relatively new explanation method to interpret the predictions of machine learning models and the shap values can reveal local case dependent contributions of the predictors chen and guestrin 2016 we reported the top 5 predictors with the highest metric scores in fig 5 the lake turbidity lake turb ntu was consistently predicted as the most important environmental variable except for the combination of xgboost model and f score for hamburg where the lake level difference between today and yesterday ll preday was the most important indeed the joint distributions fig 6 show that the log transformed values of lake turbidity and e coli concentrations correlate positively r2 0 29 with each other and this positive relationship is largely independent of the beach sites despite the consistency the other top features did not agree well across the three beaches for example the 2nd to 5th features predicted by lightgbm and mean absolute shap value share no overlap across the three beach sites fig 5d except for lake turbidity the difference in f score and mean absolute shap value among the other top features was small turbidity levels may be related to e coli concentrations for several reasons higher turbidity levels may indicate lower light penetration levels and thus lower solar insolation nevers and whitman 2005 rochelle newall et al 2015 increased turbidity also indicates higher volumes of suspended particles which may be resulted from sediment resuspension or runoff from the surrounding land surface herrig et al 2015 pandey et al 2012 rehmann and soupir 2009 in lake erie wind and associated waves are the main drivers of high turbidity high e coli concentrations may be caused by resuspension of sediment associated e coli since the different forms of disturbance will enhance the resuspension process similar phenomena have been observed in previous beach water quality studies at the great lakes for example ishii et al 2007 discovered that wave action has a potential influence on e coli colonization and distribution at lake superior beaches due to the resuspension of sand and sediments associated frick et al 2008 found that turbidity was the last remaining variable by variable elimination and thus served as the best explanatory variable at huntington beach ohio on the western shore of lake erie one characteristic feature of hamburg was ll preday which ranked among the top 5 features in three out of the four combinations of models and feature importance metrics fig 5 however it may be a predictor only informative to hamburg as woodlawn and bennett had much less lake level changes from day to day fig 4 hydrometeorological variables also play important roles in the predictions cloud cover cloudcover 24hr can be an important feature as it directly influences solar radiation intensity since runoffs resulted from rainfall carry e coli or pollutants beneficial for bacterial reproduction into the beach water rainfall data may also be important shrestha et al 2020 for example thoe et al 2014 suggested that storm events and tide levels are critical factors in modeling e coli concentrations in californian beaches weller et al 2021 also found turbidity rainfall and temperature to be the most important factors to predict e coli concentrations in agricultural water in new york state 3 4 robust association of lake turbidity with e coli concentrations one of the most important advantages of shap is that for any model variable it outputs a local shap importance for each individual value of this variable as shown in fig 7 we found that the local shap values of lake turbidity increase nearly monotonically with its actual values suggesting a simple positive relationship between lake turbidity and binarized e coli concentrations notably lake turbidity only positively contributes to measured e coli concentration when it is larger than 10 ntu more importantly the shap dependence plot of lake turbidity suggests that lake turbidity is a robust predictor of beach water quality the robustness is reflected at two levels 1 the local shap values of lake turbidity distributed narrowly around the mean indicating the contribution of this variable to the overall model performance is mostly dependent on its own values and secondarily affected by other environmental factors in other words the importance of lake turbidity i e shap value is insensitive to the fluctuations of its value which is nontrivial as the shap value distributions of other variables are generally non monotonic and exhibit much more scattered plots fig 7 2 the importance of lake turbidity has similar trends with its values across the three beach sites clearly the insight of robust association between lake turbidity and water quality cannot be drawn from global importance scores e g gini importance without local explanation methods such as shap the importance of an individual feature can be decomposed into the direct effects from the feature itself and the indirect effects based on feature feature interactions detection and quantification of feature interactions has been a central topic in machine learning lundberg et al 2020 when features interact with each other and the interaction effects are not negligible the predictions cannot be simply understood from the effects of individual features the shap dependence plots of lake turbidity fig 8 a are decomposed into main effects fig 8b plus interaction effects with specific variables e g dayofyear in fig 8c plus interaction effects with all other remaining variables fig 8d lundberg et al 2020 for all three beach sites the main effects of lake turbidity are piecewise continuous with two important thresholds at roughly 30 and 100 ntu values nearby the thresholds have similar impacts on beach closure open predictions by the variable alone interestingly the shap interaction values between lake turbidity and day of year dayofyear show an opposite direction in the deviation of the main effects of lake turbidity for different periods of a year this data pattern consistent across the three beaches indicates that lake turbidity has a stronger positive impact on e coli concentration in june and july than in august it is difficult to reveal the interaction effect between lake turbidity and day of year without shap interaction values even though both variables have been repeatedly included in the final models of microbial water quality heasley et al 2021 while lake turbidity has been extensively studied the role day of year plays as a model variable on e coli concentration is much less understood heasley et al 2021 for most studies day of year was included in the model as a proxy of any temporal variable such as temperature and solar radiation since direct measurement of temperature was incorporated it is likely that day of year to a large degree represents solar radiation in our study in geographical locations nearby buffalo solar radiation is relatively stronger in june and july compared to august and may affect lake turbidity differently during the two periods however solar inactivation is only one effect in our study and by itself cannot explain the observed mean changes in e coli concentration fig 3b purple dashed line which increase from mid may to mid june but decrease from mid july to august 3 5 impacts of beach site unique variables on model performance generally both lightgbm and xgboost models had the best performances at woodlawn and the worst at bennett it is notable that several features that were only collected for woodlawn appeared in the top 5 features in fig 5 including waveht ft wave height local rain24 in local 24 h rainfall stream turb ntu streamflow turbidity and stream turb preday the difference in streamflow turbidity between present and previous days we hypothesized that the model performance differences might be attributed to the 14 environmental variables that were collected at woodlawn but unavailable at bennett and hamburg to test this hypothesis we retrained lightgbm and xgboost models for woodlawn using only the 29 shared variables among three beaches as expected both models drastically reduced performances in terms of all model evaluation metrics with f1 score dropping from 0 76 to 0 60 for lightgbm and 0 71 to 0 57 for xgboost table 1 since bennett and woodlawn have similar distributions of the shared variables fig 4 removal of the 14 woodlawn specific variables leading to substantially reduced predictability at woodlawn at least partially accounts for the worse model performances at bennett it is interesting to mention that the feature information of some woodlawn specific variables such as waveh ft and local rain24 in is also contained in the shared variables as a proxy for example waveheight 24hr is wave height data predicted from the noaa glcfs model and airportrain24 in measures daily rainfall amount in the nearest airport to each beach site rather than local values the locally measured wave height waveht ft and rain local rain24 in maybe correlated better with the e coli concentration and thus helped improve the model performance we therefore emphasize the importance of collecting locally accurate information about environmental features for building predictive models 4 conclusions decision making for beach advisories and closures is a sensitive domain where wrong decisions may lead to severe consequences in public health and economy we employed five classification models including three rising gradient boosting decision tree algorithms to predict the safety of water quality at three geographically close lake erie beaches we found that lightgbm performed the best overall followed by xgboost and both lightgbm and xgboost have much better performances than catboost rf and ct global feature importance analysis using mean absolute shap value and f1 score revealed that lake turbidity was the most important predictor local shap values of lake turbidity further indicated that lake turbidity was not only the most important but also a very robust predictor the contribution of lake turbidity to the prediction results was mostly dependent on its own values and secondarily affected by the values of other environmental factors decomposing the shap values of lake turbidity allowed us to recover an interesting though maybe secondary interaction between day of year and lake turbidity the opposite interactions between may july and july august suggest that the predictability of lake turbidity may change before and after july each year other than lake turbidity our study also elucidated the importance of collecting accurate local information of wave height and rainfall for developing predictive models at lake erie and other great lakes beaches despite the above insights it remains challenge to understand the associations between environmental variables and e coli concentration particularly the source of lake turbidity and its interactions with other variables to collectively inform e coli concentrations and beach closure decisions as this study focused on the performance and interpretation of predictive models identifying sources releasing e coli into the beach waters is beyond the scope of this paper however there may be multiple human and non human sources at those beaches so microbial source tracking e g dubinsky et al 2016 shrestha et al 2020 can be very helpful for making better models and decisions last but not the least although the classification approach was used those tree based models including lightgbm and xgboost can also be used for regression even though regression models had worse performance in prediction accuracy it should not be neglected

16332,large river systems such as the river ganges ganga provide crucial water resources for the environment and society yet often face significant challenges associated with cumulative impacts arising from upstream environmental and anthropogenic influences understanding the complex dynamics of such systems remains a major challenge especially given accelerating environmental stressors including climate change and urbanization and due to limitations in data and process understanding across scales an integrated approach is required which robustly enables the hydrogeochemical dynamics and underpinning processes impacting water quality in large river systems to be explored here we develop a systematic approach for improving the understanding of hydrogeochemical dynamics and processes in large river systems and apply this to a longitudinal survey 2500 km of the river ganges ganga and key tributaries in the indo gangetic basin this framework enables us to succinctly interpret downstream water quality trends in response to the underpinning processes controlling major element hydrogeochemistry across the basin based on conceptual water source signatures and dynamics informed by a 2019 post monsoonal survey of 81 river bank side sampling locations the spatial distribution of a suite of selected physico chemical and inorganic parameters combined with segmented linear regression reveals minor and major downstream hydrogeochemical transitions we use this information to identify five major hydrogeochemical zones characterized in part by the inputs of key tributaries urban and agricultural areas and estuarine inputs near the bay of bengal dominant trends are further explored by investigating geochemical relationships e g na cl ca na mg na sr ca and no3 cl and how water source signatures and dynamics are modified by key processes to assess the relative importance of controls such as dilution evaporation water rock interactions including carbonate and silicate weathering and anthropogenic inputs mixing dilution between sources and water rock interactions explain most regional trends in major ion chemistry although localized controls plausibly linked to anthropogenic activities are also evident in some locations temporal and spatial representativeness of river bank side sampling are considered by supplementary sampling across the river at selected locations and via comparison to historical records limitations of such large scale longitudinal sampling programs are discussed as well as approaches to address some of these inherent challenges this approach brings new systematic insight into the basin wide controls on the dominant geochemistry of the river ganga and provides a framework for characterising dominant hydrogeochemical zones processes and controls with utility to be transferable to other large river systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality hydrogeochemical processes ganga river basin river ganges water rock interaction sampling design 1 introduction understanding the dynamics of complex large river systems is a major environmental management challenge with important implications for global water food and energy security water quality in rivers is impacted by underpinning natural hydrogeological and biogeochemical processes as well as human environment

sampling strategies to ensure representativeness of observations whilst a number of frameworks for water quality monitoring and management exist viz australian government 2018 belitz et al 2003

et al 2020 lata et al 2009 mariya et al 2019 paul 2017 satya and narayan 2018 seth et al 2013 sharma et al 2019 2016 sinha and loganathan 2015 trivedi 2010 however most previous studies report only a limited number of chemical parameters for specific smaller sub sections of the ganga which prevents detailed interpretation of underpinning hydrogeochemical drivers and controls of pollution sources

however most of these records contain only summary statistics e g annual minimum and maximum for temperature dissolved oxygen do ph electrical conductivity ec biochemical oxygen demand nitrate faecal coliform and total coliform central pollution control board 2019 parameters which are largely aligned with regulatory requirements but do not necessarily allow for comprehensive evaluation of water quality or the underpinning hydrogeochemical processes more detailed studies of particular stretches have evaluated for example nutrient and microbial water quality bowes et al 2020 heavy metal pollution paul 2017 or emerging organic contaminants sharma et al 2019 systematic evaluation of overall hydrogeochemical patterns and underpinning processes throughout the dynamic river system at the basin scale remains a major research gap an integrated comprehensive and basin wide approach is required to understand the highly complex nature of the river ganga arising both from natural environmental conditions and human environment interactions here our overall aim is to develop and demonstrate a systematic approach for advancing the understanding of hydrogeochemical dynamics in large river systems such as the river ganga this conceptual framework is a demonstration of a coordinated comprehensive approach to large scale sampling analysis and data interpretation which could be applied to a wide variety of parameters and types of river systems for improved monitoring and or process based understanding and to provide relevant information for water quality management our approach brings new insight by i improving the conceptual understanding of dominant longitudinal water quality patterns and the underpinning hydrogeochemical processes in the indo gangetic basin and elsewhere and ii addressing in part the inherent limitations of a large scale longitudinal survey spanning 1000s of kilometres our specific objectives are to i develop and test a conceptual framework for the design and interpretation of large scale river basin studies ii determine the patterns and dynamics of a selected suite of dominant hydrogeochemical parameters across the ganga basin iii interpret the dominant hydrogeochemical processes across the basin iv identify key hydrogeochemical zones across the basin and v evaluate the temporal and spatial representativeness of longitudinal sampling this systematic approach is adaptable and could be applied more widely to develop process understanding of other large river systems across the world 2 methods 2 1 conceptual framework and overall approach our overall conceptual approach fig 1 comprises a number of stages from planning to implementation analysis and data interpretation to improve the understanding of hydrogeochemical dynamics in the river ganga enabling scope for integration across parameter types scales and datasets here we describe how the key stages of this framework have been developed and applied to a large scale survey of the river ganga although the approach could be adapted to other river systems 2 2 study area the study area spans the indo gangetic basin in india from devprayag uttarakhand in the foothills of the himalayas to noorpur west bengal in the estuarine reaches south of kolkata covering a distance of 2500 km figure s1 sites also shown on fig 5 substantial environmental and socioeconomic transitions occur along the course of the river ganga bickle et al 2003 2005 dalai et al 2003 narain 2014 sharma et al 2019 tripathy and singh 2010 see supplementary information sampling sites n 81 were spread longitudinally along the main ganga and hooghly rivers n 64 noting the lower ganga is known as the hooghly downstream of approximately site g58 and key tributaries n 17 sampling sites were selected to capture key potential influences e g tributary inputs and a range of geological agricultural urban conditions and to maintain regular sampling intervals mean interval 30 km whilst balancing logistical constraints such as site access and driving distance sampling sites names are coded as xyy where x is g ganga or hooghly or t tributary and yy is a sequential number increasing with downstream distance approximate annual hydrological yields of the ganga and key tributaries were obtained from the literature mariya et al 2019 relative tributary contributions were estimated on the basis of total ganga yield 2 3 water sampling approach and conditions longitudinal water sampling the dominant focus of this study was undertaken by three teams coordinated to align sampling conditions working along the upper devprayaj to varanasi middle varanasi to begusarai and lower begusarai to noorpur segments transition areas were sampled by overlapping teams to compare data and ensure consistency surface water samples n 81 on the longitudinal survey were collected from accessible river bank side locations typically near ghats or shallow sloping banks using a bucket

sampling period is expected to be a time of relatively high groundwater surface water connectivity additional sampling was undertaken to assess the temporal and spatial representativeness of the main

with rstudio 1 4 1106 and the segmented package to test for threshold changes in the relationship between hydrogeochemical variables and distance downstream conceptually analogous to the serial discontinuity approach ward and stanford 1995 a davies test davies 1987 was used to assess whether a significant breakpoint existed and segmented regression models of increasing complexity were then

was estimated using google earth pro version 7 3 4 8248 3 results and discussion following the structure of the interpretative stage of our framework downstream patterns will be disentangled by firstly considering overall downstream trends and segmented regression to identify characteristic hydrogeochemical zones dominant hydrogeochemical processes will be identified using principal component analysis and bivariate relationships between key inorganic parameters finally sampling representativeness and recommendations for future directions are discussed 3 1 overall downstream patterns in hydrogeochemical parameters the downstream trends of a number of parameters indicate systematic shifts across the basin fig 2 a significant increase with downstream distance in the main ganga hooghly river channel is apparent for t t62 12 7 p 0 01 ph t62 7 9 p 0 01 ec t62 2 5 p 0 05 and the concentrations of the dissolved ions ca t61 5 1 t 0 01 mg t61 2 4 p 0 05 sr t61 2 6 p 0 05 and si t61 8 7 p 0 01 the trends in concentrations of cl t62 1 5 p 0 14 na p61 1 7 p 0 10 and no3 t62 1 0 p 0 31 generally increase downstream albeit not statistically significantly and concentrations are more variable than the other parameters in contrast there is a significant decrease downstream for do t62 5 4 p 0 01 and so4 t62 3 6 p 0 01 in comparison to the upper reaches the lower reaches of the basin are generally characterized by relatively low concentrations of do and so4 and relatively high t ph ec ca mg sr si na cl and no3 consistent with the increasing cumulative inputs e g urban centres agricultural zones tributary influences present along the river continuum in some cases there are clear localized inputs e g site g14 at the city of kanpur uttar pradesh near where previous studies have reported higher pollution concentrations bowes et al 2020 trivedi 2010 however the general significance of downstream trends indicates that regional rather than local controls are dominant for these selected parameters on a basin wide scale it is important to note that downstream distance is an analogue for covariables including elevation temperature flow velocity and discharge and population density and thus is not an independent explanatory variable a limited comparison of selected parameters to indian regulatory standards is in supplementary information 3 2 characteristic hydrogeochemical zones impact of key tributaries segmented regression enables further interpretation of spatial trends and possible underpinning controls and processes across the river ganga fig 3 although patterns are distinct and parameter specific there is a dominant grouping of parameters e g ec no3 cl so4 na mg sr displaying similar trends characterized by 1 an increase to 1500 km downstream 2 a decrease until the major tributary inputs at 1800 km 3 a region of relative stability 1800 2700 km and 4 a sharp increase 2700 km downstream the combination of breakpoints i e approximate locations at which changes in trends are observed across parameters fig 4 a enables identification of approximate locations of minor and major hydrogeochemical transitions which impact multiple parameters across the basin table s1 these breakpoint transitions 95 confidence interval can be described with regard to distance from source as follows i 530 100 km near g08 minor shift in t and orp ii 790 140 km near g09 g10 shift in no3 iii 1020 110 km near g14 g15 minor shift in do and ca iv 1230 70 km near g16 g17 shift in sr ca v 1400 70 km near g20 and downstream river yamuna tributary minor shift in ca na and mg na vi 1570 70 km near g24 g25 major shift in orp no3 sr ca cl na mg ca ph ec cl so4 mg na sr vii 1850 50 km downstream of river gandak tributary and between g42 g43 major shift in orp no3 sr ca mg na cl na viii 1930 80 km near g45 g46 minor shift in ph ec sr ix 2120 80 km downstream of river koshi tributary near g49 g51 major shift in do ca na cl na mg ca so4 mg x 2380 80 km near ganga hooghly transition and g61 minor shift in orp do ph and xi 2700 5 km downstream of kolkata near estuary mouth and between g79 g80 major shift in sr ca cl na mg ca ec cl na and cl no3 this analysis identifies five key zones across the basin defined based on areas bounded by the estimated major breakpoints fig 5 and table s1 zone 1 stretches from the upper reaches of the river ganga downstream for 1500 km and is generally characterized by increasing t no3 do sr ca ca na and mg na consistent both with increased agricultural and urban inputs as well as carbonate weathering bickle et al 2005 zone 2 starts 1570 70 km downstream near ghazipur and downstream of the confluence with the river yamuna tributary annual yield 76 000 106 m3 or 14 of that of the total ganga yield mariya et al 2019 zone 2 is characterized by significant decreases of a number of parameters ec ph do no3 cl so4 mg na sr sr ca cl na and mg ca and an increase in orp consistent with mixing and dilution from the yamuna zone 3 starts at 1850 50 km downstream of patna and the confluence of three key tributaries the rivers ghagara sone and gandak of approximate annual yields of 94 400 106 m3 22 420 106 m3 and 52 200 106 m3 or 18 4 and 10 of the yield of the ganga respectively mariya et al 2019 zone 3 is characterized by an initial increase in no3 cl and na concentrations and a decrease in orp sr ca and mg na likely reflecting combined contributions from both urban and tributary inputs continuing downstream ph ec and sr shift from decreasing to increasing values perhaps from urban inputs around begusarai zone 4 begins 2120 80 km downstream following the confluence with the koshi tributary annual yield 61 560 106 m3 or 12 of that of the ganga mariya et al 2019 and other urban areas including bhagalpur this is initially characterized by an increase in do so4 mg cl na and mg ca and a decrease in ca concentration within zone 4 there is also a minor shift near the ganga hooghly transition where do and ph decrease and orp increases zone 5 commencing 2700 5 km along the river and downstream of kolkata is strongly consistent with an estuariane signature with substantial increases in ec cl na sr ca cl na mg ca and cl no3 near the coast characteristic trends across all zones are shown with normalized patterns for selected parameters and for types grouping of parameters which behave similarly fig 4b c 3 3 dominant hydrogeochemical controls 3 3 1 principal component analysis principal component pc analysis was undertaken to initially screen the hydrogeochemical processes most likely to be dominant across the basin figure s4 and table s2 four components explained 94 of the variance with pc1 63 4 of variance strongly positively influenced by mg ec sr na ca no3 cl so4 ph and si consistent with dilution and mixing as major regional hydrogeochemical controls a number of samples especially from zones 1 and 2 are strongly dominated by pc1 pc2 17 9 of variance instead has strong positive loadings for ph si and ca largely consistent with controls on silicate and carbonate weathering and a negative loading for so4 which is indicative of sulfide weathering zone 1 samples trend towards the bottom left of the pc plot consistent with the lower ph and si of the upper reaches zone 4 in particularly is characterized by higher loadings of pc2 3 3 2 mixing and dilution the relationship between na and cl fig 6 a is consistent with mixing and dilution as dominant hydrogeochemical controls across the basin fresh low na low cl sources are observed in upstream reaches of zone 1 consistent with himalayan runoff bisht et al 2018 most samples are parallel to or near the equimolar line representing differing degrees of mixing between fresher sources e g near g01 and high na cl end members e g relatively polluted site g14 and estuarine site g81 and or halite dissolution the tributaries clearly have mixed inputs with the ghaghara sone gandak and koshi characterized by relatively fresh sources likely to influence mixing dilution at the confluences whereas the yamuna has relatively high na and cl concentrations potentially due to high sewage effluent inputs from the cities of new delhi ghaziabad and agra mandal et al 2010 concentrations of na in slight excess of what would be expected from halite dissolution especially at the upstream reaches are likely to derive from other water rock interactions the general trend towards higher na and cl downstream is consistent with evaporative concentration especially given consistency across parameters noted in pc1 and or cumulative inputs from halite dissolution halite dissolution has been observed to be an important process in other circum himalayan basins including the three rivers of eastern tibet noh et al 2009 although cl is commonly used in hydrological studies as a relatively conservative tracer competing processes e g mineral dissolution diffusion can also influence cl concentration introducing uncertainty in depth interpretation horner et al 2017 mcarthur et al 2012 1989 3 3 3 human environment interactions the relationship between no3 and cl is more variable fig 6b at upper reaches of zone 1 cl increases whereas no3 remains roughly constant suggesting water rock interactions e g halite dissolution increase the concentration of cl throughout the rest of the catchment no3 inputs increase approximately following the 1 1 line with cl elevated no3 concentrations are likely to arise from both urban and agricultural inputs with zone 2 and parts of zone 1 generally having the highest no3 cl ratios additional high concentrations of cl in zone 5 without a proportional increase in no3 are likely from estuarine inputs kaul and froelich jr 1984 detailed interpretation of sources and processing of nutrients in this system including with regard to land use land cover is the subject of ongoing investigation by co authors 3 3 4 water rock interactions the relationship between ca na and mg na fig 6c suggests that there are substantial contributions associated with carbonate weathering particularly in zone 1 as well as from the northerly ghaghara and gandak tributaries these geological controls suggest that sources representing the end member ratios of ca na and mg na are likely to be the dominant controls on overall major element water chemistry upstream reaches generally trend towards the calcite caco3 end member whereas the estuarine samples approach the silicate end member the ca na of himalayan silicate rocks is always 1 bickle et al 2005 and references within with an estimated granitic silicate end member of ca na 0 35 0 15 gaillardet et al 1999 consistent with the furthest downstream samples the slope of the linear regression between ca na and mg na is 3 2 0 1 slightly higher than previously reported 1 1 0 4 for the upper reaches of the basin bickle et al 2005 sr ca values fig 6d are dependant on rock type with sr ca ratios previously reported to be higher for limestones 0 22 0 02 than dolomites 0 15 0 02 in the ganga headwaters bickle et al 2005 the ratios of sr ca to ca na tend to be clustered particularly in zone 2 3 and 4 suggesting common rock types in those zones both of the cation plots ca na to mg na fig 6c and sr ca to ca na fig 6d show reasonable approximations of two component mixing of carbonate and silicate derived components and are consistent with trends previously reported bickle et al 2005 deviations from dominant two component mixing are likely to derive from additional water rock interactions related to for example evaporites phosphorites and siliceous lithologies bickle et al 2005 the downstream trends of ca are strongly in agreement with inferred hco3 with very similar breakpoints identified 1000 km downstream figure s5 consistent with trends expected from the weathering of carbonates and silicates in the middle zones where many parameters decrease significantly carbonate dissolution is likely to contribute to sustaining ca and ph resulting in the only slightly decreasing trends for these parameters sulfide weathering also appears to be an important process impacting concentrations of so4 and indeed sulfide minerals are very prevalent in the ganges brahmaputra basin fendorf et al 2010 galy and france lanord 1999 interestingly although the acidity produced by sulfide weathering may influence carbonate dissolution bufe et al 2021 the relative importance and co variation of these processes appears to be spatially dependant as ca appears to be continually produced within zone 3 even when so4 is decreasing selected important chemical reactions expected to impact the hydrogeochemistry are shown in supplementary information 3 3 5 groundwater surface water interactions groundwater has been demonstrated to substantially contribute to the water in the river ganga in addition to glacial melt and surface runoff mukherjee et al 2018 groundwater surface water interactions are largely controlled by the relative difference between river stage and groundwater level as well as regional geology with higher permeability sediments in the upper reaches of the ganga basin bonsor et al 2017 leading to increased groundwater surface water connectivity during most of the year the dominant groundwater flow direction is towards the river ganga constituting its baseflow mukherjee et al 2018 although this is expected to be strongly seasonally dependant as hydraulic gradients change with the monsoon lu et al submitted relatively high degrees of groundwater surface water connectivity are expected in the post monsoon season both for the ganga and key tributaries the observed chemical signatures are likely to thus inherently reflect this groundwater surface water continuum as well as the water rock interactions which may have influenced the composition of the contributing groundwater particularly in zones with minimal influence from tributaries e g zone 1 a strong influence from groundwater is expected to be reflected in the observed surface water signatures in particular the observed freshening of river water e g decreased ec na cl no3 so4 at the transition to zone 2 begins 1570 km which is upstream of the contributions from most of the major tributaries 1700 1800 km a further possible explanation for this is the release of stored fresh water e g monsoonal flood water from bank storage zones which are influenced both by the permeability of surrounding sediments bonsor et al 2017 as well as the depositional patterns related to the energy of the river rhodes et al 2017 the upper reaches of the ganga have a steeper elevation gradient fig 4d and are higher energy which may lead to relatively high release of bank stored water back to the river rhodes et al 2017 as compared to lower energy zones further downstream localized biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone may also influence chemical signatures although potential impacts are expected to be small because major patterns are reasonably explained by dominant processes including mixing dilution water rock interactions and to a lesser extent human environment interactions 3 4 representativeness of longitudinal sampling temporal and spatial representativeness can be inherent limitations in longitudinal sampling of large river systems here we have integrated a number of steps to assess and quantify sampling representativeness specific recommendations follow in section 3 5 3 4 1 short term variations the extent of short term variability e g hourly to weekly time scales in hydrogeochemical conditions has been estimated using various approaches see supplementary information and figure s6 substantial short term e g hourly shifts were observed over 15 min sampling intervals figure s6a d indicating that short term impacts can clearly be important variation in ph and t is broadly consistent with other studies of diurnal patterns in surface waters nimick et al 2011 pokrovsky and shirokova 2013 and likely reflects a combination of diurnal changes arising from natural daily shifts in temperature and associated parameters river metabolism cohen et al 2013 shifting flow regimes of water within the river and variable urban anthropogenic and other upstream inputs although short term variability may have significant impact on local biogeochemical processes the extent of temporal variability on these timescales is much less than the spatial variability observed longitudinally 3 4 2 seasonal annual variations comparison to historical data the magnitude and spatial trends in our post monsoon data show strong general agreement with historical records from india s national water quality monitoring programme nwqm central pollution control board 2019 figure s8 the relative similarity and consistency between t ph and ec across years corroborates that the major hydrogeochemical controls including concentrations of dominant inorganic ions are likely largely controlled by regional factors including hydrogeological setting and climate importantly however temporal representativeness may be parameter dependant with wider variability expected particularly for parameters associated with localized anthropogenic activities e g nutrients microplastics 3 4 3 representativeness of bank side sampling river cross sectional variability is discussed in supplementary information and figure s9 in brief the cross sectional variability is generally less than the diurnal variations and considerably less than the longitudinal variability observed 3 5 adaptability of approach and future directions although we report here a hydrogeochemical investigation across the river ganga in india our approach could easily be adapted to improve the understanding of dynamics and processes of other large river systems and or for systematic investigation of other types of parameters in large river systems which span diverse environmental conditions e g of varying geological climatic topographic and anthropogenic characteristics it is imperative to identify the dominant drivers impacting regional water quality in this case statistical analysis including segmented regression and principal component analysis allows distinct zones and key hydrogeochemical controls e g dilution mixing water rock interactions to be identified across the basin once a baseline study has been developed and implemented such as is reported here future studies could further expand the spatial and or temporal resolution and or types of parameters considered selection of appropriate methods for data analysis and interpretation are key design considerations for transferability and depend on the nature of specific research aims to our knowledge a systematic coordinated basin wide dataset for hydrogeochemical understanding of the river ganga at this large scale has not been established in india this approach creates a platform to investigate other parameters and to establish comparisons to other large river basins internationally in the future whilst large scale longitudinal surveys enable highly valuable spatial information to be obtained the limitations inherent in longitudinal surveys e g capturing complexities of localized inputs diurnal hydrogeochemical controls or seasonal variability must be considered recommendations to address mitigate and or quantify the impact of some of these inherent limitations whilst undertaking a large scale longitudinal survey include i conduct sampling ideally at the same time of day to mitigate the impact of diurnal variability although this is not always feasible in studies across large river systems ii undertake systematic time series sampling throughout an entire day ideally both at urban and rural locations to quantify the extent of diurnal variability iii undertake supplementary cross sectional surveys at selected key locations including near the extreme ends of longitudinal surveys noting potential logistical constraints such as practicalities of small boat access in a busy shipping transport hub such as kolkata iv compare data to historical records to assist in contextualizing annual representativeness v repeat longitudinal sampling of all or selected sites in contrasting flow conditions e g post and pre monsoonal conditions to understand how underpinning hydrogeochemical processes may change throughout the year whilst many of these measures were integrated in our study here it would be a recommended target for future work to repeat a similar longitudinal survey in the ganga basin under relatively low flow conditions to expand temporal resolution of the dataset 4 conclusions here we develop and apply a systematic approach for advancing understanding of hydrogeochemical dynamics and processes in large river systems as demonstrated via a longitudinal survey 2500 km of the river ganga and key tributaries from the himalayas to the bay of bengal the application of our framework evidences that overall the lower reaches of the basin are characterized by higher t ph ec and concentrations of ca mg sr si na cl and no3 and lower do and so4 which is largely consistent with expected cumulative downstream inputs arising from both water rock interactions and human environment interactions over 1000s of kilometres although there are localized inputs in some cases regional controls are likely dominant for most of these parameters on a basin wide scale segmented regression enables the identification of estimated downstream breakpoints and five associated hydrogeochemical zones the framework has been used to reveal that mixing and dilution are the most important hydrogeochemical controls across the basin as well as carbonate and silicate weathering strongly influencing the major element composition of surface water the magnitude and spatial trends in our data are generally in strong agreement with historical governmental records this agreement suggests that the major hydrogeochemical controls are largely controlled by regional factors e g hydrogeological setting although annual representativeness may not extend to all water quality parameters especially those directly related to anthropogenic activities the magnitude of short term temporal variability in water quality parameters was found to be less than their longitudinal diversity selected cross sectional surveys indicated some cross channel variability particularly near tributary inputs likely attributed to differences in stream depth flow and mixing rigorous interpretation of our results applying our framework to the river ganga allows limitations of large scale longitudinal sampling programs to be identified including for instance challenges in assessing localized inputs and temporal seasonal controls along with some strategies to mitigate these impacts in addition to providing new insight to the dominant hydrogeochemical processes impacting surface water composition in the river ganga our systematic approach is adaptable to other parameters and or similar coordinated surveys of other large river systems across the

16332,large river systems such as the river ganges ganga provide crucial water resources for the environment and society yet often face significant challenges associated with cumulative impacts arising from upstream environmental and anthropogenic influences understanding the complex dynamics of such systems remains a major challenge especially given accelerating environmental stressors including climate change and urbanization and due to limitations in data and process understanding across scales an integrated approach is required which robustly enables the hydrogeochemical dynamics and underpinning processes impacting water quality in large river systems to be explored here we develop a systematic approach for improving the understanding of hydrogeochemical dynamics and processes in large river systems and apply this to a longitudinal survey 2500 km of the river ganges ganga and key tributaries in the indo gangetic basin this framework enables us to succinctly interpret downstream water quality trends in response to the underpinning processes controlling major element hydrogeochemistry across the basin based on conceptual water source signatures and dynamics informed by a 2019 post monsoonal survey of 81 river bank side sampling locations the spatial distribution of a suite of selected physico chemical and inorganic parameters combined with segmented linear regression reveals minor and major downstream hydrogeochemical transitions we use this information to identify five major hydrogeochemical zones characterized in part by the inputs of key tributaries urban and agricultural areas and estuarine inputs near the bay of bengal dominant trends are further explored by investigating geochemical relationships e g na cl ca na mg na sr ca and no3 cl and how water source signatures and dynamics are modified by key processes to assess the relative importance of controls such as dilution evaporation water rock interactions including carbonate and silicate weathering and anthropogenic inputs mixing dilution between sources and water rock interactions explain most regional trends in major ion chemistry although localized controls plausibly linked to anthropogenic activities are also evident in some locations temporal and spatial representativeness of river bank side sampling are considered by supplementary sampling across the river at selected locations and via comparison to historical records limitations of such large scale longitudinal sampling programs are discussed as well as approaches to address some of these inherent challenges this approach brings new systematic insight into the basin wide controls on the dominant geochemistry of the river ganga and provides a framework for characterising dominant hydrogeochemical zones processes and controls with utility to be transferable to other large river systems graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water quality hydrogeochemical processes ganga river basin river ganges water rock interaction sampling design 1 introduction understanding the dynamics of complex large river systems is a major environmental management challenge with important implications for global water food and energy security water quality in rivers is impacted by underpinning natural hydrogeological and biogeochemical processes as well as human environment interactions that are accelerating stress on water resources at unprecedented rates best 2019 whilst remote sensing of major rivers offers increasing potential for large scale monitoring junqueira et

and spatial and temporal variability poudel et al 2013 varol et al 2012 wilbers et al 2014 developing systematic approaches for field sampling of large river systems is a critical research need however this remains challenging due to complexities around coordination logistics resource constraints and monitoring fragmentation as well as conceptual challenges in defining adequate sample sampling strategies to ensure representativeness of observations whilst a number of frameworks for water quality monitoring and management exist viz australian government 2018 belitz et al 2003 european environment agency 2018 and others understanding longitudinal water quality patterns particularly in large rivers remains very challenging due to multiple inputs and interactions and associated inherent system heterogeneities the river ganges known locally as the ganga represents one of the world s largest and most important river systems spanning 2500 km in length through one of

subcontinent kumar 2017 lokgariwar et al 2014 however regardless of its importance the river ganga is facing increasing environmental challenges associated with rapid development climate change and increasing urbanisation population water demand and agricultural intensity jain and singh 2020 moors et al 2011 pandey et al 2016 trivedi 2010 whitehead et al 2015 indian government initiatives including the ganga action plan and the national mission for clean ganga namami gange programme have been established in an attempt to monitor control and or mitigate pollution in the river ganga ministry of jal shakti 2021 narain 2014 surface water pollution in the river ganga and tributaries has been widely reported bowes et al 2020 central pollution control board 2019 hamner et al 2006 khan et al 2020 lata et al 2009 mariya et al 2019 paul 2017 satya and narayan 2018 seth et al 2013 sharma et al 2019 2016 sinha and loganathan 2015 trivedi 2010 however most previous studies report only a limited number of chemical parameters for specific smaller sub sections of the ganga which prevents detailed interpretation of underpinning hydrogeochemical drivers and controls of pollution sources

coliform and total coliform central pollution control board 2019 parameters which are largely aligned with regulatory requirements but do not necessarily allow for comprehensive evaluation of water quality or the underpinning hydrogeochemical processes more detailed studies of particular stretches have evaluated for example nutrient and microbial water quality bowes et al 2020 heavy metal pollution paul 2017 or emerging organic contaminants sharma et al 2019 systematic evaluation of overall hydrogeochemical patterns and underpinning processes throughout the dynamic river system at the basin scale remains a major research gap an integrated comprehensive and basin wide approach is required to understand the highly complex nature of the river ganga arising both from natural environmental conditions and human environment interactions here our overall aim is to develop and demonstrate a systematic approach for advancing the understanding of hydrogeochemical dynamics in large river systems such as the river ganga this conceptual framework is a demonstration of a coordinated comprehensive approach to large scale sampling analysis and data interpretation which could be applied to a wide variety of parameters and types of river systems for improved monitoring and or process based understanding and to provide relevant information for water quality management our approach brings new insight by i improving the conceptual understanding of dominant longitudinal water quality patterns and the underpinning hydrogeochemical processes in the indo gangetic basin and elsewhere and ii addressing in part the inherent limitations of a large scale longitudinal survey spanning 1000s of kilometres our specific objectives are to i develop and test a conceptual framework for the design and interpretation of large scale river basin studies ii determine the patterns and dynamics of a selected suite of dominant hydrogeochemical parameters across the ganga basin iii interpret the dominant hydrogeochemical processes across the basin iv identify key hydrogeochemical zones across the basin and v evaluate the temporal and spatial representativeness of longitudinal sampling this systematic approach is adaptable and could be applied more widely to develop process understanding of other large river systems across the world 2 methods 2 1 conceptual framework and overall approach our overall conceptual approach fig 1 comprises a number of stages from planning to implementation analysis and data interpretation to improve the understanding of hydrogeochemical dynamics in the river ganga enabling scope for integration across parameter types scales and datasets here we describe how the key stages of this framework have been developed and applied to a large scale survey of the river ganga although the approach could be adapted to other river systems 2 2 study area the study area spans the indo gangetic basin in india from devprayag uttarakhand in the foothills of the himalayas to noorpur west bengal in the estuarine reaches south of kolkata covering a distance of 2500 km figure s1 sites also shown on fig 5 substantial environmental and socioeconomic transitions occur along the course of the river ganga bickle et al 2003 2005 dalai et al 2003 narain 2014 sharma et al 2019 tripathy and singh 2010 see supplementary information sampling sites n 81 were spread longitudinally along the main ganga and hooghly rivers n 64 noting the lower ganga is known as the hooghly downstream of approximately site g58 and key tributaries n 17 sampling

whilst balancing logistical constraints such as site access and driving distance sampling sites names are coded as xyy where x is g ganga or hooghly or t tributary and yy is a sequential number increasing with downstream distance approximate annual hydrological yields of the ganga and key tributaries were obtained from the literature mariya et al 2019 relative tributary contributions were estimated on the basis of total ganga yield 2 3 water sampling approach and conditions longitudinal water sampling the dominant focus of this study was undertaken by three teams coordinated to align sampling conditions working along the upper devprayaj to varanasi middle varanasi to begusarai and lower begusarai to noorpur segments transition areas were sampled by overlapping teams to compare data and ensure consistency surface water samples n 81 on the longitudinal survey were collected from accessible river bank side locations typically near ghats or shallow sloping banks using a bucket

sampling period is expected to be a time of relatively high groundwater surface water connectivity additional sampling was undertaken to assess the temporal and spatial representativeness of the main

with rstudio 1 4 1106 and the segmented package to test for threshold changes in the relationship between hydrogeochemical variables and distance downstream conceptually analogous to the serial discontinuity approach ward and stanford 1995 a davies test davies 1987 was used to assess whether a significant breakpoint existed and segmented regression models of increasing complexity were then

was estimated using google earth pro version 7 3 4 8248 3 results and discussion following the structure of the interpretative stage of our framework downstream patterns will be disentangled by firstly considering overall downstream trends and segmented regression to identify characteristic hydrogeochemical zones dominant hydrogeochemical processes will be identified using principal component analysis and bivariate relationships between key inorganic parameters finally sampling representativeness and recommendations for future directions are discussed 3 1 overall downstream patterns in hydrogeochemical parameters the downstream trends of a number of parameters indicate systematic shifts across the basin fig 2 a significant increase with downstream distance in the main ganga hooghly river channel is apparent for t t62 12 7 p 0 01 ph t62 7 9 p 0 01 ec t62 2 5 p 0 05 and the concentrations of the dissolved ions ca t61 5 1 t 0 01 mg t61 2 4 p 0 05 sr t61 2 6 p 0 05 and si t61 8 7 p 0 01 the trends in concentrations of cl t62 1 5 p 0 14 na p61 1 7 p 0 10 and no3 t62 1 0 p 0 31 generally increase downstream albeit not statistically significantly and concentrations are more variable than the other parameters in contrast there is a significant decrease downstream for do t62 5 4 p 0 01 and so4 t62 3 6 p 0 01 in comparison to the upper reaches the lower reaches of the basin are generally characterized by relatively low concentrations of do and so4 and relatively high t ph ec ca mg sr si na cl and no3 consistent with the increasing cumulative inputs e g urban centres agricultural zones tributary influences present along the river continuum in some cases there are clear localized inputs e g site g14 at the city of kanpur uttar pradesh near where previous studies have reported higher pollution concentrations bowes et al 2020 trivedi 2010 however the general significance of downstream trends indicates that regional rather than local controls are dominant for these selected parameters on a basin wide scale it is important to note that downstream distance is an analogue for covariables including elevation temperature flow velocity and discharge and population density and thus is not an independent explanatory variable a limited comparison of selected parameters to indian regulatory standards is in supplementary information 3 2 characteristic hydrogeochemical zones impact of key tributaries segmented regression enables further interpretation of spatial trends and possible underpinning controls and processes across the river ganga fig 3 although patterns are distinct and parameter specific there is a dominant grouping of parameters e g ec no3 cl so4 na mg sr displaying similar trends characterized by 1 an increase to 1500 km downstream 2 a decrease until the major tributary inputs at 1800 km 3 a region of relative stability 1800 2700 km and 4 a sharp increase 2700 km downstream the combination of breakpoints i e approximate locations at which changes in trends are observed across parameters fig 4 a enables identification of approximate locations of minor and major hydrogeochemical transitions which impact multiple parameters across the basin table s1 these breakpoint transitions 95 confidence interval can be described with regard to distance from source as follows i 530 100 km near g08 minor shift in t and orp ii 790 140 km near g09 g10 shift in no3 iii 1020 110 km near g14 g15 minor shift in do and ca iv 1230 70 km near g16 g17 shift in sr ca v 1400 70 km near g20 and downstream river yamuna tributary minor shift in ca na and mg na vi 1570 70 km near g24 g25 major shift in orp no3 sr ca cl na mg ca ph ec cl so4 mg na sr vii 1850 50 km downstream of river gandak tributary and between g42 g43 major shift in orp no3 sr ca mg na cl na viii 1930 80 km near g45 g46 minor shift in ph ec sr ix 2120 80 km downstream of river koshi tributary near g49 g51 major shift in do ca na cl na mg ca so4 mg x 2380 80 km near ganga hooghly transition and g61 minor shift in orp do ph and xi 2700 5 km downstream of kolkata near estuary mouth and between g79 g80 major shift in sr ca cl na mg ca ec cl na and cl no3 this analysis identifies five key zones across the basin defined based on areas bounded by the estimated major breakpoints fig 5 and table s1 zone 1 stretches from the upper reaches of the river ganga downstream for 1500 km and is generally characterized by increasing t no3 do sr ca ca na and mg na consistent both with increased agricultural and urban inputs as well as carbonate weathering bickle et al 2005 zone 2 starts 1570 70 km downstream near ghazipur and downstream of the confluence with the river yamuna tributary annual yield 76 000 106 m3 or 14 of that of the total ganga yield mariya et al 2019 zone 2 is characterized by significant decreases of a number of parameters ec ph do no3 cl so4 mg na sr sr ca cl na and mg ca and an increase in orp consistent with mixing and dilution from the yamuna zone 3 starts at 1850 50 km downstream of patna and the confluence of three key tributaries the rivers ghagara sone and gandak of approximate annual yields of 94 400 106 m3 22 420 106 m3 and 52 200 106 m3 or 18 4 and 10 of the yield of the ganga respectively mariya et al 2019 zone 3 is characterized by an initial increase in no3 cl and na concentrations and a decrease in orp sr ca and mg na likely reflecting combined contributions from both urban and tributary inputs continuing downstream ph ec and sr shift from decreasing to increasing values perhaps from urban inputs around begusarai zone 4 begins 2120 80 km downstream following the confluence with the koshi tributary annual yield 61 560 106 m3 or 12 of that of the ganga mariya et al 2019 and other urban areas including bhagalpur this is initially characterized by an increase in do so4 mg cl na and mg ca and a decrease in ca concentration within zone 4 there is also a minor shift near the ganga hooghly transition where do and ph decrease and orp increases zone 5 commencing 2700 5 km along the river and downstream of kolkata is strongly consistent with an estuariane signature with substantial increases in ec cl na sr ca cl na mg ca and cl no3 near the coast characteristic trends across all zones are shown with normalized patterns for selected parameters and for types grouping of parameters which behave similarly fig 4b c 3 3 dominant hydrogeochemical controls 3 3 1 principal component analysis principal component pc analysis was undertaken to initially screen the hydrogeochemical processes most likely to be dominant across the basin figure s4 and table s2 four components explained 94 of the variance with pc1 63 4 of variance strongly positively influenced by mg ec sr na ca no3 cl so4 ph and si consistent with dilution and mixing as major regional hydrogeochemical controls a number of samples especially from zones 1 and 2 are strongly dominated by pc1 pc2 17 9 of variance instead has strong positive loadings for ph si and ca largely consistent with controls on silicate and carbonate weathering and a negative loading for so4 which is indicative of sulfide weathering zone 1 samples trend towards the bottom left of the pc plot consistent with the lower ph and si of the upper reaches zone 4 in particularly is characterized by higher loadings of pc2 3 3 2 mixing and dilution the relationship between na and cl fig 6 a is consistent with mixing and dilution as dominant hydrogeochemical controls across the basin fresh low na low cl sources are observed in upstream reaches of zone 1 consistent with himalayan runoff bisht et al 2018 most samples are parallel to or near the equimolar line representing differing degrees of mixing between fresher sources e g near g01 and high na cl end members e g relatively polluted site g14 and estuarine site g81 and or halite dissolution the tributaries clearly have mixed inputs with the ghaghara sone gandak and koshi characterized by relatively fresh sources likely to influence mixing dilution at the confluences whereas the yamuna has relatively high na and cl concentrations potentially due to high sewage effluent inputs from the cities of new delhi ghaziabad and agra mandal et al 2010 concentrations of na in slight excess of what would be expected from halite dissolution especially at the upstream reaches are likely to derive from other water rock interactions the general trend towards higher na and cl downstream is consistent with evaporative concentration especially given consistency across parameters noted in pc1 and or cumulative inputs from halite dissolution halite dissolution has been observed to be an important process in other circum himalayan basins including the three rivers of eastern tibet noh et al 2009 although cl is commonly used in hydrological studies as a relatively conservative tracer competing processes e g mineral dissolution diffusion can also influence cl concentration introducing uncertainty in depth interpretation horner et al 2017 mcarthur et al 2012 1989 3 3 3 human environment interactions the relationship between no3 and cl is more variable fig 6b at upper reaches of zone 1 cl increases whereas no3 remains roughly constant suggesting water rock interactions e g halite dissolution increase the concentration of cl throughout the rest of the catchment no3 inputs increase approximately following the 1 1 line with cl elevated no3 concentrations are likely to arise from both urban and agricultural inputs with zone 2 and parts of zone 1 generally having the highest no3 cl ratios additional high concentrations of cl in zone 5 without a proportional increase in no3 are likely from estuarine inputs kaul and froelich jr 1984 detailed interpretation of sources and processing of nutrients in this system including with regard to land use land cover is the subject of ongoing investigation by co authors 3 3 4 water rock interactions the relationship between ca na and mg na fig 6c suggests that there are substantial contributions associated with carbonate weathering particularly in zone 1 as well as from the northerly ghaghara and gandak tributaries these geological controls suggest that sources representing the end member ratios of ca na and mg na are likely to be the dominant controls on overall major element water chemistry upstream reaches generally trend towards the calcite caco3 end member whereas the estuarine samples approach the silicate end member the ca na of himalayan silicate rocks is always 1 bickle et al 2005 and references within with an estimated granitic silicate end member of ca na 0 35 0 15 gaillardet et al 1999 consistent with the furthest downstream samples the slope of the linear regression between ca na and mg na is 3 2 0 1 slightly higher than previously reported 1 1 0 4 for the upper reaches of the basin bickle et al 2005 sr ca values fig 6d are dependant on rock type with sr ca ratios previously reported to be higher for limestones 0 22 0 02 than dolomites 0 15 0 02 in the ganga headwaters bickle et al 2005 the ratios of sr ca to ca na tend to be clustered particularly in zone 2 3 and 4 suggesting common rock types in those zones both of the cation plots ca na to mg na fig 6c and sr ca to ca na fig 6d show reasonable approximations of two component mixing of carbonate and silicate derived components and are consistent with trends previously reported bickle et al 2005 deviations from dominant two component mixing are likely to derive from additional water rock interactions related to for example evaporites phosphorites and siliceous lithologies bickle et al 2005 the downstream trends of ca are strongly in agreement with inferred hco3 with very similar breakpoints identified 1000 km downstream figure s5 consistent with trends expected from the weathering of carbonates and silicates in the middle zones where many parameters decrease significantly carbonate dissolution is likely to contribute to sustaining ca and ph resulting in the only slightly decreasing trends for these parameters sulfide weathering also appears to be an important process impacting concentrations of so4 and indeed sulfide minerals are very prevalent in the ganges brahmaputra basin fendorf et al 2010 galy and france lanord 1999 interestingly although the acidity produced by sulfide weathering may influence carbonate dissolution bufe et al 2021 the relative importance and co variation of these processes appears to be spatially dependant as ca appears to be continually produced within zone 3 even when so4 is decreasing selected important chemical reactions expected to impact the hydrogeochemistry are shown in supplementary information 3 3 5 groundwater surface water interactions groundwater has been demonstrated to substantially contribute to the water in the river ganga in addition to glacial melt and surface runoff mukherjee et al 2018 groundwater surface water interactions are largely controlled by the relative difference between river stage and groundwater level as well as regional geology with higher permeability sediments in the upper reaches of the ganga basin bonsor et al 2017 leading to increased groundwater surface water connectivity during most of the year the dominant groundwater flow direction is towards the river ganga constituting its baseflow mukherjee et al 2018 although this is expected to be strongly seasonally dependant as hydraulic gradients change with the monsoon lu et al submitted relatively high degrees of groundwater surface water connectivity are expected in the post monsoon season both for the ganga and key tributaries the observed chemical signatures are likely to thus inherently reflect this groundwater surface water continuum as well as the water rock interactions which may have influenced the composition of the contributing groundwater particularly in zones with minimal influence from tributaries e g zone 1 a strong influence from groundwater is expected to be reflected in the observed surface water signatures in particular the observed freshening of river water e g decreased ec na cl no3 so4 at the transition to zone 2 begins 1570 km which is upstream of the contributions from most of the major tributaries 1700 1800 km a further possible explanation for this is the release of stored fresh water e g monsoonal flood water from bank storage zones which are influenced both by the permeability of surrounding sediments bonsor et al 2017 as well as the depositional patterns related to the energy of the river rhodes et al 2017 the upper reaches of the ganga have a steeper elevation gradient fig 4d and are higher energy which may lead to relatively high release of bank stored water back to the river rhodes et al 2017 as compared to lower energy zones further downstream localized biogeochemical processes in the hyporheic zone may also influence chemical signatures although potential impacts are expected to be small because major patterns are reasonably explained by dominant processes including mixing dilution water rock interactions and to a lesser extent human environment interactions 3 4 representativeness of longitudinal sampling temporal and spatial representativeness can be inherent limitations in longitudinal sampling of large river systems here we have integrated a number of steps to assess and quantify sampling representativeness specific recommendations follow in section 3 5 3 4 1 short term variations the extent of short term variability e g hourly to weekly time scales in hydrogeochemical conditions has been estimated using various approaches see supplementary information and figure s6 substantial short term e g hourly shifts were observed over 15 min sampling intervals figure s6a d indicating that short term impacts can clearly be important variation in ph and t is broadly consistent with other studies of diurnal patterns in surface waters nimick et al 2011 pokrovsky and shirokova 2013 and likely reflects a combination of diurnal changes arising from natural daily shifts in temperature and associated parameters river metabolism cohen et al 2013 shifting flow regimes of water within the river and variable urban anthropogenic and other upstream inputs although short term variability may have significant impact on local biogeochemical processes the extent of temporal variability on these timescales is much less than the spatial variability observed longitudinally 3 4 2 seasonal annual variations comparison to historical data the magnitude and spatial trends in our post monsoon data show strong general agreement with historical records from india s national water quality monitoring programme nwqm central pollution control board 2019 figure s8 the relative similarity and consistency between t ph and ec across years corroborates that the major hydrogeochemical controls including concentrations of dominant inorganic ions are likely largely controlled by regional factors including hydrogeological setting and climate importantly however temporal representativeness may be parameter dependant with wider variability expected particularly for parameters associated with localized anthropogenic activities e g nutrients microplastics 3 4 3 representativeness of bank side sampling river cross sectional variability is discussed in supplementary information and figure s9 in brief the cross sectional variability is generally less than the diurnal variations and considerably less than the longitudinal variability observed 3 5 adaptability of approach and future directions although we report here a hydrogeochemical investigation across the river ganga in india our approach could easily be adapted to improve the understanding of dynamics and processes of other large river systems and or for systematic investigation of other types of parameters in large river systems which span diverse environmental conditions e g of varying geological climatic topographic and anthropogenic characteristics it is imperative to identify the dominant drivers impacting regional water quality in this case statistical analysis including segmented regression and principal component analysis allows distinct zones and key hydrogeochemical controls e g dilution mixing water rock interactions to be identified across the basin once a baseline study has been developed and implemented such as is reported here future studies could further expand the spatial and or temporal resolution and or types of parameters considered selection of appropriate methods for data analysis and interpretation are key design considerations for transferability and depend on the nature of specific research aims to our knowledge a systematic coordinated basin wide dataset for hydrogeochemical understanding of the river ganga at this large scale has not been established in india this approach creates a platform to investigate other parameters and to establish comparisons to other large river basins internationally in the future whilst large scale longitudinal surveys enable highly valuable spatial information to be obtained the limitations inherent in longitudinal surveys e g capturing complexities of localized inputs diurnal hydrogeochemical controls or seasonal variability must be considered recommendations to address mitigate and or quantify the impact of some of these inherent limitations whilst undertaking a large scale longitudinal survey include i conduct sampling ideally at the same time of day to mitigate the impact of diurnal variability although this is not always feasible in studies across large river systems ii undertake systematic time series sampling throughout an entire day ideally both at urban and rural locations to quantify the extent of diurnal variability iii undertake supplementary cross sectional surveys at selected key locations including near the extreme ends of longitudinal surveys noting potential logistical constraints such as practicalities of small boat access in a busy shipping transport hub such as kolkata iv compare data to historical records to assist in contextualizing annual representativeness v repeat longitudinal sampling of all or selected sites in contrasting flow conditions e g post and pre monsoonal conditions to understand how underpinning hydrogeochemical processes may change throughout the year whilst many of these measures were integrated in our study here it would be a recommended target for future work to repeat a similar longitudinal survey in the ganga basin under relatively low flow conditions to expand temporal resolution of the dataset 4 conclusions here we develop and apply a systematic approach for advancing understanding of hydrogeochemical dynamics and processes in large river systems as demonstrated via a longitudinal survey 2500 km of the river ganga and key tributaries from the himalayas to the bay of bengal the application of our framework evidences that overall the lower reaches of the basin are characterized by higher t ph ec and concentrations of ca mg sr si na cl and no3 and lower do and so4 which is largely consistent with expected cumulative downstream inputs arising from both water rock interactions and human environment interactions over 1000s of kilometres although there are localized inputs in some cases regional controls are likely dominant for most of these parameters on a basin wide scale segmented regression enables the identification of estimated downstream breakpoints and five associated hydrogeochemical zones the framework has been used to reveal that mixing and dilution are the most important hydrogeochemical controls across the basin as well as carbonate and silicate weathering strongly influencing the major element composition of surface water the magnitude and spatial trends in our data are generally in strong agreement with historical governmental records this agreement suggests that the major hydrogeochemical controls are largely controlled by regional factors e g hydrogeological setting although annual representativeness may not extend to all water quality parameters especially those directly related to anthropogenic activities the magnitude of short term temporal variability in water quality parameters was found to be less than their longitudinal diversity selected cross sectional surveys indicated some cross channel variability particularly near tributary inputs likely attributed to differences in stream depth flow and mixing rigorous interpretation of our results applying our framework to the river ganga allows limitations of large scale longitudinal sampling programs to be identified including for instance challenges in assessing localized inputs and temporal seasonal controls along with some strategies to mitigate these impacts in addition to providing new insight to the dominant hydrogeochemical processes impacting surface water composition in the river ganga our systematic approach is adaptable to other parameters and or similar coordinated surveys of other large river systems across the

16333,general resilience addresses the resilience of a water system to any threat including unknowns in contrast to specified resilience to individual identified threats however quantification of general resilience is challenging and previous assessments have typically been qualitative or based on system properties that are assumed to be indicative of resilient performance here we present a general resilience assessment methodology gram which uses a middle state based approach to decompose general resilience into contributing components to provide a quantitative and performance based resilience assessment gram enables the accounting of the effects of any threat if all modes of system failure are identifiable it is applied to an integrated urban wastewater system where five interventions are explored the results obtained show that whilst substantial improvements in specified resilience are achieved increasing the general resilience of the system is challenging however general resilience analysis enables identification of system failure modes to which level of service is least resilient and highlights key opportunities for intervention development gram is beneficial as it can inform the development of interventions to increase the resilience of a system to unknowns such as unforeseeable natural hazards in a quantifiable manner graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adaptation general resilience middle state specified resilience urban wastewater system 1 introduction water systems have traditionally been designed to achieve a high level of reliability i e to minimise failure frequency this however has become more challenging due to increasing threats such as natural disasters and climate change a threat is defined here as an event which can potentially reduce the level of system service and is equivalent to a wide variety of other terms used in literature including hazard driver perturbation disturbance shock and crisis a paradigm shift from reliability to resilience is required for water management butler et al 2017 the concept of resilience has received much attention since the seminal work of holling 1973 and is becoming increasingly common in practice both in the water industry e g ofwat 2015 usepa 2021 and more widely e g australian government 2010 government of canada 2013 iwa 2021 the term is used in a range of fields from ecology to engineering holling 1996 and has many subtly different definitions francis and bekera 2014 however it is typically used in reference to a system s recovery from failure and is defined as the degree to which the system minimises level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional conditions by butler et al 2017 resilience may also be classified as either specified or general depending on the threat s to which resilience is being considered specified resilience is the resilience of some particular part of a system to one or more identified kinds of shocks whereas general resilience is the resilience of any and all parts of a system to all kinds of shocks including novel ones folke et al 2010 building general resilience is important since not all possible threats are foreseeable and it is desirable to minimise the magnitude and duration of failure should unanticipated threats occur existing quantitative assessment methodologies typically address specified resilience in response to only a limited number of threats of a specified magnitude e g liu et al 2012 vugrin et al 2011 for example the resilience of an urban wastewater system is assessed considering extreme rainfall wang et al 2019 leandro et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 climate change and urbanisation salerno et al 2018 and shock loading sukias et al 2018 even frameworks which claim to account for uncertainties only consider identifiable threats francis and bekera 2014 as such they only provide a measure of specified resilience and do not address all kinds of shocks including novel ones as required for general resilience however as has been evidenced with events such as the 2005 new orleans floods the 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster and the current covid 19 pandemic unanticipated magnitudes of threats can have devastating impact the effects of such threats may be reduced by building general resilience but if the concept of general resilience is to be operationalised it is important that it can be quantified whilst specified resilience contributes to general resilience woolley 2014 there are also trade offs between the two types walker and salt 2012 and increasing resilience to a specific threat may be detrimental to general resilience cork 2011 it is important therefore that specified resilience is not considered in isolation and assessment of general resilience is included in the evaluation of interventions assessment of general resilience is difficult indeed it has been suggested impossible walker and salt 2006 due to the need to consider the response to unknown threats and building resilience to these unknown threats is a recognised challenge carpenter et al 2012 labaka et al 2016 past studies which address unknown or unspecified threats have typically been qualitative or based on system properties that are assumed to be indicative of resilience e g labaka et al 2015 shirali et al 2013 yazdani et al 2011 some system attributes can provide resilience to a range of shocks o connell et al 2015 and assessment frameworks may recommend consideration of properties such as diversity modularity and social capital cork 2011 increasing redundancy is also often considered a means by which resilience can be increased bruneau et al 2003 however it is important to distinguish between properties and performance since specific properties such as these do not guarantee resilient performance meng et al 2018 performance based methods can help move the focus from the threats to the system process itself and provide an insight into system properties that contribute to improving system resilience progress may be made with a middle state based resilience assessment diao et al 2016 mugume et al 2015 which is performance based and investigates the system response to a given system failure mode rather than a specific threat to date this has only been applied in the case of specified resilience diao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 but its potential for use in assessment of general resilience is clear as knowledge of the threat s causing system failure which may be unknown is not required the global resilience analysis gra methodology mugume et al 2015 which has so far only been applied to the concept of specified resilience may also be useful in assessment of general resilience since it enables a range of event magnitudes to be accounted for including those that are considered highly unlikely and cannot be assigned a probability this paper aims to provide a general resilience assessment methodology gram for performance assessment of water systems taking into account the effects of unknown threats and demonstrate how this may be used to guide the development of resilience enhancing interventions gra a middle state based assessment approach applies a stress strain test to assess the response curve to a specific system failure gram decomposes general resilience into multiple combinations of specified resilience each of which is assessed using gra to provide a quantitative and performance based resilience assessment sweetapple et al 2018 gram provides an entirely new methodological approach and in principle may be applied to any system subject to threats however the better characterised the system the better the evaluation of general resilience will be using an integrated urban wastewater system iuws case study it is shown that multiple implementations of a middle state based gra can address the effects of any threat on level of service provision if all system failure modes are identifiable and provide a picture of its general resilience the general resilience components can then be analysed to identify threats or threat combinations to which the iuws level of service provision is least resilient thereby highlighting key opportunities and priority areas for interventions to increase general resilience a detailed analysis of any potential interventions also ensures that any inadvertent negative effects on specified resilience are not overlooked 2 general resilience assessment 2 1 middle state approach general resilience does not define the part of the system that might fail nor the type of threats which the system must endure folke et al 2010 assessment of general resilience must therefore address the response of any part of the system to any threat in this form it cannot be calculated since not all threats can be identified however for any threat known or unknown to have an impact on level of service that a water system provides it must first result in abnormal system states referred to as abnormal middle states these occur as a result of threats and represent all the potential modes of failure for a given system system failure can be categorized as 1 mechanical structural such as sewer blockage pump failure and sensor failure and 2 hydraulic functional failure such as increased influent flow the safe and sure framework butler et al 2017 describes how threats lead to system failures system failures lead to level of service impacts and level of service impacts lead to societal economic and environmental consequences in general engineering systems are better known characterised and understood than threats therefore it is more feasible to identify all the ways in which they might fail than to identify all the threats that may cause failure considering a closed system all system failure modes can theoretically be identified whether they result from a known or unknown threat is irrelevant therefore if resilience of a water system is rephrased as resilience of a water system to any system failure it encompasses the response to all threats known and unknown and yet does not require knowledge of unknowns this approach is a form of middle state based analysis if all system failure modes can be identified and the effects of these on level of service be modelled then the general resilience can be calculated through evaluations of individual failure modes and their combinations each of which provides a component of general resilience multiple system failures may occur simultaneously and the combined effects of two or more events may be greater than when they occur independently park et al 2013 therefore as well as considering resilience to each system failure mode individually resilience to every possible combination of failure modes must contribute to assessment of general resilience this concept is illustrated in fig 1 which shows all the components of general resilience for a simple closed system with three failure modes and one level of service measure knowledge of the threats known or unknown that result in each system failure mode is not required human error a threat for example may have an effect on level of service but this is indirect human error may result in one or more of the identified system failure modes which in turn may result in a level of service impact since system failure modes can be identified without knowledge of what causes them it is not necessary to know the specific details of every possible human error this simple example has just seven general resilience components however real systems are much more complex and contain many more modes of failure the total number of system failure mode combinations to which resilience must be evaluated c is given by 1 c r 1 n n r n r where n is the total number of system failure modes the number of general resilience components increases exponentially as the number of failure modes increases for a system with ten failure modes for example the effects of 1023 different system failure mode combinations on level of service provision must be evaluated if a comprehensive assessment of general resilience is to be made for 20 failure modes this increases to 1048 575 resilience to each type of system failure or combination of failures may be evaluated using gra diao et al 2016 mugume et al 2015 gra accounts for the effects of a range of event threat or system failure magnitudes and durations rather than a single event with pre defined characteristics and has previously been used in assessment of resilience to a single specified threat or system failure mode multiple applications of the gra methodology enable every magnitude duration of every combination of system failure modes to be addressed for quantification of general resilience in this application of gra the system failure mode is considered as a type of stress and the impact on level of service resulting from a given stress magnitude a strain pipe failure for example may be considered a failure mode stress and the stress magnitude may vary from 0 no pipes failed to 100 all pipes failed this stress strain concept enables response curves of the form shown in fig 2 to be developed for each stress or stress combination and for each level of service measure the area under each curve may be considered an indicator of the specified resilience to the relevant stress with a smaller area denoting greater resilience for example the response curves in fig 2 show that the level of service provision is more resilient to failure mode b than a in the example given there are few enough response curves that individual analysis of each is feasible however in a more complex system with several thousand if not more stress combinations to consider this is not practical a method by which general resilience can be quantified without reporting every component is needed we propose that the maximum strain resulting from each stress magnitude is selected to produce a maximum response curve this may incorporate multiple response curves in fig 2 for example simultaneous application of stresses a and b results in the greatest strain at low stress magnitudes whereas application of all three stresses produces the greatest strain at high stress magnitudes the area under this maximum response curve shown in grey provides a quantitative measure of general resilience and can be improved by targeting the stress combinations which contribute to it however using any single indicator to represent general resilience will masque a lot of detail inevitably given the large number of contributing components and additional information will be required to inform the development and assessment of resilience enhancing interventions furthermore the shape of the maximum response curve generated is dependant on the system specific failure modes identified and the corresponding stress durations and magnitudes assumed in the analysis if not all system failure modes are identified then this approach will provide only a partial representation of general resilience 2 2 general resilience assessment methodology gram based on the general resilience assessment concept discussed in section 2 1 the detailed methodology is as follows 1 identify all potential system failure modes for example pipe failure or pump failure these represent stresses on the system 2 determine a measure of magnitude for each stress and range of stress magnitudes to which resilience should be assessed for pipe failure for example the percentage of pipes failed may represent the stress magnitude and the magnitude can range from 0 to 100 3 identify all possible combinations of stresses to which the system may be subject and to which resilience must be evaluated for example just pipe failure just pump failure or simultaneous pipe and pump failures for a system with n potential failure modes this includes every combination of 1 to n stresses yielding a total of c combinations as in eq 1 4 identify all level of service measures for the system for example water pressure and water quality indicators these represent types of strain 5 determine acceptable level of service limits i e requirements which if not met represent a level of service failure 6 specify the number of model evaluations r to be used to estimate each response curve a higher value yields higher resolution response curves but will also increase computational demand 7 calculate every point on the response curves for the first combination of stresses as follows a simulate system performance when no system failures are present i e every stress magnitude equals zero record failure magnitude and duration for every level of service measure these are measures of each type of strain resulting from a stress magnitude of zero and each contributes to a different response curve the assessment of no system failures is used to determine the starting point of each system performance curve b for i 1 r simulate system performance when the magnitude of every system failure present in the first set of stresses is set to i r 1 times the corresponding maximum stress magnitude all other stresses are set to zero record failure magnitude and duration for every level of service measure these are the strains resulting from a normalised stress magnitude of i r 1 c plot response curves using the strain and normalised stress values from steps 7a b 8 repeat step 7 for stress combinations 2 c 9 calculate maximum strain values resulting from each stress magnitude in each set of response curves i e maximum level of service failure magnitude and duration resulting from any combination of stresses of a given magnitude this gives the maximum response curve the area under which provides an indicator for general resilience 3 case study integrated urban wastewater system the case study is a well characterised iuws which was first presented by schütze et al 2002 and has since been the subject of much research e g astaraie imani et al 2012 butler and schutze 2005 casal campos et al 2015 fu et al 2008 2009 zacharof et al 2004 this is modelled using simba6 0 ifak 2009 which operates in the matlab simulink environment whilst simba6 0 is fit for purpose in this study newer simba versions or other software tools could also be used a schematic diagram is given in fig 3 the iuws consists of a combined sewer system a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and a receiving river the sewer system contains seven sub catchments and four on line pass through storage tanks tanks 2 4 6 and 7 the catchments are simulated using a hydrologic approach with surface and sewer network flows modelled conceptually as linear cascades of reservoirs nash cascade model nash 1959 the wwtp has an off line pass through storm tank at the inlet and contains a primary clarifier an activated sludge reactor for biological treatment modelled with asm1 henze et al 2000 and a secondary clarifier modelled as detailed by lessard and beck 1993 two pumps are modelled in the wwtp designated pump 2 and pump 4 the wwtp effluent and combined sewer overflows csos discharge into a river of which 45 km is modelled performance is evaluated over a five day period which incorporates a rainfall event with a total depth of 27 mm during this time stresses are applied as detailed in section 3 1 and dynamic outputs are recorded as necessary to calculate the performance measures detailed in section 3 2 3 1 failure modes and stresses in order to calculate every component of general resilience using a middle state based approach it is necessary to identify every way in which the system might fail analysis of the model structure suggests 14 potential failure modes as detailed in table 1 further failure modes may exist but these represent all those that can feasibly be included given the model capabilities and limitations any omissions will imply that there are additional components of general resilience that have not been evaluated however the list in table 1 is sufficient to demonstrate application of the general resilience assessment methodology and provide insight into key opportunities for resilience enhancement in the system should further failure modes be identified these may be added to apply the system failures of the types listed in table 1 it is necessary to decide not only how their magnitude can be varied but also at what time and for how long each stress should be applied given that general resilience assessment requires simultaneous application of multiple stresses and each stress must be applied in a comparable manner all stresses when applied are assumed to occur throughout the entire simulation period i e recovery of the system due to intervention such as replacement or mending of a failed component is not considered this does not mean however that any level of service failure resulting from the system failure also lasts the entire simulation duration since recovery may be observed as the simulated storm event recedes for mechanical failure modes percentage loss of function represents the stress magnitude in each case loss of function in the range 0 to 100 is modelled thereby covering the full range of possibilities hydraulic failure modes identified relate to changes in the sewer influent characteristics and a maximum theoretically possible increase cannot typically be determined the exception here is the percentage increase in vss ss and scod cod ratios for which a maximum stress magnitude is selected so as to provide a maximum ratio of one other upper limits are arbitrarily set to a 100 increase with respect to the base case for the purposes of preliminary analysis but further investigation could explore the effects of extending these limits full details of the stress magnitude measures and ranges for each failure mode are provided in table 1 3 2 level of service measures and strains receiving water dissolved oxygen do and un ionised ammonia amm concentrations represent the iuws level of service measures only total ammonia is modelled dynamically in simba however the toxicity of ammonia is attributed predominantly to the un ionised component johnson et al 2007 un ionised ammonia therefore is estimated using a conversion factor of 0 0195 based on a temperature of 20 c and a ph of 7 7 schütze et al 2002 a minimum do concentration of 4 mg l dolim and a maximum amm concentration of 0 068 mg l ammlim are required to provide an acceptable level of service this do limit is commonly used in integrated urban wastewater system studies e g astaraie imani et al 2012 and is equal to the one year return period one hour limit for salmonid waters defra 2014 the amm limit is the recommended predicted no effect concentration for freshwater based on the 96 hour median lethal concentration for pink salmon johnson et al 2007 failure to comply with either of these limits constitutes a level of service failure given that resilience relates to level of service failure magnitude and duration the following measures of strain are used 2 n o r m a l i s e d d o f a i l u r e m a g n i t u d e max 0 d o l i m d o m i n d o l i m 3 n o r m a l i s e d d o f a i l u r e d u r a t i o n t r d o t f d o t t o t a l 4 n o r m a l i s e d a m m f a i l u r e m

the evaluation period ammmax the maximum un ionised ammonia concentration tf do and tf amm the times at which do and amm failures commence tr do and tr amm the times at which do and amm recovery occur and ttotal the total evaluation period duration note that both failure magnitudes are normalised with respect to their corresponding failure limits and in the case of amm this may result in normalised values in excess of 1 to account for differing do and amm concentrations along the course of the river these strain measures are calculated for 40 locations along the modelled stretch and the worst i e maximum values used for resilience assessment 4 general resilience results and discussion the 14 failure modes identified yield 16 383 combinations of stresses to which the system may be subjected and therefore 16 383 response curves for each measure of strain these are shown in fig 4 and represent the components of general resilience some stresses or stress combinations are shown to have negligible effect on do or amm failure magnitude or duration eqs 2 5 and there are even examples in which the do failure magnitude initially decreases as the stress magnitude increases in such instances stress combinations all include failure of one or more of the tank outflow pumps stresses j m thereby resulting in an increase in cso discharges from the corresponding catchments it is known that a reduction in csos does not guarantee improved receiving water quality lau et al 2002 rauch and harremoes 1999 and it is suggested these csos may result in greater dilution of unavoidable untreated wastewater discharges by distributing them along the river thereby reducing the maximum do failure magnitude increased cso discharges may also reduce the hydraulic load on the wwtp resulting in an improved effluent quality and smaller impact on receiving water quality at the discharge point of the wwtp as the stress magnitude increases further however the failure magnitudes resulting from these stress combinations are amongst the worst this highlights the importance of considering not just the low stress levels but also the high stress levels since their effects on failure magnitude and duration might be contradictory as shown by do magnitude in fig 4 i e improved performance under low magnitudes of a given stress combination but worsened performance under high magnitudes of the same stresses fig 4 also shows that the magnitude and duration of level of service failure resulting from a given stress magnitude can vary significantly depending on the stress or stresses applied under the maximum stress magnitude for example normalised do failure magnitudes in the range 0 44 0 97 equivalent to minimum do concentrations of 0 1 2 2 mg l are observed this shows that if only a few failure modes which are perceived to be important are considered as in a typical specified resilience assessment then only a small part of the picture is obtained and scenarios to which level of service is least resilient may be overlooked analysis of every potential failure scenario is vital to determine the complete range of the possible level of service impacts resulting from any threat known or unknown it is also found that the stress combination resulting in the worst response is not easily predictable it may be assumed that this would be simultaneous occurrence of every system failure mode but this is not the case this is shown clearly in fig 5 in which the maximum levels of service failure magnitudes and durations i e the greater of the do metric and the amm metric resulting from application of a one stress green curve b all 14 stresses red curve and c any combination of 2 13 stresses blue curve are plotted fig 5 shows that modelling all 14 system failure modes stresses simultaneously provides a good approximation of the worst case response under relatively small stress magnitudes up to approximately 0 4 however application of fewer stresses can result in greater level of service failure magnitude and or duration this is particularly evident at high stress magnitudes where applying every stress results in a normalised failure magnitude of 2 88 equivalent to a maximum amm concentration of 15 5 mg l but removal of four stresses a g k and m increases the maximum level of service failure magnitude to 3 78 this may be attributed to a reduction in upstream cso discharges resulting in either greater wwtp bypass or poorer wwtp performance fig 5 shows multiple system failure modes occurring simultaneously i e the two top lines blue and red can result in significantly greater level of service failure magnitude and duration than a single system failure i e the bottom line this again highlights the need to consider more than just individual system failure modes in resilience assessment the area under the maximum response curves shown in fig 5 or fig 4 provides a quantitative measure of general resilience this is system specific and may not be suitable for comparing substantially different systems with different failure modes and level of service measures however such resilience indicators may be used to provide a quantitative basis by which resilience enhancing interventions for a given system may be evaluated and compared use of general resilience assessment to guide the development of interventions is discussed further in section 5 5 interventions development and evaluation 5 1 priority level of service measures analysis of the failure duration response curves in fig 4 suggests that in a general sense the receiving water do is less resilient than the amm since the area under the maximum response curve is greater 0 62 compared with 0 49 on the basis of level of service failure magnitude amm appears to be less resilient however no firm conclusions can be drawn since the units of magnitude differ for amm and do and are not comparable increasing the do performance under zero stress conditions is also shown to be very important since level of service failures occur even when the system is fully functional i e stress magnitude 0 this suggests that the top priority for interventions is to reduce both the occurrence and duration of do failures however the effects of any interventions on amm should not be overlooked since they may not necessarily be favourable 5 2 priority failure modes analysis of the general resilience components can yield knowledge of the system failure modes to which level of service provision is least resilient and inform targeted development of interventions to enhance general resilience fig 6 shows the prevalence of each system failure mode in the stress combinations resulting in the 500 worst response curves in fig 4 i e stress combinations to which level of service provision is least resilient based on do and amm failure magnitude and duration this demonstrates that an increase in the sewer influent flow a is present in all the stress combinations to which the do and amm levels of service are least resilient suggesting that interventions to minimise any influent increases and or reduce the effects of increased influent flow on receiving water quality would be highly beneficial failure of the activated sludge aeration n is also key in terms of its effects on amm failure magnitude and duration and increased sewer influent cod d failure of pumping to the primary clarifier g and failure of the primary clarifier i are shown to be significant in terms of their effects on at least one measure of level of service strain fig 6 also enables low priority failure modes to be identified failure of the tank 7 outflow pump m for example is present in few of the stress combinations resulting in the worst effects on level of service suggesting that interventions should be focussed elsewhere if they are to provide the greatest improvement in general resilience 5 3 interventions interventions employed to enhance resilience may be classified as mitigation adaptation coping or learning assessment of general resilience using a middle state based approach as in this study captures the effects of adaptation measures actions taken to modify specific properties of the water system to enhance its capability to maintain levels of service under varying conditions butler et al 2017 specific threats and consequences are not identified and the effects of mitigation which addresses threats and coping which addresses consequences on general resilience cannot therefore be quantitatively assessed multiple potential interventions for evaluation may be developed using expert engineering knowledge and taking into account the priority level of service measures and failure modes identified in sections 5 1 and 5 2 in this study the following interventions are proposed intervention 1 increase attenuation in the catchments modelled by increasing the number of reservoirs used in hydrological modelling from 3 5 this aims to address increased sewer influent flow intervention 2 increase the maximum outflow of the storm tank preceding the wwtp tank 7 by a factor of two this aims to increase the volume of wastewater treated thereby addressing increased sewer influent flow and reducing receiving water do and amm failures intervention 3 increase capacity of the storm tank preceding the wwtp tank 7 by 200 this aims to address increased sewer influent flow intervention 4 increase activated sludge aeration tank volume by 10 this aims to increase treatment capacity and minimise the effects of increased sewer influent flow intervention 5 increase the wwtp storm tank volume by 50 this aims to provide additional storage in the case of failure of pump 2 to the primary clarifier and will also address increased sewer influent flow note that any interventions which add system components or control structures would increase the number of potential system failure modes thereby exponentially increasing the number of general resilience components and further complicating the assessment process for simplicity the interventions suggested here only consider alterations to the existing infrastructure components and control and the expected benefits are relatively small however greater improvements may be achievable with more complex interventions 5 4 interventions evaluation and discussion it is not feasible to re evaluate every component of general resilience for each intervention due to the large number of simulations required and the high computational demand as a screening process initially just the resilience to each system failure mode occurring individually is calculated for every intervention these results are shown in fig 7 where each number presented is the area under the corresponding response curve and a lower value i e closer to the centre represents greater specified resilience interventions 1 4 and 5 show no negative effects in terms of resilience to individual system failures although there will clearly be cost implications and could be considered further in the development of options to increase general resilience however improvements in specified resilience are also negligible suggesting that greater improvement in general resilience may be obtained with alternative interventions intervention 3 provides negligible improvement in resilience to any individual system failure and is detrimental to the amm response to increased sewer influent flow a and failure of the tank 7 outflow pump m this is not considered a good candidate for further analysis and refinement therefore only intervention 2 provides substantial improvements in specified resilience and the greatest improvements are in the do failure magnitude responses with a mean reduction in area under response curves of 28 the resilience of the receiving water do to every system failure mode when applied individually is improved with respect to the base case however there are still trade offs to consider it is recognised that building resilience in one area may reduce resilience in another miller et al 2010 and this is evidenced with a very small reduction in amm resilience to increased influent flow a given that receiving water do was identified as a priority level of service measure section 5 1 and significant improvements in this respect are provided by intervention 2 further analysis of this intervention is undertaken to determine its effects on general resilience decision makers must be aware of the potential increase in amm failure magnitude and duration however these remain less than the do failure magnitude and duration under individual system failures fig 8 shows the effects of implementing intervention 2 on the worst 500 response curves for each measure of strain the most notable improvement is in do failure magnitude which is reduced by up to 38 under low stress magnitudes although the mean area under the response curves is only reduced by 5 3 the effects on other stress strain relationships as summarised in table 2 are small an improvement is achieved with respect to do failure duration with both the mean and maximum area under the set of response curves reduced however this intervention is a little detrimental to the general resilience of the receiving water amm since an increase in the mean amm failure magnitude response curve and maximum amm failure duration response curve areas is observed ultimately these results show that intervention 2 is on balance beneficial to general resilience as it provides an improvement in most indicators however they also confirm the existence of trade offs as suggested by walker and salt 2012 and indicate that improvement in general resilience is difficult to achieve further and more universal improvements in general resilience may be achievable with more complex interventions but these are more challenging to evaluate and likely to incur greater expense still this case study successfully demonstrates that the gram approach may be applied to the development of interventions and can highlight potentially negative effects of measures which enhance specified resilience 6 conclusions quantifying general resilience is challenging due to the existence of unknown threats however this paper explores the general resilience of an iuws using a newly developed assessment methodology gram and demonstrates that the results may guide development of interventions to enhance general resilience key conclusions drawn include using a middle state based approach the potential effects on level of service resulting from any threat known or unknown may be determined without knowledge of unknowns if all system failure modes can be identified and modelled general resilience can be decomposed into its multiple contributing components each of which may be calculated individually using global resilience analysis combined these provide a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the general resilience of the iuws the maximum response curve derived using global resilience analysis for each combination of system failure modes represents general resilience efforts to increase general resilience should target system failure modes which contribute to this maximum response curve and in the case study increased sewer influent flow and failure of the activated sludge aeration are shown to be key assessment of specified resilience of an iuws is likely to overlook some failure scenarios to which level of service provision is least resilient it is essential that simultaneous occurrence of multiple system failure modes is considered since this can result in significantly greater level of service failure magnitude and duration than any individual failure it is also important that different combinations are considered since simultaneous occurrence of every failure does not necessarily result in the worst response general resilience cannot be estimated by calculating the response to failure of every system component simultaneously analysis of the components of general resilience enables identification of priority level of service measures and priority system failure modes thereby providing an informed starting point for the development of interventions to enhance general resilience based on the assessment results of interventions whilst substantial improvement in specified resilience may be achieved with relative ease however achieving significant improvement in the general resilience of an iuws is challenging although a holistic picture of the general resilience of the iuws is useful it requires a significantly large amount of model simulations even with the newly developed gram it should be noted that the computer model is assumed to be able to represent various failure scenarios and intervention measures in this study but developing such a model might be challenging in practice due to resources and data required as with any model based analysis confidence in the results of gram for assessment of a real system is dependant on the representativeness and accuracy of the corresponding model declaration of competing interest we

16333,general resilience addresses the resilience of a water system to any threat including unknowns in contrast to specified resilience to individual identified threats however quantification of general resilience is challenging and previous assessments have typically been qualitative or based on system properties that are assumed to be indicative of resilient performance here we present a general resilience assessment methodology gram which uses a middle state based approach to decompose general resilience into contributing components to provide a quantitative and performance based resilience assessment gram enables the accounting of the effects of any threat if all modes of system failure are identifiable it is applied to an integrated urban wastewater system where five interventions are explored the results obtained show that whilst substantial improvements in specified resilience are achieved increasing the general resilience of the system is challenging however general resilience analysis enables identification of system failure modes to which level of service is least resilient and highlights key opportunities for intervention development gram is beneficial as it can inform the development of interventions to increase the resilience of a system to unknowns such as unforeseeable natural hazards in a quantifiable manner graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords adaptation general resilience middle state specified resilience urban wastewater system 1 introduction water systems have traditionally been designed to achieve a high level of reliability i e to minimise failure frequency this however has become more challenging due to increasing threats such as natural disasters and climate change a threat is defined here as an event which can potentially reduce the level of system service and is equivalent to a wide variety of other terms used in literature including hazard driver perturbation disturbance shock and crisis a paradigm shift from reliability to resilience is required for water management butler et al 2017 the concept of resilience has received much attention since the seminal work of holling 1973 and is becoming increasingly common in practice both in the water industry e g ofwat 2015 usepa 2021 and more widely e g australian government 2010 government of canada 2013 iwa 2021 the term is used in a range of fields from ecology to engineering holling 1996 and has many subtly different definitions francis and bekera 2014 however it is typically used in reference to a system s recovery from failure and is defined as the degree to which the system minimises level of service failure magnitude and duration over its design life when subject to exceptional conditions by butler et al 2017 resilience may also be classified as either specified or general depending on the threat s to which resilience is being considered specified resilience is the resilience of some particular part of a system to one or more identified kinds of shocks whereas general resilience is the resilience of any and all parts of a system to all kinds of shocks including novel ones folke et al 2010 building general resilience is important since not all possible threats are foreseeable and it is desirable to minimise the magnitude and duration of failure should unanticipated threats occur existing quantitative assessment methodologies typically address specified resilience in response to only a limited number of threats of a specified magnitude e g liu et al 2012 vugrin et al 2011 for example the resilience of an urban wastewater system is assessed considering extreme rainfall wang et al 2019 leandro et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 climate change and urbanisation salerno et al 2018 and shock loading sukias et al 2018 even frameworks which claim to account for uncertainties only consider identifiable threats francis and bekera 2014 as such they only provide a measure of specified resilience and do not address all kinds of shocks including novel ones as required for general resilience however as has been evidenced with events such as the 2005 new orleans floods the 2011 fukushima nuclear disaster and the current covid 19 pandemic unanticipated magnitudes of threats can have devastating impact the effects of such threats may be reduced by building general resilience but if the concept of general resilience is to be operationalised it is important that it can be quantified whilst specified resilience contributes to general resilience woolley 2014 there are also trade offs between the two types walker and salt 2012 and increasing resilience to a specific threat may be detrimental to general resilience cork 2011 it is important therefore that specified resilience is not considered in isolation and assessment of general resilience is included in the evaluation of interventions assessment of general resilience is difficult indeed it has been suggested impossible walker and salt 2006 due to the need to consider the response to unknown threats and building resilience to these unknown threats is a recognised challenge carpenter et al 2012 labaka et al 2016 past studies which address unknown or unspecified threats have typically been qualitative or based on system properties that are assumed to be indicative of resilience e g labaka et al 2015 shirali et al 2013 yazdani et al 2011 some system attributes can provide resilience to a range of shocks o connell et al 2015 and assessment frameworks may recommend consideration of properties such as diversity modularity and social capital cork 2011 increasing redundancy is also often considered a means by which resilience can be increased bruneau et al 2003 however it is important to distinguish between properties and performance since specific properties such as these do not guarantee resilient performance meng et al 2018 performance based methods can help move the focus from the threats to the system process itself and provide an insight into system properties that contribute to improving system resilience progress may be made with a middle state based resilience assessment diao et al 2016 mugume et al 2015 which is performance based and investigates the system response to a given system failure mode rather than a specific threat to date this has only been applied in the case of specified resilience diao et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 but its potential for use in assessment of general resilience is clear as knowledge of the threat s causing system failure which may be unknown is not required the global resilience analysis gra methodology mugume et al 2015 which has so far only been applied to the concept of specified resilience may also be useful in assessment of general resilience since it enables a range of event magnitudes to be accounted for including those that are considered highly unlikely and cannot be assigned a probability this paper aims to provide a general resilience assessment methodology gram for performance assessment of water systems taking into account the effects of unknown threats and demonstrate how this may be used to guide the development of resilience enhancing interventions gra a middle state based assessment approach applies a stress strain test to assess the response curve to a specific system failure gram decomposes general resilience into multiple combinations of specified resilience each of which is assessed using gra to provide a quantitative and performance based resilience assessment sweetapple et al 2018 gram provides an entirely new methodological approach and in principle may be applied to any system subject to threats however the better characterised the system the better the evaluation of general resilience will be using an integrated urban wastewater system iuws case study it is shown that multiple implementations of a middle state based gra can address the effects of any threat on level of service provision if all system failure modes are identifiable and provide a picture of its general resilience the general resilience components can then be analysed to identify threats or threat combinations to which the iuws level of service provision is least resilient thereby highlighting key opportunities and priority areas for interventions to increase general resilience a detailed analysis of any potential interventions also ensures that any inadvertent negative effects on specified resilience are not overlooked 2 general resilience assessment 2 1 middle state approach general resilience does not define the part of the system that might fail nor the type of threats which the system must endure folke et al 2010 assessment of general resilience must therefore address the response of any part of the system to any threat in this form it cannot be calculated since not all threats can be identified however for any threat known or unknown to have an impact on level of service that a water system provides it must first result in abnormal system states referred to as abnormal middle states these occur as a result of threats and represent all the potential modes of failure for a given system system failure can be categorized as 1 mechanical structural such as sewer blockage pump failure and sensor failure and 2 hydraulic functional failure such as increased influent flow the safe and sure framework butler et al 2017 describes how threats lead to system failures system failures lead to level of service impacts and level of service impacts lead to societal economic and environmental consequences in general engineering systems are better known characterised and understood than threats therefore it is more feasible to identify all the ways in which they might fail than to identify all the threats that may cause failure considering a closed system all system failure modes can theoretically be identified whether they result from a known or unknown threat is irrelevant therefore if resilience of a water system is rephrased as resilience of a water system to any system failure it encompasses the response to all threats known and unknown and yet does not require knowledge of unknowns this approach is a form of middle state based analysis if all system failure modes can be identified and the effects of these on level of service be modelled then the general resilience can be calculated through evaluations of individual failure modes and their combinations each of which provides a component of general resilience multiple system failures may occur simultaneously and the combined effects of two or more events may be greater than when they occur independently park et al 2013 therefore as well as considering resilience to each system failure mode individually resilience to every possible combination of failure modes must contribute to assessment of general resilience this concept is illustrated in fig 1 which shows all the components of general resilience for a simple closed system with three failure modes and one level of service measure knowledge of the threats known or unknown that result in each system failure mode is not required human error a threat for example may have an effect on level of service but this is indirect human error may result in one or more of the identified system failure modes which in turn may result in a level of service impact since system failure modes can be identified without knowledge of what causes them it is not necessary to know the specific details of every possible human error this simple example has just seven general resilience components however real systems are much more complex and contain many more modes of failure the total number of system failure mode combinations to which resilience must be evaluated c is given by 1 c r 1 n n r n r where n is the total number of system failure modes the number of general resilience components increases exponentially as the number of failure modes increases for a system with ten failure modes for example the effects of 1023 different system failure mode combinations on level of service provision must be evaluated if a comprehensive assessment of general resilience is to be made for 20 failure modes this increases to 1048 575 resilience to each type of system failure or combination of failures may be evaluated using gra diao et al 2016 mugume et al 2015 gra accounts for the effects of a range of event threat or system failure magnitudes and durations rather than a single event with pre defined characteristics and has previously been used in assessment of resilience to a single specified threat or system failure mode multiple applications of the gra methodology enable every magnitude duration of every combination of system failure modes to be addressed for quantification of general resilience in this application of gra the system failure mode is considered as a type of stress and the impact on level of service resulting from a given stress magnitude a strain pipe failure for example may be considered a failure mode stress and the stress magnitude may vary from 0 no pipes failed to 100 all pipes failed this stress strain concept enables response curves of the form shown in fig 2 to be developed for each stress or stress combination and for each level of service measure the area under each curve may be considered an indicator of the specified resilience to the relevant stress with a smaller area denoting greater resilience for example the response curves in fig 2 show that the level of service provision is more resilient to failure mode b than a in the example given there are few enough response curves that individual analysis of each is feasible however in a more complex system with several thousand if not more stress combinations to consider this is not practical a method by which general resilience can be quantified without reporting every component is needed we propose that the maximum strain resulting from each stress magnitude is selected to produce a maximum response curve this may incorporate multiple response curves in fig 2 for example simultaneous application of stresses a and b results in the greatest strain at low stress magnitudes whereas application of all three stresses produces the greatest strain at high stress magnitudes the area under this maximum response curve shown in grey provides a quantitative measure of general resilience and can be improved by targeting the stress combinations which contribute to it however using any single indicator to represent general resilience will masque a lot of detail inevitably given the large number of contributing components and additional information will be required to inform the development and assessment of resilience enhancing interventions furthermore the shape of the maximum response curve generated is dependant on the system specific failure modes identified and the corresponding stress durations and magnitudes assumed in the analysis if not all system failure modes are identified then this approach will provide only a partial representation of general resilience 2 2 general resilience assessment methodology gram based on the general resilience assessment concept discussed in section 2 1 the detailed methodology is as follows 1 identify all potential system failure modes for example pipe failure or pump failure these represent stresses on the system 2 determine a measure of magnitude for each stress and range of stress magnitudes to which resilience should be assessed for pipe failure for example the percentage of pipes failed may represent the stress magnitude and the magnitude can range from 0 to 100 3 identify all possible combinations of stresses to which the system may be subject and to which resilience must be evaluated for example just pipe failure just pump failure or simultaneous pipe and pump failures for a system with n potential failure modes this includes every combination of 1 to n stresses yielding a total of c combinations as in eq 1 4 identify all level of service measures for the system for example water pressure and water quality indicators these represent types of strain 5 determine acceptable level of service limits i e requirements which if not met represent a level of service failure 6 specify the number of model evaluations r to be used to estimate each response curve a higher value yields higher resolution response curves but will also increase computational demand 7 calculate every point on the response curves for the first combination of stresses as follows a simulate system performance when no system failures are present i e every stress magnitude equals zero record failure magnitude and duration for every level of service measure these are measures of each type of strain resulting from a stress magnitude of zero and each contributes to a different response curve the assessment of no system failures is used to determine the starting point of each system performance curve b for i 1 r simulate system performance when the magnitude of every system failure present in the first set of stresses is set to i r 1 times the corresponding maximum stress magnitude all other stresses are set to zero record failure magnitude and duration for every level of service measure these are the strains resulting from a normalised stress magnitude of i r 1 c plot response curves using the strain and normalised stress values from steps 7a b 8 repeat step 7 for stress combinations 2 c 9 calculate maximum strain values resulting from each stress magnitude in each set of response curves i e maximum level of service failure magnitude and duration resulting from any combination of stresses of a given magnitude this gives the maximum response curve the area under which provides an indicator for general resilience 3 case study integrated urban wastewater system the case study is a well characterised iuws which was first presented by schütze et al 2002 and has since been the subject of much research e g astaraie imani et al 2012 butler and schutze 2005 casal campos et al 2015 fu et al 2008 2009 zacharof et al 2004 this is modelled using simba6 0 ifak 2009 which operates in the matlab simulink environment whilst simba6 0 is fit for purpose in this study newer simba versions or other software tools could also be used a schematic diagram is given in fig 3 the iuws consists of a combined sewer system a wastewater treatment plant wwtp and a receiving river the sewer system contains seven sub catchments and four on line pass through storage tanks tanks 2 4 6 and 7 the catchments are simulated using a hydrologic approach with surface and sewer network flows modelled conceptually as linear cascades of reservoirs nash cascade model nash 1959 the wwtp has an off line pass through storm tank at the inlet and contains a primary clarifier an activated sludge reactor for biological treatment modelled with asm1 henze et al 2000 and a secondary clarifier modelled as detailed by lessard and beck 1993 two pumps are modelled in the wwtp designated pump 2 and pump 4 the wwtp effluent and combined sewer overflows csos discharge into a river of which 45 km is modelled performance is evaluated over a five day period which incorporates a rainfall event with a total depth of 27 mm during this time stresses are applied as detailed in section 3 1 and dynamic outputs are recorded as necessary to calculate the performance measures detailed in section 3 2 3 1 failure modes and stresses in order to calculate every component of general resilience using a middle state based approach it is necessary to identify every way in which the system might fail analysis of the model structure suggests 14 potential failure modes as detailed in table 1 further failure modes may exist but these represent all those that can feasibly be included given the model capabilities and limitations any omissions will imply that there are additional components of general resilience that have not been evaluated however the list in table 1 is sufficient to demonstrate application of the general resilience assessment methodology and provide insight into key opportunities for resilience enhancement in the system should further failure modes be identified these may be added to apply the system failures of the types listed in table 1 it is necessary to decide not only how their magnitude can be varied but also at what time and for how long each stress should be applied given that general resilience assessment requires simultaneous application of multiple stresses and each stress must be applied in a comparable manner all stresses when applied are assumed to occur throughout the entire simulation period i e recovery of the system due to intervention such as replacement or mending of a failed component is not considered this does not mean however that any level of service failure resulting from the system failure also lasts the entire simulation duration since recovery may be observed as the simulated storm event recedes for mechanical failure modes percentage loss of function represents the stress magnitude in each case loss of function in the range 0 to 100 is modelled thereby covering the full range of possibilities hydraulic failure modes identified relate to changes in the sewer influent characteristics and a maximum theoretically possible increase cannot typically be determined the exception here is the percentage increase in vss ss and scod cod ratios for which a maximum stress magnitude is selected so as to provide a maximum ratio of one other upper limits are arbitrarily set to a 100 increase with respect to the base case for the purposes of preliminary analysis but further investigation could explore the effects of extending these limits full details of the stress magnitude measures and ranges for each failure mode are provided in table 1 3 2 level of service measures and strains receiving water dissolved oxygen do and un ionised ammonia amm concentrations represent the iuws level of service measures only total ammonia is modelled dynamically in simba however the toxicity of ammonia is attributed predominantly to the un ionised component johnson et al 2007 un ionised ammonia therefore is estimated using a conversion factor of 0 0195 based on a temperature of 20 c and a ph of 7 7 schütze et al 2002 a minimum do concentration of 4 mg l dolim and a maximum amm concentration of 0 068 mg l ammlim are required to provide an acceptable level of service this do limit is commonly used in integrated urban wastewater system studies e g astaraie imani et al 2012 and is equal to the one year return period one hour limit for salmonid waters defra 2014 the amm limit is the recommended predicted no effect concentration for freshwater based on the 96 hour median lethal concentration for pink salmon johnson et al 2007 failure to comply with either of these limits constitutes a level of service failure given that resilience relates to level of service failure magnitude and duration the following measures of strain are used 2 n o r m a l i s e d d o f a i l u r e m a g n i t u d e max 0 d o l i m d o m i n d o l i m 3 n o r m a l i s e d d o f a i l u r e d u r a t i o n t r d o t f d o t t o t a l 4 n o r m a l i s e d a m m f a i l u r e m

the evaluation period ammmax the maximum un ionised ammonia concentration tf do and tf amm the times at which do and amm failures commence tr do and tr amm the times at which do and amm recovery occur and ttotal the total evaluation period duration note that both failure magnitudes are normalised with respect to their corresponding failure limits and in the case of amm this may result in normalised values in excess of 1 to account for differing do and amm concentrations along the course of the river these strain measures are calculated for 40 locations along the modelled stretch and the worst i e maximum values used for resilience assessment 4 general resilience results and discussion the 14 failure modes identified yield 16 383 combinations of stresses to which the system may be subjected and therefore 16 383 response curves for each measure of strain these are shown in fig 4 and represent the components of general resilience some stresses or stress combinations are shown to have negligible effect on do or amm failure magnitude or duration eqs 2 5 and there are even examples in which the do failure magnitude initially decreases as the stress magnitude increases in such instances stress combinations all include failure of one or more of the tank outflow pumps stresses j m thereby resulting in an increase in cso discharges from the corresponding catchments it is known that a reduction in csos does not guarantee improved receiving water quality lau et al 2002 rauch and harremoes 1999 and it is suggested these csos may result in greater dilution of unavoidable untreated wastewater discharges by distributing them along the river thereby reducing the maximum do failure magnitude increased cso discharges may also reduce the hydraulic load on the wwtp resulting in an improved effluent quality and smaller impact on receiving water quality at the discharge point of the wwtp as the stress magnitude increases further however the failure magnitudes resulting from these stress combinations are amongst the worst this highlights the importance of considering not just the low stress levels but also the high stress levels since their effects on failure magnitude and duration might be contradictory as shown by do magnitude in fig 4 i e improved performance under low magnitudes of a given stress combination but worsened performance under high magnitudes of the same stresses fig 4 also shows that the magnitude and duration of level of service failure resulting from a given stress magnitude can vary significantly depending on the stress or stresses applied under the maximum stress magnitude for example normalised do failure magnitudes in the range 0 44 0 97 equivalent to minimum do concentrations of 0 1 2 2 mg l are observed this shows that if only a few failure modes which are perceived to be important are considered as in a typical specified resilience assessment then only a small part of the picture is obtained and scenarios to which level of service is least resilient may be overlooked analysis of every potential failure scenario is vital to determine the complete range of the possible level of service impacts resulting from any threat known or unknown it is also found that the stress combination resulting in the worst response is not easily predictable it may be assumed that this would be simultaneous occurrence of every system failure mode but this is not the case this is shown clearly in fig 5 in which the maximum levels of service failure magnitudes and durations i e the greater of the do metric and the amm metric resulting from application of a one stress green curve b all 14 stresses red curve and c any combination of 2 13 stresses blue curve are plotted fig 5 shows that modelling all 14 system failure modes stresses simultaneously provides a good approximation of the worst case response under relatively small stress magnitudes up to approximately 0 4 however application of fewer stresses can result in greater level of service failure magnitude and or duration this is particularly evident at high stress magnitudes where applying every stress results in a normalised failure magnitude of 2 88 equivalent to a maximum amm concentration of 15 5 mg l but removal of four stresses a g k and m increases the maximum level of service failure magnitude to 3 78 this may be attributed to a reduction in upstream cso discharges resulting in either greater wwtp bypass or poorer wwtp performance fig 5 shows multiple system failure modes occurring simultaneously i e the two top lines blue and red can result in significantly greater level of service failure magnitude and duration than a single system failure i e the bottom line this again highlights the need to consider more than just individual system failure modes in resilience assessment the area under the maximum response curves shown in fig 5 or fig 4 provides a quantitative measure of general resilience this is system specific and may not be suitable for comparing substantially different systems with different failure modes and level of service measures however such resilience indicators may be used to provide a quantitative basis by which resilience enhancing interventions for a given system may be evaluated and compared use of general resilience assessment to guide the development of interventions is discussed further in section 5 5 interventions development and evaluation 5 1 priority level of service measures analysis of the failure duration response curves in fig 4 suggests that in a general sense the receiving water do is less resilient than the amm since the area under the maximum response curve is greater 0 62 compared with 0 49 on the basis of level of service failure magnitude amm appears to be less resilient however no firm conclusions can be drawn since the units of magnitude differ for amm and do and are not comparable increasing the do performance under zero stress conditions is also shown to be very important since level of service failures occur even when the system is fully functional i e stress magnitude 0 this suggests that the top priority for interventions is to reduce both the occurrence and duration of do failures however the effects of any interventions on amm should not be overlooked since they may not necessarily be favourable 5 2 priority failure modes analysis of the general resilience components can yield knowledge of the system failure modes to which level of service provision is least resilient and inform targeted development of interventions to enhance general resilience fig 6 shows the prevalence of each system failure mode in the stress combinations resulting in the 500 worst response curves in fig 4 i e stress combinations to which level of service provision is least resilient based on do and amm failure magnitude and duration this demonstrates that an increase in the sewer influent flow a is present in all the stress combinations to which the do and amm levels of service are least resilient suggesting that interventions to minimise any influent increases and or reduce the effects of increased influent flow on receiving water quality would be highly beneficial failure of the activated sludge aeration n is also key in terms of its effects on amm failure magnitude and duration and increased sewer influent cod d failure of pumping to the primary clarifier g and failure of the primary clarifier i are shown to be significant in terms of their effects on at least one measure of level of service strain fig 6 also enables low priority failure modes to be identified failure of the tank 7 outflow pump m for example is present in few of the stress combinations resulting in the worst effects on level of service suggesting that interventions should be focussed elsewhere if they are to provide the greatest improvement in general resilience 5 3 interventions interventions employed to enhance resilience may be classified as mitigation adaptation coping or learning assessment of general resilience using a middle state based approach as in this study captures the effects of adaptation measures actions taken to modify specific properties of the water system to enhance its capability to maintain levels of service under varying conditions butler et al 2017 specific threats and consequences are not identified and the effects of mitigation which addresses threats and coping which addresses consequences on general resilience cannot therefore be quantitatively assessed multiple potential interventions for evaluation may be developed using expert engineering knowledge and taking into account the priority level of service measures and failure modes identified in sections 5 1 and 5 2 in this study the following interventions are proposed intervention 1 increase attenuation in the catchments modelled by increasing the number of reservoirs used in hydrological modelling from 3 5 this aims to address increased sewer influent flow intervention 2 increase the maximum outflow of the storm tank preceding the wwtp tank 7 by a factor of two this aims to increase the volume of wastewater treated thereby addressing increased sewer influent flow and reducing receiving water do and amm failures intervention 3 increase capacity of the storm tank preceding the wwtp tank 7 by 200 this aims to address increased sewer influent flow intervention 4 increase activated sludge aeration tank volume by 10 this aims to increase treatment capacity and minimise the effects of increased sewer influent flow intervention 5 increase the wwtp storm tank volume by 50 this aims to provide additional storage in the case of failure of pump 2 to the primary clarifier and will also address increased sewer influent flow note that any interventions which add system components or control structures would increase the number of potential system failure modes thereby exponentially increasing the number of general resilience components and further complicating the assessment process for simplicity the interventions suggested here only consider alterations to the existing infrastructure components and control and the expected benefits are relatively small however greater improvements may be achievable with more complex interventions 5 4 interventions evaluation and discussion it is not feasible to re evaluate every component of general resilience for each intervention due to the large number of simulations required and the high computational demand as a screening process initially just the resilience to each system failure mode occurring individually is calculated for every intervention these results are shown in fig 7 where each number presented is the area under the corresponding response curve and a lower value i e closer to the centre represents greater specified resilience interventions 1 4 and 5 show no negative effects in terms of resilience to individual system failures although there will clearly be cost implications and could be considered further in the development of options to increase general resilience however improvements in specified resilience are also negligible suggesting that greater improvement in general resilience may be obtained with alternative interventions intervention 3 provides negligible improvement in resilience to any individual system failure and is detrimental to the amm response to increased sewer influent flow a and failure of the tank 7 outflow pump m this is not considered a good candidate for further analysis and refinement therefore only intervention 2 provides substantial improvements in specified resilience and the greatest improvements are in the do failure magnitude responses with a mean reduction in area under response curves of 28 the resilience of the receiving water do to every system failure mode when applied individually is improved with respect to the base case however there are still trade offs to consider it is recognised that building resilience in one area may reduce resilience in another miller et al 2010 and this is evidenced with a very small reduction in amm resilience to increased influent flow a given that receiving water do was identified as a priority level of service measure section 5 1 and significant improvements in this respect are provided by intervention 2 further analysis of this intervention is undertaken to determine its effects on general resilience decision makers must be aware of the potential increase in amm failure magnitude and duration however these remain less than the do failure magnitude and duration under individual system failures fig 8 shows the effects of implementing intervention 2 on the worst 500 response curves for each measure of strain the most notable improvement is in do failure magnitude which is reduced by up to 38 under low stress magnitudes although the mean area under the response curves is only reduced by 5 3 the effects on other stress strain relationships as summarised in table 2 are small an improvement is achieved with respect to do failure duration with both the mean and maximum area under the set of response curves reduced however this intervention is a little detrimental to the general resilience of the receiving water amm since an increase in the mean amm failure magnitude response curve and maximum amm failure duration response curve areas is observed ultimately these results show that intervention 2 is on balance beneficial to general resilience as it provides an improvement in most indicators however they also confirm the existence of trade offs as suggested by walker and salt 2012 and indicate that improvement in general resilience is difficult to achieve further and more universal improvements in general resilience may be achievable with more complex interventions but these are more challenging to evaluate and likely to incur greater expense still this case study successfully demonstrates that the gram approach may be applied to the development of interventions and can highlight potentially negative effects of measures which enhance specified resilience 6 conclusions quantifying general resilience is challenging due to the existence of unknown threats however this paper explores the general resilience of an iuws using a newly developed assessment methodology gram and demonstrates that the results may guide development of interventions to enhance general resilience key conclusions drawn include using a middle state based approach the potential effects on level of service resulting from any threat known or unknown may be determined without knowledge of unknowns if all system failure modes can be identified and modelled general resilience can be decomposed into its multiple contributing components each of which may be calculated individually using global resilience analysis combined these provide a comprehensive and quantitative assessment of the general resilience of the iuws the maximum response curve derived using global resilience analysis for each combination of system failure modes represents general resilience efforts to increase general resilience should target system failure modes which contribute to this maximum response curve and in the case study increased sewer influent flow and failure of the activated sludge aeration are shown to be key assessment of specified resilience of an iuws is likely to overlook some failure scenarios to which level of service provision is least resilient it is essential that simultaneous occurrence of multiple system failure modes is considered since this can result in significantly greater level of service failure magnitude and duration than any individual failure it is also important that different combinations are considered since simultaneous occurrence of every failure does not necessarily result in the worst response general resilience cannot be estimated by calculating the response to failure of every system component simultaneously analysis of the components of general resilience enables identification of priority level of service measures and priority system failure modes thereby providing an informed starting point for the development of interventions to enhance general resilience based on the assessment results of interventions whilst substantial improvement in specified resilience may be achieved with relative ease however achieving significant improvement in the general resilience of an iuws is challenging although a holistic picture of the general resilience of the iuws is useful it requires a significantly large amount of model simulations even with the newly developed gram it should be noted that the computer model is assumed to be able to represent various failure scenarios and intervention measures in this study but developing such a model might be challenging in practice due to resources and data required as with any model based analysis confidence in the results of gram for assessment of a real system is dependant on the representativeness and accuracy of the corresponding model declaration of competing interest we

on low and middle income countries lmics water supplies in lmics typically rely on simpler technologies are not well resourced and may not have adequate water treatment with a projected increase in flooding in south and south east asia and drought in large parts of central africa increased pressure on water supplies is expected jiménez cisneros et al 2014 macdonald et al 2009 the increased vulnerability of lmics to climate change world bank 2010 demands a closer analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on water quality the effects of climate change on water quality are likely to be similar to those already observed in response to changes in temperature and rainfall jiménez cisneros et al 2014 there is strong quantitative evidence of seasonal changes in water quality in lmic settings but studies examining seasonal changes in water quality do not capture the impact of individual rainfall events which may cause short term contaminant spikes and skew seasonal averages kostyla et al 2015 as climate change is expected to lead to increased occurrence of extreme rain events understanding relationships between individual events and water quality will be essential in understanding the consequences of climate change furthermore the impact of slow onset events such as sea level rise or drought on water quality in lmics has not been reviewed to address this gap a scoping review of the available literature from lmics was undertaken investigating the relationships between observed water quality and climate variables and modelled changes in water quality based on climate change projections a scoping review was chosen because we wanted to explore a breadth of climate variables exposures and water quality threats outcomes scoping reviews are useful tools to map existing evidence and identify research gaps and to summarize studies with heterogeneous study design armstrong et al 2011 arksey and o malley 2005 the conceptual basis for the scoping review groups climate effects into 3 categories and shows how they cascade to water quality threats fig 1 we recognize that these relationships depend on the interventions around infrastructure and management that can mitigate the consequences of climate change for water quality 2 methods the scoping review was designed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma moher et al 2009 2 1 search strategy and inclusion criteria peer reviewed literature was searched in three databases pubmed scopus and web of science in may 2020 search terms included a combination of keywords related to climate variables and climate change and drinking water quality supplementary information table s1 and were chosen to reflect the potential climate change impacts depicted in fig 1 no restrictions were placed on date of publication studies from high income countries based on the world bank classification and those without titles abstracts or full text available in english were excluded studies were included in the review if they investigated the link between water quality and specified values of temperature or rainfall amounts measured within a specified period of time prior to sampling or modelled changes in water quality based on long term climate change projections reference lists of included papers were manually scanned and papers that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review studies were excluded if they reported only seasonal variation of water quality without quantitative measurements of temperature or rainfall if they investigated freshwater not used for drinking or investigated marine or brackish waters 2 2 quality of reporting studies included in the synthesis were assessed for the quality of reporting using the checklists in supplementary information table s2 the checklists were developed based on the collaboration for environmental evidence critical appraisal tool version 0 1 konno et al 2020 and nih national heart lung and blood institute s bethesda maryland usa quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross sectional studies 2 3 data extraction relevant data on study location type of study climate variable rainfall temperature or climate event windstorm coastal storm surge sea level rise non climate variables and drinking water quality parameters was extracted for each study that met the inclusion criteria the findings from each paper were summarised given the heterogeneity of the studies and the measures reported we did not attempt meta analysis of the data 3 results 3 1 search results study characteristics and quality of reporting the database search generated 21 516 results fig 2 after removing duplicates both authors screened titles and abstracts and 143 studies were considered eligible for full text review the bibliographies of studies were searched during the full text review and an additional 57 studies were added manually in all 98 studies table s3 were included in the qualitative synthesis and 102 were excluded as they did not meet our inclusion criteria for the purpose of the qualitative synthesis the papers were categorised according to the water quality threat studied nineteen studies examined the links between microbiological quality specifically evidence of faecal contamination in source waters and rainfall of these three studies also considered the impact of ambient temperature fifty four studies reported observed or modelled associations between cyanobacterial in surface water used for drinking water supply and climate variables twenty one studies examined the impact of climate variables and change on the salinity of coastal aquifers used as drinking water sources salinity was expressed as electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds or chloride cl concentrations four studies explored variability in geogenic contaminant arsenic and fluoride levels with rainfall the percentage of studies that fulfilled each criterion of the quality assessment are depicted in the supplementary information fig s1 a and b 81 of studies adequately reported methods that would allow for replication of the study while fewer than 20 of studies reported random sampling the rest of the studies collected samples at points of interest such as intakes of water treatment plants or at existing monitoring stations three quarters of the studies collected samples over a period of at least 12 months or during every season that exists in the study location we also included a criterion on whether the authors reported statistical measures of association 25 of the observational studies did not perform statistical tests and reported the relationship between exposure and outcome based on visual interpretation of plotted results while 81 of studies measured potential covariates e g non climate variables that could influence water quality only 65 of studies included them in the statistical analysis nearly 60 of the modelling studies chose exposure variables temperature rainfall or sea level rise based on historical trends or climate projections from general circulation models gcm to predict changes in water quality over 70 of studies used measured data to calibrate their model and a similar number included covariates in the model 3 2 microbiological quality the identified studies reported the microbiological water quality in spring sources well water and piped water supplies using faecal indicator organisms and in some cases pathogens the studies were predominantly from sub saharan africa and south asia despite the heterogeneity in location and source type a significant p 0 05 positive association was reported between antecedent rainfall and faecal indicator organisms and pathogens presence and concentration in the majority of the studies but there was mixed evidence on the association between temperature and contamination 3 2 1 antecedent rainfall groundwater quality in shallow wells was reported to respond rapidly to individual rainfall events significant correlation between thermotolerant coliform ttc count and amount of rainfall within 48 hours of sampling was reported for wells in uganda kulabako et al 2007 whereas in vanuatu the detection of e coli above 10 mpn 1 1 mpn most probable number 100 ml was statistically correlated with 24 h rainfall for wells equipped with a nira af 85 handpump but not for other hand pump types or motorised pumps foster et al 2019 barrell and rowland 1979 also reported an increase in faecal coliform fc another term for thermotolerant coliforms and faecal streptococci fs counts in wells with the onset of rains in the village of keneba in the gambia although no statistical analysis was reported in rural guatemala the concentration of e coli in shallow wells was reportedly 3 8 times higher at sites where rainfall had occurred 24 h before sample collection eisenhauer et al 2016 although this association was not statistically significant heavy rainfall defined as rainfall in the 90th percentile of reference data prior to sample collection led to deterioration in water quality of shallow wells the detection of cryptosporidium in wells in india was positively correlated with heavy rainfall 2 days prior to sampling daniels et al 2016 while the detection of e coli in wells in bangladesh was positively corelated to heavy rainfall occurring in the 7 15 and 30 days prior to sampling wu et al 2016 the concentration of e coli in the wells was significantly associated with the number of heavy rainfall days in the 3 day period prior to sampling only wu et al 2016 guo et al 2019 identified 2 rainfall related variables as predictors of e coli contamination in wells in tanzania the number of heavy rainfall days days with rainfall 10 mm in the 14 days prior to sampling and standardized precipitation index 2 2 spi measures how much wetter or drier the month is compared to normal conditions for that time of year spi spi had a stronger effect on e coli count in wells with handpumps compared to wells with motorized pumps on the other hand heavy rainfall within 14 days of sample collection was a better predictor of e coli count in wells with motorized pumps longer term rainfall averages also affected well water quality the median well water ttc levels 13 cfu 100 ml 3 3 cfu coliform forming unit were an order of magnitude higher than ttc levels 2 cfu 100 ml during months with above 40 mm rainfall compared to months with less than 40mm of rainfall in northern mozambique cronin et al 2006 nogueira et al 2003 also reported an increase in fc counts of well water with an increase in monthly rainfall amount although no statistical measures of association were reported lapworth et al 2020 found a statistically significant correlation between ttc levels in wells during the dry season and annual average rainfall in ethiopia malawi and uganda studies reported mixed results on the effect of rainfall on water quality in deep wells cryptosporidium or giardia detection in deep wells in india were not associated with short term or seasonal cumulative rainfall patterns daniels et al 2016 engström et al 2015 reported a similar lack of correlation between contamination ttc in deep boreholes and short term rainfall in south sudan however there was a significant association between contamination and long term rainfall depth 5 day and monthly cumulative antecedent rainfall was linked to faecal contamination in protected springs in uganda howard et al 2003 taylor et al 2009b correlation between median ttc count and amount of rainfall in the 24 h and 48 h before sample collection was attributed to the rapid recharge of protected springs howard et al 2003 taylor et al 2009b detected more than 103 cfu 100 ml ttc in spring water within one hour of rainfall when the daily rainfall exceeded 5 mm day more intense rainfall exceeding 20 mm day was associated with even higher contamination 104 cfu 100 ml taylor et al 2009b levels of fs were also strongly correlated with 24 h and 48 h rainfall amounts howard et al 2003 spikes in faecal contamination in springs within an hour of commencement of rainfall were also reported by buckerfield et al 2019 in southwest china and water quality remained impaired 1 to 4 days after rainfall while nogueira et al 2003 found an increase in fc counts of spring water with an increase in monthly rainfall amount no statistical measures of association were reported heavy rainfalls at the end of drought have been linked to faecal contamination of groundwater in ethiopia during the el nino 2015 16 drought macdonald et al 2019 the three types of the sources examined springs boreholes with handpumps and hand dug wells had negligible contamination during the dry spell but were contaminated with ttc during the first rainfall marking the end of the drought the water quality improved after the first flush and did not deteriorate during the heavy rains later in the year short term rainfall effects were reported for piped water systems in multiple studies the presence of faecal contamination indicated by a positive result using the h2s rapid test manja et al 1982 in public standpipes connected to mechanized boreholes and an elevated storage tank in rural india was significantly correlated with a heavy rainfall event rainfall in the 80th percentile of observed values in the study period 1 to 7 days before sample collection but not with heavy rain 8 to 14 days prior mertens et al 2019 similarly e coli levels in tap samples in an intermittent water supply in india were statistically higher when rain had occurred within 24h of sample collection kumpel and nelson 2013 in tanzania both spi and heavy rainfall rainfall 10mm within 14 days of sample collection led to higher e coli counts in samples collected from public taps samples from water piped to the house was not strongly affected by either climate variable guo et al 2019 cumulative rainfall was also significantly associated with the number of contaminated tap samples reported with both weekly and monthly rainfall amounts affecting water quality bastaraud et al 2020 reported on the results of a 32 year monitoring program of the urban piped water supply in antananarivo madagascar the number of contaminated samples were correlated with the amount of weekly rainfall sulfite reducing clostridia src and intestinal enterococci ie were detected after four and five weeks of cumulative rainfall while no correlations were found between cumulative rainfall and e coli the relatively small number of positive samples could have affected the performance of the statistical model in brazil the percentage of samples positive for faecal coliforms fc increased with monthly rainfall amount for both chlorinated and unchlorinated tap samples although no statistical measures of correlation were reported nogueira et al 2003 j nkanga 1980 reported the combined effects of rainfall and hazards in the distribution system on piped water quality in benin city nigeria an anti microbial resistant strain of e coli artificially introduced into the sewers was detected in tap water samples from households near the septic drainage field confirming sewage contamination in the water supply the concentration of the detected strain varied with rainfall amounts in the 7 day prior to sampling but no statistical measures of association were reported j nkanga 1980 3 2 2 temperature three studies reported on the effect of temperature on levels of faecal indicator bacteria detection of e coli in wells in rural bangladesh was more likely with higher mean temperatures in the 7 and 15 day period prior to sampling concentration of e coli was positively correlated with the number of hot days days with temperature in the 90th percentile of reference data in the 7 and 15 day period before sampling but negatively with the average temperature in the 3 day period prior to sampling wu et al 2016 in tanzania the only temperature variable to be correlated with e coli counts in piped water and wells was daily minimum temperature guo et al 2019 the percentage of samples positive for faecal coliforms fc in a piped water supply in brazil increased with increase in water temperature for both chlorinated and unchlorinated samples from piped water supply protected springs and private wells although no statistical measures of correlation were reported nogueira et al 2003 3 3 cyanobacteria 3 3 1 observational studies the most frequently reported proxy for cyanobacteria biomass was chlorophyll a concentration several studies reported positive correlations between ambient or water temperature and chlorophyll levels during a cyanobacteria bloom although this association varied with the temperature range over the study period thermal stratification and nutrient levels in the water column and the dominant cyanobacteria genus berger et al 2006 deutsch and alameddine 2019 hennemann and petrucio 2016 hoang et al 2018 li et al 2018a ni et al 2012 touati et al 2019 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 chlorophyll a levels were also directly correlated with cumulative rainfall 15 days prior to sampling li et al 2018b and negatively correlated with reservoir volume under drought conditions rocha et al 2018 cyanobacteria abundance cells ml or biomass mg l and temperature were positively correlated across climate zones in temperate lu et al 2013 luo et al 2019 tian et al 2012 sub tropical duong et al 2013 khuram et al 2017 lv et al 2014 and tropical lakes and reservoirs dao et al 2016 ni et al 2012 xu et al 2010 the most frequently detected cyanobacteria genera were microcystis barros et al 2019 dao et al 2016 deng et al 2014 li et al 2017 jiang et al 2014 major et al 2018 mankiewicz boczek et al 2015 mhlanga et al 2006 nasri et al 2007 touati et al 2019 xu et al 2010 anabaena now known as dolichospermum dao et al 2016 duong et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2018a guo et al 2018 major et al 2018 ni et al 2012 otten and paerl 2011 wu et al 2006 yu et al 2014 and cylindrospermopsis berger et al 2006 bouvy et al 1999 2000 2003 major et al 2018 several studies reported a positive correlation between temperature and microcystis biomass duong et al 2013 li et al 2017 liu et al 2011 touati et al 2019 xu et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 deng et al 2014 and guo et al 2017 observed that temperature was the critical factor controlling microcystis density cells ml once the nutrient thresholds were exceeded anabaena biomass was correlated only with photosynthetically active radiation but not water temperature li et al 2018a wu et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 c raciborskii was the dominant cylindrospermopsis species detected in studies but its biomass was also not associated with temperature in several locations bouvy et al 1999 2000 lei et al 2014 microcystin mc toxins predominantly mc rr mc yr and mc lr major et al 2018 were isolated from microcystis species and some anabaena species otten and paerl 2011 while strains of c raciborskii were associated with the toxin cylindrospermopsin cyn lei et al 2014 the association between mc concentrations and temperature was inconsistent across studies amé et al 2003 barros et al 2019 dao et al 2016 duong et al 2013 li et al 2017 mankiewicz boczek et al 2015 nasri et al 2007 ni et al 2012 wu et al 2006 yu et al 2014 and depended on the dominant cyanobacterial species present high mc levels were generally associated with toxic m aeruginosa and m flos aquae species chen et al 2009 mohamed et al 2015 otten and paerl 2011 wang et al 2002 found that the relationship between mc concentration and temperature depended on the type of toxin present with only mc yr significantly correlated with temperature similar mixed results were also reported across studies on association between temperature and cyn levels barros et al 2019 lei et al 2014 the impact of rainfall on cyanobacteria blooms was closely linked to the amount of thermal destratification induced by the event and prevalent temperature conditions autumn rainfall in a deep reservoir in china was associated with an absence of blooms the following summer because input sediment load with a higher density than existing bottom layers in the reservoir led to de stratification of the water column li et al 2015 in contrast guo et al 2018 reported that the sequence of heavy rains which transported large amounts of nutrients into the river followed by hot and dry weather causing reduced river inflow triggered a large bloom in qianting river in china bloom duration in lake taihu increased with decrease in precipitation and wind speed between 1987 and 2009 but was not significantly correlated with annual averages of temperature or precipitation zhang et al 2012 half of the cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu between 2007 and 2015 occurred within 4 days following extreme rainfall events with strong winds yang et al 2016 typhoons had a similar impact on cyanobacterial blooms after an initial disruption immediately following the typhoon blooms reappeared with higher biomass zhu et al 2014 and covered a larger area chen et al 2020 than before the typhoon but gradually reduced several days after it had passed few studies examined the impact of cyanobacteria on drinking water supplies toxin levels mc lr and mc rr in nile river source water at the treatment plant intake in damietta city egypt were positively correlated with temperature but the temperature dependence of toxin removal efficiency of water treatment steps was not explored mohamed et al 2015 toxin levels in domestic reservoirs receiving water from the treatment plant exceeded the who guideline value 1 µg l mc lr and were also correlated with temperature mohamed et al 2016 nasri et al 2007 found no temperature dependence of toxin levels at the raw water intake in cheffia dam algeria but did not explore associations between efficiency of toxin removal and temperature 3 3 2 modelling studies in models developed by zhu et al 2018 temperature was a good predictor of cyanobacteria biomass in lake erhai used to supply drinking water to dali city in china longyang 2019 modelled effects of increasing temperatures on blooms in a deep lake in southeast china and found that an increase in autumn and winter temperatures had a bigger impact on chlorophyll a concentrations than summer temperatures since summer conditions are already favourable for cyanobacteria growth climate change under rcp 8 5 was projected to impact cyanobacteria blooms through an increase in surface water temperature and extended thermal stratification in the summer especially in the long term 2070 2099 tang et al 2015 compared to the baseline year 2005 the blooms were also projected to cover a larger area in the lake and last longer simulations by shan et al 2020 predicted that an increase in water temperature would lower the nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus thresholds required to limit blooms and maintain the mc concentration below the who guideline of 1 µg l these thresholds varied across lakes in china similar trends were presented by huo et al 2019 for lakes across china under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 scenarios in the worst case scenario under rcp 8 5 a 4 8 and 37 reduction in thresholds for total nitrogen and total phosphorous respectively would be required to prevent bloom formation huo et al 2019 3 4 groundwater salinity 3 4 1 observational studies the observational studies on saltwater intrusion in coastal and island groundwaters were predominantly from south asia akter et al 2020 found a weak statistical correlation between groundwater salinity and land surface temperature lst and moderate correlation between salinity and potential evapotranspiration pet in coastal bangladesh thilagavathi et al 2017 reported no association between annual average rainfall and groundwater electrical conductivity ec in pondicherry india based on seasonal data collected over a ten year period from 2006 to 2016 however no statistical measures of correlation were reported and no consistent trends in long term average annual rainfall were detected at the study setting sreekesh et al 2018 found evidence of coastal erosion and sea level rise along the coast of kerala india annual rate of erosion was correlated with increase in ec and total dissolved solids tds of groundwater in a study across comoros islands kenya and tanzania comte et al 2016 observed a correlation between tds and annual rainfall only in volcanic aquifers indicating the effect of geology on the response of water quality to rainfall chattopadhyay and singh 2013 analysed groundwater quality in the lakshadweep islands in the western indian ocean during above and below average 30 annual rainfall conditions wells near the coast had the highest tds 1400 to 2300 mg l indicating slight to moderate salinity during the drier year in comparison the highest tds reported during years with above average rainfall in the same wells was 900 mg l wells towards the centre of the island had 600 mg l tds in both years suggesting higher vulnerability of groundwater along the rim of the island gingerich et al 2017 studied the impact of a coastal storm in the republic of marshall islands during a period of regional sea level rise linked to the el niño southern oscillation enso seawater flooding caused by the storm swell increased chloride concentrations in well waters from 53 195 mg l to 10 080 20 880 mg l seawater cl concentration was 19 600 mg l these concentrations were reduced to 1800 3990 mg l after ten days however it took 22 months for the concentrations to reduce to pre flood levels aided by artificial recharge with rainwater that began seven months after the flood 3 4 2 modelling studies modelling studies predicted saltwater intrusion caused by an inland shift of the freshwater saltwater transition zone and land surface inundation in coastal aquifers and shrinking of island freshwater lens sathish and elango 2019 sefelnasr and sherif 2014 aquifers with higher hydraulic conductivity in coastal argentina carretero et al 2013 and smaller hydraulic gradients in the nile delta aquifer sherif and singh 1999 were more susceptible to saltwater intrusion than aquifers with lower hydraulic conductivity or larger hydraulic gradient increased groundwater extraction was predicted to increase saltwater intrusion caused by sea level rise in coastal argentina carretero et al 2013 simulations by abd elhamid et al 2016a 2016b abdelaty et al 2014 and mabrouk et al 2018 for different parts of the nile delta aquifer in egypt detected comparable or greater landward shifts from increased groundwater pumping than from sea level rise the freshwater lens in kish island in iran was projected to shrink by less than 10 under three sea level rise scenarios 0 1 and 4m this effect became more pronounced with decreased groundwater recharge but could potentially be offset through increasing recharge by 20 mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 similarly reducing groundwater extraction to 50 of current rates was projected to offset the loss of freshwater resources in the nile delta aquifer caused by 0 1 m sea level rise abd elhamid et al 2016a and 0 5m sea level rise but not 1m sea level rise sefelnasr and sherif 2014 the simulated groundwater salinity of wells in coastal karnataka in india in the year 2034 considering 1 mm year sea level rise 50 decrease in recharge and 200 increase in extraction was similar to the salinity increase caused by just the changes in recharge and extraction relative to baseline conditions in 2014 lathashri and mahesha 2016 sea level rise of 1 2m in the bay of bengal was predicted to increase salinity at the intake of a water treatment plant in the coastal city of chittagong bangladesh from the current level of 1 parts per thousand ppt to between 2 and 2 5 ppt akhter et al 2012 in the laccadive islands off the western coast of india sea level rise of 0 05 and 0 1m was projected to shrink the freshwater lens in the centre of the island by 28 and 60 respectively bobba et al 2000 the lens thickness on the outer rim of the island was projected to decrease to zero implying mixing of freshwater and seawater this is similar to the observed findings of chattopadhyay and singh 2013 for the same group of islands okello et al 2015 modelled the freshwater lens on lamu island in kenya in the 2090s with estimates of local sea level rise derived from the global mean projections of 0 43m and 0 48m for a1b and a2 emissions scenarios nakicenovic et al 2000 respectively the volume of the freshwater lens was projected to increase by 60 under a1b scenario in contrast a2 conditions were expected to shrink the volume by 78 this difference was attributed to the increased potential evapotranspiration caused by the higher average temperatures under a2 as compared to a1b while monthly precipitation was projected to increase under both scenarios the higher temperatures under a2b had a drastic impact on the simulated groundwater quantity and quality 3 5 geogenic contaminants rodríguez et al 2004 reported an inverse relationship between arsenic concentration and monthly mean precipitation amount in zimapán valley in mexico while tathagata and rolee 2011 reported an inverse relationship between arsenic concentrations and mean seasonal rainfall amounts in west bengal no statistical analysis was reported in either study contrary to these findings gonçalves et al 2007 found a positive association between monthly rainfall amount and arsenic concentrations in ouro preto brazil although no statistical measures were reported only one study was identified that explored the relationship between rainfall and fluoride concentrations in groundwater davraz et al 2008 indicated that the fluoride content of spring water in turkey decreased during months with rainfall but did not report statistical measures of association 4 discussion 4 1 summary of evidence rainfall was the most frequently reported predictor of microbiological contamination the majority of studies identified were of small point sources of water supply generally from groundwater these supplies tend to use simple technologies and often lack adequate sanitary protection and water treatment making them more susceptible to contamination the reviewed studies showed that such supplies respond rapidly to heavy rainfall which can cause elevated contamination through rapid recharge of shallow groundwater or contaminants being washed into shallow sources with faulty headworks daniels et al 2016 howard et al 2003 macdonald et al 2019 taylor et al 2009b heavy rainfalls following drought are likely to cause first flush contaminant spikes in rural areas as waste accumulates near sources during the prolonged dry period macdonald et al 2019 differences in climate predictors of faecal contamination between urban and rural settings pointed to variation in patterns of faecal loading buckerfield et al 2019 guo et al 2019 although further investigation of these effects is needed deterioration in water quality was also closely linked to population density howard et al 2003 presence of animals at the study site daniels et al 2016 groundwater level and ponding at the source kulabako et al 2007 and percentage of developed area around sources wu et al 2016 the associations with topography local hydrogeology and land use daniels et al 2016 engström et al 2015 wu et al 2016 have important implications for improving resilience of water and sanitation services to climate change these factors combined with lack of disinfection would suggest such water supplies will be the most vulnerable under climate change it is quite likely that the nearly 800 million people living in lmics who lack access to even a basic water supply will get access only to such shared community managed water supplies as a first step in improving access to water supply the evidence of this review suggests that greater attention must be paid to disinfecting water from such point sources most likely through household water treatment it would be preferable however to focus on moving people to higher levels of water supply service that include disinfection who 2017b and preferably to continuous safely managed piped water at home howard 2021 evidence from the reviewed studies indicates that even chlorinated water supplies may be vulnerable to contamination with public taps responding to rainfall and temperature more strongly than water piped to the house especially when hazards are present near the distribution network guo et al 2019 nogueira et al 2003 j nkanga 1980 note that damaged pipes passing through septic tank drain fields led to high levels of contamination in piped water supplies during heavy rainfall this threat is reinforced from other studies that note that the risk of disease from contaminated water in a large utility in uganda was primarily driven by contamination in distribution systems howard et al 2006b intermittent supplies which serve about 1 billion people in lmics are also susceptible to seasonal deterioration in water quality bivins et al 2017 etchie et al 2014 kumpel and nelson 2013 the implication of these findings is that management of piped water supplies in lmics will need to substantially improve if they are to cope with the additional threats from climate change the studies on cyanobacterial blooms in water supply reservoirs predominantly focused on temperature as the exposure variable and its effect on the dominant cyanobacteria genus nutrient levels and temperature range observed during the study cyanobacteria blooms can be expected to occur more frequently under a warming climate because their growth is optimized at higher temperatures while the growth of other primary producers levels off or declines as temperatures exceed 25 c paerl and paul 2012 warmer conditions also intensify thermal stratification in lakes and reservoirs which gives a further advantage to buoyant cyanobacteria species paerl and paul 2012 temperature effects on toxin production varied between studies and seemed to depend on the specific genus and type of toxin present barros et al 2019 wang et al 2002 but not on the climate zone of the lake or reservoir dao et al 2016 mankiewicz boczek et al 2015 nasri et al 2007 heavy rainfall and windstorms led to a temporary release of nutrients from resuspended sediments in shallow lakes and transported blooms through the lake causing blooms to reappear after an initial disruption during the event chen et al 2020 yang et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 the effect on bloom formation seemed to depend on the weather conditions immediately after the event and the amount of thermal destratification caused by it guo et al 2018 li et al 2015 li et al 2018b decreased rainfall under future climate change may reduce nutrient input from non point pollution on the other hand more intense rainfall and windstorms can increase nutrient transport and sediment resuspension but also cause mixing and thermal destratification chorus and welker 2021 therefore the effect of climate change on cyanobacteria blooms and their toxicity may vary between locations depending on nutrient availability local climate patterns and type of bloom forming strains present studies projected stricter control over nitrogen and phosphorus input into surface waters to minimise bloom formation guo et al 2017 huo et al 2019 shan et al 2020 especially where warmer winters are expected longyang 2019 annual rainfall was the only climate variable significantly associated with coastal aquifer salinity in the observational studies chattopadhyay and singh 2013 comte et al 2016 thilagavathi et al 2017 however the lack of long term climate or water quality data limited the strength of evidence presented in these studies sea level rise akhter et al 2012 carratero et al 2013 sherif and singh 1999 long term changes in precipitation lathashri and mahesha 2016 razack et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 and evapotranspiration okello et al 2015 were projected to cause a gradual increase in salinity of coastal groundwater and a decrease in the volume of freshwater increase in sea level and changes in aquifer recharge can lower the hydraulic head of the aquifer relative to seawater and seaward groundwater flux causing the freshwater saltwater interface to shift inland werner et al 2012 however as multiple studies reported the overexploitation of groundwater is projected to have a comparable or greater effect on saltwater intrusion than sea level rise and maintaining current levels of groundwater recharge and pumping will be essential to mitigate these effects literature on geogenic contamination and climate variables that met our inclusion criteria was scarce and none of the studies included reported statistical measures of association this precludes any inferences on the likely effects of climate change multiple studies have reported temporal variations in arsenic concentrations with season and groundwater levels pointing to possible links with recharge in some locations but the reported trends are not uniform cheng et al 2005 savarimuthu et al 2006 4 2 limitations of the review there are a number of limitations with this scoping review some papers with titles and full text in spanish and portuguese were rejected over language which may have led to an under representation of studies form south and central america furthermore no studies in chinese or russian were identified in the search which may have excluded work from china and countries in the former soviet union respectively the search was limited to studies in peer reviewed journals and did not include technical reports or articles published in magazines of engineering societies or other professional organizations this may have excluded reports on effects of temperature and rainfall on water quality from utilities and engineering firms there was over representation of certain geographical areas in the included studies the studies on cyanobacteria were overwhelmingly from two countries brazil and china despite reports of cyanobacteria blooms from india and 21 countries across africa d silva et al 2012 ndlela et al 2016 few studies reported quantitative measurements of temperature or rainfall and therefore did not meet our inclusion criteria 4 3 recommendations for research there is a need for further research that investigates the relationships between pathogens and climate variables and to produce more accurate estimates of public health risks this may include improving quantitative microbial risk assessment models for water supplies in lmics that can be linked to climate models given advances in analytical techniques and increasing capacity in lmics there are greater opportunities for such studies to be undertaken relying on faecal indicator bacteria alone will likely under estimate the potential impact of climate change on water quality given that viral and protozoan pathogens in particular have very different survival rates in untreated water and resistance to water treatment processes betancourt and rose 2004 pedley et al 2006 there are also clear needs for further research on the relationships between piped water and climate variables in lmics given increasing rates of access to piped systems this should include investigation of the likely impact of climate change on biofilm and opportunistic pathogens increasing ambient temperatures and source waters with high nutrient loads may well result in increasing issues with biofilms in lmics hallam et al 2001 liu et al 2016 and this would therefore seem to be an important area of future research no studies examining the implications for drinking water treatment met our inclusion criteria despite the strong qualitative evidence of the potential impacts for water supply and need for adaptation delpla et al 2009 therefore research into how climate change may affect water treatment and groundwater protection requirements is a further priority further research into the links between temperature and toxin production and the effect of temperature on nutrient thresholds is needed at the reservoir level as these associations are often location specific actions to prevent an increase in algal blooms will be important in part because cyanobacteria have been associated with pathogens like pseudomonas aeruginosa legionella pneumophila and vibrio cholerae bomo et al 2011 chaturvedi et al 2015 taylor et al 2009a in addition algal blooms pose challenges for water treatment newcombe et al 2021 no studies were identified on the implications of cyanobacterial blooms for water treatment processes blooms have been known to cause taste and odour problems in treated water accumulate in sludge beds and release toxins and increase potential for disinfection by product dbp formation khan et al 2015 zamyadi et al 2012 2013 the removal of cyanotoxins and taste odour and colour producing compounds may require optimizing existing water treatment processes and additional processes such as granular activated carbon or membrane filtration thus increasing treatment costs the cost effectiveness of additional water treatment over better catchment management and nutrient control in lmic settings warrants more attention the studies on saltwater intrusion did not directly consider the implications for drinking water supplies in affected areas although all locations in the studies reported relying substantially on groundwater for domestic supply given the emerging evidence that increasing salinity in drinking water may be linked to health problems including hypertension and pre eclampsia khan et al 2011 vineis et al 2011 further work in this area is warranted unlike high income countries coastal communities in lmics may not have access to expensive desalinization processes and managed aquifer recharge may be a more cost effective adaptation option this is gaining increasing attention in countries such as bangladesh with increasingly saline groundwater and polluted surface water but feasibility systems require careful assessment naus et al 2021 naser et al 2021 found that people consuming mar water had higher urinary sodium and higher blood pressure than those continuing to rely on surface water sources and concluded that mar should not be promoted as a routine water supply option such risk substitutions have been identified before in bangladesh in relation to arsenic howard 2003 but the risks with microbiological contamination tend to substantially outweigh those associated with chemical contaminants howard et al 2006a the limited geographical range of the studies also suggest for greater attention particularly in parts of coastal africa that are affected by major windstorms between 94 to 220 million people worldwide are potentially exposed to high arsenic concentrations in groundwater of which over 94 live in asia podgorski and berg 2020 and a similar number is estimated to rely on groundwater with elevated levels of fluoride mostly in north africa and asia amini et al 2008 edmunds and smedley 2013 given the global importance of groundwater for drinking supply further research into potential effects of climate change is warranted furthermore evidence from the andes of water quality deterioration linked to glacier recession fortner et al 2011 guittard et al 2020 suggests more research into the effect of climate change on chemical water quality in glaciated river basins is also needed the potential for wildfires is expected to increase in parts of asia and africa liu et al 2010 but no studies from lmics were identified on the potential impact on water supplies from forested catchments since hotter dryer conditions are expected to increase in several lmics research is needed into the effects of wildfires on water quality especially considering the effects of peak runoff events finally we found few studies discussing the impact of multi year drought on water quality as several lmics are projected to face greater rainfall variability and may suffer from longer dry spells including drought this is an important area for future work 5 conclusions there is a growing body of evidence on the threats of climate change to water supplies in lmics changing rainfall and temperature patterns are likely to exacerbate existing challenges around safe water provision across source types and settings climate threats to water quality were either closely influenced by or in some cases exceeded by the threats from population growth poor sanitary protection and poor catchment management the vulnerability of many simple point sources of water is of concern given the large numbers of people continuing to rely on such water supplies and the prospect that millions more may only be offered such water supplies in the medium term that these water supplies are already highly vulnerable to climatic variables suggest even greater attention is needed to provide safely managed water at people s houses preferably via piped networks managed by regulated suppliers given the evidence that climate change is likely to lead to more intense rainfall and dry periods ipcc 2021 these relationships suggest that without action water quality will further deteriorate with climate change this demonstrates the urgent need to consider climate factors and climate change in the planning and operation of water supplies this will require improvements in long term monitoring water quality sampling immediately following climate events and wider uptake of risk management tools like water safety plans this review also identified key areas of research that can strengthen our

16334,understanding how climate change will affect water quality and therefore health is critical for building resilient water services in low and middle income countries lmics where the effect of climate change will be felt most acutely evidence of the effect of climate variables such as temperate and rainfall on water quality can generate insights into the likely impact of future climate change while the seasonal effects on water quality are known and there is strong qualitative evidence that climate change will impact water quality there are no reviews that synthesise quantitative evidence from lmics on links between climate variables and water quality we mapped the available evidence on a range of climate exposures and water quality outcomes and identified 98 peer reviewed studies this included observational studies on the impact of temperature and rainfall events which may cause short term changes in contaminant concentrations and modelling studies on the long term impacts of sea level rise evidence on links between antecedent rainfall and microbiological contamination of water supplies is strong and relatively evenly distributed geographically but largely focused on faecal indicator bacteria and on untreated shallow groundwater sources of drinking water the literature on climate effects on geogenic contaminants was sparse there is substantial research on the links between water temperature and cyanobacteria blooms in surface waters although most studies were from two countries and did not examine potential effects on water treatment similarly studies modelling the impact of sea level rise on groundwater salinity mostly from south asia and the middle east did not discuss challenges for drinking water supplies we identified key future research priorities based on this review these include more studies on specific pathogens including opportunistic pathogens in water supplies and their relationships with climate variables more studies that assess likely relationships between climate variables and water treatment processes studies into the relationships between climate variables and geogenic contaminants including risks from heavy metals released as glacier retreat and research into the impacts of wildfires on water quality in lmics given the current dearth of studies but recognised importance graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords climate change cyanobacteria faecal contamination saltwater intrusion water quality 1 introduction climate change poses serious threats to drinking water and health mcmichael et al 2006 howard et al 2010 long term changes in temperature and rainfall patterns and sea level rise represent shifts in stresses that can affect water resource availability and quality jiménez cisneros et al 2014 ipcc 2021 floods droughts and windstorms pose short term threats in the form of infrastructure damage and loss of services howard et al 2016 globally outbreaks of infectious diseases following an extreme weather event have been commonly attributed to contaminated drinking water supplies and other deficits in water supply and sanitation alderman et al 2012 cann et al 2013 the world health organization who estimates an additional 48 000 deaths from diarrhoea will be caused by climate effects between 2030 and 2050 who 2014 with 60 of diarrhoea deaths in low and middle income countries currently attributed to inadequate water sanitation and hygiene wash prüss ustün et al 2019 understanding how slow and rapid onset climate events coupled with land use change and population growth affect drinking water is critical towards building resilience in the water sector and mitigating health impacts of climate change howard and bartram 2010 who 2017a previous reviews have synthesised qualitative evidence on the potential links between climate change and water quality delpla et al 2009 howard et al 2016 hunter 2003 khan et al 2015 levy et al 2016 paerl et al 2020 whitehead et al 2009 increased runoff and stormwater overflow from heavy rainfall over saturated catchments can transport pollutants to surface waters and cause an increase in pathogens turbidity nutrients and organic matter concentrations khan et al 2015 schijven and de roda husman 2005 surface waters receiving wastewater discharges may face additional challenges with increased intensity of rainfall jalliffier verne et al 2017 especially in areas werner et al 2012 with inadequate wastewater treatment pollutant concentrations in surface waters may decline due to decreased overland flow during extended dry spells or drought although the presence of point sources of pollution in the catchment can counter this effect mosley 2015 decreased reservoir volumes coupled with warmer temperatures and longer residence times can increase the risk of cyanobacterial blooms paerl et al 2020 decreased river flow and groundwater recharge in coastal areas can intensify seawater intrusion into aquifers already vulnerable because of sea level rise jiménez cisneros et al 2014 vallejos et al 2015 the effect of warmer ambient temperature on pathogen survival in source waters will depend on residence time depth and wind conditions and the temperature sensitivity of the pathogen schijven and de roda husman 2005 some pathogens such as vibrio cholerae may thrive better in a warmer environment vezzulli et al 2013 higher temperatures have been correlated with lower concentrations of enteroviruses cryptosporidium and giardia in surface waters in europe but flowrate and residence time were better predictors of pathogen concentration indicating a combined effect of rainfall and temperature schijven and de roda husman 2005 despite the comprehensive body of literature qualitatively summarising the links between climate change and water quality there are no reviews on the associations between water quality and quantitative measurements of climate variables focusing on low and middle income countries lmics water supplies in lmics typically rely on simpler technologies are not well resourced and may not have adequate water treatment with a projected increase in flooding in south and south east asia and drought in large parts of central africa increased pressure on water supplies is expected jiménez cisneros et al 2014 macdonald et al 2009 the increased vulnerability of lmics to climate change world bank 2010 demands a closer analysis of the potential impacts of climate change on water quality the effects of climate change on water quality are likely to be similar to those already observed in response to changes in temperature and rainfall jiménez cisneros et al 2014 there is strong quantitative evidence of seasonal changes in water quality in lmic settings but studies examining seasonal changes in water quality do not capture the impact of individual rainfall events which may cause short term contaminant spikes and skew seasonal averages kostyla et al 2015 as climate change is expected to lead to increased occurrence of extreme rain events understanding relationships between individual events and water quality will be essential in understanding the consequences of climate change furthermore the impact of slow onset events such as sea level rise or drought on water quality in lmics has not been reviewed to address this gap a scoping review of the available literature from lmics was undertaken investigating the relationships between observed water quality and climate variables and modelled changes in water quality based on climate change projections a scoping review was chosen because we wanted to explore a breadth of climate variables exposures and water quality threats outcomes scoping reviews are useful tools to map existing evidence and identify research gaps and to summarize studies with heterogeneous study design armstrong et al 2011 arksey and o malley 2005 the conceptual basis for the scoping review groups climate effects into 3 categories and shows how they cascade to water quality threats fig 1 we recognize that these relationships depend on the interventions around infrastructure and management that can mitigate the consequences of climate change for water quality 2 methods the scoping review was designed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma moher et al 2009 2 1 search strategy and inclusion criteria peer reviewed literature was searched in three databases pubmed scopus and web of science in may 2020 search terms included a combination of keywords related to climate variables and climate change and drinking water quality supplementary information table s1 and were chosen to reflect the potential climate change impacts depicted in fig 1 no restrictions were placed on date of publication studies from high income countries based on the world bank classification and those without titles abstracts or full text available in english were excluded studies were included in the review if they investigated the link between water quality and specified values of temperature or rainfall amounts measured within a specified period of time prior to sampling or modelled changes in water quality based on long term climate change projections reference lists of included papers were manually scanned and papers that met the inclusion criteria were included in the review studies were excluded if they reported only seasonal variation of water quality without quantitative measurements of temperature or rainfall if they investigated freshwater not used for drinking or investigated marine or brackish waters 2 2 quality of reporting studies included in the synthesis were assessed for the quality of reporting using the checklists in supplementary information table s2 the checklists were developed based on the collaboration for environmental evidence critical appraisal tool version 0 1 konno et al 2020 and nih national heart lung and blood institute s bethesda maryland usa quality assessment tool for observational cohort and cross sectional studies 2 3 data extraction relevant data on study location type of study climate variable rainfall temperature or climate event windstorm coastal storm surge sea level rise non climate variables and drinking water quality parameters was extracted for each study that met the inclusion criteria the findings from each paper were summarised given the heterogeneity of the studies and the measures reported we did not attempt meta analysis of the data 3 results 3 1 search results study characteristics and quality of reporting the database search generated 21 516 results fig 2 after removing duplicates both authors screened titles and abstracts and 143 studies were considered eligible for full text review the bibliographies of studies were searched during the full text review and an additional 57 studies were added manually in all 98 studies table s3 were included in the qualitative synthesis and 102 were excluded as they did not meet our inclusion criteria for the purpose of the qualitative synthesis the papers were categorised according to the water quality threat studied nineteen studies examined the links between microbiological quality specifically evidence of faecal contamination in source waters and rainfall of these three studies also considered the impact of ambient temperature fifty four studies reported observed or modelled associations between cyanobacterial in surface water used for drinking water supply and climate variables twenty one studies examined the impact of climate variables and change on the salinity of coastal aquifers used as drinking water sources salinity was expressed as electrical conductivity ec total dissolved solids tds or chloride cl concentrations four studies explored variability in geogenic contaminant arsenic and fluoride levels with rainfall the percentage of studies that fulfilled each criterion of the quality assessment are depicted in the supplementary information fig s1 a and b 81 of studies adequately reported methods that would allow for replication of the study while fewer than 20 of studies reported random sampling the rest of the studies collected samples at points of interest such as intakes of water treatment plants or at existing monitoring stations three quarters of the studies collected samples over a period of at least 12 months or during every season that exists in the study location we also included a criterion on whether the authors reported statistical measures of association 25 of the observational studies did not perform statistical tests and reported the relationship between exposure and outcome based on visual interpretation of plotted results while 81 of studies measured potential covariates e g non climate variables that could influence water quality only 65 of studies included them in the statistical analysis nearly 60 of the modelling studies chose exposure variables temperature rainfall or sea level rise based on historical trends or climate projections from general circulation models gcm to predict changes in water quality over 70 of studies used measured data to calibrate their model and a similar number included covariates in the model 3 2 microbiological quality the identified studies reported the microbiological water quality in spring sources well water and piped water supplies using faecal indicator organisms and in some cases pathogens the studies were predominantly from sub saharan africa and south asia despite the heterogeneity in location and source type a significant p 0 05 positive association was reported between antecedent rainfall and faecal indicator organisms and pathogens presence and concentration in the majority of the studies but there was mixed evidence on the association between temperature and contamination 3 2 1 antecedent rainfall groundwater quality in shallow wells was reported to respond rapidly to individual rainfall events significant correlation between thermotolerant coliform ttc count and amount of rainfall within 48 hours of sampling was reported for wells in uganda kulabako et al 2007 whereas in vanuatu the detection of e coli above 10 mpn 1 1 mpn most probable number 100 ml was statistically correlated with 24 h rainfall for wells equipped with a nira af 85 handpump but not for other hand pump types or motorised pumps foster et al 2019 barrell and rowland 1979 also reported an increase in faecal coliform fc another term for thermotolerant coliforms and faecal streptococci fs counts in wells with the onset of rains in the village of keneba in the gambia although no statistical analysis was reported in rural guatemala the concentration of e coli in shallow wells was reportedly 3 8 times higher at sites where rainfall had occurred 24 h before sample collection eisenhauer et al 2016 although this association was not statistically significant heavy rainfall defined as rainfall in the 90th percentile of reference data prior to sample collection led to deterioration in water quality of shallow wells the detection of cryptosporidium in wells in india was positively correlated with heavy rainfall 2 days prior to sampling daniels et al 2016 while the detection of e coli in wells in bangladesh was positively corelated to heavy rainfall occurring in the 7 15 and 30 days prior to sampling wu et al 2016 the concentration of e coli in the wells was significantly associated with the number of heavy rainfall days in the 3 day period prior to sampling only wu et al 2016 guo et al 2019 identified 2 rainfall related variables as predictors of e coli contamination in wells in tanzania the number of heavy rainfall days days with rainfall 10 mm in the 14 days prior to sampling and standardized precipitation index 2 2 spi measures how much wetter or drier the month is compared to normal conditions for that time of year spi spi had a stronger effect on e coli count in wells with handpumps compared to wells with motorized pumps on the other hand heavy rainfall within 14 days of sample collection was a better predictor of e coli count in wells with motorized pumps longer term rainfall averages also affected well water quality the median well water ttc levels 13 cfu 100 ml 3 3 cfu coliform forming unit were an order of magnitude higher than ttc levels 2 cfu 100 ml during months with above 40 mm rainfall compared to months with less than 40mm of rainfall in northern mozambique cronin et al 2006 nogueira et al 2003 also reported an increase in fc counts of well water with an increase in monthly rainfall amount although no statistical measures of association were reported lapworth et al 2020 found a statistically significant correlation between ttc levels in wells during the dry season and annual average rainfall in ethiopia malawi and uganda studies reported mixed results on the effect of rainfall on water quality in deep wells cryptosporidium or giardia detection in deep wells in india were not associated with short term or seasonal cumulative rainfall patterns daniels et al 2016 engström et al 2015 reported a similar lack of correlation between contamination ttc in deep boreholes and short term rainfall in south sudan however there was a significant association between contamination and long term rainfall depth 5 day and monthly cumulative antecedent rainfall was linked to faecal contamination in protected springs in uganda howard et al 2003 taylor et al 2009b correlation between median ttc count and amount of rainfall in the 24 h and 48 h before sample collection was attributed to the rapid recharge of protected springs howard et al 2003 taylor et al 2009b detected more than 103 cfu 100 ml ttc in spring water within one hour of rainfall when the daily rainfall exceeded 5 mm day more intense rainfall exceeding 20 mm day was associated with even higher contamination 104 cfu 100 ml taylor et al 2009b levels of fs were also strongly correlated with 24 h and 48 h rainfall amounts howard et al 2003 spikes in faecal contamination in springs within an hour of commencement of rainfall were also reported by buckerfield et al 2019 in southwest china and water quality remained impaired 1 to 4 days after rainfall while nogueira et al 2003 found an increase in fc counts of spring water with an increase in monthly rainfall amount no statistical measures of association were reported heavy rainfalls at the end of drought have been linked to faecal contamination of groundwater in ethiopia during the el nino 2015 16 drought macdonald et al 2019 the three types of the sources examined springs boreholes with handpumps and hand dug wells had negligible contamination during the dry spell but were contaminated with ttc during the first rainfall marking the end of the drought the water quality improved after the first flush and did not deteriorate during the heavy rains later in the year short term rainfall effects were reported for piped water systems in multiple studies the presence of faecal contamination indicated by a positive result using the h2s rapid test manja et al 1982 in public standpipes connected to mechanized boreholes and an elevated storage tank in rural india was significantly correlated with a heavy rainfall event rainfall in the 80th percentile of observed values in the study period 1 to 7 days before sample collection but not with heavy rain 8 to 14 days prior mertens et al 2019 similarly e coli levels in tap samples in an intermittent water supply in india were statistically higher when rain had occurred within 24h of sample collection kumpel and nelson 2013 in tanzania both spi and heavy rainfall rainfall 10mm within 14 days of sample collection led to higher e coli counts in samples collected from public taps samples from water piped to the house was not strongly affected by either climate variable guo et al 2019 cumulative rainfall was also significantly associated with the number of contaminated tap samples reported with both weekly and monthly rainfall amounts affecting water quality bastaraud et al 2020 reported on the results of a 32 year monitoring program of the urban piped water supply in antananarivo madagascar the number of contaminated samples were correlated with the amount of weekly rainfall sulfite reducing clostridia src and intestinal enterococci ie were detected after four and five weeks of cumulative rainfall while no correlations were found between cumulative rainfall and e coli the relatively small number of positive samples could have affected the performance of the statistical model in brazil the percentage of samples positive for faecal coliforms fc increased with monthly rainfall amount for both chlorinated and unchlorinated tap samples although no statistical measures of correlation were reported nogueira et al 2003 j nkanga 1980 reported the combined effects of rainfall and hazards in the distribution system on piped water quality in benin city nigeria an anti microbial resistant strain of e coli artificially introduced into the sewers was detected in tap water samples from households near the septic drainage field confirming sewage contamination in the water supply the concentration of the detected strain varied with rainfall amounts in the 7 day prior to sampling but no statistical measures of association were reported j nkanga 1980 3 2 2 temperature three studies reported on the effect of temperature on levels of faecal indicator bacteria detection of e coli in wells in rural bangladesh was more likely with higher mean temperatures in the 7 and 15 day period prior to sampling concentration of e coli was positively correlated with the number of hot days days with temperature in the 90th percentile of reference data in the 7 and 15 day period before sampling but negatively with the average temperature in the 3 day period prior to sampling wu et al 2016 in tanzania the only temperature variable to be correlated with e coli counts in piped water and wells was daily minimum temperature guo et al 2019 the percentage of samples positive for faecal coliforms fc in a piped water supply in brazil increased with increase in water temperature for both chlorinated and unchlorinated samples from piped water supply protected springs and private wells although no statistical measures of correlation were reported nogueira et al 2003 3 3 cyanobacteria 3 3 1 observational studies the most frequently reported proxy for cyanobacteria biomass was chlorophyll a concentration several studies reported positive correlations between ambient or water temperature and chlorophyll levels during a cyanobacteria bloom although this association varied with the temperature range over the study period thermal stratification and nutrient levels in the water column and the dominant cyanobacteria genus berger et al 2006 deutsch and alameddine 2019 hennemann and petrucio 2016 hoang et al 2018 li et al 2018a ni et al 2012 touati et al 2019 wang et al 2013 yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2016 chlorophyll a levels were also directly correlated with cumulative rainfall 15 days prior to sampling li et al 2018b and negatively correlated with reservoir volume under drought conditions rocha et al 2018 cyanobacteria abundance cells ml or biomass mg l and temperature were positively correlated across climate zones in temperate lu et al 2013 luo et al 2019 tian et al 2012 sub tropical duong et al 2013 khuram et al 2017 lv et al 2014 and tropical lakes and reservoirs dao et al 2016 ni et al 2012 xu et al 2010 the most frequently detected cyanobacteria genera were microcystis barros et al 2019 dao et al 2016 deng et al 2014 li et al 2017 jiang et al 2014 major et al 2018 mankiewicz boczek et al 2015 mhlanga et al 2006 nasri et al 2007 touati et al 2019 xu et al 2010 anabaena now known as dolichospermum dao et al 2016 duong et al 2013 jiang et al 2014 li et al 2018a guo et al 2018 major et al 2018 ni et al 2012 otten and paerl 2011 wu et al 2006 yu et al 2014 and cylindrospermopsis berger et al 2006 bouvy et al 1999 2000 2003 major et al 2018 several studies reported a positive correlation between temperature and microcystis biomass duong et al 2013 li et al 2017 liu et al 2011 touati et al 2019 xu et al 2010 zhao et al 2019 deng et al 2014 and guo et al 2017 observed that temperature was the critical factor controlling microcystis density cells ml once the nutrient thresholds were exceeded anabaena biomass was correlated only with photosynthetically active radiation but not water temperature li et al 2018a wu et al 2006 zhang et al 2016 c raciborskii was the dominant cylindrospermopsis species detected in studies but its biomass was also not associated with temperature in several locations bouvy et al 1999 2000 lei et al 2014 microcystin mc toxins predominantly mc rr mc yr and mc lr major et al 2018 were isolated from microcystis species and some anabaena species otten and paerl 2011 while strains of c raciborskii were associated with the toxin cylindrospermopsin cyn lei et al 2014 the association between mc concentrations and temperature was inconsistent across studies amé et al 2003 barros et al 2019 dao et al 2016 duong et al 2013 li et al 2017 mankiewicz boczek et al 2015 nasri et al 2007 ni et al 2012 wu et al 2006 yu et al 2014 and depended on the dominant cyanobacterial species present high mc levels were generally associated with toxic m aeruginosa and m flos aquae species chen et al 2009 mohamed et al 2015 otten and paerl 2011 wang et al 2002 found that the relationship between mc concentration and temperature depended on the type of toxin present with only mc yr significantly correlated with temperature similar mixed results were also reported across studies on association between temperature and cyn levels barros et al 2019 lei et al 2014 the impact of rainfall on cyanobacteria blooms was closely linked to the amount of thermal destratification induced by the event and prevalent temperature conditions autumn rainfall in a deep reservoir in china was associated with an absence of blooms the following summer because input sediment load with a higher density than existing bottom layers in the reservoir led to de stratification of the water column li et al 2015 in contrast guo et al 2018 reported that the sequence of heavy rains which transported large amounts of nutrients into the river followed by hot and dry weather causing reduced river inflow triggered a large bloom in qianting river in china bloom duration in lake taihu increased with decrease in precipitation and wind speed between 1987 and 2009 but was not significantly correlated with annual averages of temperature or precipitation zhang et al 2012 half of the cyanobacterial blooms in lake taihu between 2007 and 2015 occurred within 4 days following extreme rainfall events with strong winds yang et al 2016 typhoons had a similar impact on cyanobacterial blooms after an initial disruption immediately following the typhoon blooms reappeared with higher biomass zhu et al 2014 and covered a larger area chen et al 2020 than before the typhoon but gradually reduced several days after it had passed few studies examined the impact of cyanobacteria on drinking water supplies toxin levels mc lr and mc rr in nile river source water at the treatment plant intake in damietta city egypt were positively correlated with temperature but the temperature dependence of toxin removal efficiency of water treatment steps was not explored mohamed et al 2015 toxin levels in domestic reservoirs receiving water from the treatment plant exceeded the who guideline value 1 µg l mc lr and were also correlated with temperature mohamed et al 2016 nasri et al 2007 found no temperature dependence of toxin levels at the raw water intake in cheffia dam algeria but did not explore associations between efficiency of toxin removal and temperature 3 3 2 modelling studies in models developed by zhu et al 2018 temperature was a good predictor of cyanobacteria biomass in lake erhai used to supply drinking water to dali city in china longyang 2019 modelled effects of increasing temperatures on blooms in a deep lake in southeast china and found that an increase in autumn and winter temperatures had a bigger impact on chlorophyll a concentrations than summer temperatures since summer conditions are already favourable for cyanobacteria growth climate change under rcp 8 5 was projected to impact cyanobacteria blooms through an increase in surface water temperature and extended thermal stratification in the summer especially in the long term 2070 2099 tang et al 2015 compared to the baseline year 2005 the blooms were also projected to cover a larger area in the lake and last longer simulations by shan et al 2020 predicted that an increase in water temperature would lower the nutrient nitrogen and phosphorus thresholds required to limit blooms and maintain the mc concentration below the who guideline of 1 µg l these thresholds varied across lakes in china similar trends were presented by huo et al 2019 for lakes across china under rcp 2 6 4 5 6 0 and 8 5 scenarios in the worst case scenario under rcp 8 5 a 4 8 and 37 reduction in thresholds for total nitrogen and total phosphorous respectively would be required to prevent bloom formation huo et al 2019 3 4 groundwater salinity 3 4 1 observational studies the observational studies on saltwater intrusion in coastal and island groundwaters were predominantly from south asia akter et al 2020 found a weak statistical correlation between groundwater salinity and land surface temperature lst and moderate correlation between salinity and potential evapotranspiration pet in coastal bangladesh thilagavathi et al 2017 reported no association between annual average rainfall and groundwater electrical conductivity ec in pondicherry india based on seasonal data collected over a ten year period from 2006 to 2016 however no statistical measures of correlation were reported and no consistent trends in long term average annual rainfall were detected at the study setting sreekesh et al 2018 found evidence of coastal erosion and sea level rise along the coast of kerala india annual rate of erosion was correlated with increase in ec and total dissolved solids tds of groundwater in a study across comoros islands kenya and tanzania comte et al 2016 observed a correlation between tds and annual rainfall only in volcanic aquifers indicating the effect of geology on the response of water quality to rainfall chattopadhyay and singh 2013 analysed groundwater quality in the lakshadweep islands in the western indian ocean during above and below average 30 annual rainfall conditions wells near the coast had the highest tds 1400 to 2300 mg l indicating slight to moderate salinity during the drier year in comparison the highest tds reported during years with above average rainfall in the same wells was 900 mg l wells towards the centre of the island had 600 mg l tds in both years suggesting higher vulnerability of groundwater along the rim of the island gingerich et al 2017 studied the impact of a coastal storm in the republic of marshall islands during a period of regional sea level rise linked to the el niño southern oscillation enso seawater flooding caused by the storm swell increased chloride concentrations in well waters from 53 195 mg l to 10 080 20 880 mg l seawater cl concentration was 19 600 mg l these concentrations were reduced to 1800 3990 mg l after ten days however it took 22 months for the concentrations to reduce to pre flood levels aided by artificial recharge with rainwater that began seven months after the flood 3 4 2 modelling studies modelling studies predicted saltwater intrusion caused by an inland shift of the freshwater saltwater transition zone and land surface inundation in coastal aquifers and shrinking of island freshwater lens sathish and elango 2019 sefelnasr and sherif 2014 aquifers with higher hydraulic conductivity in coastal argentina carretero et al 2013 and smaller hydraulic gradients in the nile delta aquifer sherif and singh 1999 were more susceptible to saltwater intrusion than aquifers with lower hydraulic conductivity or larger hydraulic gradient increased groundwater extraction was predicted to increase saltwater intrusion caused by sea level rise in coastal argentina carretero et al 2013 simulations by abd elhamid et al 2016a 2016b abdelaty et al 2014 and mabrouk et al 2018 for different parts of the nile delta aquifer in egypt detected comparable or greater landward shifts from increased groundwater pumping than from sea level rise the freshwater lens in kish island in iran was projected to shrink by less than 10 under three sea level rise scenarios 0 1 and 4m this effect became more pronounced with decreased groundwater recharge but could potentially be offset through increasing recharge by 20 mahmoodzadeh et al 2014 similarly reducing groundwater extraction to 50 of current rates was projected to offset the loss of freshwater resources in the nile delta aquifer caused by 0 1 m sea level rise abd elhamid et al 2016a and 0 5m sea level rise but not 1m sea level rise sefelnasr and sherif 2014 the simulated groundwater salinity of wells in coastal karnataka in india in the year 2034 considering 1 mm year sea level rise 50 decrease in recharge and 200 increase in extraction was similar to the salinity increase caused by just the changes in recharge and extraction relative to baseline conditions in 2014 lathashri and mahesha 2016 sea level rise of 1 2m in the bay of bengal was predicted to increase salinity at the intake of a water treatment plant in the coastal city of chittagong bangladesh from the current level of 1 parts per thousand ppt to between 2 and 2 5 ppt akhter et al 2012 in the laccadive islands off the western coast of india sea level rise of 0 05 and 0 1m was projected to shrink the freshwater lens in the centre of the island by 28 and 60 respectively bobba et al 2000 the lens thickness on the outer rim of the island was projected to decrease to zero implying mixing of freshwater and seawater this is similar to the observed findings of chattopadhyay and singh 2013 for the same group of islands okello et al 2015 modelled the freshwater lens on lamu island in kenya in the 2090s with estimates of local sea level rise derived from the global mean projections of 0 43m and 0 48m for a1b and a2 emissions scenarios nakicenovic et al 2000 respectively the volume of the freshwater lens was projected to increase by 60 under a1b scenario in contrast a2 conditions were expected to shrink the volume by 78 this difference was attributed to the increased potential evapotranspiration caused by the higher average temperatures under a2 as compared to a1b while monthly precipitation was projected to increase under both scenarios the higher temperatures under a2b had a drastic impact on the simulated groundwater quantity and quality 3 5 geogenic contaminants rodríguez et al 2004 reported an inverse relationship between arsenic concentration and monthly mean precipitation amount in zimapán valley in mexico while tathagata and rolee 2011 reported an inverse relationship between arsenic concentrations and mean seasonal rainfall amounts in west bengal no statistical analysis was reported in either study contrary to these findings gonçalves et al 2007 found a positive association between monthly rainfall amount and arsenic concentrations in ouro preto brazil although no statistical measures were reported only one study was identified that explored the relationship between rainfall and fluoride concentrations in groundwater davraz et al 2008 indicated that the fluoride content of spring water in turkey decreased during months with rainfall but did not report statistical measures of association 4 discussion 4 1 summary of evidence rainfall was the most frequently reported predictor of microbiological contamination the majority of studies identified were of small point sources of water supply generally from groundwater these supplies tend to use simple technologies and often lack adequate sanitary protection and water treatment making them more susceptible to contamination the reviewed studies showed that such supplies respond rapidly to heavy rainfall which can cause elevated contamination through rapid recharge of shallow groundwater or contaminants being washed into shallow sources with faulty headworks daniels et al 2016 howard et al 2003 macdonald et al 2019 taylor et al 2009b heavy rainfalls following drought are likely to cause first flush contaminant spikes in rural areas as waste accumulates near sources during the prolonged dry period macdonald et al 2019 differences in climate predictors of faecal contamination between urban and rural settings pointed to variation in patterns of faecal loading buckerfield et al 2019 guo et al 2019 although further investigation of these effects is needed deterioration in water quality was also closely linked to population density howard et al 2003 presence of animals at the study site daniels et al 2016 groundwater level and ponding at the source kulabako et al 2007 and percentage of developed area around sources wu et al 2016 the associations with topography local hydrogeology and land use daniels et al 2016 engström et al 2015 wu et al 2016 have important implications for improving resilience of water and sanitation services to climate change these factors combined with lack of disinfection would suggest such water supplies will be the most vulnerable under climate change it is quite likely that the nearly 800 million people living in lmics who lack access to even a basic water supply will get access only to such shared community managed water supplies as a first step in improving access to water supply the evidence of this review suggests that greater attention must be paid to disinfecting water from such point sources most likely through household water treatment it would be preferable however to focus on moving people to higher levels of water supply service that include disinfection who 2017b and preferably to continuous safely managed piped water at home howard 2021 evidence from the reviewed studies indicates that even chlorinated water supplies may be vulnerable to contamination with public taps responding to rainfall and temperature more strongly than water piped to the house especially when hazards are present near the distribution network guo et al 2019 nogueira et al 2003 j nkanga 1980 note that damaged pipes passing through septic tank drain fields led to high levels of contamination in piped water supplies during heavy rainfall this threat is reinforced from other studies that note that the risk of disease from contaminated water in a large utility in uganda was primarily driven by contamination in distribution systems howard et al 2006b intermittent supplies which serve about 1 billion people in lmics are also susceptible to seasonal deterioration in water quality bivins et al 2017 etchie et al 2014 kumpel and nelson 2013 the implication of these findings is that management of piped water supplies in lmics will need to substantially improve if they are to cope with the additional threats from climate change the studies on cyanobacterial blooms in water supply reservoirs predominantly focused on temperature as the exposure variable and its effect on the dominant cyanobacteria genus nutrient levels and temperature range observed during the study cyanobacteria blooms can be expected to occur more frequently under a warming climate because their growth is optimized at higher temperatures while the growth of other primary producers levels off or declines as temperatures exceed 25 c paerl and paul 2012 warmer conditions also intensify thermal stratification in lakes and reservoirs which gives a further advantage to buoyant cyanobacteria species paerl and paul 2012 temperature effects on toxin production varied between studies and seemed to depend on the specific genus and type of toxin present barros et al 2019 wang et al 2002 but not on the climate zone of the lake or reservoir dao et al 2016 mankiewicz boczek et al 2015 nasri et al 2007 heavy rainfall and windstorms led to a temporary release of nutrients from resuspended sediments in shallow lakes and transported blooms through the lake causing blooms to reappear after an initial disruption during the event chen et al 2020 yang et al 2016 zhu et al 2014 the effect on bloom formation seemed to depend on the weather conditions immediately after the event and the amount of thermal destratification caused by it guo et al 2018 li et al 2015 li et al 2018b decreased rainfall under future climate change may reduce nutrient input from non point pollution on the other hand more intense rainfall and windstorms can increase nutrient transport and sediment resuspension but also cause mixing and thermal destratification chorus and welker 2021 therefore the effect of climate change on cyanobacteria blooms and their toxicity may vary between locations depending on nutrient availability local climate patterns and type of bloom forming strains present studies projected stricter control over nitrogen and phosphorus input into surface waters to minimise bloom formation guo et al 2017 huo et al 2019 shan et al 2020 especially where warmer winters are expected longyang 2019 annual rainfall was the only climate variable significantly associated with coastal aquifer salinity in the observational studies chattopadhyay and singh 2013 comte et al 2016 thilagavathi et al 2017 however the lack of long term climate or water quality data limited the strength of evidence presented in these studies sea level rise akhter et al 2012 carratero et al 2013 sherif and singh 1999 long term changes in precipitation lathashri and mahesha 2016 razack et al 2019 zhao et al 2016 and evapotranspiration okello et al 2015 were projected to cause a gradual increase in salinity of coastal groundwater and a decrease in the volume of freshwater increase in sea level and changes in aquifer recharge can lower the hydraulic head of the aquifer relative to seawater and seaward groundwater flux causing the freshwater saltwater interface to shift inland werner et al 2012 however as multiple studies reported the overexploitation of groundwater is projected to have a comparable or greater effect on saltwater intrusion than sea level rise and maintaining current levels of groundwater recharge and pumping will be essential to mitigate these effects literature on geogenic contamination and climate variables that met our inclusion criteria was scarce and none of the studies included reported statistical measures of association this precludes any inferences on the likely effects of climate change multiple studies have reported temporal variations in arsenic concentrations with season and groundwater levels pointing to possible links with recharge in some locations but the reported trends are not uniform cheng et al 2005 savarimuthu et al 2006 4 2 limitations of the review there are a number of limitations with this scoping review some papers with titles and full text in spanish and portuguese were rejected over language which may have led to an under representation of studies form south and central america furthermore no studies in chinese or russian were identified in the search which may have excluded work from china and countries in the former soviet union respectively the search was limited to studies in peer reviewed journals and did not include technical reports or articles published in magazines of engineering societies or other professional organizations this may have excluded reports on effects of temperature and rainfall on water quality from utilities and engineering firms there was over representation of certain geographical areas in the included studies the studies on cyanobacteria were overwhelmingly from two countries brazil and china despite reports of cyanobacteria blooms from india and 21 countries across africa d silva et al 2012 ndlela et al 2016 few studies reported quantitative measurements of temperature or rainfall and therefore did not meet our inclusion criteria 4 3 recommendations for research there is a need for further research that investigates the relationships between pathogens and climate variables and to produce more accurate estimates of public health risks this may include improving quantitative microbial risk assessment models for water supplies in lmics that can be linked to climate models given advances in analytical techniques and increasing capacity in lmics there are greater opportunities for such studies to be undertaken relying on faecal indicator bacteria alone will likely under estimate the potential impact of climate change on water quality given that viral and protozoan pathogens in particular have very different survival rates in untreated water and resistance to water treatment processes betancourt and rose 2004 pedley et al 2006 there are also clear needs for further research on the relationships between piped water and climate variables in lmics given increasing rates of access to piped systems this should include investigation of the likely impact of climate change on biofilm and opportunistic pathogens increasing ambient temperatures and source waters with high nutrient loads may well result in increasing issues with biofilms in lmics hallam et al 2001 liu et al 2016 and this would therefore seem to be an important area of future research no studies examining the implications for drinking water treatment met our inclusion criteria despite the strong qualitative evidence of the potential impacts for water supply and need for adaptation delpla et al 2009 therefore research into how climate change may affect water treatment and groundwater protection requirements is a further priority further research into the links between temperature and toxin production and the effect of temperature on nutrient thresholds is needed at the reservoir level as these associations are often location specific actions to prevent an increase in algal blooms will be important in part because cyanobacteria have been associated with pathogens like pseudomonas aeruginosa legionella pneumophila and vibrio cholerae bomo et al 2011 chaturvedi et al 2015 taylor et al 2009a in addition algal blooms pose challenges for water treatment newcombe et al 2021 no studies were identified on the implications of cyanobacterial blooms for water treatment processes blooms have been known to cause taste and odour problems in treated water accumulate in sludge beds and release toxins and increase potential for disinfection by product dbp formation khan et al 2015 zamyadi et al 2012 2013 the removal of cyanotoxins and taste odour and colour producing compounds may require optimizing existing water treatment processes and additional processes such as granular activated carbon or membrane filtration thus increasing treatment costs the cost effectiveness of additional water treatment over better catchment management and nutrient control in lmic settings warrants more attention the studies on saltwater intrusion did not directly consider the implications for drinking water supplies in affected areas although all locations in the studies reported relying substantially on groundwater for domestic supply given the emerging evidence that increasing salinity in drinking water may be linked to health problems including hypertension and pre eclampsia khan et al 2011 vineis et al 2011 further work in this area is warranted unlike high income countries coastal communities in lmics may not have access to expensive desalinization processes and managed aquifer recharge may be a more cost effective adaptation option this is gaining increasing attention in countries such as bangladesh with increasingly saline groundwater and polluted surface water but feasibility systems require careful assessment naus et al 2021 naser et al 2021 found that people consuming mar water had higher urinary sodium and higher blood pressure than those continuing to rely on surface water sources and concluded that mar should not be promoted as a routine water supply option such risk substitutions have been identified before in bangladesh in relation to arsenic howard 2003 but the risks with microbiological contamination tend to substantially outweigh those associated with chemical contaminants howard et al 2006a the limited geographical range of the studies also suggest for greater attention particularly in parts of coastal africa that are affected by major windstorms between 94 to 220 million people worldwide are potentially exposed to high arsenic concentrations in groundwater of which over 94 live in asia podgorski and berg 2020 and a similar number is estimated to rely on groundwater with elevated levels of fluoride mostly in north africa and asia amini et al 2008 edmunds and smedley 2013 given the global importance of groundwater for drinking supply further research into potential effects of climate change is warranted furthermore evidence from the andes of water quality deterioration linked to glacier recession fortner et al 2011 guittard et al 2020 suggests more research into the effect of climate change on chemical water quality in glaciated river basins is also needed the potential for wildfires is expected to increase in parts of asia and africa liu et al 2010 but no studies from lmics were identified on the potential impact on water supplies from forested catchments since hotter dryer conditions are expected to increase in several lmics research is needed into the effects of wildfires on water quality especially considering the effects of peak runoff events finally we found few studies discussing the impact of multi year drought on water quality as several lmics are projected to face greater rainfall variability and may suffer from longer dry spells including drought this is an important area for future work 5 conclusions there is a growing body of evidence on the threats of climate change to water supplies in lmics changing rainfall and temperature patterns are likely to exacerbate existing challenges around safe water provision across source types and settings climate threats to water quality were either closely influenced by or in some cases exceeded by the threats from population growth poor sanitary protection and poor catchment management the vulnerability of many simple point sources of water is of concern given the large numbers of people continuing to rely on such water supplies and the prospect that millions more may only be offered such water supplies in the medium term that these water supplies are already highly vulnerable to climatic variables suggest even greater attention is needed to provide safely managed water at people s houses preferably via piped networks managed by regulated suppliers given the evidence that climate change is likely to lead to more intense rainfall and dry periods ipcc 2021 these relationships suggest that without action water quality will further deteriorate with climate change this demonstrates the urgent need to consider climate factors and climate change in the planning and operation of water supplies this will require improvements in long term monitoring water quality sampling immediately following climate events and wider uptake of risk management tools like water safety plans this review also identified key areas of research that can strengthen our
