8980,yield and fruit quality of greenhouse tomatoes vary in response to alternate partial root zone irrigation apri however little is known about whether and how these responses differ in different trusses in a multi truss tomato production system this study investigated the response of fruit yield and quality of five trusses indicated as t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 from the bottom to the top canopy to irrigation method conventional irrigation ic and alternate partial root zone irrigation ia and irrigation volume full irrigation w0 2 3 full irrigation w1 and 1 3 full irrigation w2 in a two year greenhouse trial in the arid region of northwest china results showed that both commercial fruit and non commercial fruit yields decreased from t1 to t5 across all treatments under w1 ia significantly increased single fruit weight sfw at t5 by 16 81 17 31 and no significant effect on n compared to ic in both years but other trusses had no significant responses under w2 ia significantly decreased ncf yield in t2 t5 compared to ic without significant effect on cf yield and the decrease tended to become larger as truss position increased in 2018 2019 while such pattern was not observed in 2019 2020 lycopene content lyc increased from t1 to t5 by about two fold lyc were higher under ia than under ic regardless of irrigation amounts and trusses in both years even though the increase was not

permanent wilting point 1 introduction tomato solanum lycopersicum l is the second most grown and consumed vegetable crop worldwide and it is popular as the fruit is good flavored and rich in vitamins and antioxidants e g lycopene that are known to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cancer canene adams et al 2005 rice evans et al 1996 it is a high value crop widely grown in a multiple truss system in greenhouses to provide year round vegetables essential for the human diet in many regions of the world bogale et al 2016b chadirin et al 2008 wang et al 2011a the production cycle of multi truss tomatoes can last for seven month or even longer wang et al 2011a and the fruit growth stage of different trusses overlap chadirin et al 2008 wang et al 2011a multi truss tomato plants in greenhouses are highly water demanding and hence there is a growing interest to optimize water use to ensure sustainable crop production du et al 2015 water scarcity is increasingly becoming a serious impediment to sustainable agriculture under global climate change deficit irrigation which emerged as one of water saving agricultural techniques medrano et al 2012 has been gaining in popularity in water limited regions du et al 2015 hence a better understanding of the truss specific yield and quality responses is essential for implementing the technique deficit irrigation di in which irrigation water less than plants actually require is applied to the entire root system is considered a promising strategy for improving crop water use efficiency wue in the presence of water scarcity bogale et al 2016a du et al 2015 alternate partial root zone irrigation apri is also a water saving technique zegbe domínguez et al 2004 2003a in which water is supplied to only one part of the root system with the other part being left dry at a time and the wet dry parts are alternated to prevent excessive soil drying jovanovic and stikic 2018 romero et al 2014 apri can be applied during a specific growth period or the entire growth period jovanovic and stikic 2018 and with different irrigation volumes kirda et al 2004 apri has been reported to improve wue without significantly reducing yield in grapevine chaves et al 2007 cotton du et al 2006 wheat sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 sunflower sezen et al 2011 maize kaman and kırda 2017 and tomato zegbe domínguez et al 2004 crops compared to conventional di apri has been reported to result in a stronger root to shoot aba signaling at the same irrigation volume probably because water is more dynamic in the rhizosphere of apri dodd et al 2011 adoption of apri could potentially make substantial contribution to water conservation in many water limiting regions in the world wang et al 2013 zegbe domínguez et al 2003a the mechanism underlying apri is that the roots on the dry side produce a chemical signal abscisic acid aba which is transported via the xylem to aboveground parts e g leaves and fruits aba transported to leaves is known to reduce stomatal conductance and hence reduce transpiration without sacrificing photosynthetic product accumulation du et al 2008 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 unlike leaves the effect of the xylem borne aba signal on fruit depends on the developmental stage of the fruit davies et al 2000 the tomato fruit is generally believed to rely on xylem water supply in the early stage while it is primarily dependent on phloem water supply in the late developmental stage suggesting that the transmission of the xylem borne signals to the fruit may be effective in the early stage but limited in the late stage davies et al 2000 although the theory of apri on fruit has not been fully understood a number of studies have documented the effects of apri on tomato yield and fruit quality jovanovic and stikic 2018 it has been widely reported that apri has many benefits compared to full irrigation it has been found that fruit yield was reduced by only 13 8 with alternate irrigation treatments compared to conventional irrigation while water use efficiency as a ratio of marketable fruit yield and irrigation water applied was greatly improved and fruit quality was significantly improved bogale et al 2016b bogale et al 2016a found that rdi and apri significantly decreased total tomato yield by 24 2 37 4 but notably increased wue as compared to full irrigation regardless of tomato variety while vitamin c and lycopene contents significantly increased only at one of two tomato variety and the other was significantly lower bogale et al 2016b found that compared to full irrigation apri and di had no significant effect on tomato yield fruit number per plant and fruit size increased wue by 36 7 and 26 1 respectively and increased soluble solids and titratable acid content several studies have compared the effects of apri and di on tomato yield quality and wue bogale et al 2016a kirda et al 2004 sun et al 2014 zegbe et al 2007 in order to know whether apri has an advantage over di apri did not improve tomato yield but significantly increased soluble sugar and organic acid concentrations compared to di sun et al 2014 however no significant difference was observed between apri and di in terms of yield fruit color and soluble solids zegbe domínguez et al 2003a similarly kirda et al 2004 also showed no significant difference between apri and di in yield and fruit size at the same irrigation volume shu et al 2020 investigated the effects of different soil water thresholds on tomato plant growth and fruit quality under alternate drip irrigation conditions and found that with low irrigation tomato yield and harvest index were significantly reduced even with alternate irrigation but fruit quality e g soluble sugar vitamin c sugar acid ratio was significantly improved while regulating irrigation water to the best effect of alternate irrigation by maintaining soil water content around 70 of field water holding capacity to save water and improve quality it is worth noting that the effect of truss position was not considered in the comparisons between di and apri both di and apri can produce a mild water stress affecting plant water relations chalmers et al 1986 wakrim et al 2005 but both may result in different growth responses due to different mechanisms especially in multi truss greenhouse tomatoes where fruit yield and quality may vary across different trusses many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of di and apri applied to greenhouse tomatoes for water conservation and yield stabilization campos et al 2009 casa and rouphael 2014 however little attention has been paid to how yield and fruit quality of different trusses in multi truss greenhouse tomatoes respond to apri although some researchers had studied the response of tomato fruit quality in different truss to various inducing factors ávila juárez and miranda rodríguez 2018 chadirin et al 2008 rocci et al 2005 based on the above the response of greenhouse tomatoes to apri in terms of yield and fruit quality may differ depending on truss positions in this study we designed a two year field experiment with two irrigation methods conventional irrigation and alternate partial root zone irrigation at three irrigation volumes full irrigation 2 3 full irrigation and 1 3 full irrigation aiming to reveal the effects of different irrigation methods and irrigation amounts on tomato yield and fruit quality in five trusses at different positions in tomato plants this study will provide an in depth understanding of the effects of irrigation treatments on fruit yield and quality and the regulatory mechanisms facilitating the development of precise irrigation strategies for determining the best production technology for greenhouse tomatoes 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the experimental site a greenhouse irrigation experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city latitude 37 52ˊn longitude 102 52ˊe gansu province in two consecutive winter seasons from october 2018 to april 2019 and from october 2019 to march 2020 this region is characterized by a temperate continental climate average annual precipitation 164 4 mm pan evaporation 2000 mm mean temperature 8 8 c mean sunshine duration 3000 h frost free period 150 d the groundwater table in this region is below 25 m the greenhouse used for the experiment is 76 m 8 m in size and orientated in east west direction the planting area in the greenhouse was 428 m2 and the soil was irrigated desert soil with an average soil bulk density of 1 41 g cm3 in 0 100 cm field moisture capacity θ fc of 0 33 cm3 cm3 and permanent wilting point θ pwp of 0 119 cm3 cm3 plants were drip irrigated with groundwater with an electrical conductivity ec of 0 53 ds m 2 2 crop management the tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill plants used in the two year trial were pink jubilee series which are indeterminate fresh market tomato varieties widely cultivated in the region seedlings were grown at a local nursery and transplanted to the trial plots on october 21 in the 2018 2019 trial and on october 27 in the 2019 2020 trial when 3 4 leaves appeared the soil in the greenhouse was rototilled before transplanting and 120 t ha of well rotted organic manure sheep manure and 130 kg ha of compound fertilizer n 22 p2o5 28 k 2 o 18 were applied as base fertilizer and evenly tilled on the soil surface 0 10 cm after transplanting the tomato seedlings were watered with 26 53 mm planting water in 2018 2019 and 28 00 mm planting water in 2019 2020 to ensure healthy growth polyethylene film 0 005 mm thick was placed on the soil surface to reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature starting from 30 days after transplanting when early flowering and fruit set occurred stems were trained with support strings and the flowers were hand pollinated using 60 micromolar p chlorophenoxyacetic acid spray each tomato plant was trained to keep five trusses referred to as t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 from the bottom to the top and each truss had 4 5 fruits all agronomic management procedures such as fertilization hanging pollination and forking were the same in all treatments except for irrigation 2 3 experimental design the experiment was conducted in a split zone experimental design with two variables irrigation method i and irrigation volume w irrigation method i was set as the main zone with two levels conventional deficit irrigation ic and alternate partial root zone irrigation ia irrigation volume w was set as the split zone with three levels full irrigation w0 i e 90 75 of θ fc 2 3 full irrigation w1 1 3 full irrigation w2 the upper and lower limits of irrigation in this experiment were determined according to chen et al 2013 each treatment has three replications four drip irrigation strips were laid in each plot as shown in fig 1 with ic treatment irrigating 1 2 3 and 4 drip strips each time and ia treatment irrigating 1 and 3 drip strips this time and 2 and 4 drip strips next time alternately the tomato plant spacing was set at 40 cm and the row spacing was 40 cm and the average planting density was 6 73 plants m2 each trial plot was 5 2 m long by 1 2 m wide at the same time pvc access pipes were installed near the middle of 2 and 3 and the soil water content of the test plots was monitored every 5 days before and after irrigation using a portable soil moisture monitoring system diviner 2000 sentek pty ltd australia irrigation was started when the average soil moisture content within the wetted layer 0 60 cm of the fully irrigated w0 soil plan reached 75 2 of θ fc with an upper limit of 90 2 of θ fc the irrigation volume i mm at each watering is calculated using the following formula qiu et al 2011 wang et al 2011b 1 i 0 9 θ fc θ i h 0 5 1000 in eq 1 i is the irrigation water mm θ fc is the field capacity cm3 cm3 θ i is the average soil water content of the i soil layer before irrigation cm3 cm3 h is the planned moisture layer i e 0 6 m 0 5 is soil moisture ratio tomato growth was divided into three stages wang et al 2011a i e stage i from transplanting to first fruit set stage ii from first fruit set to first fruit maturity and stage iii from first fruit maturity to seedling pulling treatments were not applied at stage i and stated from stage ii the amount and frequency of irrigation for greenhouse tomatoes in different irrigation treatments in the two year trial are shown in table 1 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 greenhouse meteorological data a weather station hobo onset computer corporation usa was installed in the center of the greenhouse solar radiation rs air temperature temp and relative humidity rh were monitored continuously at an interval of 5 s and the averaged values of data over 15 min were recorded in a data logger 2 4 2 crop water consumption the water balance method is applied to estimate crop water consumption et c with the following formula andreu et al 1997 2 et c p i g r d w in eq 2 et c is the water consumption of the crop mm p is the amount of precipitation mm and p is 0 in the greenhouse as no rainfall is received i is the amount of irrigation water mm g is groundwater recharge mm and g 0 as groundwater recharge is negligible when groundwater table is below 25 m in this study r is the surface runoff mm and r 0 as the greenhouse floor was flat and had limited irrigation d is the amount of deep seepage mm and d 0 as it was shown that no seepage was found at the depth of 0 6 m chen et al 2013 w is the amount of change in soil water storage in the rhizosphere mm and it is calculated using the following formula li et al 2020 3 w θ 0 θ 1 h 1000 in eq 3 θ 0 and θ 1 are the soil volumetric water content in the beginning and in the end respectively h is the planned wetted layer depth m the water content measured by the diviner2000 soil moisture meter was the volumetric water content per 10 cm soil layer and the mean value of θ 0 and θ 1 within the planned wetted layer was taken to calculate w since the soil moisture content under drip irrigation is not a one dimensional laminar distribution the soil moisture distribution under alternating drip irrigation conditions is even more obvious in the dry and wet areas in order to accurately calculate the crop water consumption under different irrigation methods the overall soil moisture content in the root zone was calculated using the overall average moisture content θ 4 θ θ l θ r 2 in eq 4 θ l and θ r are the average soil volumetric water content of the left and right root zone respectively 2 4 3 greenhouse tomato yield and its components tomatoes were harvested in order of ripening from t1 to t5 of red ripening fruit and the harvesting time of the same truss was kept the same for each treatment a total of 30 tomato plants near the center of each plot were randomly selected to determine fresh weight and fruit number the total yield was estimated by multiplying the average yield per plant with the planting density li et al 2020 fruits with single fresh weight 70 g or with major defects e g cracking and deformation were classified as non commercial fruit ncf while the rest of the fruits 70 g and free of major defects as commercial fruit cf wang et al 2011a tomato fruit yield were evaluated as cf yield and ncf yield respectively 2 4 4 crop water productivity crop water productivity wp c of tomato plants was calculated according to the following eq 5 fernández et al 2020 5 wp c y et c 100 in eq 5 wp c is crop water productivity kg m3 y is total yield t ha and et c is crop water consumption mm 2 4 5 fruit quality twenty tomato fruits that were healthy and uniform in size were randomly selected from the first truss t1 to the fifth truss t5 in each test plot picked and brought to the laboratory washed with distilled water to remove dust from the fruit surface and then dried naturally the samples were first divided into two parts and 10 fruits were taken to determine the single fruit weight sfw fruit color index ci and firmness fn of each fruit while the other 10 fruits were homogenized in a blender to determine reducing sugars rs rice evans et al 1996 organic acids oa vitamin c vc gazdik et al 2008 and lycopene lyc sharma and maguer 1996 with the measurements replicated 5 times among them a colorimeter sp60 x rite usa was used to determine the color space coordinates l a and b along the perimeter of the fruit and then the color index ci was calculated according to the formula arias et al 2000 intelmann et al 2005 the fhm 5 portable fruit firmness tester fhm 5 takemura electric works ltd japan was used to calculate the fruit firmness fn by selecting a cylindrical measuring head with a length of 10 mm and a diameter of 5 mm tangling the plane of the measuring head with the surface of the fruit and taking four measurements in the cross direction at the shoulder of the fruit to obtain the average value 2 5 data analysis multi factor mixed general linear models were applied to analyze the main and interaction effects of different factors irrigation method irrigation volume and truss location on yield and quality using the multi factor analysis procedure in spss version 13 0 ibm crop usa significance of differences was analyzed using duncan s multiple range test with p 0 05 plots were made using origin 2022 software 3 results 3 1 changes of greenhouse meteorological factors and dynamics of soil water content changes in solar radiation rs relative humidity rh temperature temp and vpd during the growth season in two years were shown in figs 2 and 3 rs showed a decreasing and then increasing trend over the growing period with the minimum values 66 22 w m2 and 76 82 w m2 occurring at stage ii and the maximum values 111 81 w m2 and 134 28 w m2 at stage iii temperature decreased gradually from stage i to stage ii and then increased gradually in stage iii rh increased in stages i and ii and then decreased in stage iii rs and rh were higher in 2019 2020 than in 2018 2019 the volumetric soil water content in the planned wetted layer 0 60 cm of tomato plant root zone under different irrigation treatments in the 2019 2020 season is shown in fig 3 as the pattern of soil water content was consistent in both seasons the data from 2019 to 2020 was shown as an example the volumetric soil water content in ic under w0 fluctuated within the range of 24 10 30 64 corresponding to 90 θ fc 75 θ fc while under ia it fluctuated within the range of 24 32 34 89 with the highest value on the irrigated side under w1 volumetric soil water content gradually declined over the growth season under both ia and ic under w2 a similar pattern was shown as w1 but the volumetric water content was lower than w1 under w1 and w2 volumetric soil water content was higher under ia than ic 3 2 response of water consumption of greenhouse tomatoes at different growth stages to irrigation treatments the water consumption etc of greenhouse tomatoes at each growth stage and across the whole growth period under different irrigation treatments in the two year trial is shown in fig 4 etc increased gradually from stage i to stage iii etc was not significantly different under different irrigation treatments in stage i because no treatment was imposed ia significantly reduced etc in stage ii and stage iii compared to ic regardless of irrigation amount in both years as irrigation amount decreased from w0 to w2 etc was significantly reduced under both ia and ic in stage ii and iii the pattern of etc across the whole growth period was similar to that in stage ii and iii showing a significant decrease under ia than ic and a significant decrease with decreasing irrigation volume 3 3 responses of greenhouse tomato yield and water use efficiency to different irrigation treatments 3 3 1 total yield and wp c of greenhouse tomato total yield and crop water productivity of greenhouse tomato under different irrigation treatments were shown in table 2 under w0 ia decreased the value of total yield compared to ic in both years showing a statistically significant decrease of 4 04 in 2019 2020 in contrast under deficit irrigation ia increased the value of total yield compared to ic in both years with a statistically significant increase of 5 89 under w1 in 2019 2020 as irrigation amount reduced from w0 to w1 the value of total yield decreased under ic while increase under ia in both years with a significant decrease of 5 83 and increase of 3 91 in 2019 2020 as irrigation amount further decreased to w2 total yield was reduced compared to w0 under both ia and ic in both years but the reduction was smaller under ia than under ic under w0 ia reduced wp c values compared to ic in both years although a significant decrease of 5 48 was observed only in 2018 2019 however under deficit irrigation wp c values were higher under ia compared to ic in both years even though the significant increases of 8 28 8 54 were found only in 2019 2020 compared to w0 wp c values were markedly increased under deficit irrigation regardless of irrigation methods in two years but the increase was 12 02 20 22 higher under ia than under ic 3 3 2 fruit yield of greenhouse tomato in different trusses in response to different irrigation treatments single fruit weight sfw fruit number n commercial fruit cf yield and non commercial fruit ncf yield of greenhouse tomato in different trusses responded differently to irrigation treatments in the two year trial fig 5 generally sfw decreased from t1 123 97 145 30 g to t4 98 70 101 73 g and then increased from t4 to t5 fig 5 a and b an opposite trend was shown in n which increased from t1 to t3 and then decreased from t4 to t5 fig 5 c and d hence the increase of sfm from t4 to t5 coincided with the decrease of n from t4 to t5 under w0 ia compared to ic had no significant effect on sfw at t1 t2 and t5 but significantly reduced sfw at t3 and t4 by 21 48 22 06 and 12 27 19 05 in both seasons fig 5 a and b under w1 ia significantly increased sfw at t5 by 16 81 17 31 compared to ic in both years but had no significant effects on the other trusses under w2 sfw in all trusses was not clearly pattern changes in both years overall irrigation treatments had no significant effect on n across all tursses in both years except t5 in 2018 2019 showing a significant reduction of 21 38 as irrigation amount decreased from w0 to w2 under ic fig 5 c both cf and ncf yields decreased from t1 to t5 across all treatments in both years fig 5 e h the decrease of cf yield was in the range of 30 38 42 96 from t1 472 83 559 51 g to t5 319 16 329 19 g and that of ncf yield was about 27 94 52 from t1 32 88 35 61 g to t5 15 53 25 66 g under w0 cf yield at t4 and t5 were significantly reduced by ia compared to ic in 2018 2019 with a decrease of 13 07 and 14 73 respectively while t1 t3 were not affected by irrigation method fig 5 e under w1 irrigation method had no significant effect on cf yield in the two year trial which was also the same change under w2 expect t2 where cf yield was significantly increased by 17 08 by ia than ic in 2019 2020 as irrigation volume decreased from w0 to w2 cf yield was significantly reduced under both ia and ic in both years with a relatively smaller reduction under ia than ic fig 5 e and f meanwhile ia significantly decreased ncf yield compared to ic in t2 t5 by 6 37 13 32 under w2 and the decrease tended to become larger as truss position height increased in 2018 2019 fig 5 g while such pattern was not observed in 2019 2020 fig 5 h 3 3 3 response of greenhouse tomato quality to irrigation method and irrigation quantity in different trusses overall ci values were higher in the 2018 2019 season than in the 2019 2020 season table 3 ia compared to ic significantly increased ci in t1 and t3 under w1 in both years the pattern of the effect of irrigation method on truss ci under other irrigation amounts was not clear gradually fn decreased with increased truss height from t1 to t5 and the pattern was particularly clear in 2018 2019 showing a dramatic decrease of 55 10 from t1 3 69 kg m2 to t5 1 65 kg m2 table 3 among all trusses t2 was the one that exhibited a clear response pattern to irrigation method and irrigation amount ia significantly reduced fn in t2 across all irrigation amounts in both years and fn tended to decrease with the decreasing irrigation amount unlike fn rs values were not clearly affected by truss positions table 4 under w0 rs in t1 t4 and t5 were significantly increased under ia compared to ic in both years under w1 rs values were higher under ia than under ic in all trusses in both years although the difference was not statistically significant in some cases under w2 the pattern of effect of irrigation method on rs in different trusses was unclear no clear response to irrigation volume was observed oa was significantly affected by irrigation method in many cases however the effects were highly inconsistent depending on truss position and irrigation volume without showing a clear pattern in 2018 2019 table 4 oa was not affected by irrigation method except t5 where significantly decreased by 21 37 under w1 in 2019 2020 sar did not show a clear response pattern as truss height changed table 4 compared to ic ia increased sar values in t1 and t3 in both seasons even though the increase was statistically insignificant in some cases additionally sar tended to increase with decreased irrigation amount in these two trusses in both seasons in the rest of trusses irrigation amount and method had significant effects on sar in some cases but the pattern was inconsistent and unclear generally lyc increased with as truss height increased from t1 to t5 table 5 in both years and the lyc values of t5 could be more than twofold higher than those of t1 overall the lyc values were higher under ia than under ic regardless of irrigation amounts and trusses in both years even though the increase was not statistically significant in some cases as irrigation amount decreased lyc tended to increase in t4 and t5 however this pattern was not clearly observed in the other trusses the highest values of vc occurred at t2 with 253 68 mg kg 2018 2019 and 177 31 mg kg 2019 2020 table 5 while t1 showed the lowest vc values with 112 32 mg kg and 97 36 mg kg respectively which were 55 72 and 45 09 lower than t2 in t2 ia significantly increased vc under all three irrigation amounts in both years a similar pattern was observed in t1 and t3 in which vc values were higher under ia than under ic even though no significant difference was reported in some cases however t4 and t5 did not show a clear response to irrigation amount and irrigation methods under w1 and w2 vc values in all trusses expect t5 were increased by ia and the increase could be as high as 60 18 and 53 32 observed at t1 under w2 in two seasons 4 discussion 4 1 yield distribution pattern of different trusses in multi truss tomato plants tomato plants differ from cereal crops in that they are harvested sequentially as the fruit ripens from the bottom to the top mature tomato fruits contain 92 95 water davies et al 1981 dorais et al 2010 pearce et al 1993 which largely determines single fruit fresh weight water transport into the fruit depends on the water potential difference between the stem and the fruit johnson et al 1992 and the hydraulic resistance of the water transport pathway in this study sfw was significantly decreased by 20 38 29 98 from t1 123 97 145 30 g to t4 98 70 101 73 g fig 5 a and b similarly total yield in each truss was decreased from t1 to t5 across all treatments in both years as it was the sum of cf and ncf yields which vary so patterned with truss position height fig 5 e h there are three possible reasons for above changes first of all the growing tomato fruits on the top canopy is at the end of water transport pathway and it has been shown that the diameter of xylem conduit of the tomato plant gradually decreases from the base to the top likely leading to a gradual increase in the hydraulic resistance of the water transport way olson et al 2020 rosell et al 2017 in addition there is competition for water between fruits and leaves on the top canopy exposed to under high transpiration demand leaves may be more competitive in water uptake than the fruits resulting in difficulty in fruit water uptake and even fruit water loss due to the backflow from the fruit to the stem caused by a reversed water potential gradient i e stem water potential was lower than fruit water potential johnson et al 1992 which may lead to smaller fruits and hence lower yields of the top trusses last but not least water enters the fruit via the xylem and phloem network going through the peduncle the structure connecting the truss to the stem windt et al 2009 and the proportion of water entering the fruit changes with fruit developmental stages in the early stages the xylem pathway is predominantly sensitive to changes in water potential brown and coombe 1984 windt et al 2009 while various signals related to water potential can also be transported via the xylem to the fruit affecting fruit water content whereas as the fruit ripens 80 90 of water is imported into the fruit via the phloem guichard et al 2005 ho et al 1987 plaut et al 2004 in contrast to xylem the phloem was relatively insensitive to changes of water potential ehret and ho 1986 ho et al 1987 when trusses at the base are mature and rely on phloem water supply trusses on the top are still in the early stage and rely on xylem water supply indicating that top trusses might be more sensitive than bottom trusses to water stress despite the decrease of sfw from t1 to t4 an increase in t5 was observed this increase of sfw on t5 was likely related to the decrease in fruit number n of this truss it has been found that fruit number was limited by resource availability stephenson 1981 especially under low light in winter while fruit size and fruit number could compensate for each other picken 1984 this may explain the increased fruit weight and decreased fruit number at t5 in our study 4 2 regulation of tomato yield in different trusses by apri yield in different trusses responded differently to irrigation methods these results could be explained in two ways 4 2 1 root water uptake capacity many studies have found that apri stimulated tomato root growth enhanced crop root vigor increased root length and surface area and raised root biomass and root to shoot ratio which all contributed to the improvement of yield and wue chen et al 2016 li et al 2011 wei et al 2011 however studies have also found that when apri was applied under unreasonable soil water potential thresholds it was not beneficial for improving fruit quality and yield shu et al 2020 this study showed that ia significantly decreased sfw at t3 and t4 under w0 while no significant effect on sfw at the rest trusses in both seasons fig 5 a and b as well as the response of n tomato yield is determined by single fruit fresh weight and fruit number bertin 1995 as a result tomato yield at t3 and t4 were significantly reduced by ia under w0 this may be due to the fact that the soil water content in the root zone in ia was higher than ic during the whole growing period fig 3 a and b while water consumption of tomato plants was not significantly higher in ia fig 4 the long term high level soil water content in the root zone may cause hypoxia and eventually reduce yield in ia 4 2 2 root signal aba a previous study found that apri significantly increased total plant hydraulic conductivity root to leaf at moderate irrigation rates possibly due to the production of aba in the drought root zone inducing reduced leaf area and a more developed root system facilitating water transport in the vascular system as well as yield formation yang et al 2013 this study found that ia significantly decreased ncf yield at t2 t5 in 2018 2019 fig 5 g or significantly increased cf yield by 17 08 at t2 compared ic under w2 in 2019 2020 fig 5 f overall ia significantly improved the proportion of cf yield in total tomato yield as the sum of cf and ncf yields compared to ic under w2 this may be due to the following reasons on the one hand apri could lead to higher aba content in tomato root signal compared to di at the same irrigation amount dodd et al 2008 on the other hand it might be the differential regulatory effect of aba on different parts of the plant many experiments had reported that apri could be successfully applied to tomato as its fruit had a limited xylem connection with the rest of the plant resulting in the possibility that xylem borne signals e g aba might be transmitted to fruit interior only in early development not in late development which explained the lower reduced effect on fruit yield than the regulation of vegetative parts of the plant davies et al 2000 kirda et al 2004 zegbe domínguez et al 2003b 4 3 regulation of fruit quality in different trusses by apri fruit quality is an important determinant of its economic efficiency tomato fruit color plays a key role in the consumer purchase process several studies reported the effect of water deficit on greenhouse tomato quality in different selected clusters but did not compare the effects of different irrigation methods atkinson et al 2011 coyago cruz et al 2019 2018 2017a b deficit irrigation resulted in redder skin color which was thought to be related to ethylene production nuruddin et al 2003 in this paper we found that tomato fruit color was poor at the base and became increasingly redder from the base to the tip but not all truss fruit color responded significantly to irrigation treatments table 3 fruit firmness was small at the top truss and decreased with reducing irrigation and there was a significant difference in the control effect of irrigation method between trusses table 3 that is the higher the truss the smaller the control effect in addition differences in some quality parameters such as ci table 3 between two growing seasons may be the result of the differences in meteorological factors fig 2 that may affect plant canopy growth and change the microclimate around the plants santos et al 2007 tomato fruit taste was mainly dependent on reducing sugar rs organic acids content oa and sugar to acid ratio sar dorais et al 2010 the variation of rs and oa between trusses in tomato fruit directly determined sar which determined fruit flavor quality dorais et al 2010 in this study sar did not show a clear response pattern as truss height changed but compared to ic ia increased sar values in t1 and t3 in both seasons even though the increase was statistically insignificant in some cases table 4 in addition sar tended to increase with decreased irrigation amount in these two trusses in both seasons table 4 apri was reported to increase fruit rs content sun et al 2014 xu et al 2009 and our result which ia improved rs in all trusses in a two year trial than ic under w1 is consistent with those studies table 4 two possible causes are involved in response to the elevated rs content in tomato fruit first apri increases photosynthetic assimilate acquisition in the fruit another study found that differential regulation to water transport and accumulation in tomato plants determines their flavor quality i e rs oa and sar ho et al 1987 loveys 1991 applied apri in grapes and found a reduction in the biomass of lateral branches resulting in decreasing competitiveness with fruit for carbohydrates and enhancing the carbon source for sugar metabolism in the fruit meanwhile apri may enhance water transport to the fruit for facilitating transport of photosynthetic assimilates from leaves to the fruit second apri may improve the efficiency of carbohydrate conversion into hexose aba was found to regulate carbohydrate metabolism via a range of enzymes and among them invertase is essential for regulating hexose content in tomato fruit ho 1996 ruan et al 2010 lycopene and vitamin c are two important antioxidants in tomato fruits bucheli et al 1999 lycopene is lowest in multi truss greenhouse tomatoes at the base of the fruit and increases sequentially along the stem up to the top truss with a twofold increase compared to ic the lyc values were higher under ia regardless of irrigation amounts and trusses in both years even though the increase was not statistically significant in some cases table 5 the peak value of vitamin c content occurred at t2 and was significantly increased by ia regardless of irrigation conditions but the effect on the rest of truss was limited by irrigation conditions table 5 in other words apri improved fruit color reduced fruit firmness and increased lycopene and vc content probably due to the inhibition of redundant plant canopy growth and altered canopy light transmission which allowed more sunlight to the fruit epidermis and promoted its early ripening du et al 2006 rana et al 2004 lycopene content in fruit was positively correlated with fruit color helyes et al 2006 as light had a significant effect on vc and lycopene accumulation toor et al 2006 apri may improve the light exposure of fruits by optimizing the canopy structure which ultimately promotes vitamin c and lycopene formation 5 conclusion indeterminate tomato varieties grown in multi truss systems in greenhouses had overlapping fruiting periods and regulating yield and fruit quality of all trusses simultaneously is a challenging but valuable goal for tomato growers considering optimal economic returns this study showed that there were differences in the response of greenhouse tomato yield and fruit quality to apri among different trusses simultaneously under moderate deficit irrigation apri mitigated the reduction of commercial fruit yield and avoided the increase of non commercial fruit yield due to less irrigation primarily by improving single fruit weight in the trusses at the top of the canopy with no effect on fruit number in addition apri enhanced fruit lyc values regardless of irrigation amounts and trusses while regulated other qualities depending on irrigation conditions and trusses more research should be conducted to investigate the saving water mechanisms associated with differences in response to apri for tomato yields and fruit quality

8980,yield and fruit quality of greenhouse tomatoes vary in response to alternate partial root zone irrigation apri however little is known about whether and how these responses differ in different trusses in a multi truss tomato production system this study investigated the response of fruit yield and quality of five trusses indicated as t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 from the bottom to the top canopy to irrigation method conventional irrigation ic and alternate partial root zone irrigation ia and irrigation volume full irrigation w0 2 3 full irrigation w1 and 1 3 full irrigation w2 in a two year greenhouse trial in the arid region of northwest china results showed that both commercial fruit and non commercial fruit yields decreased from t1 to t5 across all treatments under w1 ia significantly increased single fruit weight sfw at t5 by 16 81 17 31 and no significant effect on n compared to ic in both years but other trusses had no significant responses under w2 ia significantly decreased ncf yield in t2 t5 compared to ic without significant effect on cf yield and the decrease tended to become larger as truss position increased in 2018 2019 while such pattern was not observed in 2019 2020 lycopene content lyc increased from t1 to t5 by about two fold lyc were higher under ia than under ic regardless of irrigation amounts and trusses in both years even though the increase was not statistically significant in some cases color index ci firmness fn reducing sugars rs organic acids oa sugar to acid ratio sar and vitamin c vc also demonstrated truss specific responses to irrigation

permanent wilting point 1 introduction tomato solanum lycopersicum l is the second most grown and consumed vegetable crop worldwide and it is popular as the fruit is good flavored and rich in vitamins and antioxidants e g lycopene that are known to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular diseases and cancer canene adams et al 2005 rice evans et al 1996 it is a high value crop widely grown in a multiple truss system in greenhouses to provide year round vegetables essential for the human diet in many regions of the world bogale et al 2016b chadirin et al 2008 wang et al 2011a the production cycle of multi truss tomatoes can last for seven month or even longer wang et al 2011a and the fruit growth stage of different trusses overlap chadirin et al 2008 wang et al 2011a multi truss tomato plants in greenhouses are highly water demanding and hence there is a growing interest to optimize water use to ensure sustainable crop production du et al 2015 water scarcity is increasingly becoming a serious impediment to sustainable agriculture under global climate change deficit irrigation which emerged as one of water saving agricultural techniques medrano et al 2012 has been gaining in popularity in water limited regions du et al 2015 hence a better understanding of the truss specific yield and quality responses is essential for implementing the technique deficit irrigation di in which irrigation water less than plants actually require is applied to the entire root system is considered a promising strategy for improving crop water use efficiency wue in the presence of water scarcity bogale et al 2016a du et al 2015 alternate partial root zone irrigation apri is also a water saving technique zegbe domínguez et al 2004 2003a in which water is supplied to only one part of the root system with the other part being left dry at a time and the wet dry parts are alternated to prevent excessive soil drying jovanovic and stikic 2018 romero et al 2014 apri can be applied during a specific growth period or the entire growth period jovanovic and stikic 2018 and with different irrigation volumes kirda et al 2004 apri has been reported to improve wue without significantly reducing yield in grapevine chaves et al 2007 cotton du et al 2006 wheat sepaskhah and hosseini 2008 sunflower sezen et al 2011 maize kaman and kırda 2017 and tomato zegbe domínguez et al 2004 crops compared to conventional di apri has been reported to result in a stronger root to shoot aba signaling at the same irrigation volume probably because water is more dynamic in the rhizosphere of apri dodd et al 2011 adoption of apri could potentially make substantial contribution to water conservation in many water limiting regions in the world wang et al 2013 zegbe domínguez et al 2003a the mechanism underlying apri is that the roots on the dry side produce a chemical signal abscisic acid aba which is transported via the xylem to aboveground parts e g leaves and fruits aba transported to leaves is known to reduce stomatal conductance and hence reduce transpiration without sacrificing photosynthetic product accumulation du et al 2008 sepaskhah and ahmadi 2010 unlike leaves the effect of the xylem borne aba signal on fruit depends on the developmental stage of the fruit davies et al 2000 the tomato fruit is generally believed to rely on xylem water supply in the early stage while it is primarily dependent on phloem water supply in the late developmental stage suggesting that the transmission of the xylem borne signals to the fruit may be effective in the early stage but limited in the late stage davies et al 2000 although the theory of apri on fruit has not been fully understood a number of studies have documented the effects of apri on tomato yield and fruit quality jovanovic and stikic 2018 it has been widely reported that apri has many benefits compared to full irrigation it has been found that fruit yield was reduced by only 13 8 with alternate irrigation treatments compared to conventional irrigation while water use efficiency as a ratio of marketable fruit yield and irrigation water applied was greatly improved and fruit quality was significantly improved bogale et al 2016b bogale et al 2016a found that rdi and apri significantly decreased total tomato yield by 24 2 37 4 but notably increased wue as compared to full irrigation regardless of tomato variety while vitamin c and lycopene contents significantly increased only at one of two tomato variety and the other was significantly lower bogale et al 2016b found that compared to full irrigation apri and di had no significant effect on tomato yield fruit number per plant and fruit size increased wue by 36 7 and 26 1 respectively and increased soluble solids and titratable acid content several studies have compared the effects of apri and di on tomato yield quality and wue bogale et al 2016a kirda et al 2004 sun et al 2014 zegbe et al 2007 in order to know whether apri has an advantage over di apri did not improve tomato yield but significantly increased soluble sugar and organic acid concentrations compared to di sun et al 2014 however no significant difference was observed between apri and di in terms of yield fruit color and soluble solids zegbe domínguez et al 2003a similarly kirda et al 2004 also showed no significant difference between apri and di in yield and fruit size at the same irrigation volume shu et al 2020 investigated the effects of different soil water thresholds on tomato plant growth and fruit quality under alternate drip irrigation conditions and found that with low irrigation tomato yield and harvest index were significantly reduced even with alternate irrigation but fruit quality e g soluble sugar vitamin c sugar acid ratio was significantly improved while regulating irrigation water to the best effect of alternate irrigation by maintaining soil water content around 70 of field water holding capacity to save water and improve quality it is worth noting that the effect of truss position was not considered in the comparisons between di and apri both di and apri can produce a mild water stress affecting plant water relations chalmers et al 1986 wakrim et al 2005 but both may result in different growth responses due to different mechanisms especially in multi truss greenhouse tomatoes where fruit yield and quality may vary across different trusses many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of di and apri applied to greenhouse tomatoes for water conservation and yield stabilization campos et al 2009 casa and rouphael 2014 however little attention has been paid to how yield and fruit quality of different trusses in multi truss greenhouse tomatoes respond to apri although some researchers had studied the response of tomato fruit quality in different truss to various inducing factors ávila juárez and miranda rodríguez 2018 chadirin et al 2008 rocci et al 2005 based on the above the response of greenhouse tomatoes to apri in terms of yield and fruit quality may differ depending on truss positions in this study we designed a two year field experiment with two irrigation methods conventional irrigation and alternate partial root zone irrigation at three irrigation volumes full irrigation 2 3 full irrigation and 1 3 full irrigation aiming to reveal the effects of different irrigation methods and irrigation amounts on tomato yield and fruit quality in five trusses at different positions in tomato plants this study will provide an in depth understanding of the effects of irrigation treatments on fruit yield and quality and the regulatory mechanisms facilitating the development of precise irrigation strategies for determining the best production technology for greenhouse tomatoes 2 materials and methods 2 1 overview of the experimental site a greenhouse irrigation experiment was conducted at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university located in wuwei city latitude 37 52ˊn longitude 102 52ˊe gansu province in two consecutive winter seasons from october 2018 to april 2019 and from october 2019 to march 2020 this region is characterized by a temperate continental climate average annual precipitation 164 4 mm pan evaporation 2000 mm mean temperature 8 8 c mean sunshine duration 3000 h frost free period 150 d the groundwater table in this region is below 25 m the greenhouse used for the experiment is 76 m 8 m in size and orientated in east west direction the planting area in the greenhouse was 428 m2 and the soil was irrigated desert soil with an average soil bulk density of 1 41 g cm3 in 0 100 cm field moisture capacity θ fc of 0 33 cm3 cm3 and permanent wilting point θ pwp of 0 119 cm3 cm3 plants were drip irrigated with groundwater with an electrical conductivity ec of 0 53 ds m 2 2 crop management the tomato lycopersicon esculentum mill plants used in the two year trial were pink jubilee series which are indeterminate fresh market tomato varieties widely cultivated in the region seedlings were grown at a local nursery and transplanted to the trial plots on october 21 in the 2018 2019 trial and on october 27 in the 2019 2020 trial when 3 4 leaves appeared the soil in the greenhouse was rototilled before transplanting and 120 t ha of well rotted organic manure sheep manure and 130 kg ha of compound fertilizer n 22 p2o5 28 k 2 o 18 were applied as base fertilizer and evenly tilled on the soil surface 0 10 cm after transplanting the tomato seedlings were watered with 26 53 mm planting water in 2018 2019 and 28 00 mm planting water in 2019 2020 to ensure healthy growth polyethylene film 0 005 mm thick was placed on the soil surface to reduce soil evaporation and increase soil temperature starting from 30 days after transplanting when early flowering and fruit set occurred stems were trained with support strings and the flowers were hand pollinated using 60 micromolar p chlorophenoxyacetic acid spray each tomato plant was trained to keep five trusses referred to as t1 t2 t3 t4 and t5 from the bottom to the top and each truss had 4 5 fruits all agronomic management procedures such as fertilization hanging pollination and forking were the same in all treatments except for irrigation 2 3 experimental design the experiment was conducted in a split zone experimental design with two variables irrigation method i and irrigation volume w irrigation method i was set as the main zone with two levels conventional deficit irrigation ic and alternate partial root zone irrigation ia irrigation volume w was set as the split zone with three levels full irrigation w0 i e 90 75 of θ fc 2 3 full irrigation w1 1 3 full irrigation w2 the upper and lower limits of irrigation in this experiment were determined according to chen et al 2013 each treatment has three replications four drip irrigation strips were laid in each plot as shown in fig 1 with ic treatment irrigating 1 2 3 and 4 drip strips each time and ia treatment irrigating 1 and 3 drip strips this time and 2 and 4 drip strips next time alternately the tomato plant spacing was set at 40 cm and the row spacing was 40 cm and the average planting density was 6 73 plants m2 each trial plot was 5 2 m long by 1 2 m wide at the same time pvc access pipes were installed near the middle of 2 and 3 and the soil water content of the test plots was monitored every 5 days before and after irrigation using a portable soil moisture monitoring system diviner 2000 sentek pty ltd australia irrigation was started when the average soil moisture content within the wetted layer 0 60 cm of the fully irrigated w0 soil plan reached 75 2 of θ fc with an upper limit of 90 2 of θ fc the irrigation volume i mm at each watering is calculated using the following formula qiu et al 2011 wang et al 2011b 1 i 0 9 θ fc θ i h 0 5 1000 in eq 1 i is the irrigation water mm θ fc is the field capacity cm3 cm3 θ i is the average soil water content of the i soil layer before irrigation cm3 cm3 h is the planned moisture layer i e 0 6 m 0 5 is soil moisture ratio tomato growth was divided into three stages wang et al 2011a i e stage i from transplanting to first fruit set stage ii from first fruit set to first fruit maturity and stage iii from first fruit maturity to seedling pulling treatments were not applied at stage i and stated from stage ii the amount and frequency of irrigation for greenhouse tomatoes in different irrigation treatments in the two year trial are shown in table 1 2 4 measurements 2 4 1 greenhouse meteorological data a weather station hobo onset computer corporation usa was installed in the center of the greenhouse solar radiation rs air temperature temp and relative humidity rh were monitored continuously at an interval of 5 s and the averaged values of data over 15 min were recorded in a data logger 2 4 2 crop water consumption the water balance method is applied to estimate crop water consumption et c with the following formula andreu et al 1997 2 et c p i g r d w in eq 2 et c is the water consumption of the crop mm p is the amount of precipitation mm and p is 0 in the greenhouse as no rainfall is received i is the amount of irrigation water mm g is groundwater recharge mm and g 0 as groundwater recharge is negligible when groundwater table is below 25 m in this study r is the surface runoff mm and r 0 as the greenhouse floor was flat and had limited irrigation d is the amount of deep seepage mm and d 0 as it was shown that no seepage was found at the depth of 0 6 m chen et al 2013 w is the amount of change in soil water storage in the rhizosphere mm and it is calculated using the following formula li et al 2020 3 w θ 0 θ 1 h 1000 in eq 3 θ 0 and θ 1 are the soil volumetric water content in the beginning and in the end respectively h is the planned wetted layer depth m the water content measured by the diviner2000 soil moisture meter was the volumetric water content per 10 cm soil layer and the mean value of θ 0 and θ 1 within the planned wetted layer was taken to calculate w since the soil moisture content under drip irrigation is not a one dimensional laminar distribution the soil moisture distribution under alternating drip irrigation conditions is even more obvious in the dry and wet areas in order to accurately calculate the crop water consumption under different irrigation methods the overall soil moisture content in the root zone was calculated using the overall average moisture content θ 4 θ θ l θ r 2 in eq 4 θ l and θ r are the average soil volumetric water content of the left and right root zone respectively 2 4 3 greenhouse tomato yield and its components tomatoes were harvested in order of ripening from t1 to t5 of red ripening fruit and the harvesting time of the same truss was kept the same for each treatment a total of 30 tomato plants near the center of each plot were randomly selected to determine fresh weight and fruit number the total yield was estimated by multiplying the average yield per plant with the planting density li et al 2020 fruits with single fresh weight 70 g or with major defects e g cracking and deformation were classified as non commercial fruit ncf while the rest of the fruits 70 g and free of major defects as commercial fruit cf wang et al 2011a tomato fruit yield were evaluated as cf yield and ncf yield respectively 2 4 4 crop water productivity crop water productivity wp c of tomato plants was calculated according to the following eq 5 fernández et al 2020 5 wp c y et c 100 in eq 5 wp c is crop water productivity kg m3 y is total yield t ha and et c is crop water consumption mm 2 4 5 fruit quality twenty tomato fruits that were healthy and uniform in size were randomly selected from the first truss t1 to the fifth truss t5 in each test plot picked and brought to the laboratory washed with distilled water to remove dust from the fruit surface and then dried naturally the samples were first divided into two parts and 10 fruits were taken to determine the single fruit weight sfw fruit color index ci and firmness fn of each fruit while the other 10 fruits were homogenized in a blender to determine reducing sugars rs rice evans et al 1996 organic acids oa vitamin c vc gazdik et al 2008 and lycopene lyc sharma and maguer 1996 with the measurements replicated 5 times among them a colorimeter sp60 x rite usa was used to determine the color space coordinates l a and b along the perimeter of the fruit and then the color index ci was calculated according to the formula arias et al 2000 intelmann et al 2005 the fhm 5 portable fruit firmness tester fhm 5 takemura electric works ltd japan was used to calculate the fruit firmness fn by selecting a cylindrical measuring head with a length of 10 mm and a diameter of 5 mm tangling the plane of the measuring head with the surface of the fruit and taking four measurements in the cross direction at the shoulder of the fruit to obtain the average value 2 5 data analysis multi factor mixed general linear models were applied to analyze the main and interaction effects of different factors irrigation method irrigation volume and truss location on yield and quality using the multi factor analysis procedure in spss version 13 0 ibm crop usa significance of differences was analyzed using duncan s multiple range test with p 0 05 plots were made using origin 2022 software 3 results 3 1 changes of greenhouse meteorological factors and dynamics of soil water content changes in solar radiation rs relative humidity rh temperature temp and vpd during the growth season in two years were shown in figs 2 and 3 rs showed a decreasing and then increasing trend over the growing period with the minimum values 66 22 w m2 and 76 82 w m2 occurring at stage ii and the maximum values 111 81 w m2 and 134 28 w m2 at stage iii temperature decreased gradually from stage i to stage ii and then increased gradually in stage iii rh increased in stages i and ii and then decreased in stage iii rs and rh were higher in 2019 2020 than in 2018 2019 the volumetric soil water content in the planned wetted layer 0 60 cm of tomato plant root zone under different irrigation treatments in the 2019 2020 season is shown in fig 3 as the pattern of soil water content was consistent in both seasons the data from 2019 to 2020 was shown as an example the volumetric soil water content in ic under w0 fluctuated within the range of 24 10 30 64 corresponding to 90 θ fc 75 θ fc while under ia it fluctuated within the range of 24 32 34 89 with the highest value on the irrigated side under w1 volumetric soil water content gradually declined over the growth season under both ia and ic under w2 a similar pattern was shown as w1 but the volumetric water content was lower than w1 under w1 and w2 volumetric soil water content was higher under ia than ic 3 2 response of water consumption of greenhouse tomatoes at different growth stages to irrigation treatments the water consumption etc of greenhouse tomatoes at each growth stage and across the whole growth period under different irrigation treatments in the two year trial is shown in fig 4 etc increased gradually from stage i to stage iii etc was not significantly different under different irrigation treatments in stage i because no treatment was imposed ia significantly reduced etc in stage ii and stage iii compared to ic regardless of irrigation amount in both years as irrigation amount decreased from w0 to w2 etc was significantly reduced under both ia and ic in stage ii and iii the pattern of etc across the whole growth period was similar to that in stage ii and iii showing a significant decrease under ia than ic and a significant decrease with decreasing irrigation volume 3 3 responses of greenhouse tomato yield and water use efficiency to different irrigation treatments 3 3 1 total yield and wp c of greenhouse tomato total yield and crop water productivity of greenhouse tomato under different irrigation treatments were shown in table 2 under w0 ia decreased the value of total yield compared to ic in both years showing a statistically significant decrease of 4 04 in 2019 2020 in contrast under deficit irrigation ia increased the value of total yield compared to ic in both years with a statistically significant increase of 5 89 under w1 in 2019 2020 as irrigation amount reduced from w0 to w1 the value of total yield decreased under ic while increase under ia in both years with a significant decrease of 5 83 and increase of 3 91 in 2019 2020 as irrigation amount further decreased to w2 total yield was reduced compared to w0 under both ia and ic in both years but the reduction was smaller under ia than under ic under w0 ia reduced wp c values compared to ic in both years although a significant decrease of 5 48 was observed only in 2018 2019 however under deficit irrigation wp c values were higher under ia compared to ic in both years even though the significant increases of 8 28 8 54 were found only in 2019 2020 compared to w0 wp c values were markedly increased under deficit irrigation regardless of irrigation methods in two years but the increase was 12 02 20 22 higher under ia than under ic 3 3 2 fruit yield of greenhouse tomato in different trusses in response to different irrigation treatments single fruit weight sfw fruit number n commercial fruit cf yield and non commercial fruit ncf yield of greenhouse tomato in different trusses responded differently to irrigation treatments in the two year trial fig 5 generally sfw decreased from t1 123 97 145 30 g to t4 98 70 101 73 g and then increased from t4 to t5 fig 5 a and b an opposite trend was shown in n which increased from t1 to t3 and then decreased from t4 to t5 fig 5 c and d hence the increase of sfm from t4 to t5 coincided with the decrease of n from t4 to t5 under w0 ia compared to ic had no significant effect on sfw at t1 t2 and t5 but significantly reduced sfw at t3 and t4 by 21 48 22 06 and 12 27 19 05 in both seasons fig 5 a and b under w1 ia significantly increased sfw at t5 by 16 81 17 31 compared to ic in both years but had no significant effects on the other trusses under w2 sfw in all trusses was not clearly pattern changes in both years overall irrigation treatments had no significant effect on n across all tursses in both years except t5 in 2018 2019 showing a significant reduction of 21 38 as irrigation amount decreased from w0 to w2 under ic fig 5 c both cf and ncf yields decreased from t1 to t5 across all treatments in both years fig 5 e h the decrease of cf yield was in the range of 30 38 42 96 from t1 472 83 559 51 g to t5 319 16 329 19 g and that of ncf yield was about 27 94 52 from t1 32 88 35 61 g to t5 15 53 25 66 g under w0 cf yield at t4 and t5 were significantly reduced by ia compared to ic in 2018 2019 with a decrease of 13 07 and 14 73 respectively while t1 t3 were not affected by irrigation method fig 5 e under w1 irrigation method had no significant effect on cf yield in the two year trial which was also the same change under w2 expect t2 where cf yield was significantly increased by 17 08 by ia than ic in 2019 2020 as irrigation volume decreased from w0 to w2 cf yield was significantly reduced under both ia and ic in both years with a relatively smaller reduction under ia than ic fig 5 e and f meanwhile ia significantly decreased ncf yield compared to ic in t2 t5 by 6 37 13 32 under w2 and the decrease tended to become larger as truss position height increased in 2018 2019 fig 5 g while such pattern was not observed in 2019 2020 fig 5 h 3 3 3 response of greenhouse tomato quality to irrigation method and irrigation quantity in different trusses overall ci values were higher in the 2018 2019 season than in the 2019 2020 season table 3 ia compared to ic significantly increased ci in t1 and t3 under w1 in both years the pattern of the effect of irrigation method on truss ci under other irrigation amounts was not clear gradually fn decreased with increased truss height from t1 to t5 and the pattern was particularly clear in 2018 2019 showing a dramatic decrease of 55 10 from t1 3 69 kg m2 to t5 1 65 kg m2 table 3 among all trusses t2 was the one that exhibited a clear response pattern to irrigation method and irrigation amount ia significantly reduced fn in t2 across all irrigation amounts in both years and fn tended to decrease with the decreasing irrigation amount unlike fn rs values were not clearly affected by truss positions table 4 under w0 rs in t1 t4 and t5 were significantly increased under ia compared to ic in both years under w1 rs values were higher under ia than under ic in all trusses in both years although the difference was not statistically significant in some cases under w2 the pattern of effect of irrigation method on rs in different trusses was unclear no clear response to irrigation volume was observed oa was significantly affected by irrigation method in many cases however the effects were highly inconsistent depending on truss position and irrigation volume without showing a clear pattern in 2018 2019 table 4 oa was not affected by irrigation method except t5 where significantly decreased by 21 37 under w1 in 2019 2020 sar did not show a clear response pattern as truss height changed table 4 compared to ic ia increased sar values in t1 and t3 in both seasons even though the increase was statistically insignificant in some cases additionally sar tended to increase with decreased irrigation amount in these two trusses in both seasons in the rest of trusses irrigation amount and method had significant effects on sar in some cases but the pattern was inconsistent and unclear generally lyc increased with as truss height increased from t1 to t5 table 5 in both years and the lyc values of t5 could be more than twofold higher than those of t1 overall the lyc values were higher under ia than under ic regardless of irrigation amounts and trusses in both years even though the increase was not statistically significant in some cases as irrigation amount decreased lyc tended to increase in t4 and t5 however this pattern was not clearly observed in the other trusses the highest values of vc occurred at t2 with 253 68 mg kg 2018 2019 and 177 31 mg kg 2019 2020 table 5 while t1 showed the lowest vc values with 112 32 mg kg and 97 36 mg kg respectively which were 55 72 and 45 09 lower than t2 in t2 ia significantly increased vc under all three irrigation amounts in both years a similar pattern was observed in t1 and t3 in which vc values were higher under ia than under ic even though no significant difference was reported in some cases however t4 and t5 did not show a clear response to irrigation amount and irrigation methods under w1 and w2 vc values in all trusses expect t5 were increased by ia and the increase could be as high as 60 18 and 53 32 observed at t1 under w2 in two seasons 4 discussion 4 1 yield distribution pattern of different trusses in multi truss tomato plants tomato plants differ from cereal crops in that they are harvested sequentially as the fruit ripens from the bottom to the top mature tomato fruits contain 92 95 water davies et al 1981 dorais et al 2010 pearce et al 1993 which largely determines single fruit fresh weight water transport into the fruit depends on the water potential difference between the stem and the fruit johnson et al 1992 and the hydraulic resistance of the water transport pathway in this study sfw was significantly decreased by 20 38 29 98 from t1 123 97 145 30 g to t4 98 70 101 73 g fig 5 a and b similarly total yield in each truss was decreased from t1 to t5 across all treatments in both years as it was the sum of cf and ncf yields which vary so patterned with truss position height fig 5 e h there are three possible reasons for above changes first of all the growing tomato fruits on the top canopy is at the end of water transport pathway and it has been shown that the diameter of xylem conduit of the tomato plant gradually decreases from the base to the top likely leading to a gradual increase in the hydraulic resistance of the water transport way olson et al 2020 rosell et al 2017 in addition there is competition for water between fruits and leaves on the top canopy exposed to under high transpiration demand leaves may be more competitive in water uptake than the fruits resulting in difficulty in fruit water uptake and even fruit water loss due to the backflow from the fruit to the stem caused by a reversed water potential gradient i e stem water potential was lower than fruit water potential johnson et al 1992 which may lead to smaller fruits and hence lower yields of the top trusses last but not least water enters the fruit via the xylem and phloem network going through the peduncle the structure connecting the truss to the stem windt et al 2009 and the proportion of water entering the fruit changes with fruit developmental stages in the early stages the xylem pathway is predominantly sensitive to changes in water potential brown and coombe 1984 windt et al 2009 while various signals related to water potential can also be transported via the xylem to the fruit affecting fruit water content whereas as the fruit ripens 80 90 of water is imported into the fruit via the phloem guichard et al 2005 ho et al 1987 plaut et al 2004 in contrast to xylem the phloem was relatively insensitive to changes of water potential ehret and ho 1986 ho et al 1987 when trusses at the base are mature and rely on phloem water supply trusses on the top are still in the early stage and rely on xylem water supply indicating that top trusses might be more sensitive than bottom trusses to water stress despite the decrease of sfw from t1 to t4 an increase in t5 was observed this increase of sfw on t5 was likely related to the decrease in fruit number n of this truss it has been found that fruit number was limited by resource availability stephenson 1981 especially under low light in winter while fruit size and fruit number could compensate for each other picken 1984 this may explain the increased fruit weight and decreased fruit number at t5 in our study 4 2 regulation of tomato yield in different trusses by apri yield in different trusses responded differently to irrigation methods these results could be explained in two ways 4 2 1 root water uptake capacity many studies have found that apri stimulated tomato root growth enhanced crop root vigor increased root length and surface area and raised root biomass and root to shoot ratio which all contributed to the improvement of yield and wue chen et al 2016 li et al 2011 wei et al 2011 however studies have also found that when apri was applied under unreasonable soil water potential thresholds it was not beneficial for improving fruit quality and yield shu et al 2020 this study showed that ia significantly decreased sfw at t3 and t4 under w0 while no significant effect on sfw at the rest trusses in both seasons fig 5 a and b as well as the response of n tomato yield is determined by single fruit fresh weight and fruit number bertin 1995 as a result tomato yield at t3 and t4 were significantly reduced by ia under w0 this may be due to the fact that the soil water content in the root zone in ia was higher than ic during the whole growing period fig 3 a and b while water consumption of tomato plants was not significantly higher in ia fig 4 the long term high level soil water content in the root zone may cause hypoxia and eventually reduce yield in ia 4 2 2 root signal aba a previous study found that apri significantly increased total plant hydraulic conductivity root to leaf at moderate irrigation rates possibly due to the production of aba in the drought root zone inducing reduced leaf area and a more developed root system facilitating water transport in the vascular system as well as yield formation yang et al 2013 this study found that ia significantly decreased ncf yield at t2 t5 in 2018 2019 fig 5 g or significantly increased cf yield by 17 08 at t2 compared ic under w2 in 2019 2020 fig 5 f overall ia significantly improved the proportion of cf yield in total tomato yield as the sum of cf and ncf yields compared to ic under w2 this may be due to the following reasons on the one hand apri could lead to higher aba content in tomato root signal compared to di at the same irrigation amount dodd et al 2008 on the other hand it might be the differential regulatory effect of aba on different parts of the plant many experiments had reported that apri could be successfully applied to tomato as its fruit had a limited xylem connection with the rest of the plant resulting in the possibility that xylem borne signals e g aba might be transmitted to fruit interior only in early development not in late development which explained the lower reduced effect on fruit yield than the regulation of vegetative parts of the plant davies et al 2000 kirda et al 2004 zegbe domínguez et al 2003b 4 3 regulation of fruit quality in different trusses by apri fruit quality is an important determinant of its economic efficiency tomato fruit color plays a key role in the consumer purchase process several studies reported the effect of water deficit on greenhouse tomato quality in different selected clusters but did not compare the effects of different irrigation methods atkinson et al 2011 coyago cruz et al 2019 2018 2017a b deficit irrigation resulted in redder skin color which was thought to be related to ethylene production nuruddin et al 2003 in this paper we found that tomato fruit color was poor at the base and became increasingly redder from the base to the tip but not all truss fruit color responded significantly to irrigation treatments table 3 fruit firmness was small at the top truss and decreased with reducing irrigation and there was a significant difference in the control effect of irrigation method between trusses table 3 that is the higher the truss the smaller the control effect in addition differences in some quality parameters such as ci table 3 between two growing seasons may be the result of the differences in meteorological factors fig 2 that may affect plant canopy growth and change the microclimate around the plants santos et al 2007 tomato fruit taste was mainly dependent on reducing sugar rs organic acids content oa and sugar to acid ratio sar dorais et al 2010 the variation of rs and oa between trusses in tomato fruit directly determined sar which determined fruit flavor quality dorais et al 2010 in this study sar did not show a clear response pattern as truss height changed but compared to ic ia increased sar values in t1 and t3 in both seasons even though the increase was statistically insignificant in some cases table 4 in addition sar tended to increase with decreased irrigation amount in these two trusses in both seasons table 4 apri was reported to increase fruit rs content sun et al 2014 xu et al 2009 and our result which ia improved rs in all trusses in a two year trial than ic under w1 is consistent with those studies table 4 two possible causes are involved in response to the elevated rs content in tomato fruit first apri increases photosynthetic assimilate acquisition in the fruit another study found that differential regulation to water transport and accumulation in tomato plants determines their flavor quality i e rs oa and sar ho et al 1987 loveys 1991 applied apri in grapes and found a reduction in the biomass of lateral branches resulting in decreasing competitiveness with fruit for carbohydrates and enhancing the carbon source for sugar metabolism in the fruit meanwhile apri may enhance water transport to the fruit for facilitating transport of photosynthetic assimilates from leaves to the fruit second apri may improve the efficiency of carbohydrate conversion into hexose aba was found to regulate carbohydrate metabolism via a range of enzymes and among them invertase is essential for regulating hexose content in tomato fruit ho 1996 ruan et al 2010 lycopene and vitamin c are two important antioxidants in tomato fruits bucheli et al 1999 lycopene is lowest in multi truss greenhouse tomatoes at the base of the fruit and increases sequentially along the stem up to the top truss with a twofold increase compared to ic the lyc values were higher under ia regardless of irrigation amounts and trusses in both years even though the increase was not statistically significant in some cases table 5 the peak value of vitamin c content occurred at t2 and was significantly increased by ia regardless of irrigation conditions but the effect on the rest of truss was limited by irrigation conditions table 5 in other words apri improved fruit color reduced fruit firmness and increased lycopene and vc content probably due to the inhibition of redundant plant canopy growth and altered canopy light transmission which allowed more sunlight to the fruit epidermis and promoted its early ripening du et al 2006 rana et al 2004 lycopene content in fruit was positively correlated with fruit color helyes et al 2006 as light had a significant effect on vc and lycopene accumulation toor et al 2006 apri may improve the light exposure of fruits by optimizing the canopy structure which ultimately promotes vitamin c and lycopene formation 5 conclusion indeterminate tomato varieties grown in multi truss systems in greenhouses had overlapping fruiting periods and regulating yield and fruit quality of all trusses simultaneously is a challenging but valuable goal for tomato growers considering optimal economic returns this study showed that there were differences in the response of greenhouse tomato yield and fruit quality to apri among different trusses simultaneously under moderate deficit irrigation apri mitigated the reduction of commercial fruit yield and avoided the increase of non commercial fruit yield due to less irrigation primarily by improving single fruit weight in the trusses at the top of the canopy with no effect on fruit number in addition apri enhanced fruit lyc values regardless of irrigation amounts and trusses while regulated other qualities depending on irrigation conditions and trusses more research should be conducted to investigate the saving water mechanisms associated with differences in response to apri for tomato yields and fruit quality

8981,generally straw return can reduce soil freezing depth and inhibit soil evaporation in cold dry agricultural regions however when crushed corn straw is returned with thoroughly mixed with the topsoil 0 20 cm the influence on water and heat flux during soil freezing and thawing is still unclear in this study two years straw return experiments of total 9 treatments for 3 straw returns 1 6 0 8 kg m 2 no return and 3 autumn irrigation amounts 180 135 90 mm were conducted in 27 lysmeters with bottomless spatial and temporal dynamics of water and heat within soil profiles were continuously observed for freezing and thawing period the results showed that straw return inhibited the decrease and increase of soil temperature during the freeze thaw period furthermore straw return reduced the freezing rate and delayed the complete thawing date results showed that effect of straw return on soil temperature and water were affected obviously by irrigation amount finally straw return can restrained soil evaporation after soil thawing completely and the soil unfrozen water content and the total water content were higher for treatments with the straw return to topsoil our findings can enhance the understanding to soil temperature and water dynamics for freeze thaw period keywords straw return soil freeze thaw soil temperature soil water data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction soil salinity is a prominent problem that affects agricultural development in arid and semi arid areas irrigation is an essential measure to manage soil water and salt for sustainable agriculture development usually autumn or winter irrigation is applied to leaching soil salt which accumulated in root zone soil within the crop growth period furthermore some arid and semi arid areas are located in northern 30 n where seasonally frozen soil exists in these areas the freeze thaw process which involves hydro thermal coupling and water phase transformation could affect soil water and salt distribution through the soil profile xu et al 2001 for some poor irrigation management districts unreasonable autumn irrigation have caused the rapid rise of the groundwater level and it is difficult to leach salt out of the root zone li et al 2013 with the decline of air temperature surface soil begins to freeze after the autumn irrigation event and the unfrozen water in the soil profile moves driven by potential energy difference obviously liu et al 2016 this can result in salt accumulated in the freezing front during the freezing period hou et al 2020 during the thawing period high potential evapotranspiration makes the salt accumulate in the surface soil which hinders crop growth next year wu et al 2016 therefore scientific irrigation management and measures should be taken to avoid salt accumulating within surface soil gong et al 1997 zhang and wang 2001 guo et al 2005 tillage and straw management have been the main measures to avoid salt accumulation by adjusting the temperature and water distribution within the soil profile lots field experiments have demonstrated that tillage and straw management affect soil temperature and moisture status further affecting the occurrence and depth of freezing and soil evaporation upon melting horton et al 1996 kozak et al 2007 hou et al 2022 previous field experiments had proved that no tillage standing stubble could affect the formation of soil freezing layer and reduce soil freezing depth by 35 on average pikul et al 1986 compared with conventional tillage in autumn no tillage can resulted in soil froze deeper kay et al 1985 reducing the amount of stubble in autumn tillage management could lead to an early disappearance of frost and an increase of soil temperature during the thawing period benoit et al 1986 compared with autumn tillage no tillage stuffing could increase soil temperature below 2 freeze deeper 0 5 m and thaw time 20 days earlier sharratt et al 1998 after corn harvest the higher stubble 60 cm could reduce the freezing depth by at least 0 5 m and accelerate the thawing of soil profile for at least 25 days in west central minnesota near morris a continental climate area sharratt 2002 the whole stalk of corn without tillage reduced maximum freezing depth thawed soil earlier promoted early sowing and extended the growth period of corn next year in the north of china at jilin city gand et al 2017 furthermore cutting corn stover into small sections and evenly laying on the ground could significantly reduce the maximum freezing depth accelerate soil thawing during the thawing period and reduce surface runoff and soil erosion during soil thawing in spring sharratt et al 2000 in the freezing period straw mulching treatment straw cross laying thickness of 10 cm could reduce the variation range of soil temperature and liquid water content increase surface water content absorb excess heat and reduce the fluctuation of the soil energy budget bristow 1988 straw mulching reduced the amplitude of fluctuation in soil temperature and liquid water content increased surface soil water content weakened the influence of environmental factors on the income and expenditure of soil energy during the freezing period and enhanced the energy exchange between the soil and the environment during the thawing period the greater the amount of mulching the fewer the environmental factors affecting the temperature of the cultivated layer fu et al 2014 2015 meng et al 2020 in the stable freezing period straw mulching could reduce soil evaporation by 49 58 8 compared with bare soil chen et al 2019 fu et al 2018b mulching before autumn irrigation 0 9 kg m 2 increased the soil temperature slowly and the soil moisture was higher in the next spring lu et al 2017 after straw mulching the maximum soil freezing depth decreased by 4 26 cm and the initial freezing and thawing time was delayed which inhibited the soil surface evaporation and reduced the accumulation of salt within the topsoil liang et al 2015 liang et al 2017 additionally lots of research showed that straw was a measure to retain water and the amount of chopped straw mulch was positively correlated with the resistance of water vapor transport in soil fuchs and hadas 2011 some field experiments during the growth period showed that crop residues could reduce extreme heat and mass fluxes at the soil surface compared to bare soil horton et al 1996 cover crops did not affect thermal properties but corn residue removal reduced field thermal conductivity by 12 41 and volumetric heat capacity by 6 49 for the 0 5 cm depth sindelar et al 2019 mulch rates significantly increased available water capacity and total porosity mulumba and lal 2008 furthermore some numerical simulation results showed that the near surface soil temperature under spring residue mulch increased to 5 with 5 9 days earlier than that under bare or flat mulch increasing seedling germination and promoting plant growth flerchinger et al 2003 compared with continuous fallow vegetation treatment alleviated the freezing depth and freezing time of soil and increased soil moisture lu et al 2019 overall the effects of straw return or straw mulching on soil temperature and water content during the freeze thaw period depend on detailed measures climate conditions and soil properties straw return after crop harvest is popular in some main agricultural production areas however it is still unclear how straw return affects the soil temperature and water content during soil freeze and thaw therefore with two years field observation experiments the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the effects of straw return on soil profile temperature and freezing depth during the freeze thaw period 2 calculate soil freezing rate and depth during the freeze period with straw return 3 investigate the effect of straw return amount on soil unfrozen water content and total water content during the freeze thaw period 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a field experiment was conducted at the yongji experiment station located in the hetao irrigation district in northwest china latitude 41 09 n longitude 107 39 e altitude 1032 m fig 1 there is an arid temperate continental climate characterized by low precipitation and high evaporation annual precipitation is around 149 25 mm and the potential evaporation open water evaporation is 2300 mm over the past ten years the mean annual temperature is 6 8 and the average annual groundwater depth is less than 3 m soils begin freezing in the second half of november freeze to a depth of about 0 7 1 1 m and completely thaw in late april to mid early may of the following year the duration of freeze thaw is about 180 days li et al 2012b field observation covers the freeze thaw season of october 2020 to may 2021 and october 2021 to may 2022 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted in 27 bottomless lysimeters fig 1 each lysimeter is 4 45 m long and 3 m wide respectively plastic cloth was 1 2 m depth to avoid the water exchange among lysimeters the soil physical properties of the 0 80 cm soil layer were analyzed using the laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 table 1 various autumn irrigation and straw return levels were considered in the experiment as a result a total of 9 treatments were applied in this experiment and each treatment consisted of three replications with a completely randomized block trial design irrigation levels were 180 135 and 90 mm and straw return levels were 1 6 0 8 and 0 kg m 1 table 2 respectively before irrigation the dried corn straw was crushed into 3 5 cm long and thoroughly mixed within the 0 20 cm topsoil in the treatment irrigation was applied after straw returned to the field on nov 12 13 2020 and oct 13 2021 respectively with the decline of temperature the soil usually begins to freeze and release latent heat with the temperature rising at the end of feb the soil thawing process occurred from both above and below the frozen layer the two thawing fronts met at a soil depth of approximately 60 cm in mid to late april 2 3 monitoring item and method meteorological data were monitored by a field micro weather station during the freeze thaw period of 2 years hobo u30 onset computer corp ma usa soil means unfrozen water content uwc and temperature were monitored by using 5te sensors meter group inc usa installed in nine treatment centers in one of the block groups em50 decagon devices inc usa data collection was used to record the daily mean uwc and temperature in the soil layers of 10 20 40 60 and 80 cm by the hour all sensors were calibrated before the experiment soil samples from each treatment in different freeze thaw periods were collected to measure and calculate the total mean water content twc about once a month after freezing a gasoline power sampling drill was used to sample the soil layers of 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm respectively the twc was measured by drying at 105 for 8 h the sampling time is divided as shown in appendix 1 the division of the freeze thaw stage was mainly based on the observation results of frozen depth in the frozen soil sampling period it was regretful that we couldn t observe the detailed maximum freezing depth due to only a soil profile of 80 cm depth included in our experiment 2 3 1 soil temperature difference soil temperature difference during the whole freeze thaw period is described by temperature range r and standard derivation σ with the increase of σ the fluctuation and difference in soil temperature rise 1 r t max t min where r is the temperature range t max is the daily maximum temperature t min is the daily minimum temperature 2 σ i 1 n t i t 2 n 1 3 t 1 n i 1 n t i where σ is temperature standard derivation n is observation days t i is the mean daily temperature t is the sample mean 2 3 2 freezing rate here we used two methods to describe the freezing rate one is the average rate fr deep of decrease in soil temperature over time the other is the diurnal rate fr day of soil temperature in each soil layer 4 fr deep d t zero where fr deep is corresponding to soil freezing rates of the soil profile cm d 1 d and t zero represent the depth difference cm and time difference day when the soil temperature reaches about 0 at the deepest observable frozen soil layer 5 fr day t d where fr day is the freezing decreases rate of each soil layer d 1 t and d represent the daily temperature difference of soil layer and the period of stable freezing about 30 days of observations over the two years were selected 3 results and analysis 3 1 solar radiation and air temperature during the 2 years experiment period fig 2 the solar radiation began to decrease from oct and reached to lowest in jan of the next year with the lowest values appearing on jan 1 70 mj m 2 day 1 and jan 6 67 7 mj m 2 day 1 respectively with the decrease in solar radiation air temperature rapidly declined after oct and reached below 0 on nov 5 and nov 8 respectively for the two years air temperature was kept below 0 for a duration of about three and four months respectively the mean air temperature was 7 55 5 63 for these two observation periods it was noted that the lowest air temperature was drop to 20 13 and 15 42 respectively on jan 6 and dec 26 then the temperature began to rise reaching above 0 since feb 18 and mar 8 respectively in detail from oct 4 and oct 10 the daily minimum temperature reached below 0 respectively with the decrease in solar radiation topsoil kept frozen from nov 21 and dec 23 respectively and the soil gradually froze deeper with the increase in solar radiation the daily minimum temperature gradually reached above 0 and topsoil kept thawing since feb 20 and mar 11 respectively fig 3 3 2 soil temperature and depth of freezing in this study the influence of the salt concentration on soil freeze and the thaw was ignored according to the soil temperature change scope we divided the soil freeze thaw period into two stages including the freezing stage aft the daily mean soil temperature dropped to 0 and soil freezing occurred the liquid water phased into solid ice and the thawing stage att the daily mean soil temperature rose to 0 and soil thawing began the solid ice phased into liquid water meanwhile the data when the soil layer began to freeze fsd thaw tsd and complete thaw td were recorded as well table 3 the impact of straw return on soil temperature depended on the irrigation levels which determined the initial water content of freezing fig 4 it is found that straw return delayed the soil freeze thaw process in which the temperature declined for the same soil layer in the freezing period for example experimental observation results showed that the date of topsoil temperature 0 10 cm decreased to 0 was later by 5 days for i3m2 than that for no return treatment i3m0 it was noted that this delay was much more significant in the second year and the onset of 0 for topsoil of i1m2 had 23 days delay compared with that of i1m0 treatment furthermore straw return restricted the decline of soil temperature during the freezing period which was especially obvious for high irrigation level fig 4 for the topsoil 0 10 cm the lowest temperature tmin for i3m2 treatment were 8 88 4 41 while 11 68 7 57 for i3m0 respectively for the observed 2 years with the irrigation decreased the tmin have a decline trend for example the tmin were 10 50 and 4 83 for i1m2 while it were 13 00 and 8 55 for i1m0 respectively similarly straw return also inhibited the rise in temperature of topsoil 0 10 cm during the thawing period the low temperature in spring prevented the topsoil from thawing and the temperature rise to 0 was later by 6 days for i3m2 than that for no return treatment i3m0 similarly the temperature rise to 0 of i1m2 had 8 days delay compared with that of i1m0 in the second year straw return significantly affected the soil profile complete thawing date td for example the td of i3m2 treatment was later by 8 days 1 day for no return treatment i3m0 during the 2 years in fact the td significantly depend on the irrigation amount reduced the irrigation amount the td of i1m2 was later by 6 and 9 days for no return i1m0 respectively straw return inhibited the decrease of soil temperature in the freezing stage aft the soil means temperature 0 80 cm under different treatments were 1 69 2 14 2 39 and 1 24 1 47 1 88 respectively for i3m2 i3m1 i3m0 of the 2 years furthermore we noted that the inhibition to soil temperature decrease of straw return treatment depended on the irrigation levels soil temperatures of i1m2 and i1m1 were higher than i1m0 by 0 70 and 0 47 on average respectively the straw return also restricted the rise of soil temperature in the thawing stage att and the effect was obvious with the small irrigation level for example the average soil temperature 0 80 cm under different treatments were 5 05 5 34 5 34 and 3 77 4 39 4 94 respectively for i1m2 i1m1 i1m0 of the 2 years and the average temperature of i1m0 were higher than that of i1m1 i1m2 by 0 73 0 28 respectively to understand the effect of straw return on soil temperature within different deep soil layers we divided the soil into the upper and lower layers 0 20 40 80 cm appendix 2 the effect to soil temperature of topsoil 0 20 cm was evident for treatment with the high irrigation in the freezing stage aft the soil temperature increased with the straw return to the upper layer 0 20 cm for example the soil temperature of high irrigation level treatment i3m2 increased by 1 20 1 05 respectively than that of i3m0 for the 2 observed years with the decrease in irrigation the effect of straw return to inhibit decrease of the upper soil temperature was weakened it was noted that the upper layer soil temperature of i1m2 increased by 1 10 0 91 than that of i1m0 and the lower layer increased by 0 33 0 45 respectively for the two years similarly during the thawing stage att the soil temperature decreased when the straw return to the upper layer 0 20 cm reducing the irrigation was influenced similarly to aft specifically the upper layer soil temperature of i1m2 increased by 0 70 1 85 compared with that of i1m0 however the soil temperature of lower layer of i1m2 were higher than that of i1m0 by 0 33 0 45 respectively for the 2 years furthermore the increase of straw return levels reduced the fluctuation range of soil temperature within whole freeze thaw period appendix 2 under the same irrigation level the experimental data during the freeze thaw period of the two years showed that the more straw return the smaller value of σ r which mean the smaller fluctuation range in the topsoil 10 20 cm temperature however for the thawing stage att soil temperature fluctuation difference between different levels of irrigation had no obvious over the two years the σ and r in the 40 80 cm layer were similar to those in the topsoil the frozen depth isotherm within the soil profile was by interpolate temporal and spatial distribution of 0 fig 3 the isotherm of increasing straw return and irrigation levels has obvious deviation tread to the right during the freeze thaw period of 2 years as expected the isotherm with the irrigation amount decreased among treatments was irregularity during thawing periods especially 3 3 soil freezing rate 3 3 1 soil freezing rate of fr deep observation data indicated that straw return could result in the slowing of the freezing rate of the soil profile table 4 for example fr deep for i3m2 was 1 11 and 0 70 cm d 1 which was far slower than 1 67 and 1 25 cm d 1 for i3m0 respectively for the two years it was noted that the decrease in fr deep depend on the irrigation amount and the decrease in fr deep was more obvious with the lower irrigation results showed that fr deep were 1 25 and 2 50 cm d 1 for i1m2 and 0 71 and 1 40 cm d 1 of i1m0 respectively in the two years the freezing pattern of the first year in the 40 60 cm layer was similar to that in the 0 20 cm but no obvious trend in the second year for the whole soil profile of 0 80 cm the lowest fr deep was 1 10 and 0 71 cm d 1 for the i3m2 and the highest fr deep was 1 86 and 1 29 cm d 1 for the i1m0 respectively 3 3 2 soil freezing rate of fr day at the same time straw return also influenced the fr day in each layer soil temperature data dec to jan 2021 and mid nov to mid dec 2022 of 10 20 and 40 60 cm layer were used here to calculate the freezing rate fr day between the soil start freeze and the stable soil freezing period which the soil temperature rapidly decrease stage of two years the freezing rate fr day of each soil layer increased with the decrease in straw return amount and the difference was more obvious with the decrease in irrigation amount appendix 3 showed that fr day of the 15 cm soil layer were 0 203 and 0 092 d 1 i3m2 which were higher than 0 240 and 0 107 d 1 i3m0 respectively for the two years compared with the decrease of straw return treatment meanwhile fr day increased significantly with the reduction of irrigation amount fr day was 0 221 and 0 093 d 1 for i1m2 and 0 246 and 0 111 for i1m0 which is higher than that of the treatment of i3m2 and i3m0 respectively of the two years furthermore we noted that the effect of fr day decrease depended on the straw return amount fr day of i3m2 i1m2 were higher by 0 037 and 0 025 d 1 than that of i3m0 i1m0 respectively 3 4 soil unfrozen water content fig 5 shows the variation of soil unfrozen water content uwc over the full freeze thaw period for three straw return levels with different irrigation amounts the mean uwc of the soil profile 0 80 cm within the freezing period from nov 11 2020 to jan 20 2021 and from oct 12 2021 to feb 20 2022 table 5 it was found that straw return treatment under the same irrigation levels had enhanced the uwc in the freeze thaw process especially in the freezing period of topsoil 10 20 cm the uwc of i3m2 were higher than that of i3m0 by 19 71 44 02 respectively for the two years for the deeper layer 40 80 cm the uwc of i3m2 was higher than i3m0 by 14 49 and 9 88 respectively for the two years furthermore it was noted that the uwc reduced with the decrease of irrigation for example the uwc of i1m2 was higher than that of i1m0 by 15 55 and 23 87 at the topsoil respectively of the two years for the deeper layer 40 80 cm the uwc of i1m2 was higher than that of i1m0 by 21 41 and 22 51 respectively for the two years 3 5 soil total water content 3 5 1 soil total water content during freeze thaw periods soil total water content affect the transport and storage of heat in the soil for the measurement of total mean soil water content twc we sampled the soil 6 times for each freezing period appendix 1 to better understand the soil water content change with freezing the whole freezing period was divided it into three stages including before irrigation period p1 t1 the freezing period p2 t2 t3 and t4 and the thawing period p3 t5 and t6 fig 6ab it is noted that while twc of p1 stage did not have statistically significant difference among various straw return treatments overall straw return can increase the twc within the 0 40 cm layer significantly during p2 and p3 with the irrigation decrease the difference of twc among straw return treatments decrease gradually under high irrigation condition straw return can enhance the twc within the topsoil 0 20 cm the experimental data showed that the twc of i3m2 is 19 22 27 83 which increased by 7 37 and 4 04 compared to that of i3m0 respectively for p3 stage of the observed two years with the reduction of irrigation the twc of i1m2 was higher than that of i1m0 by 3 07 in the p2 first year during the p3 of two years i1m2 was higher than that of i1m0 by 0 10 6 86 respectively similarly the average twc within 20 40 cm of the straw return treatments for the high irrigation level were higher than that of no return treatment i3m0 by 0 65 in the p2 first year during the p3 it is found that straw return can enhance twc by 5 28 11 22 compared to that of i3m0 21 78 26 73 respectively of the two years with the reduction of irrigation the twc of i1m2 increased by 3 38 compared with that of i1m0 in the first year however in our study the straw return had limited effects on improving the twc in deeper layers 40 80 cm 3 5 2 soil water content after thawing to understand water saving effect of straw return at the stage of full thawing we compared the final soil water content for different straw return treatments table 6 as expected the straw return obviously enhanced soil water content at topsoil 0 20 cm soil water content for m2 and m1 treatments increased respectively by 34 62 and 15 38 compared with m0 in the freeze thaw period of the first experimental season this water saving effect was much more significant for the second experimental season and the soil water content was higher by 49 09 and 21 82 for the two straw return treatments than that of m0 this could be attributed to the role of straw return on decreasing soil evaporation in spring with high potential evapotranspiration the soil water content of m2 m1 treatments in the 40 80 cm soil layer also increased by 21 21 11 00 and 26 32 16 47 respectively compared to that of m0 for two years it might be attributed to the straw restraining the soil evaporation and maintaining soil water 4 discussion 4 1 soil temperature change and freezing rate straw return changed the topsoil structure and increased soil pores fu et al 2021 mulumba and lal 2008 after autumn irrigation higher water content improved soil heat capacity and decreased soil heat transfer capacity which made a difference between conventional tillage during freeze and thaw processes lampurlan es and cantero martínez 2006 in the freezing stage straw return preserved the atmosphere heat to the soil especially the more autumn irrigation amount meanwhile it restrained the heat transfer from soil to the atmosphere during the thawing stage which was not conducive to the rise of soil temperature in spring similar effect of corn stubble has also been found in other experiments and corn stubble can promote soil temperature and make spring thawing earlier than stubble removal or shredding wang et al 2017 however accelerated soil thawing was not observed in straw return treatment for our experiment which might be due to difference between straw return and conventional no tillage stubble management furthermore the topsoil temperature did not differ with the decrease of irrigation amount in the freezing period while straw return restrained soil water content loss of strong evaporation in the thawing period it is worth noting that planting or early sowing in this way should be adopted to raise soil temperature before sowing in spring meanwhile combined with agronomic measures batter such as film mulching to further ensure crop emergence freezing and thawing depth is a comprehensive index reflecting soil water heat exchange and freeze thaw characteristics rui et al 2019 in our experiment autumn irrigation and straw return could significantly reduce the soil freezing rate and freezing depth in the stable freezing period the freezing rate decreased obviously and the freezing soil depth became shallower this is similar to the findings of sharratt et al 1998 sharratt 2002 and flerchinger et al 2003 however the effects of salt concentration from soil and irrigation water on soil freezing point hui and wei 2011 were ignored in our study the influence of soil salinity on straw return should be further considered in future experiments 4 2 soil water content the straw return also improved the topsoil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water content increased significantly after irrigation the increase of soil pores further enhanced the water storage capacity which further enhance the heat storage capacity and heat capacity of the soil sindelar et al 2019 as a result the liquid soil water is hard to freeze in the freezing period and the freezing date is delayed while the ice melts slowly in the thawing period this conclusion is similar to fu et al 2014 2015 which found that the various point of the water phase transition under straw mulching conditions was delayed not only by the increase of soil depth but also by the increase of straw mulching thickness however the point of water phase transition in the thawing stage under straw return treatment was not obvious and this can attributed to the straw return method in our experiment for the mechanism of water and energy heat balances of crop residue some research showed that the net radiation r n at the surface can be partitioned in several different ways depending on the surface and atmospheric conditions resulting in an energy balance that can be quite different for bare and mulch covered surfaces fu et al 2018a horton et al 1996 o brien and daigh 2019 sharratt and campbell 1994 show the shortwave reflectivity of a light colored residue may be considerably larger than that of a dark colored soil surface thereby reducing the amount of solar radiation that reaches the soil surface in this case there will be less energy available at the soil surface for evaporating water or for heating the soil hares and novak 1992b show observed r n for bare and crop residue covered surfaces daytime r n values were larger for the bare surface than the mulched surface with bare soil vertical mulch and horizontal mulch treatments cierniewski et al 2015 show the soil surface cover i e residue or live vegetation typically has a higher albedo than the darker soil beneath it so removal of cover reduces reflectiveness and increases the amount of shortwave radiation absorbed at the soil surface in our study straw return hindered the water heat transfer and diffusion between the atmosphere and soil within a certain range inhibited soil evaporation and reduced the evaporation rate and the water content of the surface soil was higher than that of the bare land in the spring this conclusion is similar to the results of ji and unger 2001 fuchs and hadas 2011 flerchinger et al 2003 and zribi et al 2015 during the growth period experiments 5 conclusions two years of field experiments during freeze thaw observation indicates that straw return at approximately 1 6 kg m 2 in 0 20 cm can delayed the freeze thaw process and inhibited topsoil temperature decline and rise at the same time the fluctuation of soil temperature reduced which became more pronounced with higher irrigation amount 180 mm similarly straw return significantly reduced the freezing rate and freezing depth of soil furthermore the effect were evidently depend on irrigation amount the presence of straw return however did ameliorate the negative effects of autumn irrigation on soil unfrozen water content in this system similarly soil unfrozen water content related to freezing periods was affected by straw return as a result straw return increased the topsoil total water content in the freeze thaw period due to the restrained of straw return to soil evaporation after thawing was complete however the effect of straw return on soil temperature and water content depended on the autumn irrigation amount soil texture and climatic conditions in future studies the straw return amount can be optimized for the concerned soil climate

8981,generally straw return can reduce soil freezing depth and inhibit soil evaporation in cold dry agricultural regions however when crushed corn straw is returned with thoroughly mixed with the topsoil 0 20 cm the influence on water and heat flux during soil freezing and thawing is still unclear in this study two years straw return experiments of total 9 treatments for 3 straw returns 1 6 0 8 kg m 2 no return and 3 autumn irrigation amounts 180 135 90 mm were conducted in 27 lysmeters with bottomless spatial and temporal dynamics of water and heat within soil profiles were continuously observed for freezing and thawing period the results showed that straw return inhibited the decrease and increase of soil temperature during the freeze thaw period furthermore straw return reduced the freezing rate and delayed the complete thawing date results showed that effect of straw return on soil temperature and water were affected obviously by irrigation amount finally straw return can restrained soil evaporation after soil thawing completely and the soil unfrozen water content and the total water content were higher for treatments with the straw return to topsoil our findings can enhance the understanding to soil temperature and water dynamics for freeze thaw period keywords straw return soil freeze thaw soil temperature soil water data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction soil salinity is a prominent problem that affects agricultural development in arid and semi arid areas irrigation is an essential measure to manage soil water and salt for sustainable agriculture development usually autumn or winter irrigation is applied to leaching soil salt which accumulated in root zone soil within the crop growth period furthermore some arid and semi arid areas are located in northern 30 n where seasonally frozen soil exists in these areas the freeze thaw process which involves hydro thermal coupling and water phase transformation could affect soil water and salt distribution through the soil profile xu et al 2001 for some poor irrigation management districts unreasonable autumn irrigation have caused the rapid rise of the groundwater level and it is difficult to leach salt out of the root zone li et al 2013 with the decline of air temperature surface soil begins to freeze after the autumn irrigation event and the unfrozen water in the soil profile moves driven by potential energy difference obviously liu et al 2016 this can result in salt accumulated in the freezing front during the freezing period hou et al 2020 during the thawing period high potential evapotranspiration makes the salt accumulate in the surface soil which hinders crop growth next year wu et al 2016 therefore scientific irrigation management and measures should be taken to avoid salt accumulating within surface soil gong et al 1997 zhang and wang 2001 guo et al 2005 tillage and straw management have been the main measures to avoid salt accumulation by adjusting the temperature and water distribution within the soil profile lots field experiments have demonstrated that tillage and straw management affect soil temperature and moisture status further affecting the occurrence and depth of freezing and soil evaporation upon melting horton et al 1996 kozak et al 2007 hou et al 2022 previous field experiments had proved that no tillage standing stubble could affect the formation of soil freezing layer and reduce soil freezing depth by 35 on average pikul et al 1986 compared with conventional tillage in autumn no tillage can resulted in soil froze deeper kay et al 1985 reducing the amount of stubble in autumn tillage management could lead to an early disappearance of frost and an increase of soil temperature during the thawing period benoit et al 1986 compared with autumn tillage no tillage stuffing could increase soil temperature below 2 freeze deeper 0 5 m and thaw time 20 days earlier sharratt et al 1998 after corn harvest the higher stubble 60 cm could reduce the freezing depth by at least 0 5 m and accelerate the thawing of soil profile for at least 25 days in west central minnesota near morris a continental climate area sharratt 2002 the whole stalk of corn without tillage reduced maximum freezing depth thawed soil earlier promoted early sowing and extended the growth period of corn next year in the north of china at jilin city gand et al 2017 furthermore cutting corn stover into small sections and evenly laying on the ground could significantly reduce the maximum freezing depth accelerate soil thawing during the thawing period and reduce surface runoff and soil erosion during soil thawing in spring sharratt et al 2000 in the freezing period straw mulching treatment straw cross laying thickness of 10 cm could reduce the variation range of soil temperature and liquid water content increase surface water content absorb excess heat and reduce the fluctuation of the soil energy budget bristow 1988 straw mulching reduced the amplitude of fluctuation in soil temperature and liquid water content increased surface soil water content weakened the influence of environmental factors on the income and expenditure of soil energy during the freezing period and enhanced the energy exchange between the soil and the environment during the thawing period the greater the amount of mulching the fewer the environmental factors affecting the temperature of the cultivated layer fu et al 2014 2015 meng et al 2020 in the stable freezing period straw mulching could reduce soil evaporation by 49 58 8 compared with bare soil chen et al 2019 fu et al 2018b mulching before autumn irrigation 0 9 kg m 2 increased the soil temperature slowly and the soil moisture was higher in the next spring lu et al 2017 after straw mulching the maximum soil freezing depth decreased by 4 26 cm and the initial freezing and thawing time was delayed which inhibited the soil surface evaporation and reduced the accumulation of salt within the topsoil liang et al 2015 liang et al 2017 additionally lots of research showed that straw was a measure to retain water and the amount of chopped straw mulch was positively correlated with the resistance of water vapor transport in soil fuchs and hadas 2011 some field experiments during the growth period showed that crop residues could reduce extreme heat and mass fluxes at the soil surface compared to bare soil horton et al 1996 cover crops did not affect thermal properties but corn residue removal reduced field thermal conductivity by 12 41 and volumetric heat capacity by 6 49 for the 0 5 cm depth sindelar et al 2019 mulch rates significantly increased available water capacity and total porosity mulumba and lal 2008 furthermore some numerical simulation results showed that the near surface soil temperature under spring residue mulch increased to 5 with 5 9 days earlier than that under bare or flat mulch increasing seedling germination and promoting plant growth flerchinger et al 2003 compared with continuous fallow vegetation treatment alleviated the freezing depth and freezing time of soil and increased soil moisture lu et al 2019 overall the effects of straw return or straw mulching on soil temperature and water content during the freeze thaw period depend on detailed measures climate conditions and soil properties straw return after crop harvest is popular in some main agricultural production areas however it is still unclear how straw return affects the soil temperature and water content during soil freeze and thaw therefore with two years field observation experiments the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the effects of straw return on soil profile temperature and freezing depth during the freeze thaw period 2 calculate soil freezing rate and depth during the freeze period with straw return 3 investigate the effect of straw return amount on soil unfrozen water content and total water content during the freeze thaw period 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description a field experiment was conducted at the yongji experiment station located in the hetao irrigation district in northwest china latitude 41 09 n longitude 107 39 e altitude 1032 m fig 1 there is an arid temperate continental climate characterized by low precipitation and high evaporation annual precipitation is around 149 25 mm and the potential evaporation open water evaporation is 2300 mm over the past ten years the mean annual temperature is 6 8 and the average annual groundwater depth is less than 3 m soils begin freezing in the second half of november freeze to a depth of about 0 7 1 1 m and completely thaw in late april to mid early may of the following year the duration of freeze thaw is about 180 days li et al 2012b field observation covers the freeze thaw season of october 2020 to may 2021 and october 2021 to may 2022 2 2 experimental design the experiment was conducted in 27 bottomless lysimeters fig 1 each lysimeter is 4 45 m long and 3 m wide respectively plastic cloth was 1 2 m depth to avoid the water exchange among lysimeters the soil physical properties of the 0 80 cm soil layer were analyzed using the laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 2000 table 1 various autumn irrigation and straw return levels were considered in the experiment as a result a total of 9 treatments were applied in this experiment and each treatment consisted of three replications with a completely randomized block trial design irrigation levels were 180 135 and 90 mm and straw return levels were 1 6 0 8 and 0 kg m 1 table 2 respectively before irrigation the dried corn straw was crushed into 3 5 cm long and thoroughly mixed within the 0 20 cm topsoil in the treatment irrigation was applied after straw returned to the field on nov 12 13 2020 and oct 13 2021 respectively with the decline of temperature the soil usually begins to freeze and release latent heat with the temperature rising at the end of feb the soil thawing process occurred from both above and below the frozen layer the two thawing fronts met at a soil depth of approximately 60 cm in mid to late april 2 3 monitoring item and method meteorological data were monitored by a field micro weather station during the freeze thaw period of 2 years hobo u30 onset computer corp ma usa soil means unfrozen water content uwc and temperature were monitored by using 5te sensors meter group inc usa installed in nine treatment centers in one of the block groups em50 decagon devices inc usa data collection was used to record the daily mean uwc and temperature in the soil layers of 10 20 40 60 and 80 cm by the hour all sensors were calibrated before the experiment soil samples from each treatment in different freeze thaw periods were collected to measure and calculate the total mean water content twc about once a month after freezing a gasoline power sampling drill was used to sample the soil layers of 0 20 20 40 40 60 and 60 80 cm respectively the twc was measured by drying at 105 for 8 h the sampling time is divided as shown in appendix 1 the division of the freeze thaw stage was mainly based on the observation results of frozen depth in the frozen soil sampling period it was regretful that we couldn t observe the detailed maximum freezing depth due to only a soil profile of 80 cm depth included in our experiment 2 3 1 soil temperature difference soil temperature difference during the whole freeze thaw period is described by temperature range r and standard derivation σ with the increase of σ the fluctuation and difference in soil temperature rise 1 r t max t min where r is the temperature range t max is the daily maximum temperature t min is the daily minimum temperature 2 σ i 1 n t i t 2 n 1 3 t 1 n i 1 n t i where σ is temperature standard derivation n is observation days t i is the mean daily temperature t is the sample mean 2 3 2 freezing rate here we used two methods to describe the freezing rate one is the average rate fr deep of decrease in soil temperature over time the other is the diurnal rate fr day of soil temperature in each soil layer 4 fr deep d t zero where fr deep is corresponding to soil freezing rates of the soil profile cm d 1 d and t zero represent the depth difference cm and time difference day when the soil temperature reaches about 0 at the deepest observable frozen soil layer 5 fr day t d where fr day is the freezing decreases rate of each soil layer d 1 t and d represent the daily temperature difference of soil layer and the period of stable freezing about 30 days of observations over the two years were selected 3 results and analysis 3 1 solar radiation and air temperature during the 2 years experiment period fig 2 the solar radiation began to decrease from oct and reached to lowest in jan of the next year with the lowest values appearing on jan 1 70 mj m 2 day 1 and jan 6 67 7 mj m 2 day 1 respectively with the decrease in solar radiation air temperature rapidly declined after oct and reached below 0 on nov 5 and nov 8 respectively for the two years air temperature was kept below 0 for a duration of about three and four months respectively the mean air temperature was 7 55 5 63 for these two observation periods it was noted that the lowest air temperature was drop to 20 13 and 15 42 respectively on jan 6 and dec 26 then the temperature began to rise reaching above 0 since feb 18 and mar 8 respectively in detail from oct 4 and oct 10 the daily minimum temperature reached below 0 respectively with the decrease in solar radiation topsoil kept frozen from nov 21 and dec 23 respectively and the soil gradually froze deeper with the increase in solar radiation the daily minimum temperature gradually reached above 0 and topsoil kept thawing since feb 20 and mar 11 respectively fig 3 3 2 soil temperature and depth of freezing in this study the influence of the salt concentration on soil freeze and the thaw was ignored according to the soil temperature change scope we divided the soil freeze thaw period into two stages including the freezing stage aft the daily mean soil temperature dropped to 0 and soil freezing occurred the liquid water phased into solid ice and the thawing stage att the daily mean soil temperature rose to 0 and soil thawing began the solid ice phased into liquid water meanwhile the data when the soil layer began to freeze fsd thaw tsd and complete thaw td were recorded as well table 3 the impact of straw return on soil temperature depended on the irrigation levels which determined the initial water content of freezing fig 4 it is found that straw return delayed the soil freeze thaw process in which the temperature declined for the same soil layer in the freezing period for example experimental observation results showed that the date of topsoil temperature 0 10 cm decreased to 0 was later by 5 days for i3m2 than that for no return treatment i3m0 it was noted that this delay was much more significant in the second year and the onset of 0 for topsoil of i1m2 had 23 days delay compared with that of i1m0 treatment furthermore straw return restricted the decline of soil temperature during the freezing period which was especially obvious for high irrigation level fig 4 for the topsoil 0 10 cm the lowest temperature tmin for i3m2 treatment were 8 88 4 41 while 11 68 7 57 for i3m0 respectively for the observed 2 years with the irrigation decreased the tmin have a decline trend for example the tmin were 10 50 and 4 83 for i1m2 while it were 13 00 and 8 55 for i1m0 respectively similarly straw return also inhibited the rise in temperature of topsoil 0 10 cm during the thawing period the low temperature in spring prevented the topsoil from thawing and the temperature rise to 0 was later by 6 days for i3m2 than that for no return treatment i3m0 similarly the temperature rise to 0 of i1m2 had 8 days delay compared with that of i1m0 in the second year straw return significantly affected the soil profile complete thawing date td for example the td of i3m2 treatment was later by 8 days 1 day for no return treatment i3m0 during the 2 years in fact the td significantly depend on the irrigation amount reduced the irrigation amount the td of i1m2 was later by 6 and 9 days for no return i1m0 respectively straw return inhibited the decrease of soil temperature in the freezing stage aft the soil means temperature 0 80 cm under different treatments were 1 69 2 14 2 39 and 1 24 1 47 1 88 respectively for i3m2 i3m1 i3m0 of the 2 years furthermore we noted that the inhibition to soil temperature decrease of straw return treatment depended on the irrigation levels soil temperatures of i1m2 and i1m1 were higher than i1m0 by 0 70 and 0 47 on average respectively the straw return also restricted the rise of soil temperature in the thawing stage att and the effect was obvious with the small irrigation level for example the average soil temperature 0 80 cm under different treatments were 5 05 5 34 5 34 and 3 77 4 39 4 94 respectively for i1m2 i1m1 i1m0 of the 2 years and the average temperature of i1m0 were higher than that of i1m1 i1m2 by 0 73 0 28 respectively to understand the effect of straw return on soil temperature within different deep soil layers we divided the soil into the upper and lower layers 0 20 40 80 cm appendix 2 the effect to soil temperature of topsoil 0 20 cm was evident for treatment with the high irrigation in the freezing stage aft the soil temperature increased with the straw return to the upper layer 0 20 cm for example the soil temperature of high irrigation level treatment i3m2 increased by 1 20 1 05 respectively than that of i3m0 for the 2 observed years with the decrease in irrigation the effect of straw return to inhibit decrease of the upper soil temperature was weakened it was noted that the upper layer soil temperature of i1m2 increased by 1 10 0 91 than that of i1m0 and the lower layer increased by 0 33 0 45 respectively for the two years similarly during the thawing stage att the soil temperature decreased when the straw return to the upper layer 0 20 cm reducing the irrigation was influenced similarly to aft specifically the upper layer soil temperature of i1m2 increased by 0 70 1 85 compared with that of i1m0 however the soil temperature of lower layer of i1m2 were higher than that of i1m0 by 0 33 0 45 respectively for the 2 years furthermore the increase of straw return levels reduced the fluctuation range of soil temperature within whole freeze thaw period appendix 2 under the same irrigation level the experimental data during the freeze thaw period of the two years showed that the more straw return the smaller value of σ r which mean the smaller fluctuation range in the topsoil 10 20 cm temperature however for the thawing stage att soil temperature fluctuation difference between different levels of irrigation had no obvious over the two years the σ and r in the 40 80 cm layer were similar to those in the topsoil the frozen depth isotherm within the soil profile was by interpolate temporal and spatial distribution of 0 fig 3 the isotherm of increasing straw return and irrigation levels has obvious deviation tread to the right during the freeze thaw period of 2 years as expected the isotherm with the irrigation amount decreased among treatments was irregularity during thawing periods especially 3 3 soil freezing rate 3 3 1 soil freezing rate of fr deep observation data indicated that straw return could result in the slowing of the freezing rate of the soil profile table 4 for example fr deep for i3m2 was 1 11 and 0 70 cm d 1 which was far slower than 1 67 and 1 25 cm d 1 for i3m0 respectively for the two years it was noted that the decrease in fr deep depend on the irrigation amount and the decrease in fr deep was more obvious with the lower irrigation results showed that fr deep were 1 25 and 2 50 cm d 1 for i1m2 and 0 71 and 1 40 cm d 1 of i1m0 respectively in the two years the freezing pattern of the first year in the 40 60 cm layer was similar to that in the 0 20 cm but no obvious trend in the second year for the whole soil profile of 0 80 cm the lowest fr deep was 1 10 and 0 71 cm d 1 for the i3m2 and the highest fr deep was 1 86 and 1 29 cm d 1 for the i1m0 respectively 3 3 2 soil freezing rate of fr day at the same time straw return also influenced the fr day in each layer soil temperature data dec to jan 2021 and mid nov to mid dec 2022 of 10 20 and 40 60 cm layer were used here to calculate the freezing rate fr day between the soil start freeze and the stable soil freezing period which the soil temperature rapidly decrease stage of two years the freezing rate fr day of each soil layer increased with the decrease in straw return amount and the difference was more obvious with the decrease in irrigation amount appendix 3 showed that fr day of the 15 cm soil layer were 0 203 and 0 092 d 1 i3m2 which were higher than 0 240 and 0 107 d 1 i3m0 respectively for the two years compared with the decrease of straw return treatment meanwhile fr day increased significantly with the reduction of irrigation amount fr day was 0 221 and 0 093 d 1 for i1m2 and 0 246 and 0 111 for i1m0 which is higher than that of the treatment of i3m2 and i3m0 respectively of the two years furthermore we noted that the effect of fr day decrease depended on the straw return amount fr day of i3m2 i1m2 were higher by 0 037 and 0 025 d 1 than that of i3m0 i1m0 respectively 3 4 soil unfrozen water content fig 5 shows the variation of soil unfrozen water content uwc over the full freeze thaw period for three straw return levels with different irrigation amounts the mean uwc of the soil profile 0 80 cm within the freezing period from nov 11 2020 to jan 20 2021 and from oct 12 2021 to feb 20 2022 table 5 it was found that straw return treatment under the same irrigation levels had enhanced the uwc in the freeze thaw process especially in the freezing period of topsoil 10 20 cm the uwc of i3m2 were higher than that of i3m0 by 19 71 44 02 respectively for the two years for the deeper layer 40 80 cm the uwc of i3m2 was higher than i3m0 by 14 49 and 9 88 respectively for the two years furthermore it was noted that the uwc reduced with the decrease of irrigation for example the uwc of i1m2 was higher than that of i1m0 by 15 55 and 23 87 at the topsoil respectively of the two years for the deeper layer 40 80 cm the uwc of i1m2 was higher than that of i1m0 by 21 41 and 22 51 respectively for the two years 3 5 soil total water content 3 5 1 soil total water content during freeze thaw periods soil total water content affect the transport and storage of heat in the soil for the measurement of total mean soil water content twc we sampled the soil 6 times for each freezing period appendix 1 to better understand the soil water content change with freezing the whole freezing period was divided it into three stages including before irrigation period p1 t1 the freezing period p2 t2 t3 and t4 and the thawing period p3 t5 and t6 fig 6ab it is noted that while twc of p1 stage did not have statistically significant difference among various straw return treatments overall straw return can increase the twc within the 0 40 cm layer significantly during p2 and p3 with the irrigation decrease the difference of twc among straw return treatments decrease gradually under high irrigation condition straw return can enhance the twc within the topsoil 0 20 cm the experimental data showed that the twc of i3m2 is 19 22 27 83 which increased by 7 37 and 4 04 compared to that of i3m0 respectively for p3 stage of the observed two years with the reduction of irrigation the twc of i1m2 was higher than that of i1m0 by 3 07 in the p2 first year during the p3 of two years i1m2 was higher than that of i1m0 by 0 10 6 86 respectively similarly the average twc within 20 40 cm of the straw return treatments for the high irrigation level were higher than that of no return treatment i3m0 by 0 65 in the p2 first year during the p3 it is found that straw return can enhance twc by 5 28 11 22 compared to that of i3m0 21 78 26 73 respectively of the two years with the reduction of irrigation the twc of i1m2 increased by 3 38 compared with that of i1m0 in the first year however in our study the straw return had limited effects on improving the twc in deeper layers 40 80 cm 3 5 2 soil water content after thawing to understand water saving effect of straw return at the stage of full thawing we compared the final soil water content for different straw return treatments table 6 as expected the straw return obviously enhanced soil water content at topsoil 0 20 cm soil water content for m2 and m1 treatments increased respectively by 34 62 and 15 38 compared with m0 in the freeze thaw period of the first experimental season this water saving effect was much more significant for the second experimental season and the soil water content was higher by 49 09 and 21 82 for the two straw return treatments than that of m0 this could be attributed to the role of straw return on decreasing soil evaporation in spring with high potential evapotranspiration the soil water content of m2 m1 treatments in the 40 80 cm soil layer also increased by 21 21 11 00 and 26 32 16 47 respectively compared to that of m0 for two years it might be attributed to the straw restraining the soil evaporation and maintaining soil water 4 discussion 4 1 soil temperature change and freezing rate straw return changed the topsoil structure and increased soil pores fu et al 2021 mulumba and lal 2008 after autumn irrigation higher water content improved soil heat capacity and decreased soil heat transfer capacity which made a difference between conventional tillage during freeze and thaw processes lampurlan es and cantero martínez 2006 in the freezing stage straw return preserved the atmosphere heat to the soil especially the more autumn irrigation amount meanwhile it restrained the heat transfer from soil to the atmosphere during the thawing stage which was not conducive to the rise of soil temperature in spring similar effect of corn stubble has also been found in other experiments and corn stubble can promote soil temperature and make spring thawing earlier than stubble removal or shredding wang et al 2017 however accelerated soil thawing was not observed in straw return treatment for our experiment which might be due to difference between straw return and conventional no tillage stubble management furthermore the topsoil temperature did not differ with the decrease of irrigation amount in the freezing period while straw return restrained soil water content loss of strong evaporation in the thawing period it is worth noting that planting or early sowing in this way should be adopted to raise soil temperature before sowing in spring meanwhile combined with agronomic measures batter such as film mulching to further ensure crop emergence freezing and thawing depth is a comprehensive index reflecting soil water heat exchange and freeze thaw characteristics rui et al 2019 in our experiment autumn irrigation and straw return could significantly reduce the soil freezing rate and freezing depth in the stable freezing period the freezing rate decreased obviously and the freezing soil depth became shallower this is similar to the findings of sharratt et al 1998 sharratt 2002 and flerchinger et al 2003 however the effects of salt concentration from soil and irrigation water on soil freezing point hui and wei 2011 were ignored in our study the influence of soil salinity on straw return should be further considered in future experiments 4 2 soil water content the straw return also improved the topsoil unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water content increased significantly after irrigation the increase of soil pores further enhanced the water storage capacity which further enhance the heat storage capacity and heat capacity of the soil sindelar et al 2019 as a result the liquid soil water is hard to freeze in the freezing period and the freezing date is delayed while the ice melts slowly in the thawing period this conclusion is similar to fu et al 2014 2015 which found that the various point of the water phase transition under straw mulching conditions was delayed not only by the increase of soil depth but also by the increase of straw mulching thickness however the point of water phase transition in the thawing stage under straw return treatment was not obvious and this can attributed to the straw return method in our experiment for the mechanism of water and energy heat balances of crop residue some research showed that the net radiation r n at the surface can be partitioned in several different ways depending on the surface and atmospheric conditions resulting in an energy balance that can be quite different for bare and mulch covered surfaces fu et al 2018a horton et al 1996 o brien and daigh 2019 sharratt and campbell 1994 show the shortwave reflectivity of a light colored residue may be considerably larger than that of a dark colored soil surface thereby reducing the amount of solar radiation that reaches the soil surface in this case there will be less energy available at the soil surface for evaporating water or for heating the soil hares and novak 1992b show observed r n for bare and crop residue covered surfaces daytime r n values were larger for the bare surface than the mulched surface with bare soil vertical mulch and horizontal mulch treatments cierniewski et al 2015 show the soil surface cover i e residue or live vegetation typically has a higher albedo than the darker soil beneath it so removal of cover reduces reflectiveness and increases the amount of shortwave radiation absorbed at the soil surface in our study straw return hindered the water heat transfer and diffusion between the atmosphere and soil within a certain range inhibited soil evaporation and reduced the evaporation rate and the water content of the surface soil was higher than that of the bare land in the spring this conclusion is similar to the results of ji and unger 2001 fuchs and hadas 2011 flerchinger et al 2003 and zribi et al 2015 during the growth period experiments 5 conclusions two years of field experiments during freeze thaw observation indicates that straw return at approximately 1 6 kg m 2 in 0 20 cm can delayed the freeze thaw process and inhibited topsoil temperature decline and rise at the same time the fluctuation of soil temperature reduced which became more pronounced with higher irrigation amount 180 mm similarly straw return significantly reduced the freezing rate and freezing depth of soil furthermore the effect were evidently depend on irrigation amount the presence of straw return however did ameliorate the negative effects of autumn irrigation on soil unfrozen water content in this system similarly soil unfrozen water content related to freezing periods was affected by straw return as a result straw return increased the topsoil total water content in the freeze thaw period due to the restrained of straw return to soil evaporation after thawing was complete however the effect of straw return on soil temperature and water content depended on the autumn irrigation amount soil texture and climatic conditions in future studies the straw return amount can be optimized for the concerned soil climate

8982,irrigation modernization impacts irrigation energy consumption and greenhouse gas ghg emissions enhancing irrigation water efficiency to systematically examine the impact of irrigation system modernization on china s irrigation energy consumption and ghg emissions a scenario decomposition based calculation method of irrigation energy consumption and ghg emissions at national and provincial scales based on the physical processes of irrigation energy consumption was proposed the relationship between irrigation water consumption energy consumption and ghg emissions during the rapid development period 2005 2015 of water saving irrigation technology in china was clarified the data demonstrate that the irrigation water volume and energy consumption increased by 7 9 and 22 3 respectively from 2005 to 2015 and the national equivalent of ghg reached 42 5 mt co2e in 2015 water energy consumption across the country was extremely divergent the irrigation energy consumption per unit volume of water and per unit area is 3 74 and 2 88 times more in the northern provinces than in the southern provinces promoting water saving irrigation technology can effectively improve china s irrigation water energy ghg emissions structure which can help improve irrigation efficiency while ensuring no dramatic increase in irrigation energy consumption water saving irrigation technologies should be promoted following the local conditions throughout the country the relationship between irrigation water energy ghg emissions in northern provinces should be considered significantly keywords water saving irrigation technology agricultural irrigation irrigation energy consumption surface water groundwater data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction china is facing severe water shortages the average annual water shortage for irrigation has exceeded 3 1010 m3 in recent years wang et al 2018 however china s water resources are unevenly distributed in time and space and irrigation water is crucial to food security the grain yield exhibits a synchronized changing pattern with the irrigated area china s agricultural irrigation water consumption rate is still relatively low the utilization coefficient of irrigation water refers to the ratio of the amount of water applied to the field to the total amount of water introduced to the irrigation system in 2020 the utilization coefficient of irrigation water was about 0 565 ji 2021 to alleviate the water shortage for agriculture and ensure food production security the chinese government has vigorously issued a series of policies to develop water saving irrigation technologies since 2005 in 2011 the no 1 central document proposed that 4 trillion cny 635 billion would be invested in water conservancy construction and development from 2010 to 2020 people s daily 2011 liu and wu 2012 the ministry of water resources 2017 issued the implementation plan for the newly increased water saving irrigation area of 6 67 million hm2 in the 13th five year period 2 61 million hm2 is drip irrigation local governments also implemented effective initiatives locally such as inner mongolia s intention to expand 2 67 million acres of highly efficient water saving irrigation regions from 2016 to 2020 inner mongolia 2016 china has launched unprecedented agricultural irrigation modernization reforms inspired by a series of policies in 2018 the irrigation water usage coefficient increased to 0 554 china water resources bulletin 2018 similar to the promotion of water saving irrigation in china other countries around the world are also pushing for water saving irrigation research on the relationship between irrigation water and energy has been conducted in spain india and pakistan and general observations were obtained that the increase in irrigation efficiency has led to a significant increase in the use of irrigation energy and an increase in the total carbon footprint of pumped irrigation in countries such as india spain and pakistan shah 2009 rodríguez et al 2011a grafton et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 siyal et al 2021 therefore it is important to clarify the trend for the irrigation water energy ghg relationship in china amidst the fast growth of water saving irrigation which will optimize the planning design operation and management of water saving irrigation projects the current research on the relationship between irrigation water energy ghg is still scant and faces a global dearth rodríguez et al 2011b investigated the relationship between irrigation water and energy in the ten irrigation districts in southern spain the irrigation energy consumption per hectare was about 1000 kwh jackson et al 2010 investigated ground and pressure irrigation s energy consumption under different water sources and analyzed two irrigation districts in new south wales and south australia chai et al 2020 reported that irrigation activities may lead to an increase in ghg emissions in the field qiu et al 2018 and chen et al 2019 focused on the energy consumption and ghg of groundwater irrigation in the north china plain wang et al 2012 estimated ghg emissions from groundwater irrigation in china for the first time by field study and estimation with the conclusion being 33 1 mt co2 equivalent co2e carbon dioxide emissions in the mid 2000 s accounted for 0 58 of china s total co2 emissions in 2016 above all it can be implied that irrigation water shows a significant energy cost in addition various energy consuming components are frequently omitted while conducting statistical analyses of irrigation energy use for instance espinosa tasón et al 2020 showed that irrigation energy consumption in spain increased six fold from 1950 to 2017 assuming that surface water irrigation had a uniform delivery head loss of 5 m on a national scale jackson et al 2010 found that the energy consumption of pressurized irrigation rose by 3 163 compared to surface irrigation under conditions of surface water supply however long distance delivery energy use was not factored into the calculations the channel length from the water source to the target irrigation area is 518 km due to the high altitude of the irrigation region or the great distance of inter basin water delivery surface water delivery is frequently accompanied by significant energy consumption for example the hongsibu pumping irrigation district n 37 25 30 17 e 106 03 27 58 in china draws 169 million m3 of water from the yellow river every year with a total lift of 299 05 m in order to satisfy the water supply needs of irrigated regions a lift of this magnitude requires additional energy rothausen and conway 2011 proposed that in the existing research on irrigation energy consumption the estimation accuracy of irrigation energy consumption at the national and international scales is low because it is frequently based on a large number of assumptions and lacks field survey information on energy source type pumping head and crop water consumption based on the above background this study aims to 1 develop a method for estimating energy consumption at provincial and national scales based on limited statistical data 2 determine the relationship between water energy ghg during the rapid development of china s water saving irrigation technology from 2005 to 2015 3 examine the regional distribution characteristics of irrigation water energy structure in china 2 materials and methods as seen in fig 1 the research was conducted utilizing the concept from part to whole based on deconstructed water supply scenarios the basic irrigation process has been subdivided into three secondary steps water intake delivery and distribution with each stage corresponding to the respective water source type water delivery technique and water distribution technology these alternatives can be combined to form a series of irrigation scenarios from which the irrigation energy consumption and ghg emissions per unit volume of water could be estimated depending on the pumping head and energy source type of each water supply scenario each province s total irrigation water was allocated to each water supply scenario the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of irrigation on a regional and national scale might be calculated cumulatively note ghgr diesel ghg emission factor of diesel ghgr electricity ghg emission factor of electricity 2 1 division of irrigation water supply scenarios surface water and groundwater are included in the water source type depending on whether the water is pressured during irrigation surface water might be further classified as pressured or gravity flow surface water consequently the kind of water source might be classified as pressured surface water gravity flow surface water and pressured groundwater the delivery modes of irrigation water include open channel and pressurized pipeline among which open channel includes earth canal and canal lining therefore water conveyance modes could also be divided into three types water distribution technology could be divided into four types surface irrigation including furrow irrigation and other surface irrigation technologies sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and low pressure pipe irrigation with three water conveyance systems and four water distribution technologies producing 24 irrigation scenarios for surface water under pressure and surface water flowing by gravity is possible when groundwater is utilized for irrigation there is low water loss during irrigation water delivery thus just field water distribution technology is evaluated resulting in four additional water supply scenarios therefore a total of 28 water supply scenarios are obtained considering the types of irrigation water sources water delivery methods and field water distribution methods see supplementary table s1 for more details 2 2 water supply scenario based unit energy consumption 2 2 1 net energy consumption per unit volume nev net energy consumption per unit volume is the amount of energy necessary to replenish 1 m3 of water for crops disregarding water loss during transport and field distribution the following equation may compute the pumping energy consumption eurnet per unit of water volume rothausen and conway 2011 1 eur net 9 8 th 3 6 10 6 efficiency where th m is the total water pumping head related to the water source type water delivery distance and field water distribution technology efficiency is the overall efficiency of the pump system which mainly depends on the pump efficiency energy type and energy conversion efficiency when the water source is pressurized surface water the total pumping head can be calculated by 2 th sp lift sp ah fl where lift sp m is the lifting head of surface water with the altitude difference between the irrigated area and water intakes and the head loss during the water delivery process lift sp m of different provinces were obtained by querying the statistical data of water resources and records of 30 provinces zou et al 2015 and ciddc china irrigation and drainage development center 2008 ciddc 2009 ah m is the working head of the field water distribution technology fl m is the head loss of the field distribution network for the gravity flow surface water sg there is no need to raise the water head during the delivery process and the total pumping head could be calculated by 3 th sg ah fl for the water source of pressured groundwater gp the total pumping head relates closely to the lifting head of groundwater 4 th gp lift gp ah fl comprehensive data on groundwater lifting heads in china s various provinces are still unavailable according to wang et al 2012 s field study of 366 villages across the nation the groundwater lifting head is directly proportional to the groundwater level as demonstrated by eq 5 in light of this eq 5 was utilized to compute the groundwater lifting heads for this investigation the data were acquired from the china geological environment monitoring ground water level yearbook china geological environment monitoring institute 2011 the lifting head of surface water and ground water is displayed in supplementary table s2 5 lift gp 0 906 g l 21 75 surface irrigation furrow irrigation border irrigation is the most traditional irrigation method for different types of water delivery technologies it is the only irrigation system that does not require pressure low pressure pipe irrigation refers to providing water to a field through a pipe with a general outlet water head of 0 5 1 5 m consequently 1 m was utilized in this investigation sprinkler and drip irrigation are common water saving irrigation methods with excellent efficiency the operational head of the sprinkler ranges from 10 m for low pressure sprinklers to over 50 m for large volume sprinklers this investigation measured the functional sprinkler head at a mean distance of 30 m the operating head of an emitter is typically 5 15 m in this study the working head of the emitter was taken as 10 m in addition the technical code for water saving irrigation projects gb t 50085 2007 stipulates that the head loss of the sprinkler irrigation system and drip irrigation system through the pipeline must not exceed 20 of the operating pressure of the sprinkler nozzle or drip emitter therefore the head loss for sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation technology pipe networks was assumed to be 6 m and 2 m respectively in this study the network loss of low pressure pipe irrigation was assumed to be 15 m commonly 10 20 m see supplementary table s3 for more details

powered by an electric motor eurmotor and a diesel engine eurdiesel in different provinces of china and its energy source type may be estimated currently both energy sources are utilized statewide and provincial level statistics on power source distribution for pumps are quite challenging wang et al 2012 found that electric pumps and diesel pumps accounted for 76 and 24 respectively of the energy sources of water pumps a finding that was adopted by cremades et al 2016 and qiu et al 2018 in the lack of more reliable data this analysis relies on wang s survey results for all the provinces although the amount of water pump energy sources in various provinces will undoubtedly vary therefore the nev could be calculated by 8 eur net 0 76 eur motor 0 24 eur diesel 2 2 2 gross energy consumption per unit volume gev due to the water loss during transportation and field distribution the energy required to supplement 1 m3 of water to a crop should be much greater than the energy estimated by eq 8 and eq 9 may be used to determine the gev 9 eur gross eur net η trans η dis where η trans is the delivery efficiency of irrigation water η dis is the distribution efficiency of irrigation water the common ranges and values are taken in this study of η trans and η dis are shown in table 1 2 3 water supply scenarios based on irrigation volume division the agricultural water consumption of all provinces in china could be obtained from the china statistical yearbook nbsc 2005 nbsc 2010 and nbsc 2015 where irrigation amounts to 90 of the total agricultural water consumption the irrigation water might thereafter be allocated to 28 water supply scenarios there are two primary processes involved in water distribution 1 water distribution is based on the source of water in 2010 2012 china performed its first national water census and defined the irrigated area of various water sources at the province level the national water census classified irrigation water sources as reservoirs rivers and lakes dams wells and others based on water source conditions reservoirs rivers lakes and dams are examples of surface water sources wells are examples of groundwater sources and the control area of other water sources is often less than 5 other water sources were included in surface water source calculations for convenience in accordance with the management area of each province s water pumping station for reservoirs rivers lakes and dams the surface water source was classified into surface water pumping sp and surface water gravity flow sg these statistics were used to determine the proportion of surface water pumping sp surface water gravity flow sg and groundwater pumping gp controlled irrigation area in each province under the assumption of a linear relationship between the proportion of water volume and the proportion of control area for various water sources zou et al 2015 irrigation water may be distributed based on the type of water source in table 2 it demonstrates the distribution ratio of each water source in each province where tf is the water delivery factor tp is the proportion of water delivery control area df is the water distribution factor dp is the proportion of water distribution control area j represents the j th water delivery method k represents the k th water distribution technology since the lower the water transmission efficiency and water distribution efficiency the more the irrigation water demand the water delivery and water distribution factors in eq 10 are respectively the reciprocal of the water delivery efficiency and the water distribution efficiency the water delivery methods and distribution technology control area of each province and their proportions are obtained from the china statistical yearbook nbsc 2005 nbsc 2010 nbsc 2015 and the china water statistics yearbook mwr 2005 mwr 2010 mwr 2015 the water distribution mechanism s impact is no longer considered when the water source type is groundwater the cf u for water distribution for the four irrigation scenarios with groundwater as the source is 11 cf uk df k dp k the irrigation water volume under 28 irrigation scenarios in each province could be calculated according to the water volume of different water sources and the comprehensive water distribution factor 2 4 irrigation energy consumption the irrigation energy consumption was investigated in three forms total irrigation energy consumption tec energy consumption per unit area eca and energy consumption per unit volume ecv 2 4 1 tec the tec could be calculated by 12 energy total i 1 n eur i v i where i is the i th water supply scenario eur i is the energy consumption per unit volume of the i th scenario kwh m3 v i is the water consumption of the i th scenario m3 2 4 2 eca the eca could be calculated by 13 energy a i 1 n eur i v i a where a is the effective irrigation area hm2 2 4 3 ecv the ecv could be calculated by 14 energy v i 1 n eur i v i i 1 n v i 2 5 greenhouse gas emission the co2e per unit volume of irrigation water considering the two energy sources of electricity and diesel is calculated as follows 15 ghgr 0 76 eur motor ghgr ele 0 24 eur engine ghgr diesel where ghgr ele and ghgr diesel are the co2e of unit energy consumption of electricity and diesel kgco2e kwh 1 was taken as 0 95 kgco2ekwh 1 and 0 32 kgco2ekwh 1 for ghgr ele and ghgr diesel in china wang et al 2012 the total greenhouse gas emission was calculated by 16 ghg e i 1 n ghgr i v i where ghgri is the co2e emission per unit volume of irrigation water under the ith water supply scenario 2 6 spatial distribution pattern of irrigation water energy ghg emission in china to explore the geographical distribution pattern of irrigation water energy ghg emission in china 30 provinces were classified using the k means clustering technique khan and ahmad 2013 according to k means clustering technology wca eca and ecv of each province are mainly analyzed to find out their distribution characteristics see supplementary information for more details 2 7 impact of water saving technology on irrigation energy consumption and ghg emission the effective irrigation area in china continues to expand simultaneously under the guidance and encouragement of several policies the area of water saving irrigation sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation low pressure pipe irrigation and channel lining has expanded rapidly and the structural composition of various irrigation technology control areas irrigation water consumption and energy consumption has shifted to evaluate the impact of speeding the development of water saving irrigation technology on irrigation energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we posited a scenario of robust development that is not pushed by policies under this scenario the effective irrigation area of china in 2015 was assumed to remain unchanged to ensure food production security each water saving irrigation technology s annual average growth rate is consistent with the annual compound annual growth rate cagr of the national effective irrigation area from 2005 to 2015 the compound annual growth rate cagr is the annual growth rate of an investment over a specific period using the 2005 application area of each water saving irrigation technology as a starting point determine the 2015 application area of each technology under the hypothetical scenario the difference between irrigation water usage irrigation energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions under hypothetical and actual conditions might show the effect of the fast development of water saving irrigation technology the equation for calculating the cagr of the effective irrigation area is 17 cagr s m s n 1 m n 1 where s m and s n is the effective irrigation area of the m th and n th year 3 results 3 1 water supply scenarios based on unit energy consumption 3 1 1 net energy consumption per unit volume nev according to eqs 2 and 3 the surface water s lifting head is either 0 or a particular number for gravity flow and surface water under pressure the nev calculation findings are contingent on the water supply mechanism each province corresponds to 12 nevs based on the three types of water sources and four water distribution technologies fig 2 depicts the nevs of 30 provinces in china the higher the energy consumption the closer the color is to red as illustrated in the graph the nev of irrigation water varies considerably between situations and provinces the nevs for surface and groundwater pumping vary from 0 08 to 1 34 and 0 26 0 98 kwh m3 respectively whereas the nevs for surface water gravity flow irrigation range from 0 to 0 36 kwh m3 due to surface artesian irrigation head loss along the course is disregarded when calculating the net energy consumption per unit volume hence the calculation results for each province are identical the energy consumption of sp irrigation is heavily influenced by the distribution of water resources altitude and water delivery distance and varies substantially between provinces for example zhejiang province is abundant with water resources and the nev of sp irrigation is only 0 05 0 40 kwh m3 while shanxi is one of the most water deficient provinces in china and is located on the loess plateau the nev of sp irrigation reaches 0 99 1 34

research object of this article was 30 provinces of china data from china s hong kong macao taiwan and shanghai are not included 3 1 2 gross energy consumption per unit volume gev taking into account the efficacy of water delivery and distribution under various scenarios the gevs of 28 water supply scenarios in each province were estimated see supplementary table s4 for more details the gev has a distribution pattern comparable to the nev the gev rises significantly when earth canal deliveries and surface irrigation are employed for instance in the provinces of gansu and shanxi the actual energy consumption for 1 m3 of water in the field is 3 82 kwh and 3 74 kwh respectively the gev for groundwater irrigation is between 0 42 and 1 30 kwh m3 since there is no water loss during transfer in regions with surface water gravity flow irrigation conditions such as snow mountain melt water reservoir storage water etc this portion of water should be fully utilized for irrigation to reduce the irrigation energy consumption as determined by an analysis of gev under different irrigation scenarios in different provinces in areas that require the pump to lift the water head for surface water or groundwater it is necessary to consider both the water and energy consumption in the design of irrigation systems and select appropriate water delivery methods and water distribution techniques the use of sprinkler irrigation or low pressure pipe irrigation technology will substantially increase gev compared to conventional surface irrigation technology when drip irrigation technology is utilized the energy consumption of irrigation in all types of water delivery systems is lower than that of surface irrigation in most provinces this is due to the compensatory impact between the pump pressurization and the water saving effect 3 2 irrigation water energy ghg emission in china 3 2 1 provincial scale 3 2 1 1 irrigation water consumption from 2005 2015 the total irrigation water usage grew in 16 provinces and declined in 14 provinces fig 3a the pace at which irrigation water use in heilongjiang increased by 63 from 17 3 billion m3 to 28 1 billion m3 is the highest in china meanwhile heilongjiang is ranked second in the 30 provinces for irrigation water consumption the fast rise in effective irrigation area in heilongjiang province is primarily responsible for the quick increase in irrigation water usage expanding by 142 4 between 2005 and 2015 from 2 28 million hm2 to 5 53 million hm2 xinjiang is the province with the highest irrigation water use reaching 49 2 billion m3 in 2015 the largest decrease rate 49 in irrigation water consumption was in beijing which dropped from 1 140 billion m3 to 0 576 billion m3 beijing also has the lowest usage of irrigation water among the 30 provinces except for xinjiang irrigation water consumption in various chinese provinces is higher in the east and lower in the west per china s precipitation rates from 2005 2015 the irrigation water consumption per unit area wca decreased in 17 provinces and climbed in 13 provinces fig 3b the province with the largest drop was heilongjiang decreasing from 7576 5 m3 hm2 to 4740 0 m3 hm2 the most significant increase was in qinghai province increasing from 6693 0 m3 hm2 to 8593 5 m3 hm2 corresponding to a 28 increase in 2005 the wca of two provinces tibet and ningxia topped 1000 0 m3 with respective values of 16 027 5 m3 hm2 and 15 564 0 m3 hm2 by 2015 the wca in these two provinces was significantly reduced to 11 523 0 m3 hm2 and 11 016 0 m3 hm2 respectively the wca of china s provinces is high in the west low in the east high in the south and low in the north as seen in the graph provinces like shandong henan hebei and anhui china s principal grain producing regions have wcas below 3000 0 m3 hm2 due to reasonably extensive farmland water conservation infrastructure the wca in the southeastern and western provinces of xinjiang tibet qinghai and gansu exceeded 7500 0 m3 hm2 note the specific data of each province in this figure can be obtained from supplementary table s5 due to data limitations the research object of this article was 30 provinces of china data from china s hong kong macao taiwan and shanghai are not included 3 2 1 2 irrigation energy consumption it is evident that from 2005 to 2015 the overall irrigation energy consumption of various provinces increased fig 4a twenty five provinces raised their energy consumption while just five provinces hebei tianjin beijing jiangsu and hunan decreased their irrigation energy use among them beijing has the highest energy consumption reduction 49 9 from 593 0 million kwh to 297 0 million kwh and the remaining four provinces have a 3 2 10 1 decrease in irrigation energy consumption fujian was the province with the greatest growth in irrigation energy use 75 6 from 275 0 million kwh to 484 0 million kwh xinjiang is the province with the largest energy usage for irrigation which reached 11 3 billion kwh in 2015 a 46 1 increase from 2005 the distribution of irrigation energy consumption across the country reveals that northern provinces such as heilongjiang xinjiang and the north china plain have the highest irrigation energy consumption from 2005 2015 the irrigation energy consumption per unit area eca decreased in 11 provinces and climbed in 19 provinces fig 4b the province with the most significant decrease was heilongjiang which decreased by 35 from 2428 5 kwh hm2 to 1579 5 kwh hm2 the province of qinghai had the largest rise from 381 0 kwh hm2 to 723 0 kwh hm2 an increase of 89 8 the eca of three provinces heilongjiang xinjiang and ningxia exceeded 2250 0 kwh hm2 in 2005 by the end of 2015 the eca in these three provinces had dropped by 5 3 35 the results also implies that the eca of each province in the north of the country is high in many northern regions the eca surpasses 1200 kwh hm2 but it is often below 600 kwh hm2 in southern provinces from 2005 2015 twenty seven of the thirty provinces exhibited a rising trend of energy consumption per unit volume of water ecv fig 4c fujian hainan and qinghai are the provinces with substantially higher growth rates with increasing rates of 91 1 47 8 and 36 6 respectively only jiangxi shanxi and beijing showed a downward trend in ecv with decreased rates of 16 6 2 4 and 0 9 respectively by 2015 shanxi province had the highest ecv 0 57 kwh m3 while guangdong province had the lowest ecv 0 02 kwh m3 northern provinces have much greater ecv than southern provinces from a national viewpoint in provinces with scarce water resources such as shanxi inner mongolia and the north china plain the groundwater supply surpasses 50 of the total irrigation water the serious over extraction of groundwater all year round leads to a continuous decline of groundwater level and severe ground funnels were formed leading to the energy consumption to extract water increasing yearly in the southern provinces especially the southeastern coastal provinces the gravity flow of surface water accounts for a large proportion contributing to the low ecv note the specific data of each province in this figure can be obtained from supplementary table s5 due to data limitations the research object of this article was 30 provinces of china data from china s hong kong macao taiwan and shanghai are not included 3 2 1 3 greenhouse gas emission from 2005 2015 the greenhouse gas emissions fell in five provinces and grew in 25 provinces fig 5 with beijing seeing the largest fall from 391 1 mkg to 195 7mkg a reduction of 50 the province with the greatest rise was fujian which grew by 76 from 181 5 mkg to 318 7 mkg as of 2015 xinjiang had the highest total greenhouse gas emissions with 7434 9 mkg while tibet had the lowest with 49 0 mkg as shown in the diagram greenhouse gas emissions in the northern provinces are generally higher than in the southern provinces with shanxi inner mongolia and the north china plain leading contributors to such high emissions most of these provinces are china s grain producing regions and face a severe water shortage therefore irrigation water has to rely on groundwater which accounts for more than 50 of the total irrigation water even more than 70 in hebei beijing the groundwater level decreases annually due to perennial groundwater extraction forming a dangerous underground funnel and the total greenhouse gas emission rises as annual water consumption rises compared to the southern provinces gravity artesian water diversion irrigation accounts for a greater proportion of irrigation water and total greenhouse gas emissions decreased as irrigation energy consumption decreased note the specific data of each province in this figure can be obtained from supplementary table s6 due to data limitations the research object of this article was 30 provinces of china data from china s hong kong macao taiwan and shanghai are not included 3 2 1 4 spatial distribution pattern of water energy ghg based on k means cluster analysis in 2015 a k means clustering analysis was conducted using thirty provinces wca eca and ecv the 30 provinces were separated into five groups fig 6 based on the numerical value of each cluster center wca eca and ecv can be categorized as high medium or low table 3 displays the classification results of the evaluation indexes for each cluster note due to data limitations the research object of this article was 30 provinces of china data from china s hong kong macao taiwan and shanghai are not included the wca is the highest for the first class tibet guangdong guangxi and hainan provinces while the eca and evc are the lowest therefore improving irrigation in these provinces further improves the irrigation water use efficiency the wca eca and ecv are all at elevated levels for the second class xinjiang ningxia the most significant contradiction is between irrigation water volume and irrigation energy consumption further optimization of the planting structure and irrigation transmission and distribution technology is required to resolve the contradiction and achieve the irrigation water and energy saving dual goals the third class qinghai gansu zhejiang jiangxi fujian and the fourth class shaanxi inner mongolia heilongjiang jilin liaoning jiangsu hubei hunan yunnan guizhou sichuan chongqing present relatively moderate irrigation water and energy consumption and the third class should be further tapped for water saving potential in contrast provinces in the fourth class should focus more on irrigation related energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions the fifth class consists primarily of the north china plain and the province of shanxi the region relies heavily on groundwater resources due to a severe lack of irrigation water resources this region has the lowest wca and the highest ecv due to the annual drop in groundwater level considering this area belongs to china s main grain production area the development of high efficiency water saving agriculture and cross regional water transfer could be further adopted to ensure the irrigation water resources and avoid the excessive exploitation of groundwater resources at the same time 3 2 2 national scale the statistical data of various provinces were integrated to obtain national scale irrigation water energy ghg emissions data to ensure a stable food supply under continuous population growth china s effective irrigated area continued to grow steadily increasing from 56 0 million hm2 in 2005 to 66 1 million hm2 in 2015 in comparison to 2005 the growth rates in 2010 and 2015 were 7 4 and 18 0 respectively with the expansion of effective irrigation area irrigation water and energy consumption continued to rise with the rate of increase for irrigation water consumption increasing by 3 2 and 7 9 in 2010 and 2015 respectively and the rate of increase for irrigation energy consumption increasing by 8 2 and 22 3 to 57 0 and 64 4 billion kwh the trend of fluctuating ghg emissions is identical to fluctuating energy consumption in 2005 2010 and 2015 the equivalents of agricultural irrigation ghg emissions were 34 7 37 6 and 42 5 mt co2e respectively china s water consumption per unit area has decreased significantly due to the rapid development of water saving irrigation technology from 5703 1 m3 hm2 in 2005 to 5479 5 m3 hm2 in 2010 and 5216 3 m3 hm2 in 2015 the energy consumption per unit area for irrigation increased from 940 5 kwh hm2 in 2005 to 974 7 kwh hm2 in 2015 an increase of 3 6 the energy consumption per unit volume of water increased relatively rapidly between 2005 and 2015 from 0 165 kwh m3 to 0 187 kwh m3 fig 7 3 3 impact of water saving technology on irrigation energy consumption and ghg emission the country s effective irrigated area has increased from 56 0 million hm2 in 2005 to 66 1 million hm2 in 2015 with a growth rate of 18 0 and an annual compound annual growth rate of 1 67 table 4 the growth rates of the application area for water efficient irrigation technologies are significantly higher than those of the effective irrigation area the total area utilizing water saving irrigation technologies increased from 17 3 million hm2 to 32 1 million hm2 at an increased rate of 85 3 and an annual compound growth rate of 6 35 the proportion of water saving irrigation area to total effective irrigation area increased from 30 9 to 48 5 the area under drip irrigation has exploded from 0 60 million hm2 to 5 27 million hm2 with a growth rate and compound growth rate of 744 7 and 23 8 respectively the application of drip irrigation in cotton cultivation in xinjiang where the drip irrigation area increased from 0 38 million hm2 in 2005 to 3 12 million hm2 by the end of 2015 contributed to the rapid advancement of drip irrigation technology the drip irrigation area in xinjiang accounts for 59 3 of the total drip irrigation area in the country the application area of the other three water saving irrigation technologies is also growing rapidly channel lining is the most prevalent of the four types of water saving irrigation technologies the controlled irrigation area of channel lining reached 14 5 million hm2 in 2015 assuming that the annual growth rate of each water saving irrigation technology is consistent with the cagr of the effective irrigation area and using the 2005 application area of each water saving irrigation technology as the baseline fig 8 depicts the application area of each water saving irrigation technology in 2015 under the assumption scenario the difference between the actual and assumed application areas for each technology represents the incentive effect of the policy s guidance the graph demonstrates that the policy incentive significantly impacts the promotion and implementation of water saving irrigation technology compared to the assumed scenario the actual application area of sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation low pressure pipe irrigation and canal lining technology has increased by 19 8 619 2 48 3 and 34 7 respectively the application area of water saving irrigation technology a total of four technologies has expanded by 50 5 the national irrigation water consumption irrigation energy consumption and ghg emissions under the hypothetical scenario in 2015 reached 393 7 billion m3 68 8 billion kwh and 46 3 mt co2e respectively while the actual values of these indicators were lower than the hypothetical scenario reaching 49 0 billion m3 4 35 billion kwh and 3 82mt co2e see supplementary fig s1 for more details it demonstrates that the promotion and implementation of water saving irrigation technology have effectively decreased irrigation water energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of southern and northern provinces the distribution of water resources in china is highly unequal with more water resources in the south and less in the north the distribution characteristics of irrigation water and irrigation energy consumption in china from north to south are analyzed further the northern regions of china excluding hong kong macao and taiwan include 16 provinces beijing tianjin hebei shanxi inner mongolia liaoning jilin heilongjiang shandong henan tibet shaanxi gansu qinghai ningxia and xinjiang southern china comprises fifteen provinces shanghai jiangsu zhejiang anhui fujian jiangxi hubei hunan guangdong guangxi hainan sichuan chongqing guizhou and yunnan according to our analysis the irrigated areas in both north and south china are growing annually but the growth rate and effective irrigated area in north china are greater as of 2015 the irrigated area in the north accounted for 56 44 of the whole in terms of irrigation water consumption north china and south china remain the same and the water consumption per unit area in the north is lower than that in the south using 2015 as an example the irrigation water per unit area in the south is 5994 2 m3 hm2 while in the north it is 4616 4 m3 hm2 fig 9 although precipitation in south china is significantly greater than in north china jin et al 2021 irrigation water per unit area in south china is still greater than in north china this may be since in the south of china crops typically mature twice or three times per year whereas in the north crops mature once per year or every two years furthermore more water intensive crops such as rice are cultivated in southern china regarding energy the irrigation energy consumption in northern and southern provinces accounted for 78 and 22 of the national irrigation energy consumption respectively energy consumption per unit area was approximately 1362 0 kwh hm2 and 473 1 kwh hm2 while energy consumption per unit volume was approximately 0 30 kwh m3 and 0 08 kwh m3 respectively the significant difference in irrigation energy consumption between the north and south directly results from the disparate distribution of water resources and population some provinces in the northwest of china are sparsely populated and there is always a substantial loss of water volume and water head during long distance water transfer in the northeast plain irrigation water relies more on groundwater extraction the groundwater level keeps dropping and irrigation energy consumption increases yearly qiu et al 2018 in contrast water and hydropower resources are relatively abundant in south china the cultivated land is close to the water source and the transmission energy loss is small moreover many provinces in the south are suitable for dam storage and developing hydropower resources to form gravity flow which can significantly reduce irrigation energy consumption agricultural irrigation in northern regions has a bigger energy consumption load than in southern china in the construction and design of irrigation systems the interaction between water and energy in the irrigation process must be considered holistically 4 2 comparison with other studies prior research has focused on regional irrigation energy consumption rodríguez et al 2011b qiu et al 2018 chen et al 2019 or focused on groundwater irrigation energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions shah 2009 griffiths sattenspiel and wilson 2009 wang et al 2012 cremades et al 2016 however few studies have been able to conduct quantitative studies on national irrigation energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of all water sources including both underground water and surface water which limits the overall understanding of the composition of irrigation energy consumption and the proposal of corresponding irrigation energy consumption regulation strategies table 5 to validate the correctness of this work we compared the computation findings from this study to those from prior research in addition findings from this study can also provide more comprehensive data and more multidimensional analysis perspective so as to provide support for the proposal of irrigation energy consumption regulation strategies china has the second biggest irrigated area in the world yet surprisingly little is known about the nation s irrigation energy use wang et al 2012 and cremades et al 2016 studied the ghg emission equivalent of groundwater irrigation in china in 2005 and 2011 and the results were 33 1 and 22 4 mt co2e respectively in this study china s groundwater pumping irrigation ghg emissions grew annually from 2005 to 2015 ranging from 23 4 to 27 5 mt co2e the findings concur with cremades et al 2016 which are much lower than wang s in wang s study the necessary data for estimating the ghg emissions of 11 provinces were gathered using a questionnaire survey however the restricted number of samples in certain provinces may have reduced the results representativeness for example just three villages were examined in shandong province and historic agricultural cities such as heze and jining were excluded from the study according to wang s research groundwater pumping irrigation accounts for 93 of total irrigation water usage which is higher than the values reported in our study the annual water volume drawn from the yellow river in shandong is about 6 7 billion m3 accounting for one third of the province s water consumption in addition a specific volume of water is taken from the south to north water transfer project according to statistics from the national water census ground pumping water surface gravity flow water and surface pumping water are 43 4 33 0 and 23 4 respectively using these data the predicted ghg emissions from groundwater pumping irrigation are closer to the actual situation therefore the method proposed in this study can effectively reduce the deviation between the survey results and the actual value caused by limited survey samples the national irrigation ghg emission in 2011 obtained by cremades et al 2016 was 38 8 mt co2e this study ranges from 34 7 to 42 5 mt co2e increasing gradually from 2005 to 2015 it is consistent with the findings of cremades s work which also demonstrates the excellent computational precision of the approach utilized in this paper qiu et al 2018 studied the energy consumption of groundwater irrigation in the north china plain from 1993 to 2013 qiu s study obtained energy consumption per unit volume was 0 50 0 61kwh m3 according to this study groundwater irrigation s energy usage per unit volume on the north china plain was 0 55 0 57 kwh m3 chen et al 2019 calculated the energy consumption of groundwater irrigation in the north china plain at a more precise county scale the results indicate that during the winter wheat summer corn planting mode the north china plain s groundwater irrigation energy consumption per unit area is 1122 4 kwh hm2 according to this study this result is 1124 2 1179 2 kwh hm2 which also agrees with chen s research results the consistency of the results of these studies proves the reliability of the results of this study on this basis this study further obtains that the total energy consumption of groundwater irrigation in the north china plain is 104 4 106 7 billion kwh year and the ghg emission equivalent is about 6 88 7 03 mt co2e therefore it provides more complete data support from the time and space dimensions for the quantitative analysis and control strategy formulation of groundwater irrigation energy consumption and carbon emissions in the region nevertheless there are also some limitations in this study due to the limited data that can be obtained we are not able to perform higher accuracy energy consumption calculation for the time being for example due to the limited number of measured groundwater depth monitoring data in each province we took the average value of available monitoring data as the characteristic groundwater depth of each province without considering the fluctuation of groundwater level with time and regional changes with the further improvement of the statistical data network in the future more accurate calculation results can be obtained 5 conclusion based on the physical processes of irrigation energy consumption and ghg emission this study proposed a technique for predicting provincial and national levels of irrigation energy consumption and ghg emissions using limited statistical data the main conclusions are as follows 1 the net unit volume irrigation energy consumption is 0 1 34 kwh m3 and the gross unit volume irrigation energy consumption range is 0 3 82 kwh m3 priority should be given to constructing surface water gravity flow irrigation it is essential to consider the trade off between irrigation water utilization efficiency and energy consumption when designing the irrigation system s delivery techniques and distribution techniques 2 from 2005 2015 the effective irrigation area nationwide increased by 18 0 of which the water saving irrigation area increased rapidly with an increase of 85 3 the increase in irrigation water and irrigation energy consumption in 2015 compared with 2005 was 7 9 and 22 3 and the ghg emissions in irrigation were 42 5 mt co2e in 2015 the irrigation water use per unit area and energy consumption per unit area has decreased dramatically reaching 347 8 m3 and 974 7 kwh hm2 respectively rapidly advancing water saving irrigation technology may improve china s irrigation water energy ghg emission structure guarantee food production security enhance irrigation efficiency and regulate irrigation energy consumption within a tolerable range 3 the distribution of irrigation water energy greenhouse gas emission structure is not uniform and the structure is significantly different northern provinces face the dual pressure of rapid growth of water resources and energy consumption for irrigation the northern provinces supply 48 9 of the irrigation water and 56 4 of the irrigated area with 18 8 of the average water resources for many years providing 78 of the irrigation energy consumption the energy consumption per unit volume and the energy

8982,irrigation modernization impacts irrigation energy consumption and greenhouse gas ghg emissions enhancing irrigation water efficiency to systematically examine the impact of irrigation system modernization on china s irrigation energy consumption and ghg emissions a scenario decomposition based calculation method of irrigation energy consumption and ghg emissions at national and provincial scales based on the physical processes of irrigation energy consumption was proposed the relationship between irrigation water consumption energy consumption and ghg emissions during the rapid development period 2005 2015 of water saving irrigation technology in china was clarified the data demonstrate that the irrigation water volume and energy consumption increased by 7 9 and 22 3 respectively from 2005 to 2015 and the national equivalent of ghg reached 42 5 mt co2e in 2015 water energy consumption across the country was extremely divergent the irrigation energy consumption per unit volume of water and per unit area is 3 74 and 2 88 times more in the northern provinces than in the southern provinces promoting water saving irrigation technology can effectively improve china s irrigation water energy ghg emissions structure which can help improve irrigation efficiency while ensuring no dramatic increase in irrigation energy consumption water saving irrigation technologies should be promoted following the local conditions throughout the country the relationship between irrigation water energy ghg emissions in northern provinces should be considered significantly keywords water saving irrigation technology agricultural irrigation irrigation energy consumption surface water groundwater data availability the authors are unable or have chosen not to specify which data has been used 1 introduction china is facing severe water shortages the average annual water shortage for irrigation has exceeded 3 1010 m3 in recent years wang et al 2018 however china s water resources are unevenly distributed in time and space and irrigation water is crucial to food security the grain yield exhibits a synchronized changing pattern with the irrigated area china s agricultural irrigation water consumption rate is still relatively low the utilization coefficient of irrigation water refers to the ratio of the amount of water applied to the field to the total amount of water introduced to the irrigation system in 2020 the utilization coefficient of irrigation water was about 0 565 ji 2021 to alleviate the water shortage for agriculture and ensure food production security the chinese government has vigorously issued a series of policies to develop water saving irrigation technologies since 2005 in 2011 the no 1 central document proposed that 4 trillion cny 635 billion would be invested in water conservancy construction and development from 2010 to 2020 people s daily 2011 liu and wu 2012 the ministry of water resources 2017 issued the implementation plan for the newly increased water saving irrigation area of 6 67 million hm2 in the 13th five year period 2 61 million hm2 is drip irrigation local governments also implemented effective initiatives locally such as inner mongolia s intention to expand 2 67 million acres of highly efficient water saving irrigation regions from 2016 to 2020 inner mongolia 2016 china has launched unprecedented agricultural irrigation modernization reforms inspired by a series of policies in 2018 the irrigation water usage coefficient increased to 0 554 china water resources bulletin 2018 similar to the promotion of water saving irrigation in china other countries around the world are also pushing for water saving irrigation research on the relationship between irrigation water and energy has been conducted in spain india and pakistan and general observations were obtained that the increase in irrigation efficiency has led to a significant increase in the use of irrigation energy and an increase in the total carbon footprint of pumped irrigation in countries such as india spain and pakistan shah 2009 rodríguez et al 2011a grafton et al 2018 zhao et al 2020 siyal et al 2021 therefore it is important to clarify the trend for the irrigation water energy ghg relationship in china amidst the fast growth of water saving irrigation which will optimize the planning design operation and management of water saving irrigation projects the current research on the relationship between irrigation water energy ghg is still scant and faces a global dearth rodríguez et al 2011b investigated the relationship between irrigation water and energy in the ten irrigation districts in southern spain the irrigation energy consumption per hectare was about 1000 kwh jackson et al 2010 investigated ground and pressure irrigation s energy consumption under different water sources and analyzed two irrigation districts in new south wales and south australia chai et al 2020 reported that irrigation activities may lead to an increase in ghg emissions in the field qiu et al 2018 and chen et al 2019 focused on the energy consumption and ghg of groundwater irrigation in the north china plain wang et al 2012 estimated ghg emissions from groundwater irrigation in china for the first time by field study and estimation with the conclusion being 33 1 mt co2 equivalent co2e carbon dioxide emissions in the mid 2000 s accounted for 0 58 of china s total co2 emissions in 2016 above all it can be implied that irrigation water shows a significant energy cost in addition various energy consuming components are frequently omitted while conducting statistical analyses of irrigation energy use for instance espinosa tasón et al 2020 showed that irrigation energy consumption in spain increased six fold from 1950 to 2017 assuming that surface water irrigation had a uniform delivery head loss of 5 m on a national scale jackson et al 2010 found that the energy consumption of pressurized irrigation rose by 3 163 compared to surface irrigation under conditions of surface water supply however long distance delivery energy use was not factored into the calculations the channel length from the water source to the target irrigation area is 518 km due to the high altitude of the irrigation region or the great distance of inter basin water delivery surface water delivery is frequently accompanied by significant energy consumption for example the hongsibu pumping irrigation district n 37 25 30 17 e 106 03 27 58 in china draws 169 million m3 of water from the yellow river every year with a total lift of 299 05 m in order to satisfy the water supply needs of irrigated regions a lift of this magnitude requires additional energy rothausen and conway 2011 proposed that in the existing research on irrigation energy consumption the estimation accuracy of irrigation energy consumption at the national and international scales is low because it is frequently based on a large number of assumptions and lacks field survey information on energy source type pumping head and crop water consumption based on the above background this study aims to 1 develop a method for estimating energy consumption at provincial and national scales based on limited statistical data 2 determine the relationship between water energy ghg during the rapid development of china s water saving irrigation technology from 2005 to 2015 3 examine the regional distribution characteristics of irrigation water energy structure in china 2 materials and methods as seen in fig 1 the research was conducted utilizing the concept from part to whole based on deconstructed water supply scenarios the basic irrigation process has been subdivided into three secondary steps water intake delivery and distribution with each stage corresponding to the respective water source type water delivery technique and water distribution technology these alternatives can be combined to form a series of irrigation scenarios from which the irrigation energy consumption and ghg emissions per unit volume of water could be estimated depending on the pumping head and energy source type of each water supply scenario each province s total irrigation water was allocated to each water supply scenario the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of irrigation on a regional and national scale might be calculated cumulatively note ghgr diesel ghg emission factor of diesel ghgr electricity ghg emission factor of electricity 2 1 division of irrigation water supply scenarios surface water and groundwater are included in the water source type depending on whether the water is pressured during irrigation surface water might be further classified as pressured or gravity flow surface water consequently the kind of water source might be classified as pressured surface water gravity flow surface water and pressured groundwater the delivery modes of irrigation water include open channel and pressurized pipeline among which open channel includes earth canal and canal lining therefore water conveyance modes could also be divided into three types water distribution technology could be divided into four types surface irrigation including furrow irrigation and other surface irrigation technologies sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and low pressure pipe irrigation with three water conveyance systems and four water distribution technologies producing 24 irrigation scenarios for surface water under pressure and surface water flowing by gravity is possible when groundwater is utilized for irrigation there is low water loss during irrigation water delivery thus just field water distribution technology is evaluated resulting in four additional water supply scenarios therefore a total of 28 water supply scenarios are obtained considering the types of irrigation water sources water delivery methods and field water distribution methods see supplementary table s1 for more details 2 2 water supply scenario based unit energy consumption 2 2 1 net energy consumption per unit volume nev net energy consumption per unit volume is the amount of energy necessary to replenish 1 m3 of water for crops disregarding water loss during transport and field distribution the following equation may compute the pumping energy consumption eurnet per unit of water volume rothausen and conway 2011 1 eur net 9 8 th 3 6 10 6 efficiency where th m is the total water pumping head related to the water source type water delivery distance and field water distribution technology efficiency is the overall efficiency of the pump system which mainly depends on the pump efficiency energy type and energy conversion efficiency when the water source is pressurized surface water the total pumping head can be calculated by 2 th sp lift sp ah fl where lift sp m is the lifting head of surface water with the altitude difference between the irrigated area and water intakes and the head loss during the water delivery process lift sp m of different provinces were obtained by querying the statistical data of water resources and records of 30 provinces zou et al 2015 and ciddc china irrigation and drainage development center 2008 ciddc 2009 ah m is the working head of the field water distribution technology fl m is the head loss of the field distribution network for the gravity flow surface water sg there is no need to raise the water head during the delivery process and the total pumping head could be calculated by 3 th sg ah fl for the water source of pressured groundwater gp the total pumping head relates closely to the lifting head of groundwater 4 th gp lift gp ah fl comprehensive data on groundwater lifting heads in china s various provinces are still unavailable according to wang et al 2012 s field study of 366 villages across the nation the groundwater lifting head is directly proportional to the groundwater level as demonstrated by eq 5 in light of this eq 5 was utilized to compute the groundwater lifting heads for this investigation the data were acquired from the china geological environment monitoring ground water level yearbook china geological environment monitoring institute 2011 the lifting head of surface water and ground water is displayed in supplementary table s2 5 lift gp 0 906 g l 21 75 surface irrigation furrow irrigation border irrigation is the most traditional irrigation method for different types of water delivery technologies it is the only irrigation system that does not require pressure low pressure pipe irrigation refers to providing water to a field through a pipe with a general outlet water head of 0 5 1 5 m consequently 1 m was utilized in this investigation sprinkler and drip irrigation are common water saving irrigation methods with excellent efficiency the operational head of the sprinkler ranges from 10 m for low pressure sprinklers to over 50 m for large volume sprinklers this investigation measured the functional sprinkler head at a mean distance of 30 m the operating head of an emitter is typically 5 15 m in this study the working head of the emitter was taken as 10 m in addition the technical code for water saving irrigation projects gb t 50085 2007 stipulates that the head loss of the sprinkler irrigation system and drip irrigation system through the pipeline must not exceed 20 of the operating pressure of the sprinkler nozzle or drip emitter therefore the head loss for sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation technology pipe networks was assumed to be 6 m and 2 m respectively in this study the network loss of low pressure pipe irrigation was assumed to be 15 m commonly 10 20 m see supplementary table s3 for more details the pump system s driving type mainly includes motor drive and diesel engine drive when driven by an electromotor the efficiency of the pump system is 6 efficiency motor μ pump μ motor 1 td loss where μ pump is the efficiency of the pump taken as 0 6 μ motor is the energy conversion efficiency of the electromotor taken as 0 76 wang et al 2012 td loss is the loss of power during the delivery process taken as 0 15 cremades et al 2016 the efficiency of the pump system was calculated to be 0 388 when driven by a diesel engine the efficiency of the pump system is 7 efficiency diesel μ pump μ engine where μ engine is the energy conversion efficiency of the diesel engine taken as 0 24 wang et al 2012 and the efficiency of the pump system was calculated to be 0 144 according to eqs 1 7 the nev is powered by an electric motor eurmotor and a diesel engine eurdiesel in different provinces of china and its energy source type may be estimated currently both energy sources are utilized statewide and provincial level statistics on power source distribution for pumps are quite challenging wang et al 2012 found that electric pumps and diesel pumps accounted for 76 and 24 respectively of the energy sources of water pumps a finding that was adopted by cremades et al 2016 and qiu et al 2018 in the lack of more reliable data this analysis relies on wang s survey results for all the provinces although the amount of water pump energy sources in various provinces will undoubtedly vary therefore the nev could be calculated by 8 eur net 0 76 eur motor 0 24 eur diesel 2 2 2 gross energy consumption per unit volume gev due to the water loss during transportation and field distribution the energy required to supplement 1 m3 of water to a crop should be much greater than the energy estimated by eq 8 and eq 9 may be used to determine the gev 9 eur gross eur net η trans η dis where η trans is the delivery efficiency of irrigation water η dis is the distribution efficiency of irrigation water the common ranges and values are taken in this study of η trans and η dis are shown in table 1 2 3 water supply scenarios based on irrigation volume division the agricultural water consumption of all provinces in china could be obtained from the china statistical yearbook nbsc 2005 nbsc 2010 and nbsc 2015 where irrigation amounts to 90 of the total agricultural water consumption the irrigation water might thereafter be allocated to 28 water supply scenarios there are two primary processes involved in water distribution 1 water distribution is based on the source of water in 2010 2012 china performed its first national water census and defined the irrigated area of various water sources at the province level the national water census classified irrigation water sources as reservoirs rivers and lakes dams wells and others based on water source conditions reservoirs rivers lakes and dams are examples of surface water sources wells are examples of groundwater sources and the control area of other water sources is often less than 5 other water sources were included in surface water source calculations for convenience in accordance with the management area of each province s water pumping station for reservoirs rivers lakes and dams the surface water source was classified into surface water pumping sp and surface water gravity flow sg these statistics were used to determine the proportion of surface water pumping sp surface water gravity flow sg and groundwater pumping gp controlled irrigation area in each province under the assumption of a linear relationship between the proportion of water volume and the proportion of control area for various water sources zou et al 2015 irrigation water may be distributed based on the type of water source in table 2 it demonstrates the distribution ratio of each water source in each province where tf is the water delivery factor tp is the proportion of water delivery control area df is the water distribution factor dp is the proportion of water distribution control area j represents the j th water delivery method k represents the k th water distribution technology since the lower the water transmission efficiency and water distribution efficiency the more the irrigation water demand the water delivery and water distribution factors in eq 10 are respectively the reciprocal of the water delivery efficiency and the water distribution efficiency the water delivery methods and distribution technology control area of each province and their proportions are obtained from the china statistical yearbook nbsc 2005 nbsc 2010 nbsc 2015 and the china water statistics yearbook mwr 2005 mwr 2010 mwr 2015 the water distribution mechanism s impact is no longer considered when the water source type is groundwater the cf u for water distribution for the four irrigation scenarios with groundwater as the source is 11 cf uk df k dp k the irrigation water volume under 28 irrigation scenarios in each province could be calculated according to the water volume of different water sources and the comprehensive water distribution factor 2 4 irrigation energy consumption the irrigation energy consumption was investigated in three forms total irrigation energy consumption tec energy consumption per unit area eca and energy consumption per unit volume ecv 2 4 1 tec the tec could be calculated by 12 energy total i 1 n eur i v i where i is the i th water supply scenario eur i is the energy consumption per unit volume of the i th scenario kwh m3 v i is the water consumption of the i th scenario m3 2 4 2 eca the eca could be calculated by 13 energy a i 1 n eur i v i a where a is the effective irrigation area hm2 2 4 3 ecv the ecv could be calculated by 14 energy v i 1 n eur i v i i 1 n v i 2 5 greenhouse gas emission the co2e per unit volume of irrigation water considering the two energy sources of electricity and diesel is calculated as follows 15 ghgr 0 76 eur motor ghgr ele 0 24 eur engine ghgr diesel where ghgr ele and ghgr diesel are the co2e of unit energy consumption of electricity and diesel kgco2e kwh 1 was taken as 0 95 kgco2ekwh 1 and 0 32 kgco2ekwh 1 for ghgr ele and ghgr diesel in china wang et al 2012 the total greenhouse gas emission was calculated by 16 ghg e i 1 n ghgr i v i where ghgri is the co2e emission per unit volume of irrigation water under the ith water supply scenario 2 6 spatial distribution pattern of irrigation water energy ghg emission in china to explore the geographical distribution pattern of irrigation water energy ghg emission in china 30 provinces were classified using the k means clustering technique khan and ahmad 2013 according to k means clustering technology wca eca and ecv of each province are mainly analyzed to find out their distribution characteristics see supplementary information for more details 2 7 impact of water saving technology on irrigation energy consumption and ghg emission the effective irrigation area in china continues to expand simultaneously under the guidance and encouragement of several policies the area of water saving irrigation sprinkler irrigation micro irrigation low pressure pipe irrigation and channel lining has expanded rapidly and the structural composition of various irrigation technology control areas irrigation water consumption and energy consumption has shifted to evaluate the impact of speeding the development of water saving irrigation technology on irrigation energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions we posited a scenario of robust development that is not pushed by policies under this scenario the effective irrigation area of china in 2015 was assumed to remain unchanged to ensure food production security each water saving irrigation technology s annual average growth rate is consistent with the annual compound annual growth rate cagr of the national effective irrigation area from 2005 to 2015 the compound annual growth rate cagr is the annual growth rate of an investment over a specific period using the 2005 application area of each water saving irrigation technology as a starting point determine the 2015 application area of each technology under the hypothetical scenario the difference between irrigation water usage irrigation energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions under hypothetical and actual conditions might show the effect of the fast development of water saving irrigation technology the equation for calculating the cagr of the effective irrigation area is 17 cagr s m s n 1 m n 1 where s m and s n is the effective irrigation area of the m th and n th year 3 results 3 1 water supply scenarios based on unit energy consumption 3 1 1 net energy consumption per unit volume nev according to eqs 2 and 3 the surface water s lifting head is either 0 or a particular number for gravity flow and surface water under pressure the nev calculation findings are contingent on the water supply mechanism each province corresponds to 12 nevs based on the three types of water sources and four water distribution technologies fig 2 depicts the nevs of 30 provinces in china the higher the energy consumption the closer the color is to red as illustrated in the graph the nev of irrigation water varies considerably between situations and provinces the nevs for surface and groundwater pumping vary from 0 08 to 1 34 and 0 26 0 98 kwh m3 respectively whereas the nevs for surface water gravity flow irrigation range from 0 to 0 36 kwh m3 due to surface artesian irrigation head loss along the course is disregarded when calculating the net energy consumption per unit volume hence the calculation results for each province are identical the energy consumption of sp irrigation is heavily influenced by the distribution of water resources altitude and water delivery distance and varies substantially between provinces for example zhejiang province is abundant with water resources and the nev of sp irrigation is only 0 05 0 40 kwh m3 while shanxi is one of the most water deficient provinces in china and is located on the loess plateau the nev of sp irrigation reaches 0 99 1 34

research object of this article was 30 provinces of china data from china s hong kong macao taiwan and shanghai are not included 3 1 2 gross energy consumption per unit volume gev taking into account the efficacy of water delivery and distribution under various scenarios the gevs of 28 water supply scenarios in each province were estimated see supplementary table s4 for more details the gev has a distribution pattern comparable to the nev the gev rises significantly when earth canal deliveries and surface irrigation are employed for instance in the provinces of gansu and shanxi the actual energy consumption for 1 m3 of water in the field is 3 82 kwh and 3 74 kwh respectively the gev for groundwater irrigation is between 0 42 and 1 30 kwh m3 since there is no water loss during transfer in regions with surface water gravity flow irrigation conditions such as snow mountain melt water reservoir storage water etc this portion of water should be fully utilized for irrigation to reduce the irrigation energy consumption as determined by an analysis of gev under different irrigation scenarios in different provinces in areas that require the pump to lift the water head for surface water or groundwater it is necessary to consider both the water and energy consumption in the design of irrigation systems and select appropriate water delivery methods and water distribution techniques the use of sprinkler irrigation or low pressure pipe irrigation technology will substantially increase gev compared to conventional surface irrigation technology when drip irrigation technology is utilized the energy consumption of irrigation in all types of water delivery systems is lower than that of surface irrigation in most provinces this is due to the compensatory impact between the pump pressurization and the water saving effect 3 2 irrigation water energy ghg emission in china 3 2 1 provincial scale 3 2 1 1 irrigation water consumption from 2005 2015 the total irrigation water usage grew in 16 provinces and declined in 14 provinces fig 3a the pace at which irrigation water use in heilongjiang increased by 63 from 17 3 billion m3 to 28 1 billion m3 is the highest in china meanwhile heilongjiang is ranked second in the 30 provinces for irrigation water consumption the fast rise in effective irrigation area in heilongjiang province is primarily responsible for the quick increase in irrigation water usage expanding by 142 4 between 2005 and 2015 from 2 28 million hm2 to 5 53 million hm2 xinjiang is the province with the highest irrigation water use reaching 49 2 billion m3 in 2015 the largest decrease rate 49 in irrigation water consumption was in beijing which dropped from 1 140 billion m3 to 0 576 billion m3 beijing also has the lowest usage of irrigation water among the 30 provinces except for xinjiang irrigation water consumption in various chinese provinces is higher in the east and lower in the west per china s precipitation rates from 2005 2015 the irrigation water consumption per unit area wca decreased in 17 provinces and climbed in 13 provinces fig 3b the province with the largest drop was heilongjiang decreasing from 7576 5 m3 hm2 to 4740 0 m3 hm2 the most significant increase was in qinghai province increasing from 6693 0 m3 hm2 to 8593 5 m3 hm2 corresponding to a 28 increase in 2005 the wca of two provinces tibet and ningxia topped 1000 0 m3 with respective values of 16 027 5 m3 hm2 and 15 564 0 m3 hm2 by 2015 the wca in these two provinces was significantly reduced to 11 523 0 m3 hm2 and 11 016 0 m3 hm2 respectively the wca of china s provinces is high in the west low in the east high in the south and low in the north as seen in the graph provinces like shandong henan hebei and anhui china s principal grain producing regions have wcas below 3000 0 m3 hm2 due to reasonably extensive farmland water conservation infrastructure the wca in the southeastern and western provinces of xinjiang tibet qinghai and gansu exceeded 7500 0 m3 hm2 note the specific data of each province in this figure can be obtained from supplementary table s5 due to data limitations the research object of this article was 30 provinces of china data from china s hong kong macao taiwan and shanghai are not included 3 2 1 2 irrigation energy consumption it is evident that from 2005 to 2015 the overall irrigation energy consumption of various provinces increased fig 4a twenty five provinces raised their energy consumption while just five provinces hebei tianjin beijing jiangsu and hunan decreased their irrigation energy use among them beijing has the highest energy consumption reduction 49 9 from 593 0 million kwh to 297 0 million kwh and the remaining four provinces have a 3 2 10 1 decrease in irrigation energy consumption fujian was the province with the greatest growth in irrigation energy use 75 6 from 275 0 million kwh to 484 0 million kwh xinjiang is the province with the largest energy usage for irrigation which reached 11 3 billion kwh in 2015 a 46 1 increase from 2005 the distribution of irrigation energy consumption across the country reveals that northern provinces such as heilongjiang xinjiang and the north china plain have the highest irrigation energy consumption from 2005 2015 the irrigation energy consumption per unit area eca decreased in 11 provinces and climbed in 19 provinces fig 4b the province with the most significant decrease was heilongjiang which decreased by 35 from 2428 5 kwh hm2 to 1579 5 kwh hm2 the province of qinghai had the largest rise from 381 0 kwh hm2 to 723 0 kwh hm2 an increase of 89 8 the eca of three provinces heilongjiang xinjiang and ningxia exceeded 2250 0 kwh hm2 in 2005 by the end of 2015 the eca in these three provinces had dropped by 5 3 35 the results also implies that the eca of each province in the north of the country is high in many northern regions the eca surpasses 1200 kwh hm2 but it is often below 600 kwh hm2 in southern provinces from 2005 2015 twenty seven of the thirty provinces exhibited a rising trend of energy consumption per unit volume of water ecv fig 4c fujian hainan and qinghai are the provinces with substantially higher growth rates with increasing rates of 91 1 47 8 and 36 6 respectively only jiangxi shanxi and beijing showed a downward trend in ecv with decreased rates of 16 6 2 4 and 0 9 respectively by 2015 shanxi province had the highest ecv 0 57 kwh m3 while guangdong province had the lowest ecv 0 02 kwh m3 northern provinces have much greater ecv than southern provinces from a national viewpoint in provinces with scarce water resources such as shanxi inner mongolia and the north china plain the groundwater supply surpasses 50 of the total irrigation water the serious over extraction of groundwater all year round leads to a continuous decline of groundwater level and severe ground funnels were formed leading to the energy consumption to extract water increasing yearly in the southern provinces especially the southeastern coastal provinces the gravity flow of surface water accounts for a large proportion contributing to the low ecv note the specific data of each province in this figure can be obtained from supplementary table s5 due to data limitations the research object of this article was 30 provinces of china data from china s hong kong macao taiwan and shanghai are not included 3 2 1 3 greenhouse gas emission from 2005 2015 the greenhouse gas emissions fell in five provinces and grew in 25 provinces fig 5 with beijing seeing the largest fall from 391 1 mkg to 195 7mkg a reduction of 50 the province with the greatest rise was fujian which grew by 76 from 181 5 mkg to 318 7 mkg as of 2015 xinjiang had the highest total greenhouse gas emissions with 7434 9 mkg while tibet had the lowest with 49 0 mkg as shown in the diagram greenhouse gas emissions in the northern provinces are generally higher than in the southern provinces with shanxi inner mongolia and the north china plain leading contributors to such high emissions most of these provinces are china s grain producing regions and face a severe water shortage therefore irrigation water has to rely on groundwater which accounts for more than 50 of the total irrigation water even more than 70 in hebei beijing the groundwater level decreases annually due to perennial groundwater extraction forming a dangerous underground funnel and the total greenhouse gas emission rises as annual water consumption rises compared to the southern provinces gravity artesian water diversion irrigation accounts for a greater proportion of irrigation water and total greenhouse gas emissions decreased as irrigation energy consumption decreased note the specific data of each province in this figure can be obtained from supplementary table s6 due to data limitations the research object of this article was 30 provinces of china data from china s hong kong macao taiwan and shanghai are not included 3 2 1 4 spatial distribution pattern of water energy ghg based on k means cluster analysis in 2015 a k means clustering analysis was conducted using thirty provinces wca eca and ecv the 30 provinces were separated into five groups fig 6 based on the numerical value of each cluster center wca eca and ecv can be categorized as high medium or low table 3 displays the classification results of the evaluation indexes for each cluster note due to data limitations the research object of this article was 30 provinces of china data from china s hong kong macao taiwan and shanghai are not included the wca is the highest for the first class tibet guangdong guangxi and hainan provinces while the eca and evc are the lowest therefore improving irrigation in these provinces further improves the irrigation water use efficiency the wca eca and ecv are all at elevated levels for the second class xinjiang ningxia the most significant contradiction is between irrigation water volume and irrigation energy consumption further optimization of the planting structure and irrigation transmission and distribution technology is required to resolve the contradiction and achieve the irrigation water and energy saving dual goals the third class qinghai gansu zhejiang jiangxi fujian and the fourth class shaanxi inner mongolia heilongjiang jilin liaoning jiangsu hubei hunan yunnan guizhou sichuan chongqing present relatively moderate irrigation water and energy consumption and the third class should be further tapped for water saving potential in contrast provinces in the fourth class should focus more on irrigation related energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions the fifth class consists primarily of the north china plain and the province of shanxi the region relies heavily on groundwater resources due to a severe lack of irrigation water resources this region has the lowest wca and the highest ecv due to the annual drop in groundwater level considering this area belongs to china s main grain production area the development of high efficiency water saving agriculture and cross regional water transfer could be further adopted to ensure the irrigation water resources and avoid the excessive exploitation of groundwater resources at the same time 3 2 2 national scale the statistical data of various provinces were integrated to obtain national scale irrigation water energy ghg emissions data to ensure a stable food supply under continuous population growth china s effective irrigated area continued to grow steadily increasing from 56 0 million hm2 in 2005 to 66 1 million hm2 in 2015 in comparison to 2005 the growth rates in 2010 and 2015 were 7 4 and 18 0 respectively with the expansion of effective irrigation area irrigation water and energy consumption continued to rise with the rate of increase for irrigation water consumption increasing by 3 2 and 7 9 in 2010 and 2015 respectively and the rate of increase for irrigation energy consumption increasing by 8 2 and 22 3 to 57 0 and 64 4 billion kwh the trend of fluctuating ghg emissions is identical to fluctuating energy consumption in 2005 2010 and 2015 the equivalents of agricultural irrigation ghg emissions were 34 7 37 6 and 42 5 mt co2e respectively china s water consumption per unit area has decreased significantly due to the rapid development of water saving irrigation technology from 5703 1 m3 hm2 in 2005 to 5479 5 m3 hm2 in 2010 and 5216 3 m3 hm2 in 2015 the energy consumption per unit area for irrigation increased from 940 5 kwh hm2 in 2005 to 974 7 kwh hm2 in 2015 an increase of 3 6 the energy consumption per unit volume of water increased relatively rapidly between 2005 and 2015 from 0 165 kwh m3 to 0 187 kwh m3 fig 7 3 3 impact of water saving technology on irrigation energy consumption and ghg emission the country s effective irrigated area has increased from 56 0 million hm2 in 2005 to 66 1 million hm2 in 2015 with a growth rate of 18 0 and an annual compound annual growth rate of 1 67 table 4 the growth rates of the application area for water efficient irrigation technologies are significantly higher than those of the effective irrigation area the total area utilizing water saving irrigation technologies increased from 17 3 million hm2 to 32 1 million hm2 at an increased rate of 85 3 and an annual compound growth rate of 6 35 the proportion of water saving irrigation area to total effective irrigation area increased from 30 9 to 48 5 the area under drip irrigation has exploded from 0 60 million hm2 to 5 27 million hm2 with a growth rate and compound growth rate of 744 7 and 23 8 respectively the application of drip irrigation in cotton cultivation in xinjiang where the drip irrigation area increased from 0 38 million hm2 in 2005 to 3 12 million hm2 by the end of 2015 contributed to the rapid advancement of drip irrigation technology the drip irrigation area in xinjiang accounts for 59 3 of the total drip irrigation area in the country the application area of the other three water saving irrigation technologies is also growing rapidly channel lining is the most prevalent of the four types of water saving irrigation technologies the controlled irrigation area of channel lining reached 14 5 million hm2 in 2015 assuming that the annual growth rate of each water saving irrigation technology is consistent with the cagr of the effective irrigation area and using the 2005 application area of each water saving irrigation technology as the baseline fig 8 depicts the application area of each water saving irrigation technology in 2015 under the assumption scenario the difference between the actual and assumed application areas for each technology represents the incentive effect of the policy s guidance the graph demonstrates that the policy incentive significantly impacts the promotion and implementation of water saving irrigation technology compared to the assumed scenario the actual application area of sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation low pressure pipe irrigation and canal lining technology has increased by 19 8 619 2 48 3 and 34 7 respectively the application area of water saving irrigation technology a total of four technologies has expanded by 50 5 the national irrigation water consumption irrigation energy consumption and ghg emissions under the hypothetical scenario in 2015 reached 393 7 billion m3 68 8 billion kwh and 46 3 mt co2e respectively while the actual values of these indicators were lower than the hypothetical scenario reaching 49 0 billion m3 4 35 billion kwh and 3 82mt co2e see supplementary fig s1 for more details it demonstrates that the promotion and implementation of water saving irrigation technology have effectively decreased irrigation water energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions 4 discussion 4 1 comparison of southern and northern provinces the distribution of water resources in china is highly unequal with more water resources in the south and less in the north the distribution characteristics of irrigation water and irrigation energy consumption in china from north to south are analyzed further the northern regions of china excluding hong kong macao and taiwan include 16 provinces beijing tianjin hebei shanxi inner mongolia liaoning jilin heilongjiang shandong henan tibet shaanxi gansu qinghai ningxia and xinjiang southern china comprises fifteen provinces shanghai jiangsu zhejiang anhui fujian jiangxi hubei hunan guangdong guangxi hainan sichuan chongqing guizhou and yunnan according to our analysis the irrigated areas in both north and south china are growing annually but the growth rate and effective irrigated area in north china are greater as of 2015 the irrigated area in the north accounted for 56 44 of the whole in terms of irrigation water consumption north china and south china remain the same and the water consumption per unit area in the north is lower than that in the south using 2015 as an example the irrigation water per unit area in the south is 5994 2 m3 hm2 while in the north it is 4616 4 m3 hm2 fig 9 although precipitation in south china is significantly greater than in north china jin et al 2021 irrigation water per unit area in south china is still greater than in north china this may be since in the south of china crops typically mature twice or three times per year whereas in the north crops mature once per year or every two years furthermore more water intensive crops such as rice are cultivated in southern china regarding energy the irrigation energy consumption in northern and southern provinces accounted for 78 and 22 of the national irrigation energy consumption respectively energy consumption per unit area was approximately 1362 0 kwh hm2 and 473 1 kwh hm2 while energy consumption per unit volume was approximately 0 30 kwh m3 and 0 08 kwh m3 respectively the significant difference in irrigation energy consumption between the north and south directly results from the disparate distribution of water resources and population some provinces in the northwest of china are sparsely populated and there is always a substantial loss of water volume and water head during long distance water transfer in the northeast plain irrigation water relies more on groundwater extraction the groundwater level keeps dropping and irrigation energy consumption increases yearly qiu et al 2018 in contrast water and hydropower resources are relatively abundant in south china the cultivated land is close to the water source and the transmission energy loss is small moreover many provinces in the south are suitable for dam storage and developing hydropower resources to form gravity flow which can significantly reduce irrigation energy consumption agricultural irrigation in northern regions has a bigger energy consumption load than in southern china in the construction and design of irrigation systems the interaction between water and energy in the irrigation process must be considered holistically 4 2 comparison with other studies prior research has focused on regional irrigation energy consumption rodríguez et al 2011b qiu et al 2018 chen et al 2019 or focused on groundwater irrigation energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions shah 2009 griffiths sattenspiel and wilson 2009 wang et al 2012 cremades et al 2016 however few studies have been able to conduct quantitative studies on national irrigation energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions of all water sources including both underground water and surface water which limits the overall understanding of the composition of irrigation energy consumption and the proposal of corresponding irrigation energy consumption regulation strategies table 5 to validate the correctness of this work we compared the computation findings from this study to those from prior research in addition findings from this study can also provide more comprehensive data and more multidimensional analysis perspective so as to provide support for the proposal of irrigation energy consumption regulation strategies china has the second biggest irrigated area in the world yet surprisingly little is known about the nation s irrigation energy use wang et al 2012 and cremades et al 2016 studied the ghg emission equivalent of groundwater irrigation in china in 2005 and 2011 and the results were 33 1 and 22 4 mt co2e respectively in this study china s groundwater pumping irrigation ghg emissions grew annually from 2005 to 2015 ranging from 23 4 to 27 5 mt co2e the findings concur with cremades et al 2016 which are much lower than wang s in wang s study the necessary data for estimating the ghg emissions of 11 provinces were gathered using a questionnaire survey however the restricted number of samples in certain provinces may have reduced the results representativeness for example just three villages were examined in shandong province and historic agricultural cities such as heze and jining were excluded from the study according to wang s research groundwater pumping irrigation accounts for 93 of total irrigation water usage which is higher than the values reported in our study the annual water volume drawn from the yellow river in shandong is about 6 7 billion m3 accounting for one third of the province s water consumption in addition a specific volume of water is taken from the south to north water transfer project according to statistics from the national water census ground pumping water surface gravity flow water and surface pumping water are 43 4 33 0 and 23 4 respectively using these data the predicted ghg emissions from groundwater pumping irrigation are closer to the actual situation therefore the method proposed in this study can effectively reduce the deviation between the survey results and the actual value caused by limited survey samples the national irrigation ghg emission in 2011 obtained by cremades et al 2016 was 38 8 mt co2e this study ranges from 34 7 to 42 5 mt co2e increasing gradually from 2005 to 2015 it is consistent with the findings of cremades s work which also demonstrates the excellent computational precision of the approach utilized in this paper qiu et al 2018 studied the energy consumption of groundwater irrigation in the north china plain from 1993 to 2013 qiu s study obtained energy consumption per unit volume was 0 50 0 61kwh m3 according to this study groundwater irrigation s energy usage per unit volume on the north china plain was 0 55 0 57 kwh m3 chen et al 2019 calculated the energy consumption of groundwater irrigation in the north china plain at a more precise county scale the results indicate that during the winter wheat summer corn planting mode the north china plain s groundwater irrigation energy consumption per unit area is 1122 4 kwh hm2 according to this study this result is 1124 2 1179 2 kwh hm2 which also agrees with chen s research results the consistency of the results of these studies proves the reliability of the results of this study on this basis this study further obtains that the total energy consumption of groundwater irrigation in the north china plain is 104 4 106 7 billion kwh year and the ghg emission equivalent is about 6 88 7 03 mt co2e therefore it provides more complete data support from the time and space dimensions for the quantitative analysis and control strategy formulation of groundwater irrigation energy consumption and carbon emissions in the region nevertheless there are also some limitations in this study due to the limited data that can be obtained we are not able to perform higher accuracy energy consumption calculation for the time being for example due to the limited number of measured groundwater depth monitoring data in each province we took the average value of available monitoring data as the characteristic groundwater depth of each province without considering the fluctuation of groundwater level with time and regional changes with the further improvement of the statistical data network in the future more accurate calculation results can be obtained 5 conclusion based on the physical processes of irrigation energy consumption and ghg emission this study proposed a technique for predicting provincial and national levels of irrigation energy consumption and ghg emissions using limited statistical data the main conclusions are as follows 1 the net unit volume irrigation energy consumption is 0 1 34 kwh m3 and the gross unit volume irrigation energy consumption range is 0 3 82 kwh m3 priority should be given to constructing surface water gravity flow irrigation it is essential to consider the trade off between irrigation water utilization efficiency and energy consumption when designing the irrigation system s delivery techniques and distribution techniques 2 from 2005 2015 the effective irrigation area nationwide increased by 18 0 of which the water saving irrigation area increased rapidly with an increase of 85 3 the increase in irrigation water and irrigation energy consumption in 2015 compared with 2005 was 7 9 and 22 3 and the ghg emissions in irrigation were 42 5 mt co2e in 2015 the irrigation water use per unit area and energy consumption per unit area has decreased dramatically reaching 347 8 m3 and 974 7 kwh hm2 respectively rapidly advancing water saving irrigation technology may improve china s irrigation water energy ghg emission structure guarantee food production security enhance irrigation efficiency and regulate irrigation energy consumption within a tolerable range 3 the distribution of irrigation water energy greenhouse gas emission structure is not uniform and the structure is significantly different northern provinces face the dual pressure of rapid growth of water resources and energy consumption for irrigation the northern provinces supply 48 9 of the irrigation water and 56 4 of the irrigated area with 18 8 of the average water resources for many years providing 78 of the irrigation energy consumption the energy consumption per unit volume and the energy consumption for irrigation per unit area are 3 74 and 2 88 times that of the southern region thus it is necessary to continue actively promoting water saving irrigation techniques in the northern regions following local conditions declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to

8983,grey water footprint gwf is one component of water footprint wf it considers multiple pollutants and water quality regulations when determining the amount of freshwater required to assimilate the pollution load discharged by agricultural production into the receiving water body this indicator is typically estimated for accounting the wf of agricultural productions including paddy rice this study evaluates the gwf of irrigated paddy rice ipr through sampling multiple pollutants in both the inflow and drainage of a pilot area simultaneously it aims to find a realistic range for the gwf of ipr and emphasize the impacts of pollutants regulations c max and inflow q in variations for this purpose an isolated subsurface drained farm in northern iran was chosen as a pilot area where 32 samples from inflow and outflow were taken during the cultivation period 94 days here the concentrations of electro conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do chemical oxidation demand cod nitrate no3 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total phosphorous tp total nitrogen tn and butachlor herbicide as well as irrigation and drainage volume were investigated c max was examined through three regulation scenarios strict s1 normal s2 and lenient s3 in addition q in was measured by the methods of water balance and scd usda results show that tp was most critical in paddy rice gwf s1 s2 while do can be an alternative critical parameter in s3 based on calculations gwf was ultimately varied between 1109 and 8079 m3 ton in all scenarios it incorporated a significant share in wf as its ratio varied between 46 and 86 c max showed relatively higher impacts on gwf comparing with the precise calculation of q in moreover calculating the net pollution loads of multiple pollutants discharged from paddy field was recommended for higher accuracy as a result a range for gwf is introduced instead of an absolute value that can be updated by further case studies graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigated agriculture paddy rice multiple pollutants water footprint water quality management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction as a diffuse source agriculture generally discharges a considerable amount of pollution to the receiving water bodies and consequently has detrimental impacts on water quality dabrowski et al 2009 evans et al 2019 wang et al 2019 inadequate drainage management may increase the amounts of various contaminants in water resources biswas et al 2014 carpenter et al 1998 mateo sagasta et al 2018 high electro conductivity ec total nitrogen tn total phosphorous tp and the residues of pesticides are all common contaminants found in farmland drainage chaudhry and malik 2017 evans et al 2019 studies demonstrate that farmlands are the primary source of tn mateo sagasta et al 2018 and tp 75 90 in water bodies tiessen 2008 for instance irrigated rice fields are a source of nitrogen fertilizer emissions into water bodies zhao et al 2012 arrien et al 2021 among agricultural crops paddy fields consume a large amount of water and directly pollutes the water bodies eighty million hectares of paddy fields globally provide around 75 of total rice production they consume between 34 and 43 of the world s total irrigation water or between 24 and 30 of its freshwater bouman et al 2007 according to a study conducted by fu et al 2018 in china groundwater and surface runoff received 48 and 11 8 of the total irrigation water consumed in paddy fields respectively they also claimed that 10 8 and 6 4 of tp fertilizer used in paddy fields was discharged into groundwater and surface runoff respectively similarly these percentages were 13 1 and 4 1 respectively for tn fertilizer fu et al 2019 according to a survey conducted in northern iran between 23 and 30 of the applied tn as fertilizer to paddy fields leached into groundwater while just 0 1 1 of applied tn entered surface waters darzi naftchali et al 2017 pesticides also contribute to pollution in paddy fields lamers et al 2011 pesticides easily enter water bodies due to the flooding state in paddy fields capri 2008 butachlor is a common pesticide used in rice fields in asia africa and south america to eradicate annual weeds and broadleaves before they germinate ok et al 2012 pohanish 2014 wang et al 2013 this herbicide may harm aquatic ecosystems wildlife and human life in water supplies chang et al 2013 christopher et al 2013 dwivedi et al 2012 epa us 2020 the average butachlor concentration in the babol roud river in northern iran bordered by paddy fields reported 299 6 and 413 2 μg l in 2018 and 2019 jolodar et al 2021 these pollutants can reduce the sustainability of agricultural production and may inhibit further regional development certain indicators have been defined to aid the assessment of the sustainability of agri food productions and decision making water footprint wf is an indicator that considers both water and environmental concepts dalin et al 2017 hoekstra et al 2011 this indicator is the total embedded volume of freshwater consumed or contaminated directly and indirectly in the production process it is composed of three major components blue water footprint bwf green water footprint grwf and grey water footprint gwf for agricultural productions bwf refers to the volume of surface or groundwater used for irrigation in agricultural production while grwf accounts the total amount of water from precipitation that is stored in the root zone of the soil and evaporated transpired or incorporated by plants during cultivation chapagain and hoekstra 2010 hoekstra et al 2011 gwf is defined as the freshwater volume required for pollution load assimilation to meet specific water quality standards it is calculated based on the difference between the natural background concentration of the pollutants in receiving water bodies and the existing ambient water quality standards franke et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 it means that gwf is the environmental indicator within wf that calculates the impacts of agricultural productions on water quality various studies have been recently conducted to account for the gwf of different agricultural productions castellanos et al 2016 liu et al 2017 vale et al 2019 however these researches were mainly based on approximate leaching runoff released fertilizer fraction with maximum and minimum concentrations and only included limited pollutants muratoglu 2020 several approaches with different accuracy were applied for the paddy rice gwf calculation for example at the approximate levels a leaching runoff fraction α was used to simplify the estimations of agricultural chemicals discharged to water resources franke et al 2013 in some researches only nitrogen fertilizer with different α was considered as a pollution factor bulsink et al 2010 kashyap and agarwal 2021 li et al 2018 li et al 2020 while in some other studies only nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer were considered as pollution resources in paddy fields mullick and das 2021 yoo et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016 the maximum allowable c max and natural background c nat concentrations of pollutants can also play a significant role in determining gwf franke et al 2013 for example in a study by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 the gwf of rice paddies was calculated 187 m3 ton with α about 10 nitrogen c nat equals zero and c max of 10 mg l nitrates mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 in another study by zhuo et al 2016 although α and production yield were close to mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 c max and c nat differed considerably here rice paddy gwf was reported 5164 m3 ton zhuo et al 2016 this difference implies that gwf accounting is very reliant on assumptions another deficiency in accounting paddy s gwf originates from samplings or assumptions based on only the outflow without considering the inflow pollution loads at the upstream moreover using limited water quality parameters like tn and tp for gwf calculation may increase its inefficiency as gwf is a multiple pollutant indicator wu et al 2021a 2021b xinchun et al 2018 all these assumptions and deficiencies may increase the uncertainty of gwf and reduce its role in wf assessments reducing this uncertainty is possible by considering multiple pollutants and experimental field studies the main purpose of this study is to use an experimental method to calculate the gwf of irrigated paddy rice ipr by multi pollutant and evaluate its possible range through different parameters this research calculates gwf based on data derived from the samplings implemented in both the inflow and drainage of a farm as the pilot area the results are then discussed in 5 uncertainty scenarios 3 for c max and 2 for effective precipitation methods and compared with recent literature and global data this approach provides a range for ipr gwf instead of an exact value and comparatively highlights the effectiveness of these parameters in gwf accounting with global perspective it is noteworthy that the pilot is located in iran where nearly 4 5 million tons of paddy rice were produced in 2019 ranked 21st among all producers around the world faostat 2021 iran ministry of agriculture 2020 2 materials and method gwf accounting is typically relied on the outflow pollution load based on limited water quality parameters wu et al 2021a 2021b xinchun et al 2018 this method seems inappropriate for ipr in areas where irrigation water is mixed with the municipal industrial or agricultural wastewater upstream by neglecting the inflow pollution the gwf would be overestimated or underestimated as a result the methodology of this research is based on simultaneous examinations of multiple pollutants in both the inflow and outflow of a pilot area under controlled condition based on these data the effectiveness of different parameters such as pollutants water quality criteria and inflow variations are evaluated in different scenarios to find a gwf range for irp pilot characteristics and agricultural practices are explained in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively sampling and gwf calculation methods are explained in sections 2 3 and 2 4 respectively the calculation methods of parameters as inflow and outflow section 2 5 precipitation section 2 6 c max section 2 7 and c nat section 2 8 are also explained eventually wf is calculated for ipr and the results are compared and discussed with previous studies the main novelties that stands out this research with previous studies are as follows using pilot study under controlled condition for gwf accounting considering do in association with other 7 pollutants for gwf assessment comparing the impacts of 3 water quality levels and 2 inflow measurement methods on the gwf calculating the gwf based on the net pollution discharged from paddy field by excluding inflow pollution loads and pollutants abated in the paddy fields it is noteworthy that the methodological scope of this research is limited to a pilot study however the outcomes reveal critical understandings about the gwf these findings are even fully discussed and compared with recent literature in global scale 2 1 study area and pilot characteristics in order to evaluate the gwf of irp 0 6 ha 75 80 m of a renovated paddy field was chosen as the pilot field the pilot field is located in the rice research institute guilan province northern iran at 49 38 24 longitude and 37 12 0 latitudes fig 1 this province has a moderate climate where about 2300 km2 paddy fields annually produce more than one million tons of paddy rice with average irrigation efficiency of 62 iran ministry of agriculture 2020 parsinejad et al 2009 here there are conventional canals for irrigation beside almost every paddy field which has a hydraulic gradient from the field to the canals this condition was similarly followed in the pilot equipped with subsurface free drainage pipes dps dps were constructed horizontally across the land with 40 m long and 100 cm depth from the soil s surface they were made of corrugated pvc with openings having 125 mm diameter for drainage alizadeh et al 2016 according to the united states department of agriculture usda soil classification system the predominant soil type in the studied area is silty clay mousavi et al 2011 shakouri et al 2011 moreover the annual average precipitation was 1136 mm with the record of about 181 mm for the four month cultivation period the details of average monthly temperature 2005 2020 based on the nearest meteorological station is shown in fig 1 in order to eliminate possible experimental errors the pilot area were located with limited interface with surrounding paddy fields the surroundings were not planted during the study period as well as the pilot was isolated by thick plastic to remove unintentional sub surface flows therefore dps were the only effluent of pilot area in addition the paddy rice was cultivated once a year from march to august when precipitation and also groundwater level are at the lowest these practices may make some differences between the operation of the pilot and real paddy fields but they can considerably reduce interferences for more accurate gwf accounting for controlling the groundwater level in the study area and the interference with dps the data of 8 observation wells around the study area 2003 2020 were used wrmi 2021 fig 2 confirms that the groundwater level is below dps depth before and during the cultivation period 2 2 agricultural practices after plowing in late april studies initiated on 12th may 2020 with manual planting of rice plant oryza sativa the common cultivar of the region hashemi from the nursery to the paddy field usually the age of seedlings is 20 25 days and up to 30 days in some cases paddy fields in the study area are cultivated once a year during warm seasons and irrigated by the irrigation network of the sefidroud dam in the study area all agricultural operations including irrigation time and fertilizer application were carried out following the custom of local farmers after ensuring the required water depth in the field 60 and 30 kg ha of urea fertilizer were respectively applied on 20th may 9th day and 5th june 24th day when 60 and 20 kg ha of triple superphosphate were also added in addition on 19th may 3 liter ha of 60 butachlor emulsion herbicide was applied to the field as highlighted by spraying in fig 2 this figure shows the growth stages of the rice plant and their duration on 28th august after 109 days crops were harvested and weighed at the site 2 3 sampling and experimental tests in this study dissolved oxygen do ec ph and temperature were measured in situ using the portable multi parameter device table 1 for other parameters sampling was done every three days twice a week by 1 liter polyethylene or stained glass containers from both the pilot area s inflow channel and subsurface dp s outflow and immediately transferred to the laboratory the stars in fig 1 denote the sampling locations 64 samples were totally taken from two points each point 32 samples chemical oxidation demand cod nitrate no3 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn n tp were tested according to standard methods apha 2017 in iran non chemical methods are not popular to control weeds here butachlor is the primary and common herbicide used in paddy fields noorhosseini et al 2012 therefore butachlor concentrations were measured daily until five days after spraying us epa 2007 the methods and types of equipment used for the tests are mentioned in table 1 it should be noted that the aggregate concentration of tkn and nitrate was reported as tn since there were no significant nitrite levels to detect 2 4 gwf calculation gwf of each pollutant i m3 ton is accounted individually by eq 1 as recommended by hoekstra et al 2011 and their maximum value is determined as the gwf of paddy rice eq 2 franke et al 2013 hoekstra et al 2011 1 gwf i l i y c max c nat i 2 gwf max gwf i in these equations δl is the difference between the outflow and inflow pollution i loads gr yr calculated by eq 3 δl 0 c max is the maximum allowable concentration of contaminants mg l or µg l c nat is the natural background concentration of pollutants mg l or µg l y is the annual production yield of pilot paddy rice ton yr in the pilot area after harvesting in this study the total paddy rice harvested after the study period weighed about 2 42 tons 4 03 ton ha c max and c nat are explained in sections 2 4 and 2 5 3 l l out l in here l out refers to the discharged pollution load from the pilot area gr yr while l in gr yr is the entering pollution load via irrigation into the paddy field both parameters are calculated by eq 4 4 l in out q in c in out in this equation c out and c in are the average concentration of pollutants mg l µg l in the outflow and inflow respectively it is noteworthy that the concentration of butachlor on the fourth day after application became less than 5 µg l as its half life in the paddy field water column is less than 2 5 days kangning et al 1993 ok et al 2012 thus the c out of butachlor is based on its average in 4 days the measurement of q in is explained in section 2 5 it should be noted that gwf do is calculated differently via eq 5 based on jamshidi 2019 this equation is based on the fact that carbonaceous organic compounds and nitrogenous compounds are responsible for increasing the oxygen demand in water carbonaceous oxygen demand is estimated by cod while nitrogenous oxygen demand is approximated via tkn chapra 2008 hence the aggregate of the net pollution loads δl of cod and tkn can estimate the total oxidation demand in water as similarly discussed for the gwf accounting of fish production jamshidi 2019 the assimilation factor of do is also different it should be the difference between do saturation level in the main river of the region c sat and its minimum allowable standard limit in freshwater c min jamshidi 2019 here c sat is 9 75 mg l on average in the study area jamshidi et al 2015 and c min is determined as noted in table 2 5 gwf do l cod l tkn c sat c min y 2 5 inflow and outflow measurement q in refers to the net inflow of the pilot area as annual water volume m3 used for cultivation which is calculated by eq 6 in two scenarios u and b as explained in section 2 6 6 q in u b q irr 1 t 10 a p eff u b t 1 t 10 a et t 7 q irr 1 t 0 00370 d 2 646 10 3 86400 t here t is the cultivation study period equals 94 days q irr is the total volume of daily irrigation water measured during the cultivation period t by washington state college wsc trapezoidal flume type ii chamberlain 1952 as eq 7 m3 in which 0 001 and 86 400 convert lit s to m3 d d refers to the measured water depth cm in the flume in eq 7 by this equation q irr was totally measured 4290 m3 for the study period 94 days p eff is effective precipitation in the pilot in cultivation period mm measured by two methods u and b explained in section 2 6 et represents actual evapotranspiration from the plant and soil surface mm measured by a mini lysimeter with 60 cm diameter installed near the pilot area 10 converts mm to m3 ha and a is the pilot area equals 0 6 ha according to the daily et data gathered during the study period t shown in fig 3 the total et was measured 3089 m3 the water balance components are schematically illustrated in fig 4 q out is the aggregate of dps outflow measured daily during the cultivation period since paddy rice is cultivated once a year in this area q out equals the overall annual water volume m3 discharged from the paddy field in this study the average q out was measured 12 4 m3 d fig 5 which equals 1479 2 m3 in 94 days t it should be added that q out was measured 94 4 m3 during the four days of butachlor introduction 2 6 effective precipitation peff p eff is effective precipitation mm in a pilot cultivation period this parameter is determined by two methods of water balance p eff b and scs usda p eff u separately according to the eq 8 mohan et al 1996 and 9 zheng et al 2020 respectively this parameter is estimated by two methods as two scenarios u and b in order to discuss the effectiveness of these estimation methods on gwf and compare their impacts with other uncertainty scenarios 8 p eff b q out et perc s q irr in eq 8 perc denotes the period s percolation losses as the average percolation pilot location was 0 65 millimeters per day in all pilot area δs denotes the difference

runoff could not be created in the pilot area q out q irr and et were described earlier in section 2 5 by these assumptions p eff b was measured 333 m3 during the cultivation period therefore q in b was calculated 1534 5 m3 16 3 m3 day on average by eq 6 9 p e f f u p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 p 8 3 4 17 0 1 p p 8 3 in eq 9 p is the total daily precipitation mm derived from a meteorological station with 300 m distance from the pilot area this equation is used in scs usda method developed by the u s department of agriculture döll and siebert 2002 which is similarly used for rice wf evaluation in recent researches zheng et al 2020 according to the daily p eff u data gathered during the study period t shown in fig 3 the overall p eff u was measured 278 m3 with 16 difference with p eff b therefore q in u was calculated 1479 2 m3 15 7 m3 day on average by eq 6 accordingly q in u and q in b has only 3 6 difference it should be added that q in u was measured 62 94 m3 during the four days of butachlor introduction 2 7 maximum allowable concentration cmax since the gwf is used globally this study recommends that c max is assumed based on multiple standards instead of an absolute criteria in this study several criteria have been used to determine c max table 2 water quality standards from different parts of the world were used in three scenarios of strict s1 normal s2 and lenient s3 which were also used in this research these three scenarios with different c max in association with the two aforementioned scenarios of q in section 2 6 form the total 6 scenarios of uncertainty in accounting the gwf of ipr in this study 2 8 natural concentration c nat for calculating c nat the sefidroud river was selected as the primary receiver of pollution loads discharged by paddy fields jamshidi et al 2015 here the available water quality data in two stations upstream manjil and downstream kiashahr were gathered using the global environment monitoring system for freshwater gems united nations 2017b monthly average trends of both stations specific selected parameters concentrations are shown from 1980 to 1983 the oldest data available in fig 6 and their average is assumed as c nat as table 3 it is important to note that the population has doubled since 1980 as a result residential industrial and agricultural activity have increased significantly during the last four decades pilehvar 2021 worldometer 2020 therefore the assumed c nat can represent reliable data in a period with minimum human interferences 2 9 wf calculation bwf and grwf were calculated m3 ton by eqs 10 and 11 respectively while the overall wf was calculated by eq 12 hoekstra et al 2011 10 bwf 10 t 1 n max 0 et p eff y 11 grwf 10 t 1 n min et p eff y 12 wf bwf grwf gwf here bwf grwf and gwf are the blue green and grey water footprints m3 ton respectively n is the number of days 94 and other parameters are defined earlier 3 results 3 1 pollution load the average concentrations of pollutants were determined for both the inflow and outflow as summarized in table 4 results show that the concentrations of cod ec tkn and tp were increased in the pilot outflow while nitrate and tn concentrations were decreased for example nitrate concentration was reduced from an average of 4 77 mg l in inflow to 1 13 mg l in outflow the reduction of nitrate can be due to its uptake by the plantations and partial denitrification in the ponds while other parameters were increased mainly due to fertilizer application limited do in paddy fields inhibits nitrification and conversely facilitates denitrification process chapra 2008 this fact can lead to the dominance of tkn over nitrate concentration during cultivation as a result and according to eq 4 based on q in u δl becomes negative for nitrate and tn thus these pollutants cannot be directly effective on gwf as δl 0 the comparative statistical analysis by minitab 19 also verified that the variations of parameters from inflow to outflow were significant with a 95 confidence interval fig 7 these results imply that the current agricultural practices for rice production can affect the water quality of outflow however all of the pollutants are not necessarily effective on gwf the pollution load of some pollutants may be reduced in paddy field therefore no3 and tn were excluded from gwf accounting in this research this point should be considered as a filtering step prior to multiple pollutant gwf accounting it means that the gwf of productions should only be calculated based on pollutants that their pollution loads are increased through the production process in the paddy field δl 0 3 2 gwf calculation multiple pollutant gwf was calculated by eq 1 and via the values of table 2 c max table 3 c nat and table 4 δl different standardization scenarios s1 s2 s3 in addition to the scenarios of q in q in u q in b were included for comprehensive uncertainty analysis as shown in fig 8 based on the results in q in u fig 8 the gwf of paddy rice is 7788 3126 and 1109 m3 ton in s1 s2 and s3 respectively it means that water quality criteria c max has a significant impact on gwf variations in addition the determinant pollutant can be changed in different standardization scenarios for example tp is critical in s1 7788 m3 ton and s2 3126 m3 ton while do deficiency becomes critical in s3 1109 m3 ton provided that precipitation estimation method is set by water balance q in b the gwf would be changed in all scenarios fig 7 the gwf of paddy rice in this scenario is 8080 3243 and 1150 m3 ton in s1 s2 and s3 respectively these values are comparatively 4 more than q in u all these evaluations indicate that gwf accounting based on 1 multiple pollutants 2 concrete samplings in the inflow and outflow and 3 different water quality standards may present a more precise and comprehensive value this study also estimates the bwf and grwf by eqs 10 and 11 in all of the scenarios fig 9 these indicators are calculated 1171 and 115 m3 ton for ipr by q in u accordingly the overall wf is 9074 4412 and 2395 m3 ton via eq 12 in s1 s2 and s3 respectively based on these values the proportion of gwf to wf equals 86 71 and 46 in s1 s2 and s3 respectively it implies that gwf even with lenient water quality standards s3 incorporates a considerable share in the wf of ipr which cannot be ignored provided that the inflow measurement uncertainties are considered in gwf accounting wf would range 9074 9366 m3 ton s1 4412 4530 m3 ton s2 and 2395 2437 m3 ton s3 accordingly the ratios of gwf to wf range between 85 86 s1 71 72 s2 and 46 47 s3 similarly bwf and grwf estimations were obtained by q in b and compared with q in u fig 9 in this scenario bwf and grwf are calculated 1148 and 139 for ipr by water balance method q in b bwf reduces about 4 while grwf increases 16 nevertheless these changes could not have significant impact on the gwf and its ratio to wf it can be concluded that among two parameters of 1 different c max s1 s3 and 2 q in variations by two p eff methods the former is relatively more effective on the gwf the effectiveness of c max increases gwf up to 7 times from s1 to s3 while q in estimation by two methods of p eff with 16 differences changes gwf only about 4 in all scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 agricultural practices in gwf in two scenarios in the current study s1 and s2 tp has been determined as a critical pollutant in gwf accounting however in another similar study in paddy field nitrogen was introduced as the determinant pollutant of gwf xinchun et al 2018 it can be due to the fact that agricultural practices like fertilizer types are effective on the critical pollutants and consequently the gwf of products in addition the soil and paddy field specifications may affect pollution leachate peng et al 2011 therefore agricultural specifications and practices are effective on gwf it should also be noted that precipitation in the research area during the cultivation period is relatively lower than comparable field studies as the cultivation period is carried out in dry season in addition paddy field is irrigated not rain fed in which grwf is relatively lower than bwf therefore the ratio of gwf to wf can relatively increase in comparison with other studies wu et al 2021 xinchun et al 2018 however this approach in pilot scale requires further case studies to support the global or regional assessment of gwf and wf discussing about the spatial variation of these indicators virtual water trading or the wf of crops regionally muratoglu and avanoz 2021 are basically founded on the results of these pilot or case studies 4 2 pilot study specification and limitation this study was carried out in a pilot in rice research institute rci isolated with controlled drainage system farming stages and seeds were identical to the normal pattern of the area in larger scale paddy fields are naturally surrounded by other fields farms gardens rural or even industrial activities without isolation and monitoring systems all these surroundings in addition to sedimentation soil texture and plantations in riparian zone can more or less affect groundwater and surface water quality therefore the exact gwf evaluation of paddy rice in larger scales requires considerable cost and practice for isolation sampling with repetition in different periods for tracking possible interactions of effective parameters this study focused on the inflow and outflow of pilot for eliminating the most aforementioned disturbances for gwf nevertheless samples were also taken weekly by rci in the same period march august 2020 from the existing conventional surface drainage system canals these canals transfer surface water upstream to 86 hec of paddy fields 143 folds more that pilot area and drain the effluents downstream without any isolation or control over the discharges here water quality are affected by rurals side streams water uptakes and natural assimilation by plantations or sedimentation in these trenches fig 10 illustrates that the concentrations of nutrients n and p were decreased on average it should be added that cod concentration reduced from 41 to 37 mg l while ec increased from 1276 to 1327 µs cm in general the reducing trend of water quality from inflow to outflow shows that the dilution effects of side streams nutrient uptake by plantations leachacte water uptake for irrigation sedimentation etc can affect the final gwf assessment it implies that regional estimation without elaborate experimentation may underestimate the gwf of paddy rice in larger scale due to the partial assimilation of pollution out of the main fields 4 3 importance of inflow pollution another influential factor in gwf accounting is the actual regional conditions prevailing in the paddy fields for example in northern iran the density of paddy fields is relatively high according to the cultivation calendar herbicide and fertilizers may be applied simultaneously in a short period it may have adverse impacts on the downstream irrigation water quality aghabeigi et al 2018 therefore paddy rice gwf accounting exclusively based on the outflow pollution load may overestimate the related environmental impacts as it neglects the upstream inflow pollution load on the condition that the inflow pollution load is neglected in the current study as in other studies the gwf of paddy rice may increase to 11 043 4432 and 1676 m3 ton in s1 s2 and s3 respectively qin u these values are 42 51 more than measured gwf considering base on inflow and outflow simultaneously consequently it is recommended that for more accurate calculation both inflow and outflow average pollution loads should be included in gwf accounting particularly for paddy rice it is also recommended that gwf should be calculated only based on pollutants that their pollution loads not the concentration or amount of pollutants are increased from the inflow to outflow otherwise paddy field should not be charged for pollution 4 4 main effective factors based on the results of recent researches a wide range of gwf was accounted for paddy rice between 48 and 5184 m3 ton summarized in table 5 as previously discussed this diversity is originated from agricultural practices field specifications and also the assumptions of c max and c nat for example the c max of nitrogen was considered as 10 mgno3 n l mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 40 mgtn l yoo et al 2014 10 mgtn l bulsink et al 2010 li et al 2018 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 1 mgtn l zhuo et al 2016 50 mgno3 l chapagain and hoekstra 2010 and 2 mgtn l xinchun et al 2018 the c max of phosphorus was also determined as 4 mgtp l yoo et al 2014 0 2 mgtp l zhuo et al 2016 and 0 4 mgtp l xinchun et al 2018 on the contrary c nat was mostly considered as zero for n and p bulsink et al 2010 mullick and das 2021 yoo et al 2014 however these c nat are not realistic particularly for tn as nutrients are naturally transferred in water via plants and algae without human interferences some research recommends using the minimum level mentioned in water quality standards for c nat zhuo et al 2016 the current study recommends 1 to consider at least three scenarios for c max and 2 to refer to the earliest existing water quality data of the main receiving water bodies to provide a more realistic c nat otherwise the values of gwf might be underestimated the results of gwf in the three scenarios of water quality standards shows that gwf can be increased to 2 8 s3 s2 or more than 7 s3 s1 folds in different cmax this variation in gwf is more significant than the impacts of q out variations and p eff estimations the uncertainty analysis in qu shows that using scs usda for p eff calculation may only increase gwf about 1 2 fold in comparison with the water balance method it means that c max has a relatively leading role on gwf in comparison with the calculating variations of inflow 4 5 multi pollutant many researches calculated gwf based on a single pollutant the current study showed that paddy fields might discharge different pollutants ec tkn cod herbicide and also do deficiency can be effective pollutants that may be ignored using multiple pollutant gwf can increase the comprehensiveness of this environmental indicator jamshidi 2021 in addition according to a recent development in accounting gwf jamshidi 2019 this indicator may be calculated more than 1150 8079 m3 ton in the current study area do deficiency eutrophication and elevated levels of micropollutants are some of the downstream research area s ecological concerns based on the developed methodology jamshidi 2019 these ecological challenges should be inserted in the form of an increasing factor in gwf to indicate the current ecological status of regions where productions are produced this can be studied in further researches by comparing these results with other researches in table 5 it can be concluded that typical leaching runoff fractions α for tn and tp losses may lead into a realistic gwf unless c max is underestimated zhuo et al 2016 or overestimated bulsink et al 2010 chapagain and hoekstra 2010 yoo et al 2014 5 conclusion this research mainly examined the effectiveness of different parameters as uncertainties in gwf calculation and calculated a realistic range for the gwf of this crop based on concrete pilot study according to the results and discussions the main conclusions are by comparing the effectiveness of strict s1 normal s2 and lenient s3 scenarios with inflow evaluations methods based on water balance qin b and scs usda qin u on the gwf c max was more effective on gwf rather than 4 variations of q in it implied that using proper c max may have considerable impacts comparing with the precise calculation of drained water volume or precipitation on land the gwf calculation of ipr only based on the outflow pollution without subtracting the inflow pollution would dramatically overestimate this indicator and must be avoided particularly where inflow has considerable pollution in addition critical pollutants are more accurate in this approach some pollutants like nitrate and tn in this study may be reduced not increased in cultivation from inflow to outflow this reduction must be considered in multi pollutant gwf accounting by excluding reduced pollutants tp is the critical pollutant determined in the most of scenarios it is due to the specific agricultural practices and water quality limitations nevertheless in some scenarios do was become critical it means that multi pollutant evaluation combined with uncertainty analysis can increase calculation accuracy and broaden the range of gwf through the applied methodology gwf would incorporate a significant share in the wf of ipr the comparative analysis with recent researches verified that the current methodology presented a moderate gwf m3 ton in s3 it implied that field based examinations on both the inflow and outflow with lenient water quality limitations was rather identical with global data therefore in other scenarios s1 and s2 gwf would be increased significantly due to inevitable uncertainties the current approach that defined a range for the gwf in different scenarios was recommended instead of using estimations for absolute gwf calculation it can also be updated in further studies by considering the environmental impairment background of the receiving water body declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

8983,grey water footprint gwf is one component of water footprint wf it considers multiple pollutants and water quality regulations when determining the amount of freshwater required to assimilate the pollution load discharged by agricultural production into the receiving water body this indicator is typically estimated for accounting the wf of agricultural productions including paddy rice this study evaluates the gwf of irrigated paddy rice ipr through sampling multiple pollutants in both the inflow and drainage of a pilot area simultaneously it aims to find a realistic range for the gwf of ipr and emphasize the impacts of pollutants regulations c max and inflow q in variations for this purpose an isolated subsurface drained farm in northern iran was chosen as a pilot area where 32 samples from inflow and outflow were taken during the cultivation period 94 days here the concentrations of electro conductivity ec dissolved oxygen do chemical oxidation demand cod nitrate no3 total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total phosphorous tp total nitrogen tn and butachlor herbicide as well as irrigation and drainage volume were investigated c max was examined through three regulation scenarios strict s1 normal s2 and lenient s3 in addition q in was measured by the methods of water balance and scd usda results show that tp was most critical in paddy rice gwf s1 s2 while do can be an alternative critical parameter in s3 based on calculations gwf was ultimately varied between 1109 and 8079 m3 ton in all scenarios it incorporated a significant share in wf as its ratio varied between 46 and 86 c max showed relatively higher impacts on gwf comparing with the precise calculation of q in moreover calculating the net pollution loads of multiple pollutants discharged from paddy field was recommended for higher accuracy as a result a range for gwf is introduced instead of an absolute value that can be updated by further case studies graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigated

fields reported 299 6 and 413 2 μg l in 2018 and 2019 jolodar et al 2021 these pollutants can reduce the sustainability of agricultural production and may inhibit further regional development certain indicators have been defined to aid the assessment of the sustainability of agri food productions and decision making water footprint wf is an indicator that considers both water and environmental concepts dalin et al 2017 hoekstra et al 2011 this indicator is the total embedded volume of freshwater consumed or contaminated directly and indirectly in the production process it is composed of three major components blue water footprint bwf green water footprint grwf and grey water footprint gwf for agricultural productions bwf refers to the volume of surface or groundwater used for irrigation in agricultural production while grwf accounts the total amount of water from precipitation that is stored in the root zone of the soil and evaporated transpired or incorporated by plants during cultivation chapagain and hoekstra 2010 hoekstra et al 2011 gwf is defined as the freshwater volume required for pollution load assimilation to meet specific water quality standards it is calculated based on the difference between the natural background concentration of the pollutants in receiving water bodies and the existing ambient water quality standards franke et al 2013 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 it means that gwf is the environmental indicator within wf that calculates the impacts of agricultural productions on water quality various studies have been recently conducted to account for the gwf of different agricultural productions castellanos et al 2016 liu et al 2017 vale et al 2019 however these researches were mainly based on approximate leaching runoff released fertilizer fraction with maximum and minimum concentrations and only included limited pollutants muratoglu 2020 several approaches with different accuracy were applied for the paddy rice gwf calculation for example at the approximate levels a leaching runoff fraction α was used to simplify the estimations of agricultural chemicals discharged to water resources franke et al 2013 in some researches only nitrogen fertilizer with different α was considered as a pollution factor bulsink et al 2010 kashyap and agarwal 2021 li et al 2018 li et al 2020 while in some other studies only nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer were considered as pollution resources in paddy fields mullick and das 2021 yoo et al 2014 zhuo et al 2016 the maximum allowable c max and natural background c nat concentrations of pollutants can also play a significant role in determining gwf franke et al 2013 for example in a study by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 the gwf of rice paddies was calculated 187 m3 ton with α about 10 nitrogen c nat equals zero and c max of 10 mg l nitrates mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 in another study by zhuo et al 2016 although α and production yield were close to mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 c max and c nat differed considerably here rice paddy gwf was reported 5164 m3 ton zhuo et al 2016 this difference implies that gwf accounting is very reliant on assumptions another deficiency in accounting paddy s gwf originates from samplings or assumptions based on only the outflow without considering the inflow pollution loads at the upstream moreover using limited water quality parameters like tn and tp for gwf calculation may increase its inefficiency as gwf is a multiple pollutant indicator wu et al 2021a 2021b xinchun et al 2018 all these assumptions and deficiencies may increase the uncertainty of gwf and reduce its role in wf assessments reducing this uncertainty is possible by considering multiple pollutants and experimental field studies the main purpose of this study is to use an experimental method to calculate the gwf of irrigated paddy rice ipr by multi pollutant and evaluate its possible range through different parameters this research calculates gwf based on data derived from the samplings implemented in both the inflow and drainage of a farm as the pilot area the results are then discussed in 5 uncertainty scenarios 3 for c max and 2 for effective precipitation methods and compared with recent literature and global data this approach provides a range for ipr gwf instead of an exact value and comparatively highlights the effectiveness of these parameters in gwf accounting with global perspective it is noteworthy that the pilot is located in iran where nearly 4 5 million tons of paddy rice were produced in 2019 ranked 21st among all producers around the world faostat 2021 iran ministry of agriculture 2020 2 materials and method gwf accounting is typically relied on the outflow pollution load based on limited water quality parameters wu et al 2021a 2021b xinchun et al 2018 this method seems inappropriate for ipr in areas where irrigation water is mixed with the municipal industrial or agricultural wastewater upstream by neglecting the inflow pollution the gwf would be overestimated or underestimated as a result the methodology of this research is based on simultaneous examinations of multiple pollutants in both the inflow and outflow of a pilot area under controlled condition based on these data the effectiveness of different parameters such as pollutants water quality criteria and inflow variations are evaluated in different scenarios to find a gwf range for irp pilot characteristics and agricultural practices are explained in sections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively sampling and gwf calculation methods are explained in sections 2 3 and 2 4 respectively the calculation methods of parameters as inflow and outflow section 2 5 precipitation section 2 6 c max section 2 7 and c nat section 2 8 are also explained eventually wf is calculated for ipr and the results are compared and discussed with previous studies the main novelties that stands out this research with previous studies are as follows using pilot study under controlled condition for gwf accounting considering do in association with other 7 pollutants for gwf assessment comparing the impacts of 3 water quality levels and 2 inflow measurement methods on the gwf calculating the gwf based on the net pollution discharged from paddy field by excluding inflow pollution loads and pollutants abated in the paddy fields it is noteworthy that the methodological scope of this research is limited to a pilot study however the outcomes reveal critical understandings about the gwf these findings are even fully discussed and compared with recent literature in global scale 2 1 study area and pilot characteristics in order to evaluate the gwf of irp 0 6 ha 75 80 m of a renovated paddy field was chosen as the pilot field the pilot field is located in the rice research institute guilan province northern iran at 49 38 24 longitude and 37 12 0 latitudes fig 1 this province has a moderate climate where about 2300 km2 paddy fields annually produce more than one million tons of paddy rice with average irrigation efficiency of 62 iran ministry of agriculture 2020 parsinejad et al 2009 here there are conventional canals for irrigation beside almost every paddy field which has a hydraulic gradient from the field to the canals this condition was similarly followed in the pilot equipped with subsurface free drainage pipes dps dps were constructed horizontally across the land with 40 m long and 100 cm depth from the soil s surface they were made of corrugated pvc with openings having 125 mm diameter for drainage alizadeh et al 2016 according to the united states department of agriculture usda soil classification system the predominant soil type in the studied area is silty clay mousavi et al 2011 shakouri et al 2011 moreover the annual average precipitation was 1136 mm with the record of about 181 mm for the four month cultivation period the details of average monthly temperature 2005 2020 based on the nearest meteorological station is shown in fig 1 in order to eliminate possible experimental errors the pilot area were located with limited interface with surrounding paddy fields the surroundings were not planted during the study period as well as the pilot was isolated by thick plastic to remove unintentional sub surface flows therefore dps were the only effluent of pilot area in addition the paddy rice was cultivated once a year from march to august when precipitation and also groundwater level are at the lowest these practices may make some differences between the operation of the pilot and real paddy fields but they can considerably reduce interferences for more accurate gwf accounting for controlling the groundwater level in the study area and the interference with dps the data of 8 observation wells around the study area 2003 2020 were used wrmi 2021 fig 2 confirms that the groundwater level is below dps depth before and during the cultivation period 2 2 agricultural practices after plowing in late april studies initiated on 12th may 2020 with manual planting of rice plant oryza sativa the common cultivar of the region hashemi from the nursery to the paddy field usually the age of seedlings is 20 25 days and up to 30 days in some cases paddy fields in the study area are cultivated once a year during warm seasons and irrigated by the irrigation network of the sefidroud dam in the study area all agricultural operations including irrigation time and fertilizer application were carried out following the custom of local farmers after ensuring the required water depth in the field 60 and 30 kg ha of urea fertilizer were respectively applied on 20th may 9th day and 5th june 24th day when 60 and 20 kg ha of triple superphosphate were also added in addition on 19th may 3 liter ha of 60 butachlor emulsion herbicide was applied to the field as highlighted by spraying in fig 2 this figure shows the growth stages of the rice plant and their duration on 28th august after 109 days crops were harvested and weighed at the site 2 3 sampling and experimental tests in this study dissolved oxygen do ec ph and temperature were measured in situ using the portable multi parameter device table 1 for other parameters sampling was done every three days twice a week by 1 liter polyethylene or stained glass containers from both the pilot area s inflow channel and subsurface dp s outflow and immediately transferred to the laboratory the stars in fig 1 denote the sampling locations 64 samples were totally taken from two points each point 32 samples chemical oxidation demand cod nitrate no3 n total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn n tp were tested according to standard methods apha 2017 in iran non chemical methods are not popular to control weeds here butachlor is the primary and common herbicide used in paddy fields noorhosseini et al 2012 therefore butachlor concentrations were measured daily until five days after spraying us epa 2007 the methods and types of equipment used for the tests are mentioned in table 1 it should be noted that the aggregate concentration of tkn and nitrate was reported as tn since there were no significant nitrite levels to detect 2 4 gwf calculation gwf of each pollutant i m3 ton is accounted individually by eq 1 as recommended by hoekstra et al 2011 and their maximum value is determined as the gwf of paddy rice eq 2 franke et al 2013 hoekstra et al 2011 1 gwf i l i y c max c nat i 2 gwf max gwf i in these equations δl is the difference between the outflow and inflow pollution i loads gr yr calculated by eq 3 δl 0 c max is the maximum allowable concentration of contaminants mg l or µg l c nat is the natural background concentration of pollutants mg l or µg l y is the annual production yield of pilot paddy rice ton yr in the pilot area after harvesting in this study the total paddy rice harvested after the study period weighed about 2 42 tons 4 03 ton ha c max and c nat are explained in sections 2 4 and 2 5 3 l l out l in here l out refers to the discharged pollution load from the pilot area gr yr while l in gr yr is the entering pollution load via irrigation into the paddy field both parameters are calculated by eq 4 4 l in out q in c in out in this equation c out and c in are the average concentration of pollutants mg l µg l in the outflow and inflow respectively it is noteworthy that the concentration of butachlor on the fourth day after application became less than 5 µg l as its half life in the paddy field water column is less than 2 5 days kangning et al 1993 ok et al 2012 thus the c out of butachlor is based on its average in 4 days the measurement of q in is explained in section 2 5 it should be noted that gwf do is calculated differently via eq 5 based on jamshidi 2019 this equation is based on the fact that carbonaceous organic compounds and nitrogenous compounds are responsible for increasing the oxygen demand in water carbonaceous oxygen demand is estimated by cod while nitrogenous oxygen demand is approximated via tkn chapra 2008 hence the aggregate of the net pollution loads δl of cod and tkn can estimate the total oxidation demand in water as similarly discussed for the gwf accounting of fish production jamshidi 2019 the assimilation factor of do is also different it should be the difference between do saturation level in the main river of the region c sat

total volume of daily irrigation water measured during the cultivation period t by washington state college wsc trapezoidal flume type ii chamberlain 1952 as eq 7 m3 in which 0 001 and 86 400 convert lit s to m3 d d refers to the measured water depth cm in the flume in eq 7 by this equation q irr was totally measured 4290 m3 for the study period 94 days p eff is effective precipitation in the pilot in cultivation period mm measured by two methods u and b explained in section 2 6 et represents actual evapotranspiration from the plant and soil surface mm measured by a mini lysimeter with 60 cm diameter installed near the pilot area 10 converts mm to m3 ha and a is the pilot area equals 0 6 ha according to the daily et data gathered during the study period t shown in fig 3 the total et was measured 3089 m3 the water balance components are schematically illustrated in fig 4 q out is the aggregate of dps outflow measured daily during the cultivation period since paddy rice is cultivated once a year in this area q out equals the overall annual water volume m3 discharged from the paddy field in this study the average q out was measured 12 4 m3 d fig 5 which equals 1479 2 m3 in 94 days t it should be added that q out was measured 94 4 m3 during the four days of butachlor introduction 2 6 effective precipitation peff p eff is effective precipitation mm in a pilot cultivation period this parameter is determined by two methods of water balance p eff b and scs usda p eff u separately according to the eq 8 mohan et al 1996 and 9 zheng et al 2020 respectively this parameter is estimated by two methods as two scenarios u and b in order to discuss the effectiveness of these estimation methods on gwf and compare their impacts with other uncertainty scenarios 8 p eff b q out et perc s q irr in eq 8 perc denotes the period s percolation losses as the average percolation pilot location was 0 65 millimeters per day in all pilot area δs denotes the difference between storage at the end of the period and storage at the beginning according to the irrigated situation at the start of the period and the late rainfalls δs variations were assumed to be negligible runoff could not be created in the pilot area q out q irr and et were described earlier in section 2 5 by these assumptions p eff b was measured 333 m3 during the cultivation period therefore q in b was calculated 1534 5 m3 16 3 m3 day on average by eq 6 9 p e f f u p 4 17 0 2 p 4 17 p 8 3 4 17 0 1 p p 8 3 in eq 9 p is the total daily precipitation mm derived from a meteorological station with 300 m distance from the pilot area this equation is used in scs usda method developed by the u s department of agriculture döll and siebert 2002 which is similarly used for rice wf evaluation in recent researches zheng et al 2020 according to the daily p eff u data gathered during the study period t shown in fig 3 the overall p eff u was measured 278 m3 with 16 difference with p eff b therefore q in u was calculated 1479 2 m3 15 7 m3 day on average by eq 6 accordingly q in u and q in b has only 3 6 difference it should be added that q in u was measured 62 94 m3 during the four days of butachlor introduction 2 7 maximum allowable concentration cmax since the gwf is used globally this study recommends that c max is assumed based on multiple standards instead of an absolute criteria in this study several criteria have been used to determine c max table 2 water quality standards from different parts of the world were used in three scenarios of strict s1 normal s2 and lenient s3 which were also used in this research these three scenarios with different c max in association with the two aforementioned scenarios of q in section 2 6 form the total 6 scenarios of uncertainty in accounting the gwf of ipr in this study 2 8 natural concentration c nat for calculating c nat the sefidroud river was selected as the primary receiver of pollution loads discharged by paddy fields jamshidi et al 2015 here the available water quality data in two stations upstream manjil and downstream kiashahr were gathered using the global environment monitoring system for freshwater gems united nations 2017b monthly average trends of both stations specific selected parameters concentrations are shown from 1980 to 1983 the oldest data available in fig 6 and their average is assumed as c nat as table 3 it is important to note that the population has doubled since 1980 as a result residential industrial and agricultural activity have increased significantly during the last four decades pilehvar 2021 worldometer 2020 therefore the assumed c nat can represent reliable data in a period with minimum human interferences 2 9 wf calculation bwf and grwf were calculated m3 ton by eqs 10 and 11 respectively while the overall wf was calculated by eq 12 hoekstra et al 2011 10 bwf 10 t 1 n max 0 et p eff y 11 grwf 10 t 1 n min et p eff y 12 wf bwf grwf gwf here bwf grwf and gwf are the blue green and grey water footprints m3 ton respectively n is the number of days 94 and other parameters are defined earlier 3 results 3 1 pollution load the average concentrations of pollutants were determined for both the inflow and outflow as summarized in table 4 results show that the concentrations of cod ec tkn and tp were increased in the pilot outflow while nitrate and tn concentrations were decreased for example nitrate concentration was reduced from an average of 4 77 mg l in inflow to 1 13 mg l in outflow the reduction of nitrate can be due to its uptake by the plantations and partial denitrification in the ponds while other parameters were increased mainly due to fertilizer application limited do in paddy fields inhibits nitrification and conversely facilitates denitrification process chapra 2008 this fact can lead to the dominance of tkn over nitrate concentration during cultivation as a result and according to eq 4 based on q in u δl becomes negative for nitrate and tn thus these pollutants cannot be directly effective on gwf as δl 0 the comparative statistical analysis by minitab 19 also verified that the variations of parameters from inflow to outflow were significant with a 95 confidence interval fig 7 these results imply that the current agricultural practices for rice production can affect the water quality of outflow however all of the pollutants are not necessarily effective on gwf the pollution load of some pollutants may be reduced in paddy field therefore no3 and tn were excluded from gwf accounting in this research this point should be considered as a filtering step prior to multiple pollutant gwf accounting it means that the gwf of productions should only be calculated based on pollutants that their pollution loads are increased through the production process in the paddy field δl 0 3 2 gwf calculation multiple pollutant gwf was calculated by eq 1 and via the values of table 2 c max table 3 c nat and table 4 δl different standardization scenarios s1 s2 s3 in addition to the scenarios of q in q in u q in b were included for comprehensive uncertainty analysis as shown in fig 8 based on the results in q in u fig 8 the gwf of paddy rice is 7788 3126 and 1109 m3 ton in s1 s2 and s3 respectively it means that water quality criteria c max has a significant impact on gwf variations in addition the determinant pollutant can be changed in different standardization scenarios for example tp is critical in s1 7788 m3 ton and s2 3126 m3 ton while do deficiency becomes critical in s3 1109 m3 ton provided that precipitation estimation method is set by water balance q in b the gwf would be changed in all scenarios fig 7 the gwf of paddy rice in this scenario is 8080 3243 and 1150 m3 ton in s1 s2 and s3 respectively these values are comparatively 4 more than q in u all these evaluations indicate that gwf accounting based on 1 multiple pollutants 2 concrete samplings in the inflow and outflow and 3 different water quality standards may present a more precise and comprehensive value this study also estimates the bwf and grwf by eqs 10 and 11 in all of the scenarios fig 9 these indicators are calculated 1171 and 115 m3 ton for ipr by q in u accordingly the overall wf is 9074 4412 and 2395 m3 ton via eq 12 in s1 s2 and s3 respectively based on these values the proportion of gwf to wf equals 86 71 and 46 in s1 s2 and s3 respectively it implies that gwf even with lenient water quality standards s3 incorporates a considerable share in the wf of ipr which cannot be ignored provided that the inflow measurement uncertainties are considered in gwf accounting wf would range 9074 9366 m3 ton s1 4412 4530 m3 ton s2 and 2395 2437 m3 ton s3 accordingly the ratios of gwf to wf range between 85 86 s1 71 72 s2 and 46 47 s3 similarly bwf and grwf estimations were obtained by q in b and compared with q in u fig 9 in this scenario bwf and grwf are calculated 1148 and 139 for ipr by water balance method q in b bwf reduces about 4 while grwf increases 16 nevertheless these changes could not have significant impact on the gwf and its ratio to wf it can be concluded that among two parameters of 1 different c max s1 s3 and 2 q in variations by two p eff methods the former is relatively more effective on the gwf the effectiveness of c max increases gwf up to 7 times from s1 to s3 while q in estimation by two methods of p eff with 16 differences changes gwf only about 4 in all scenarios 4 discussion 4 1 agricultural practices in gwf in two scenarios in the current study s1 and s2 tp has been determined as a critical pollutant in gwf accounting however in another similar study in paddy field nitrogen was introduced as the determinant pollutant of gwf xinchun et al 2018 it can be due to the fact that agricultural practices like fertilizer types are effective on the critical pollutants and consequently the gwf of products in addition the soil and paddy field specifications may affect pollution leachate peng et al 2011 therefore agricultural specifications and practices are effective on gwf it should also be noted that precipitation in the research area during the cultivation period is relatively lower than comparable field studies as the cultivation period is carried out in dry season in addition paddy field is irrigated not rain fed in which grwf is relatively lower than bwf therefore the ratio of gwf to wf can relatively increase in comparison with other studies wu et al 2021 xinchun et al 2018 however this approach in pilot scale requires further case studies to support the global or regional assessment of gwf and wf discussing about the spatial variation of these indicators virtual water trading or the wf of crops regionally muratoglu and avanoz 2021 are basically founded on the results of these pilot or case studies 4 2 pilot study specification and limitation this study was carried out in a pilot in rice research institute rci isolated with controlled drainage system farming stages and seeds were identical to the normal pattern of the area in larger scale paddy fields are naturally surrounded by other fields farms gardens rural or even industrial activities without isolation and monitoring systems all these surroundings in addition to sedimentation soil texture and plantations in riparian zone can more or less affect groundwater and surface water quality therefore the exact gwf evaluation of paddy rice in larger scales requires considerable cost and practice for isolation sampling with repetition in different periods for tracking possible interactions of effective parameters this study focused on the inflow and outflow of pilot for eliminating the most aforementioned disturbances for gwf nevertheless samples were also taken weekly by rci in the same period march august 2020 from the existing conventional surface drainage system canals these canals transfer surface water upstream to 86 hec of paddy fields 143 folds more that pilot area and drain the effluents downstream without any isolation or control over the discharges here water quality are affected by rurals side streams water uptakes and natural assimilation by plantations or sedimentation in these trenches fig 10 illustrates that the concentrations of nutrients n and p were decreased on average it should be added that cod concentration reduced from 41 to 37 mg l while ec increased from 1276 to 1327 µs cm in general the reducing trend of water quality from inflow to outflow shows that the dilution effects of side streams nutrient uptake by plantations leachacte water uptake for irrigation sedimentation etc can affect the final gwf assessment it implies that regional estimation without elaborate experimentation may underestimate the gwf of paddy rice in larger scale due to the partial assimilation of pollution out of the main fields 4 3 importance of inflow pollution another influential factor in gwf accounting is the actual regional conditions prevailing in the paddy fields for example in northern iran the density of paddy fields is relatively high according to the cultivation calendar herbicide and fertilizers may be applied simultaneously in a short period it may have adverse impacts on the downstream irrigation water quality aghabeigi et al 2018 therefore paddy rice gwf accounting exclusively based on the outflow pollution load may overestimate the related environmental impacts as it neglects the upstream inflow pollution load on the condition that the inflow pollution load is neglected in the current study as in other studies the gwf of paddy rice may increase to 11 043 4432 and 1676 m3 ton in s1 s2 and s3 respectively qin u these values are 42 51 more than measured gwf considering base on inflow and outflow simultaneously consequently it is recommended that for more accurate calculation both inflow and outflow average pollution loads should be included in gwf accounting particularly for paddy rice it is also recommended that gwf should be calculated only based on pollutants that their pollution loads not the concentration or amount of pollutants are increased from the inflow to outflow otherwise paddy field should not be charged for pollution 4 4 main effective factors based on the results of recent researches a wide range of gwf was accounted for paddy rice between 48 and 5184 m3 ton summarized in table 5 as previously discussed this diversity is originated from agricultural practices field specifications and also the assumptions of c max and c nat for example the c max of nitrogen was considered as 10 mgno3 n l mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 40 mgtn l yoo et al 2014 10 mgtn l bulsink et al 2010 li et al 2018 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 1 mgtn l zhuo et al 2016 50 mgno3 l chapagain and hoekstra 2010 and 2 mgtn l xinchun et al 2018 the c max of phosphorus was also determined as 4 mgtp l yoo et al 2014 0 2 mgtp l zhuo et al 2016 and 0 4 mgtp l xinchun et al 2018 on the contrary c nat was mostly considered as zero for n and p bulsink et al 2010 mullick and das 2021 yoo et al 2014 however these c nat are not realistic particularly for tn as nutrients are naturally transferred in water via plants and algae without human interferences some research recommends using the minimum level mentioned in water quality standards for c nat zhuo et al 2016 the current study recommends 1 to consider at least three scenarios for c max and 2 to refer to the earliest existing water quality data of the main receiving water bodies to provide a more realistic c nat otherwise the values of gwf might be underestimated the results of gwf in the three scenarios of water quality standards shows that gwf can be increased to 2 8 s3 s2 or more than 7 s3 s1 folds in different cmax this variation in gwf is more significant than the impacts of q out variations and p eff estimations the uncertainty analysis in qu shows that using scs usda for p eff calculation may only increase gwf about 1 2 fold in comparison with the water balance method it means that c max has a relatively leading role on gwf in comparison with the calculating variations of inflow 4 5 multi pollutant many researches calculated gwf based on a single pollutant the current study showed that paddy fields might discharge different pollutants ec tkn cod herbicide and also do deficiency can be effective pollutants that may be ignored using multiple pollutant gwf can increase the comprehensiveness of this environmental indicator jamshidi 2021 in addition according to a recent development in accounting gwf jamshidi 2019 this indicator may be calculated more than 1150 8079 m3 ton in the current study area do deficiency eutrophication and elevated levels of micropollutants are some of the downstream research area s ecological concerns based on the developed methodology jamshidi 2019 these ecological challenges should be inserted in the form of an increasing factor in gwf to indicate the current ecological status of regions where productions are produced this can be studied in further researches by comparing these results with other researches in table 5 it can be concluded that typical leaching runoff fractions α for tn and tp losses may lead into a realistic gwf unless c max is underestimated zhuo et al 2016 or overestimated bulsink et al 2010 chapagain and hoekstra 2010 yoo et al 2014 5 conclusion this research mainly examined the effectiveness of different parameters as uncertainties in gwf calculation and calculated a realistic range for the gwf of this crop based on concrete pilot study according to the results and discussions the main conclusions are by comparing the effectiveness of strict s1 normal s2 and lenient s3 scenarios with inflow evaluations methods based on water balance qin b and scs usda qin u on the gwf c max was more effective on gwf rather than 4 variations of q in it implied that using proper c max may have considerable impacts comparing with the precise calculation of drained water volume or precipitation on land the gwf calculation of ipr only based on the outflow pollution without subtracting the inflow pollution would dramatically overestimate this indicator and must be avoided particularly where inflow has considerable pollution in addition critical pollutants are more accurate in this approach some pollutants like nitrate and tn in this study may be reduced not increased in cultivation from inflow to outflow this reduction must be considered in multi pollutant gwf accounting by excluding reduced pollutants tp is the critical pollutant determined in the most of scenarios it is due to the specific agricultural practices and water quality limitations nevertheless in some scenarios do was become critical it means that multi pollutant evaluation combined with uncertainty analysis can increase calculation accuracy and broaden the range of gwf through the applied methodology gwf would incorporate a significant share in the wf of ipr the comparative analysis with recent researches verified that the current methodology presented a moderate gwf m3 ton in s3 it implied that field based examinations on both the inflow and outflow with lenient water quality limitations was rather identical with global data therefore in other scenarios s1 and s2 gwf would be increased significantly due to inevitable uncertainties the current approach that defined a range for the gwf in different scenarios was recommended instead of using estimations for absolute gwf calculation it can also be updated in further studies by considering the environmental impairment background of the receiving water body declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

8984,rationalizing the use of agricultural water is a key issue in semi arid areas that face more and more water shortages while food security is already threatened by the increasing population the fao 56 approach has been developed to estimate the crop water requirement it relies on an accurate estimation of the basal crop coefficient kcb act that has been shown to be closely related to ndvi nevertheless optical data can be inoperant in case of persistent cloud cover within this context the objective of this study is to assess the potentiality of the all weather c band sentinel 1 radar observations available with 6 day revisit time at the field scale to this end the empirical relationships between kcb act on one hand and the interferometric coherence at vv ρ vv and vh ρ vh polarizations and the polarization ratio on the other hand were assessed on two wheat fields during two crop seasons and compared to the classical kcb act ndvi method it is demonstrated that while good statistical metrics are obviously obtained between kcb act and ndvi derived from sentinel 2 r 0 77 0 88 and rmse 0 14 0 15 for field 1 field 2 close results are highlighted with radar data the best metrics are found with ρ vv r 0 76 and 0 77 and rmse 0 18 and 0 28 for field 1 and field 2 respectively using the calibrated relationships on one season of field 1 reasonable estimates of etc act was found on field 1 r 0 70 rmse 0 75 mm day and bias 0 18 mm days using kcb act ρ vv by contrast a significant overestimations is highlighted both with ρ vv bias 0 73 mm day and ndvi bias 1 46 mm day over field 2 interestingly the kcb act ρ vv relationship is more consistent in the estimation of etc act when changing from one plot to another these outcomes open new perspectives for the estimation of etc act from radar data as a potential substitute of ndvi in case of persistent cloud cover keywords basal crop coefficient interferometric coherence polarization ratio evapotranspiration wheat crop data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global water demand is dominated by the irrigation sector that uses up to 90 of available water in semi arid catchments anapalli et al 2020 jarlan et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 a rationale and sustainable use of the already scarce water resources in this region is becoming essential anticipation and eﬃcient management of irrigation is also fundamental to ensure the global food security ipcc 2019 medecc 2020 this management is mainly based on the characterization of soil and vegetation water conditions that govern the use of water resources and this requires the estimation of crop water requirements which is represented by the evapotranspiration of the vegetation cover et the accurate estimation of et constitutes the focus of several applications starting from meteorology since et represents the process that transfers water from soil plant to atmosphere allen et al 2007 gibelin 2007 norman et al 1995 soer 1980 to agronomy where et defines the water requirements of the crop feng et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 yao et al 2020 et estimation can be done using in situ measurements such as the eddy covariance system and the lysimeters such techniques provide reliable estimates but they remain local and expensive to implement allen et al 2011 besides direct measurements et is computed using land surface models various types of models exist in the literature with a wide variety of theoretical background and required input variables and can be divided into models based on resolving the energy balance and or the water balance with different level of complexity ait hssaine et al 2021 2018 allen et al 2011 annandale et al 1999 bigeard et al 2019 courault et al 2005 diarra et al 2017 elfarkh et al 2022 jarlan et al 2021 subedi and chávez 2015 zhang et al 2016 the fao 56 approach is a widely deployed model in the operational tools for irrigation management because it is easy to implement through a limited number of inputs allen et al 1998 it was applied for several type of vegetation and has demonstrated accurate estimation over a wide range of climate and growth conditions around the world duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 pereira et al 2021 it consists in multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 of a well irrigated grass derived from simple meteorological variables by an empirical coefficient called the crop coefficient kc that reflects the actual condition of the considered plant under this form the determination of kc is sufficient to obtain an estimate of the amount of water needed by the plant to preserve a good yield while avoiding waste of water pereira et al 2021 kc varies throughout the agricultural season because of the phenological stages specific water demand and the changes of the aerodynamic and the surface resistances allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021 for annual crops kc is assumed to have a trapezoidal shape with four linear segments representing four main growing stages and subsequently three kc values are required to obtain the whole growing season evolution fao 56 paper provides a large database of these values for a wide range of crops and climates however previous work has demonstrated strong discrepancies between locally measured and the fao tabulated values anapalli et al 2020 er raki et al 2013 howell et al 1995 irmak et al 2013 lópez urrea et al 2016 pereira et al 2021 sánchez et al 2015 indeed kc is highly affected by several factors such as irrigation technique crop cover fraction agricultural practices length of the growing season and local climate kc values and the duration of the different growth stages should thus be adjusted to reflect the actual condition of the considered crop allen et al 1998 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 er raki et al 2008 pôças et al 2020 because local calibration of kc requires costly and time consuming installations remote sensing and in particular vegetation indices derived from optical data have been considered to exploit the high sensitivity of kc to the vegetation cover fraction and to the leaf area index lai since the 1980s bausch and neale 1987 diarra et al 2017 er raki et al 2013 wiegand et al 1991 several vegetation indices have been assessed see pôças et al 2020 for a review but the most widely used remains the ndvi duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2013 french et al 2020 glenn et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2005 pereira et al 2021 pôças et al 2020 experience has shown that there is no general scientific framework that defines the nature of the relationship between kc and ndvi as both linear bausch 1993 duchemin et al 2006 gontia and tiwari 2010 hunsaker et al 2003 kamble et al 2013 and non linear relationships alam et al 2018 er raki et al 2013 pôças et al 2020 have been established several operational tools based on kc ndvi relationships have already been developed so far the satellite monitoring of irrigation samir a software package developed to estimate et and spatialized irrigation water budget over large areas le page et al 2014 simonneaux et al 2009 that is part of the modspa modeling platform developed at cesbio http osr cesbio ups tlse fr satirr the satirr tool for irrigation scheduling at the field scale pôças et al 2020 also provided a number of websites for kc mapping over several countries to support irrigation management while good estimates of evapotranspiration where obtained based on these kc ndvi relationships optical data may be hampered by atmospheric conditions leading to images unavailability during long periods that could be problematic in cloudy regions or for winter crop monitoring indeed the swot analysis strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats of the fao 56 approach developed by pôças et al 2020 has clearly highlighted cloud cover as a threat to the application of the method when optical indices are used to derive kc within this context the main objective of this work is to assess the potentialities of all weather c band radar data as a substitute to vegetation indices for kc estimates from optical remote sensing over the last decade radar or sar for synthetic aperture radar data have become increasingly used for vegetation monitoring at the field scale mainly with the launch of the satellites sentinel 1a in 2014 and 1b in 2016 as the main driver although c band radar signals wavelengths between 3 75 and 7 5 cm provide a complex mix of ground and vegetation contributions several authors have proposed variables derived from the signal intensity and phase that can be directly related to vegetation variables such as biomass crop height and cover fraction gherboudj et al 2011 greifeneder et al 2018 jacome et al 2013 li and wang 2018 mattia et al 2003 ouaadi et al 2020 2021a srivastava et al 2015 veloso et al 2017 in particular while the radar backscattering coefficient σ 0 a measure of the backscattered signal intensity is sensitive to both soil and vegetation variables the polarization ratio pr σ vh 0 σ vv 0 where σ vh 0 and σ vv 0 stand for the backscattering coefficient at cross vh and co vv polarization respectively was introduced to reduce the effects of soil and soil vegetation interaction indeed the pr has been shown to be more stable in time than the backscattering coefficient and follows the evolution of biomass during the agricultural season ouaadi et al 2021a veloso et al 2017 this ratio is recently used by chintala et al 2022 to estimate kc over rice sugarcane and vegetables their investigation was directed towards establishing a linear relationship between kc and pr but poor correlations were obtained correlations range from 0 01 to 0 31 beside the signal intensity the phase information acquired by radar sensors has also been shown to be related to the crop cycle through the interferometric coherence ρ ρ is a measure of the phase stability it can be computed between i two images taken by two antennas simultaneously from two different angles that overlook the same scene or ii two images acquired by the same sensor over an orbit with exact repetition but taken at different times coltelli et al 1996 such as for sentinel 1 data frison and lardeux 2018 if the characteristics of the scatterers including both geometric at the scale of the radar wavelength and dielectric properties within the image does not change ρ is equal to 1 while if the characteristics changes between two acquisitions a drastic drop of ρ can be observed in particular for crops vegetation growth and movement of the scatterers due to weather conditions such as wind and rain systematically causes ρ to drop frison et al 2018 with the high temporal repetitivity provided by sentinel 1 6 days research has been conducted to investigate and understand the behavior of ρ over annual crops based on the encouraging results of some early studies blaes and defourny 2003 engdahl et al 2001 wegmuller and werner 1997 in particular ρ has been used as complementary information to optical data for crop mapping and classification busquier et al 2020 mattia et al 2015 mestre quereda et al 2020 in addition strong relationships were recently highlighted between ρ and several vegetation variables namely biomass leaf area index crop height and cover fraction by ouaadi et al 2020 2021a within this context the objective of this work is to assess the potential of radar observations to estimate the fao 56 crop coefficient as a surrogate to the classically used ndvi derived from optical data to this end two variables derived from sentinel 1 data are investigated namely pr and ρ at vv and vh polarizations the study is carried out over 4 winter wheat seasons in morocco the following section presents the study site and the experimental data section 3 deals with the presentation of the results and it is organized as follows 1 the time series of kc derived from the eddy covariance system for the four seasons are presented 2 the relationships between kc and the radar variables are investigated and compared to kc ndvi relationship 3 the calibration and validation of the kc retrieved from the different variables are evaluated 4 the et derived from the estimated kc over the four seasons is discussed the last section is devoted to drawing conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area is located on a private farm in west central morocco in the marrakech safi region in one of the most important agricultural plains of the country named the haouz plain fig 1 characterized by a semi arid climate the air temperature is variable throughout the year ranging from a hot summer with a daily average of about 35 c in july august to a cold winter with an average of 5 c in january abourida et al 2008 the average air humidity is about 50 and the reference evapotranspiration et0 is about 1600 mm year jarlan et al 2015 which far exceeds the annual precipitation amount of 250 mm year on average cereals mainly wheat represent the major portion of the irrigated and non irrigated agricultural production of the plain they are sown in winter when 85 of the rainfall falls between october and april this study is conducted on two winter wheat fields monitored during two consecutive crop seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 fig 1 illustrates the location of the fields in the haouz plain the soil texture is a mixture of 37 5 clay and 32 5 sand the fields are drip irrigated and cover an area of 1 5 ha each sown and harvested on the same dates for the two monitored 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons the agricultural season starts with the sowing of wheat in late november 27 11 2016 and 25 11 2017 until the harvest on 16 05 2017 and 08 06 2018 respectively the fields are sown by the karim variety using an automatic seed drill with a distance of 15 cm between the sowing lines in the 2016 2017 season a stem density campaign conducted on march 28th resulted of an average of 416 and 504 stems m2 over field 1 and field 2 respectively unfortunately the accurate value of the field density is not determined for the 2017 2018 season but the same tools were used for seeding resulting probably in seed densities of the same order of value an estimation of the main crop growth stages starting dates reported during the field campaigns from visual inspection are provided in table 1 the gdd growing degree days corresponding to these dates is also provided in c for the sake of information calculated by accumulation of daily average temperatures the fields are irrigated at a rate of 12 5 mm per event and the irrigation scheduling and amounts are recorded ouaadi et al 2021b 2 2 in situ measurements weather and eddy covariance stations in the vicinity of the study sites a weather station was installed over an irrigated alfalfa field fig 1 the station allow a half hourly measurements of precipitations and other meteorological variables used for estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 namely solar radiation wind speed and air temperature and relative humidity meteorological data were quality controlled to detect outliers following boudhar 2009 chaponnière et al 2008 and simonneaux et al 2008 to estimate continuous measurements of the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act two similar eddy covariance stations campbell scientific ltd are installed at 2 58 m high in the center of each field as shown in fig 1 each station is composed of a csat3 3d sonic anemometer and a kh2o krypton hygrometer allowing the measurement of the three components of wind speed and the rapid fluctuations of atmospheric water vapor respectively the sampled raw data at 20 hz rate are used to calculate the half hourly sensible h and latent heat le fluxes using the ecpack software to apply all required corrections for planar fit correction humidity and oxygen kh20 frequency response for slow apparatus and path length integration ait hssaine et al 2018 rafi et al 2019 van dijk et al 2004 the measurements are representative of the field to ensure that the flux contribution measured by the station is within the field the calculation conducted for the study site conditions shows that 95 of the flux information came from 50 32 5 m long x wide for a mean wind speed of 1 95 m s and a wind direction of 58 rafi et al 2019 finally the daily evapotranspiration mm day is obtained by cumulating the 48 daily values of le measurements excluding the negative values and then converting from w m2 to mm day the stations are also equipped with kipp and zonen cnr radiometers to measure the net radiation rn and two hft3 l heat flux plates installed at 5 cm depth to measure the soil heat flux g is computed by a simple average considering each field and season separately the energy balance closure is acceptable the correlation coefficient ranges between 0 70 and 0 81 while the slope of the linear regression between rn g and h le is between 0 47 and 0 56 these statistical metrics are within the range found in the literature in particular concerning the slope see elfarkh et al 2020 liu et al 2011 wilson et al 2002 among others the lack of closure of eddy covariance measurements was largely discussed in the literature and could be related to a combination of several factors see allen et al 2011 including i the attenuation of turbulent signals at sufficiently low or high frequencies moore 1986 ii the source area of the rn and g sensors that measure the available energy is very small compared to that of the eddy covariance system which can be changed rapidly depending on wind speed and direction and surface conditions iii the energy storage either in the vegetation scott et al 2003 or in the layer between surface and the heat flux plate measurements that is not considered in the energy balance closure meyers et al 2004 iv the time shift between the irradiation and the turbulent fluxes that can reach up to 30 min foken et al 2001 2006 the modeling studies most commonly force the closing of the surface energy balance to correct the systematic under estimation of turbulent fluxes measurements in particular because the energy balance is closed for the land surface models the most extensively used method for this purpose is the bowen ratio approach twine et al 2000 this method is closing the energy balance by scaling h and le so that the sum equals rn g considering the low value of the energy balance closure both raw le data i e without correction and le values corrected by the bowen ration approach are considered in this study more details on this data base including meteorological and eddy covariance data can be found in ait hssaine et al 2018 2020 and rafi et al 2019 and part of the data set has been made available to the scientific community ouaadi et al 2021a fig 2 displays the time series of the raw measured etc act and computed et0 see section 2 3 over the two fields for the sake of simplicity the 2016 2017 season is designated by s1 and the 2017 2018 season by s2 the difference between et0 and etc act is significant during the growing season characterizing the high climatic demand of the semi arid region et0 is higher in s1 than in s2 because of wetter conditions in the second season where the amount of rainfall recorded from sowing to harvest is 167 mm versus 70 mm during season s2 and season s1 respectively ouaadi et al 2021a the general trend is an increase during the agricultural season with minimum values occurring in december and january around 2 mm day this period corresponds to the start of the season et0 is higher than etc act because most of etc act comes from soil evaporation since canopy cover is very low allen et al 1998 whereas et0 is the et of a well developed grass and will therefore use more water for transpiration araya et al 2011 the etc act starts to increase with the development of the canopy with an average increase of 3 mm day from the beginning of the season to full development in addition to the higher seed density on field 2 compared to field 1 irrigation was stopped from 27 02 2017 to 14 03 2017 on field 1 which led to a lower etc act of 2 5 mm day on this field compared to field 2 moreover etc act reached a maximum of 4 5 mm day on field 1 while the maximum on field 2 is about 6 mm day the wetter 2017 2018 season contributed to the increase of the etc act of field 1 to reach higher values than the first season and joined the et0 level in the mid season stage for field 2 season s2 was affected by a particular growing condition explained with more details in ouaadi et al 2021a the presence of dense weed in the field as well as strong winds that laid down the high stems in april may be the reason for the low values observed of etc act etc act decreases obviously at the end of the season from the senescence phase onwards as the vegetation and the underlying soil dry out 2 3 actual single and basal crop coefficients the reference evapotranspiration et 0 is the evapotranspiration from a well watered grass that totally cover the soil with a uniform height of 0 12 m albedo of 0 23 and a surface resistance of 70 s m it is a climatic variable that account only for the evaporating power of the atmosphere according to the fao 56 guidelines et 0 is computed from the meteorological forcing using the penman monteith equation 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n mj m2 day is the net radiation at the crop surface and g mj m2 day is the conductive flux in the soil u 2 m s is the wind speed at 2 m above the ground t c is the averaged air temperature at 2 m γ kpa c is the psychrometric constant e s kpa and e a kpa are the saturation and actual vapor pressures at 2 m respectively g is assumed to be equal to 0 for daily calculation while the other variables are computed using the daily meteorological forcing as in allen et al 1998 the crop evapotranspiration et c act is computed as introduced in the paper 56 of the fao by allen et al 1998 2 et c act k c act et 0 where kc act is the crop coefficient that account for the soil evaporation plant transpiration and the effect of water stress via three coefficients 3 k c act k s k cb act k e where k s is the water stress coefficient k cb act is the basal crop coefficient and k e the evaporation coefficient this study focuses on the estimation of kcb act and etc act to do so the following steps are implemented i the ratio of etc act measurements to the et0 resulting in the crop coefficient kc act has been filtered from high evaporation and water stressed data so that the remaining data correspond to ke 0 and ks 1 and therefore approximate the basal crop coefficient kc act kcb act the method is adapted from duchemin et al 2006 first an initial cleaning of the database was performed by eliminating days corresponding to watering events irrigation and precipitation as these generally correspond to an abrupt increase in kc act in response to increased evaporation torres and calera 2010 specific concern is given thereafter to the beginning of the season since the soil is bare and consequently kc act is dominated by ke when an irrigation precipitation event occurs for this period corresponds to a cover fraction 0 2 the 4 days following the watering event are eliminated from the data base duchemin et al 2006 later in the season ke is assumed to be neglected compared to kcb act as the vegetation is well developed and covers the soil allen et al 1998 duchemin et al 2006 the effect of water stress can also affect the computation of the crop coefficient kcb act during the period of full development pôças et al 2020 the water stressed data are characterized by a drop of kc act duchemin et al 2006 in this study the data lower than one standard deviation of the mid season period data average is discarded by this point we assume that the remaining data correspond to kc act kcb act ii the relationships between kcb act from one hand and ρ vv ρ vh pr and ndvi from the other hand are investigated for both fields and both seasons iii relationships are first established using data from 2017 2018 season s1 over field 1 and then used to derive kcb act and consequently etc act over the other seasons fields 2 4 satellite data 2 4 1 sentinel 1 data sentinel 1 is a constellation composed of two satellites sentinel 1a launched in 2014 and sentinel 1b launched in 2016 each satellite is equipped with a c band sar sensor with a frequency of 5 33 ghz the two satellites map the entire world in 175 orbits with a revisit time of six days torres et al 2012 the operational mode iw interferometric wide swath mode allows the acquisition of data in dual polarization vv and vh with an azimuth resolution of 20 m and a ground range resolution of 5 m european space agency 2012 the sentinel 1 data hub website https scihub copernicus eu gives free access to two types of products i slc products single look complex which are raw images that contain the radar measurement as a complex number and ii grdh products ground range detected high resolution which are multi looked to reduce the speckle and projected to ground range to have square pixels that contains only a measurement of the intensity of the measured signal the descending relative orbit number 52 maps the study area at 06 30 utc with an incidence angle of about 35 2 over both fields grd and slc products are used to compute the backscattering coefficient and the interferometric coherence respectively as described in the following sections the data availability is illustrated in fig a1 in the appendix please note that the relationships between radar and vegetation variables are not shown in this paper as they have been already studied in detail in ouaadi et al 2021a the reader is invited to consult this reference for more details on these relationships during the agricultural season 2 4 1 1 backscattering coefficient the backscattering coefficient is computed from the grdh products using the orfeo toolbox cnes 2018 with a processing chain that consists of three modules applied to each image for each polarization frison and lardeux 2018 thermal noise removal calibration and terrain correction the last aims to project the images on the surface of the earth using the digital terrain model srtm shuttle radar topography mission at 30 m resolution the obtained products are the backscattering coefficient at vv σ vv 0 and vh σ vh 0 with a spatial resolution of 10 m finally the radar backscattering coefficient is obtained from averaging all the pixels values within a field details of the processing steps are provided in ouaadi et al 2021a the polarization ratio pr is calculated as the ratio between σ vh 0 and σ vv 0 and then converted to db for a better visualization of the data dynamics 2 4 1 2 interferometric coherence the interferometric coherence ρ is a complementary information to σ 0 and well correlated with vegetation development since it contains the phase information the slc products allows computing ρ by exploiting the repeated orbits of sentinel 1 6 days between two consecutive acquisitions using sentinel 1 a and b of the same orbit the combination of the two successive images allows measuring the change occurred to the scene between these two dates the result is a scalar ranging between 0 when there is no correlation between the two images and 1 when the correlation is perfect over an agricultural area the main cause of ρ decrease is the temporal decorelation caused by the change in orientation size and position of the scatterers canopy components indeed it was found that the coherence is almost constant at high values 0 9 at vv in summer when the soil is bare ouaadi et al 2020 while the natural movement of vegetation components leaves stems under the effect of wind and rainfall in addition to the change caused by the growth of vegetation induce a gradual decrease in ρ to reach levels down to 0 2 during the agricultural season it is worth mentioning that soil moisture change has also been shown to impact ρ in some cases de zan et al 2014 morrison et al 2011 scott et al 2017 and does not highlight high impact on others ouaadi et al 2020 the sentinel snap application platform is used to calculate the interferometric coherence at vv ρ vv and vh ρ vh based on a five steps processing chain apply orbit file back geocoding coherence topsar deburst and terrain correction as for σ 0 ρ is obtained from averaging all the pixel values within a plot for more details on the processing chain the reader is referred to ouaadi et al 2021a 2 4 2 sentinel 2 ndvi the sentinel 2 is an optical constellation of two satellites sentinel 2a launched on 2015 and sentinel 2b launched on 2017 providing data on 13 spectral bands in the visible near and medium infrared domains with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m and a revisit time of 5 days over the study area the data are atmospherically corrected using the maja chain developed at cesbio hagolle et al 2015 the products are freely distributed by the national centre for space studies cnes via two platforms peps https peps cnes fr and theia https theia cnes fr among the 45 available images over the two agricultural seasons only 28 are free of clouds less than 30 of clouds over the study area see data availability in fig a1 in the appendix the 28 images are downloaded and processed to extract the ndvi using the red and near infrared bands bands 4 and 8 and finally an average per field is computed 3 results the first section is devoted to crop coefficients analysis over the agricultural season the second section is dedicated to the investigation of the relationships between kcb act and remote sensing variables finally the third section is dealing with the estimation of kcb act and etc act the raw le data are used but the results of kcb act and etc act estimation with corrected le are also reported 3 1 time series of the crop coefficients fig 3 displays the time series of the crop coefficient obtained from the measured etc act over the two fields during the two seasons s1 and s2 sowing and harvest dates for each season are marked with arrows in the figure for the season s1 data are available only from january 9 the kc act shape is a trapezoidal shape with low values at the start of the season when the soil is almost bare increasing values during the development stage a plateau of maximum values during the full development and then the kc act decreases progressively at the end of the season with the senescence of the vegetation the first values of kc act around the sowing dates are very low probably because the soil is almost dry at this time thereafter kc act can reach high values in response to high evaporation i e the red points in fig 3 because of rainfall and frequent irrigation see fig 2 for rainfall and irrigation distribution applied by the farmer to accelerate wheat emergence and development ouaadi et al 2021b likewise the kc act values corresponding to water stress during the period of full development are presented in black the red and black points are removed and it is assumed that the remaining data correspond to ks 1 and ke 0 and therefore kc act kcb act considering the mean value for each stage initial kcb init mid season kcb mid and late season kcb end the kcb act segmented curve is constructed magenta curve in fig 3 for each field and each season for comparison purposes the kcb curve obtained using fao 56 tabulated values with crop stages duration adjusted based on the field observations and ndvi cycle is also displayed in black in fig 3 table 2 reports the default fao 56 and adjusted lengths of the crop growth stages initial linit crop development ldev mid season lmid and late season llate significant discrepancies are observed between the tabulated fao 56 values and the adjusted values for the fields this highlights the need for local calibration of fao 56 as reported by many authors er raki et al 2008 pôças et al 2020 among others see introduction a value of kcb init 0 15 is given in fao 56 assuming that there is always some moisture in the soil while in this study kcb init is 0 07 probably because the tilling is not deep and the soil surface is very dry surface soil moisture average 0 03 m3 m3 on 27 11 2017 over both fields this is also the reason why the obtained kcb at the end of the season about 0 1 0 17 is lower than the fao 56 value 0 23 for mid season period fao 56 kcb mid is equal to 0 9 which is close to the kcb mid obtained over field 1 during season s2 while the values obtained are lower for field 2 and field 1 s1 this is related to the combined effect of the meteorological conditions with cropping system and vegetation physiological properties see the introduction section indeed the average of kcb act reached at mid season is different between the fields during season s1 the average kcb mid for both fields are close with 0 7 over field 1 and 0 6 over field 2 by contrast noticeable differences between the two fields are observed during season s2 with significantly lower values of kcb mid on field 2 the higher kcb mid over field 1 during s2 compared to s1 could be attributed to the wetter conditions of the 2017 2018 growing season compared to the 2016 2017 season resulting in much more vegetation as illustrated by the difference in the amount of biomass between the two seasons presented in ouaadi et al 2021a on the other hand the low values of kcb mid on field 2 are probably the result of the particular growing conditions of this field during s2 with a mixture of barley and wheat in addition to the high presence of adventices see above indeed etc act is highly affected by the specific canopy characteristics geometric and physiological such as the leaf arrangement the height of the vegetation and stomata properties araya et al 2011 the time series of pr ρ vv ρ vh and ndvi over the four growing seasons are presented in fig 4 the evolution of these variables illustrates a seasonal evolution following the development of wheat early in the season the values are low high and start to increase decrease with the development of the vegetation until a maximum minimum value is reached in full development for ndvi pr and interferometric coherences respectively with the onset of senescence a progressive decreasing increasing trend is observed until harvest it can be pointed out that for low values of ρ 0 4 corresponding to full development of vegetation ρ vv and ρ vh are quite identical however for high values 0 4 corresponding to low vegetation i e when vegetation is at early stage of development or during senescence ρ vv ρ vh traducing the higher sensitivity of vh polarization to small amounts of vegetation it should be kept in mind however that high values of the interferometric coherence 0 5 are more significant than the low values that are contaminated by noise 3 2 relationships between kcb act and satellite variables the relationships between kcb act and the different radar data including pr ρ vv and ρ vh with the same x axis scale 0 15 0 7 for ρ vv and ρ vh are presented in fig 5 for field 1 and field 2 the relationship between kcb act and ndvi is also displayed to compare the performance of the radar variables with this commonly used optical index using the complete wheat cycle from sowing to harvest the best fit is found to be exponential between kcb act and all the satellite variables the regression equation r and rmse calculated between the predicted variable using the fitted relationship in red and the observations are displayed in each subplot results show that the best fitting is obtained between kcb act and ρ vv hereafter named kcb act ρ vv and between kcb act and ndvi kcb act ndvi regarding data from both fields in contrast the relationships are more scattered using ρ vh kcb act ρ vh and pr kcb act pr the problem is due to a significant dispersion of the data in particular during the transition phase between the low high plateaus values see fig 4 pr was introduced to describe vegetation development while reducing the effect of soil variables on the backscattered signal yet it seems to contain some of these effects this may be related to a combined effect of wheat geometry and soil drying after heading σ vh 0 is still high because of the volume contribution from the head layer while σ vv 0 is low and quite constant as the soil is dry consequently the pr remained high late in the season the weak relationship with ρ vh is not surprising due to the low overall values 0 4 which are less significant than ρ vv 0 65 this is due to the highest sensitivity of vh polarization to low vegetation leading to lowest coherence values at vh fig 4 it is the reason why better relationship is observed for ρ vv which show an amplitude of 0 45 0 2 ρ vv 0 65 it is interesting to note that ρ vh and ρ vv when 0 35 are less scattered for field 2 than for field 1 indeed kcb act is more scattered on field 1 in particular around mid season when ρ vh is at its lowest level ρ vh 0 33 in general the statistical metrics using the radar variables are better for field 2 than for field 1 because of the scattering of kcb act around mid season fig 3 in contrast the best metrics are obtained on field 1 for kcb act ndvi which are also the best metrics obtained for the 8 subplots investigated in this study with an rmse limited to 0 15 this kcb act ndvi relationship is compared to similar relationships previously published 1 duchemin et al 2006 have used a linear relationship k cb act 1 64 ndvi 0 14 2 hunsaker et al 2005 have fitted kcb act to ndvi using a third order regression model k cb act 0 18 1 63 ndvi n 2 57 ndvi n 2 1 93 ndvi n 3 with ndvi n ndvi ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min 3 er raki et al 2007 derived kcb act from ndvi using an exponential relationship k cb act 1 07 1 ndvi m 0 84 0 54 with ndvi m ndvi max ndvi ndvi max ndvi min fig a2 displays our observations and the different relationships including ours in red over field 1 the different relationships provide with quite close results the closest being provided by duchemin et al 2006 for wheat fields also grown in the tensift catchment near marrakech with similar climate conditions considering all the results of this study kcb act ndvi provides good performance but the statistics of kcb act ρ vv comparable with those of kcb act ndvi are also promising 3 3 kcb act and crop evapotranspiration estimation in this section kcb act is estimated from different kcb act satellite variables relationships and then the estimated kcb act is used to calculate the etc act first the data from one season field 1 season s2 was chosen to calibrate the 4 relationships using the four variables pr ρ vv ρ vh and ndvi this relationship is then used to estimate kcb act over all fields seasons this season is chosen because the 2016 2017 season is not complete as previously mentioned the results obtained are presented in fig 6 for both fields and both seasons as expected the best results are obtained with kcb act ndvi and kcb act ρ vv over field 1 the retrieved kcb act from radar data is limited to almost 1 because of the quick saturation of the c band data while the kcb act ndvi can reach up to 1 2 and thus reproduce well the kcb act this advantage is reflected on the good statics on this field with r 0 88 slope 0 91 rmse 0 16 and a bias limited to 0 02 however this can also be a drawback from another point of view obviously when the canopy is very dense and consists of a mixture of several vegetation types as is the case in field 2 on this field a significant overestimation up to kcb act 2 is observed with a reduction in statistical metrics to r 0 70 slope 1 66 rmse 0 52 and bias 0 35 this can be explained by fig 4 and fig 3 where ndvi is higher in field 2 than in field 1 while kcb act is lower in field 2 than in field 1 in fact the low kcb act values are obviously due to the lower etc act of season s1 of field 2 compared to field 1 this is due to the presence of adventices with two possible scenarios i adventices do not transpire much which leads to a reduction in etc act ii adventices lead to a reduction in soil evaporation as they cover the entire soil indeed the measured canopy cover fc not shown shows high values since the beginning of the season where fc has reached 0 9 on 31 01 2018 on field 2 versus 0 7 on field 1 and had only reached 0 9 52 days later 13 03 2018 in contrast the higher cover fraction of green vegetation adventices and wheat is obviously driven at a much higher ndvi than field 1 and thus kcb act is overestimated in contrast similar statistical metrics are obtained between field 1 and field 2 using the radar variables the statistical metrics of kcb act ρ vv are lower than kcb act ndvi for field 1 but they are better for field 2 in addition kcb act ρ vv demonstrates a more stable performance between the two fields where r 0 76 and 0 77 for field 1 and field 2 respectively nevertheless the bias is higher for field 2 indicating a slight overestimation y intercept 0 44 this was mainly attributed to the end of the season when the estimated kcb act does not decrease enough to reach the lowest measured kcb act values not shown the kcb act ρ vh and kcb act pr provides with less accurate estimates with a better performance on field 2 due to a lower scattering of kcb act on this field as discussed in the previous section fig 5 using the estimated kcb act the etc act is then calculated and the results obtained for both fields are presented in fig 7 the outcomes with kcb act ndvi and kcb act ρ vv are encouraging because of the good estimates of kcb act fig 6 consequently similar comments can be drawn the kcb act ndvi has yielded very good estimate of etc act over field 1 with r 0 80 and rmse 0 65 mm day for etc act values up to 4 5 mm day as expected the performance drops to r 0 53 and bias 1 46 mm day over field 2 and the rmse increased from 0 65 to 2 15 mm day due to the overestimation of kcb act knowing that the maximum etc act is around 6 mm day on field 2 the stable estimate of kcb act by the kcb act ρ vv is reflected in the etc act estimation metrics where r is equal to 0 7 for both fields however the overestimation of kcb act at the end of the season led to a higher rmse on field 2 1 15 mm day on field 2 versus 0 75 mm day on field 1 interestingly enough kcb act pr and kcb act ρ vh methods provided with similar metrics as kcb act ndvi and kcb act ρ vv in estimating etc act even that the relationships used to estimate kcb act are of poor quality see fig 5 for kcb act pr and kcb act ρ vh relationships for instance kcb act pr provided an estimate of etc act with r 0 63 slope 0 89 rmse 1 02 mm day and bias 0 38 mm day over field 2 this is probably related to the quasi absence of water stressed period that could lead to strong discrepancies between etc act and et0 on these irrigated fields within these conditions the inter daily dynamics of etc act is mainly governed by et0 explaining the acceptable correlation coefficients for all the methods assessed in this study to summarize when passing from kcb act ndvi to kcb act radar variables r was decreased by 12 5 using ρ vv and more than 27 using pr and ρ vh for field 1 in contrast r is improved on field 2 using radar variables over ndvi with 24 using ρ vv and more than 18 using pr and ρ vh when corrected le values are considered the estimation of kcb act and etc act over field 1 and field 2 yielded the statistical metrics summarized in table a1 in the appendix the same approach as for raw le values is adopted 1 the relationships between kcb act and different remote sensing variables are first computed using data of field 1 s2 2 kcb act is estimated from these relationships and used to compute etc act the statistical metrics are close to those obtained with the raw data the best relationships with kcb act are obviously obtained with ndvi but using ρ vv also provided with acceptable metrics the main differences are related to higher biases leading to higher rmse mainly on field 1 while bias is lower on field 2 when using ndvi for a temporal inter comparison of the etc act estimated from different methods fig 8 presents the time series of etc act estimated over field 1 and field 2 for the two agricultural seasons considering raw le data the et0 the measured etc act rainfall and irrigation are also displayed results show good reproduction of the etc act time series especially using kcb act ndvi and kcb act ρ vv for the field 1 both seasons and field 2 season s1 for field 2 season s2 the presence of weed as well as the wind that laid down the high stems in april may be the reason for the low values obtained especially since the etc act estimated by the different methods is high this highlights the effect of different growing conditions for the same crop planted in the same soil in the same climate and with the same irrigation technique overall the studies that have used ndvi and other optical variables so far have been conducted on fields with similar crop characteristics the question of the generality of the relationships established to estimate kcb act is still raised in previously published work it has been reported that the effect of geometric properties plant structure and development on etc act varies not only between crops but also between varieties of the same crop araya et al 2011 campos et al 2017 pôças et al 2020 and thus may change if the crop is mixed with another type of vegetation such as adventices in our case by comparing the estimated etc act from the kcb act retrieved from different satellite data a slight underestimation is observed at the beginning of the season for the radar variables which is due to the low estimated kcb act compared to the ndvi that seems to estimate correctly the start of the season but then switches to a slight overestimation clearly visible in field 2 s1 this is in agreement with the results of french et al 2020 using kcb act estimated from sentinel 2 and venus dick et al 2022 ndvi where they found that the performance is less accurate during the first 60 days after sowing the authors who conducted their study at 7 different wheat fields in usa have reported accurate et estimates from mid season onwards the significant overestimation observed on field 2 fig 6 is illustrated in fig 3 even though field 2 during season s2 presents some specific growing conditions as already mentioned the estimated etc act is much higher than the et0 and this is due to the high kcb act values caused by high ndvi values as discussed earlier however many shortcomings are highlighted in the literature concerning ndvi even though it is widely used huete 1988 huete et al 2002 huete and liu 1994 pôças et al 2020 among ρ vv ρ vh and pr it appears that kcb act ρ vv provides better results for etc act estimation until senescence at this time of the season even though the change in cover structure has stopped and the water content of the vegetation is low water content is about 27 of total biomass in field 1 season 1 the coherence is generally still low due to the movement of scatters wheat components which leads to high kcb act values and consequently high etc act values this sensitivity of coherence to scatterers motion explains also the underestimation of etc act by ρ vv and ρ vh between 22 03 2018 and 06 04 2018 where an increase in ρ vv and ρ vh is observed fig 4 such anomalies could be avoided in future works by a simple smoothing 4 discussion so far the research and efforts in estimating kcb act have been focused only on using optical data this is mainly due to the intrinsic simplicity and ease of interpretation and understanding of these indices pôças et al 2020 that have made their use widespread for irrigation assessment in particular they can be used by technicians and farmers allen et al 2011 in addition they demonstrated good results in the estimation of etc act however the continuous availability of optical time series throughout the agricultural season is prevented by cloudy conditions this has led some researchers to seek alternative solutions for estimating vegetation indices when significant data gaps are presented one of the most prominent approaches has been the consideration of radar data to fill these gaps filgueiras et al 2019 our results in this study show encouraging prospects for using radar data instead of optical indices for etc act estimation yet it is also feasible to use the radar as a complement to the optics for instance sentinel 2 images for the period from 11 02 2017 02 04 2017 are not useful due to cloud cover therefore kcb act is estimated from ρ vv for this period and the rest is estimated from ndvi hereafter called hybrid kcb act fig 9 shows the estimated etc act from the hybrid kcb act for field 1 and field 2 for comparison the estimated etc act from kcb act ndvi kcb act ρ vv and the measured etc act are also shown in the figure the corresponding statistical metrics are presented in table 3 the results show an obvious improvement in the estimation of etc act using the hybrid kcb act where an improvement of 6 7 and 15 9 on field 1 and field 2 respectively in the correlation is obtained interestingly the bias is reduced by 63 6 on field 1 and the rmse and bias are reduced by 21 8 and 27 respectively on field 2 when using the hybrid kcb act the use of kcb act estimated from ρ vv for the cloudy period reduced the overestimation by the kcb act ndvi over field 2 clearly observed in the etc act time series between 05 02 and 15 03 in fig 9 in addition to a hybrid approach that uses the radar and optical variables separately it can be expected that combining both through multiple linear regression or machine learning algorithms would be a promising way to improve the estimation of kcb act however it is worth mentioning that radar data are relatively more complicated to process and interpret than optical data which can be a problem for direct applications by managers although these difficulties are decreasing thanks to the rapid evolution of electronic equipment and platforms that can process radar data on a large scale and make them available to users for example the cnes platform https peps cnes fr can now offer σ 0 maps on demand google earth engine also provides large scale products using free scripts found on the internet it is hoped that these efforts will increase and make the processed data easily available to users who are not primarily radar data specialists this work is the first step in its concept and further research is obviously required here the simple kcb act approach is used as a first step to check the accuracies and potential use of different radar variables the simple kcb act approach is generally preferred because it allows for rapid analysis and rough quantification of etc act with relatively moderate accuracy of vegetation water stress and soil evaporation on one hand it is an approach well suited for large scale agricultural water management for instance it can be used for irrigation scheduling by estimating kcb from the proposed approach and the water stress coefficient ks estimated typically from a water balance model such as the two layer soil budget of the fao 56 double coefficient approach however for operational irrigation management at large scale the estimation of ks from the water balance model is limited by the unavailability of irrigation data at the field scale over most irrigated areas as well as the difficulty in modeling the root zone soil moisture because of uncertain root depth and soil texture olivera guerra et al 2018 consequently several studies have assessed the potentialities of thermal infrared data to estimate ks e g ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 kullberg et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2018 on the other hand a better description of physical processes is beneficial our current work focuses on the partition of evaporation from the soil and the transpiration component this approach which is based on the resolution of the soil water balance should also be corrected using ks this application would be very interesting and compatible with the resolution of sentinels 1 and 2 with the upcoming availability of high spatio temporal resolution of thermal data with the launch of future missions such as hyspiri 2022 sentinel 8 2024 trishna 2025 and lstm 2028 the transferability of the obtained relationships between kcb act and remote sensing variables is a key issue the fao 56 been a very conceptual model the relationships between kcb act and ndvi as ndvi is the most commonly used variable to estimate kcb act in the literature are well known to be specific to the site region where they have been established this is because kcb act take into account all factors that make a specific crop different from the reference grass including development stage density geometry and health it also depends on climate and on agricultural practices as discussed in the introduction as such the domain of application of the kcb act relationships with radar variables presented in this study should be limited to wheat under similar semi arid climate and agricultural practices to extend the genericity of the method by developing relationships for other conditions a larger data base should be used from another perspective the study should be extended to include other annual crops such as tree crops where the seasonal evolution of ρ and σ 0 hence pr is limited frison et al 2018 also the investigation should be extended to other sites with different irrigation techniques such as flooding and sprinkling some studies have shown sensitivity of ρ to soil moisture such as morrison et al 2011 who demonstrated a relationship between ρ and soil moisture on bare soil in c band similarly de zan et al 2014 found a loss of ρ in response to increasing and decreasing soil moisture levels using l band data on bare fields for our database no significant sensitivity to soil moisture is observed details on ouaadi et al 2020 on one hand this could be related to the low fraction of wetted soil surface fw as the fields are drip irrigated fw 0 3 allen et al 1998 compared to other techniques such as flooding where fw is equal to 1 on the other hand it is most likely that in the presence of vegetation the effect of soil moisture is negligible compared to the decorelation or loss of ρ caused by the vegetation indeed moeremans and dautrebande 2000 reported that some ρ changes can be related to soil moisture variations on bare soils but these changes become negligible when the soil is vegetated similarly barrett et al 2012 found that the effect of soil moisture variation is suppressed by the predominant effect of vegetation particularly for c band which is sensitive to both soil and vegetation characteristics ulaby et al 1986 using c and l band data molan and lu 2020 also revealed that ρ is not related to changes in soil moisture over agricultural fields however it should be kept in mind that ρ is calculated in these studies as in ours with a minimum of 6 days between the two images baseline which is largely sufficient for agricultural cover to grow and in most cases weather conditions change which will be the main sources of ρ loss stated differently soil moisture could have an observable impact if ρ is calculated with a short baseline where the temporal development of vegetation is limited indeed the experiment conducted by albinet et al 2016 on a tree demonstrated that watering the tree leads to an abrupt decrease in ρ that requires between 30 min and 6 h depending on polarization to recover the previous level before watering from another perspective the results of albinet et al 2016 shows that the presence of water on the surface of vegetation components due to watering events such as artificial or natural rainfall or due to dew disrupts ρ this was highlighted in the tropical forest by hamadi et al 2014 the further investigation of these different circumstances is necessary for a better evaluation of the kcb act ρ relationships since the degradation of ρ will automatically induce a degradation of the kcb act ρ relationships in this context sub daily measurements of radar data over annual crops are needed to understand the impact of soil moisture on ρ an experiment is currently installed in morocco to measure ρ and σ 0 over a wheat field with a step of 15 min the data are being processed and will be used in our future work 5 conclusions this work seeks to evaluate the potential use of sar data to estimate the crop coefficient kcb act and crop evapotranspiration etc act the commonly used ndvi is also considered for comparison purposes the study was conducted over four agricultural seasons of irrigated winter wheat in morocco radar variables are estimated from the c band sentinel 1 sensor with a revisit time of 6 days and a resolution of 10 m the ndvi is derived from sentinel 2 with similar resolutions first the relationship between kcb act on one hand and pr ρ vv and ρ vh on the other hand is studied for the whole agricultural season second the relationships kcb act pr kcb act ρ vv kcb act ρ vh and kcb act ndvi are calibrated using an agricultural season and the derived relationships are used to estimate kcb act and etc act over the four seasons the outcomes of this study showed that the variables derived from the sar data can also be successfully used to estimate kcb act and etc act in particular etc act is estimated using kcb act ρ vv with an rmse 0 75 mm day which is close to the rmse obtained using kcb act ndvi rmse 0 65 mm day over field 1 in contrast rmse values have increased to 1 15 mm day versus 2 15 mm day using kcb act ρ vv and kcb act ndvi respectively on field 2 due to the specific growing conditions of this field with a high presence of adventices however based on our results the radar variables and in particular ρ vv demonstrates good performance and in particular a stability of the statistical metrics from one field and one season to another in the estimation of etc act over the two fields this opens new perspectives for robust and operational applications at large spatial scales especially in regions where optical data are inoperable or for crops grown in winter usually characterized by frequent cloudy conditions most importantly the shortcomings obtained for etc act estimation using radar data are at the end of the season a period that is not important for etc act applications and crop water requirement management since vegetation dries out at this time and irrigation is already stopped the results also show that radar can be used as a complement to optics in particular the use of kcb act derived from ρ vv during the period of unavailability of optical images improved the correlation coefficient of etc act estimate by 7 16 and reduced the bias by over 27 our study presents the first attempt at estimating kcb act and etc act from sar data but further work is required for additional validation of the results as well as for a better and deeper investigation of the behavior of the kcb act radar and kcb act optical variables relationships and their robustness in estimating etc act when the geometrical and physiological properties of the canopy change as for example the case presented by

8984,rationalizing the use of agricultural water is a key issue in semi arid areas that face more and more water shortages while food security is already threatened by the increasing population the fao 56 approach has been developed to estimate the crop water requirement it relies on an accurate estimation of the basal crop coefficient kcb act that has been shown to be closely related to ndvi nevertheless optical data can be inoperant in case of persistent cloud cover within this context the objective of this study is to assess the potentiality of the all weather c band sentinel 1 radar observations available with 6 day revisit time at the field scale to this end the empirical relationships between kcb act on one hand and the interferometric coherence at vv ρ vv and vh ρ vh polarizations and the polarization ratio on the other hand were assessed on two wheat fields during two crop seasons and compared to the classical kcb act ndvi method it is demonstrated that while good statistical metrics are obviously obtained between kcb act and ndvi derived from sentinel 2 r 0 77 0 88 and rmse 0 14 0 15 for field 1 field 2 close results are highlighted with radar data the best metrics are found with ρ vv r 0 76 and 0 77 and rmse 0 18 and 0 28 for field 1 and field 2 respectively using the calibrated relationships on one season of field 1 reasonable estimates of etc act was found on field 1 r 0 70 rmse 0 75 mm day and bias 0 18 mm days using kcb act ρ vv by contrast a significant overestimations is highlighted both with ρ vv bias 0 73 mm day and ndvi bias 1 46 mm day over field 2 interestingly the kcb act ρ vv relationship is more consistent in the estimation of etc act when changing from one plot to another these outcomes open new perspectives for the estimation of etc act from radar data as a potential substitute of ndvi in case of persistent cloud cover keywords basal crop coefficient interferometric coherence polarization ratio evapotranspiration wheat crop data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the global water demand is dominated by the irrigation sector that uses up to 90 of available water in semi arid catchments anapalli et al 2020 jarlan et al 2015 zhang et al 2017 a rationale and sustainable use of the already scarce water resources in this region is becoming essential anticipation and eﬃcient management of irrigation is also fundamental to ensure the global food security ipcc 2019 medecc 2020 this management is mainly based on the characterization of soil and vegetation water conditions that govern the use of water resources and this requires the estimation of crop water requirements which is represented by the evapotranspiration of the vegetation cover et the accurate estimation of et constitutes the focus of several applications starting from meteorology since et represents the process that transfers water from soil plant to atmosphere allen et al 2007 gibelin 2007 norman et al 1995 soer 1980 to agronomy where et defines the water requirements of the crop feng et al 2019 xiang et al 2020 yao et al 2020 et estimation can be done using in situ measurements such as the eddy covariance system and the lysimeters such techniques provide reliable estimates but they remain local and expensive to implement allen et al 2011 besides direct measurements et is computed using land surface models various types of models exist in the literature with a wide variety of theoretical background and required input variables and can be divided into models based on resolving the energy balance and or the water balance with different level of complexity ait hssaine et al 2021 2018 allen et al 2011 annandale et al 1999 bigeard et al 2019 courault et al 2005 diarra et al 2017 elfarkh et al 2022 jarlan et al 2021 subedi and chávez 2015 zhang et al 2016 the fao 56 approach is a widely deployed model in the operational tools for irrigation management because it is easy to implement through a limited number of inputs allen et al 1998 it was applied for several type of vegetation and has demonstrated accurate estimation over a wide range of climate and growth conditions around the world duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 pereira et al 2021 it consists in multiplying the reference evapotranspiration et0 of a well irrigated grass derived from simple meteorological variables by an empirical coefficient called the crop coefficient kc that reflects the actual condition of the considered plant under this form the determination of kc is sufficient to obtain an estimate of the amount of water needed by the plant to preserve a good yield while avoiding waste of water pereira et al 2021 kc varies throughout the agricultural season because of the phenological stages specific water demand and the changes of the aerodynamic and the surface resistances allen et al 2011 pereira et al 2021 for annual crops kc is assumed to have a trapezoidal shape with four linear segments representing four main growing stages and subsequently three kc values are required to obtain the whole growing season evolution fao 56 paper provides a large database of these values for a wide range of crops and climates however previous work has demonstrated strong discrepancies between locally measured and the fao tabulated values anapalli et al 2020 er raki et al 2013 howell et al 1995 irmak et al 2013 lópez urrea et al 2016 pereira et al 2021 sánchez et al 2015 indeed kc is highly affected by several factors such as irrigation technique crop cover fraction agricultural practices length of the growing season and local climate kc values and the duration of the different growth stages should thus be adjusted to reflect the actual condition of the considered crop allen et al 1998 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 er raki et al 2008 pôças et al 2020 because local calibration of kc requires costly and time consuming installations remote sensing and in particular vegetation indices derived from optical data have been considered to exploit the high sensitivity of kc to the vegetation cover fraction and to the leaf area index lai since the 1980s bausch and neale 1987 diarra et al 2017 er raki et al 2013 wiegand et al 1991 several vegetation indices have been assessed see pôças et al 2020 for a review but the most widely used remains the ndvi duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2013 french et al 2020 glenn et al 2011 hunsaker et al 2005 pereira et al 2021 pôças et al 2020 experience has shown that there is no general scientific framework that defines the nature of the relationship between kc and ndvi as both linear bausch 1993 duchemin et al 2006 gontia and tiwari 2010 hunsaker et al 2003 kamble et al 2013 and non linear relationships alam et al 2018 er raki et al 2013 pôças et al 2020 have been established several operational tools based on kc ndvi relationships have already been developed so far the satellite monitoring of irrigation samir a software package developed to estimate et and spatialized irrigation water budget over large areas le page et al 2014 simonneaux et al 2009 that is part of the modspa modeling platform developed at cesbio http osr cesbio ups tlse fr satirr the satirr tool for irrigation scheduling at the field scale pôças et al 2020 also provided a number of websites for kc mapping over several countries to support irrigation management while good estimates of evapotranspiration where obtained based on these kc ndvi relationships optical data may be hampered by atmospheric conditions leading to images unavailability during long periods that could be problematic in cloudy regions or for winter crop monitoring indeed the swot analysis strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats of the fao 56 approach developed by pôças et al 2020 has clearly highlighted cloud cover as a threat to the application of the method when optical indices are used to derive kc within this context the main objective of this work is to assess the potentialities of all weather c band radar data as a substitute to vegetation indices for kc estimates from optical remote sensing over the last decade radar or sar for synthetic aperture radar data have become increasingly used for vegetation monitoring at the field scale mainly with the launch of the satellites sentinel 1a in 2014 and 1b in 2016 as the main driver although c band radar signals wavelengths between 3 75 and 7 5 cm provide a complex mix of ground and vegetation contributions several authors have proposed variables derived from the signal intensity and phase that can be directly related to vegetation variables such as biomass crop height and cover fraction gherboudj et al 2011 greifeneder et al 2018 jacome et al 2013 li and wang 2018 mattia et al 2003 ouaadi et al 2020 2021a srivastava et al 2015 veloso et al 2017 in particular while the radar backscattering coefficient σ 0 a measure of the backscattered signal intensity is sensitive to both soil and vegetation variables the polarization ratio pr σ vh 0 σ vv 0 where σ vh 0 and σ vv 0 stand for the backscattering coefficient at cross vh and co vv polarization respectively was introduced to reduce the effects of soil and soil vegetation interaction indeed the pr has been shown to be more stable in time than the backscattering coefficient and follows the evolution of biomass during the agricultural season ouaadi et al 2021a veloso et al 2017 this ratio is recently used by chintala et al 2022 to estimate kc over rice sugarcane and vegetables their investigation was directed towards establishing a linear relationship between kc and pr but poor correlations were obtained correlations range from 0 01 to 0 31 beside the signal intensity the phase information acquired by radar sensors has also been shown to be related to the crop cycle through the interferometric coherence ρ ρ is a measure of the phase stability it can be computed between i two images taken by two antennas simultaneously from two different angles that overlook the same scene or ii two images acquired by the same sensor over an orbit with exact repetition but taken at different times coltelli et al 1996 such as for sentinel 1 data frison and lardeux 2018 if the characteristics of the scatterers including both geometric at the scale of the radar wavelength and dielectric properties within the image does not change ρ is equal to 1 while if the characteristics changes between two acquisitions a drastic drop of ρ can be observed in particular for crops vegetation growth and movement of the scatterers due to weather conditions such as wind and rain systematically causes ρ to drop frison et al 2018 with the high temporal repetitivity provided by sentinel 1 6 days research has been conducted to investigate and understand the behavior of ρ over annual crops based on the encouraging results of some early studies blaes and defourny 2003 engdahl et al 2001 wegmuller and werner 1997 in particular ρ has been used as complementary information to optical data for crop mapping and classification busquier et al 2020 mattia et al 2015 mestre quereda et al 2020 in addition strong relationships were recently highlighted between ρ and several vegetation variables namely biomass leaf area index crop height and cover fraction by ouaadi et al 2020 2021a within this context the objective of this work is to assess the potential of radar observations to estimate the fao 56 crop coefficient as a surrogate to the classically used ndvi derived from optical data to this end two variables derived from sentinel 1 data are investigated namely pr and ρ at vv and vh polarizations the study is carried out over 4 winter wheat seasons in morocco the following section presents the study site and the experimental data section 3 deals with the presentation of the results and it is organized as follows 1 the time series of kc derived from the eddy covariance system for the four seasons are presented 2 the relationships between kc and the radar variables are investigated and compared to kc ndvi relationship 3 the calibration and validation of the kc retrieved from the different variables are evaluated 4 the et derived from the estimated kc over the four seasons is discussed the last section is devoted to drawing conclusions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area is located on a private farm in west central morocco in the marrakech safi region in one of the most important agricultural plains of the country named the haouz plain fig 1 characterized by a semi arid climate the air temperature is variable throughout the year ranging from a hot summer with a daily average of about 35 c in july august to a cold winter with an average of 5 c in january abourida et al 2008 the average air humidity is about 50 and the reference evapotranspiration et0 is about 1600 mm year jarlan et al 2015 which far exceeds the annual precipitation amount of 250 mm year on average cereals mainly wheat represent the major portion of the irrigated and non irrigated agricultural production of the plain they are sown in winter when 85 of the rainfall falls between october and april this study is conducted on two winter wheat fields monitored during two consecutive crop seasons 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 fig 1 illustrates the location of the fields in the haouz plain the soil texture is a mixture of 37 5 clay and 32 5 sand the fields are drip irrigated and cover an area of 1 5 ha each sown and harvested on the same dates for the two monitored 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons the agricultural season starts with the sowing of wheat in late november 27 11 2016 and 25 11 2017 until the harvest on 16 05 2017 and 08 06 2018 respectively the fields are sown by the karim variety using an automatic seed drill with a distance of 15 cm between the sowing lines in the 2016 2017 season a stem density campaign conducted on march 28th resulted of an average of 416 and 504 stems m2 over field 1 and field 2 respectively unfortunately the accurate value of the field density is not determined for the 2017 2018 season but the same tools were used for seeding resulting probably in seed densities of the same order of value an estimation of the main crop growth stages starting dates reported during the field campaigns from visual inspection are provided in table 1 the gdd growing degree days corresponding to these dates is also provided in c for the sake of information calculated by accumulation of daily average temperatures the fields are irrigated at a rate of 12 5 mm per event and the irrigation scheduling and amounts are recorded ouaadi et al 2021b 2 2 in situ measurements weather and eddy covariance stations in the vicinity of the study sites a weather station was installed over an irrigated alfalfa field fig 1 the station allow a half hourly measurements of precipitations and other meteorological variables used for estimating reference evapotranspiration et0 namely solar radiation wind speed and air temperature and relative humidity meteorological data were quality controlled to detect outliers following boudhar 2009 chaponnière et al 2008 and simonneaux et al 2008 to estimate continuous measurements of the actual crop evapotranspiration etc act two similar eddy covariance stations campbell scientific ltd are installed at 2 58 m high in the center of each field as shown in fig 1 each station is composed of a csat3 3d sonic anemometer and a kh2o krypton hygrometer allowing the measurement of the three components of wind speed and the rapid fluctuations of atmospheric water vapor respectively the sampled raw data at 20 hz rate are used to calculate the half hourly sensible h and latent heat le fluxes using the ecpack software to apply all required corrections for planar fit correction humidity and oxygen kh20 frequency response for slow apparatus and path length integration ait hssaine et al 2018 rafi et al 2019 van dijk et al 2004 the measurements are representative of the field to ensure that the flux contribution measured by the station is within the field the calculation conducted for the study site conditions shows that 95 of the flux information came from 50 32 5 m long x wide for a mean wind speed of 1 95 m s and a wind direction of 58 rafi et al 2019 finally the daily evapotranspiration mm day is obtained by cumulating the 48 daily values of le measurements excluding the negative values and then converting from w m2 to mm day the stations are also equipped with kipp and zonen cnr radiometers to measure the net radiation rn and two hft3 l heat flux plates installed at 5 cm depth to measure the soil heat flux g is computed by a simple average considering each field and season separately the energy balance closure is acceptable the correlation coefficient ranges between 0 70 and 0 81 while the slope of the linear regression between rn g and h le is between 0 47 and 0 56 these statistical metrics are within the range found in the literature in particular concerning the slope see elfarkh et al 2020 liu et al 2011 wilson et al 2002 among others the lack of closure of eddy covariance measurements was largely discussed in the literature and could be related to a combination of several factors see allen et al 2011 including i the attenuation of turbulent signals at sufficiently low or high frequencies moore 1986 ii the source area of the rn and g sensors that measure the available energy is very small compared to that of the eddy covariance system which can be changed rapidly depending on wind speed and direction and surface conditions iii the energy storage either in the vegetation scott et al 2003 or in the layer between surface and the heat flux plate measurements that is not considered in the energy balance closure meyers et al 2004 iv the time shift between the irradiation and the turbulent fluxes that can reach up to 30 min foken et al 2001 2006 the modeling studies most commonly force the closing of the surface energy balance to correct the systematic under estimation of turbulent fluxes measurements in particular because the energy balance is closed for the land surface models the most extensively used method for this purpose is the bowen ratio approach twine et al 2000 this method is closing the energy balance by scaling h and le so that the sum equals rn g considering the low value of the energy balance closure both raw le data i e without correction and le values corrected by the bowen ration approach are considered in this study more details on this data base including meteorological and eddy covariance data can be found in ait hssaine et al 2018 2020 and rafi et al 2019 and part of the data set has been made available to the scientific community ouaadi et al 2021a fig 2 displays the time series of the raw measured etc act and computed et0 see section 2 3 over the two fields for the sake of simplicity the 2016 2017 season is designated by s1 and the 2017 2018 season by s2 the difference between et0 and etc act is significant during the growing season characterizing the high climatic demand of the semi arid region et0 is higher in s1 than in s2 because of wetter conditions in the second season where the amount of rainfall recorded from sowing to harvest is 167 mm versus 70 mm during season s2 and season s1 respectively ouaadi et al 2021a the general trend is an increase during the agricultural season with minimum values occurring in december and january around 2 mm day this period corresponds to the start of the season et0 is higher than etc act because most of etc act comes from soil evaporation since canopy cover is very low allen et al 1998 whereas et0 is the et of a well developed grass and will therefore use more water for transpiration araya et al 2011 the etc act starts to increase with the development of the canopy with an average increase of 3 mm day from the beginning of the season to full development in addition to the higher seed density on field 2 compared to field 1 irrigation was stopped from 27 02 2017 to 14 03 2017 on field 1 which led to a lower etc act of 2 5 mm day on this field compared to field 2 moreover etc act reached a maximum of 4 5 mm day on field 1 while the maximum on field 2 is about 6 mm day the wetter 2017 2018 season contributed to the increase of the etc act of field 1 to reach higher values than the first season and joined the et0 level in the mid season stage for field 2 season s2 was affected by a particular growing condition explained with more details in ouaadi et al 2021a the presence of dense weed in the field as well as strong winds that laid down the high stems in april may be the reason for the low values observed of etc act etc act decreases obviously at the end of the season from the senescence phase onwards as the vegetation and the underlying soil dry out 2 3 actual single and basal crop coefficients the reference evapotranspiration et 0 is the evapotranspiration from a well watered grass that totally cover the soil with a uniform height of 0 12 m albedo of 0 23 and a surface resistance of 70 s m it is a climatic variable that account only for the evaporating power of the atmosphere according to the fao 56 guidelines et 0 is computed from the meteorological forcing using the penman monteith equation 1 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where r n mj m2 day is the net radiation at the crop surface and g mj m2 day is the conductive flux in the soil u 2 m s is the wind speed at 2 m above the ground t c is the averaged air temperature at 2 m γ kpa c is the psychrometric constant e s kpa and e a kpa are the saturation and actual vapor pressures at 2 m respectively g is assumed to be equal to 0 for daily calculation while the other variables are computed using the daily meteorological forcing as in allen et al 1998 the crop evapotranspiration et c act is computed as introduced in the paper 56 of the fao by allen et al 1998 2 et c act k c act et 0 where kc act is the crop coefficient that account for the soil evaporation plant transpiration and the effect of water stress via three coefficients 3 k c act k s k cb act k e where k s is the water stress coefficient k cb act is the basal crop coefficient and k e the evaporation coefficient this study focuses on the estimation of kcb act and etc act to do so the following steps are implemented i the ratio of etc act measurements to the et0 resulting in the crop coefficient kc act has been filtered from high evaporation and water stressed data so that the remaining data correspond to ke 0 and ks 1 and therefore approximate the basal crop coefficient kc act kcb act the method is adapted from duchemin et al 2006 first an initial cleaning of the database was performed by eliminating days corresponding to watering events irrigation and precipitation as these generally correspond to an abrupt increase in kc act in response to increased evaporation torres and calera 2010 specific concern is given thereafter to the beginning of the season since the soil is bare and consequently kc act is dominated by ke when an irrigation precipitation event occurs for this period corresponds to a cover fraction 0 2 the 4 days following the watering event are eliminated from the data base duchemin et al 2006 later in the season ke is assumed to be neglected compared to kcb act as the vegetation is well developed and covers the soil allen et al 1998 duchemin et al 2006 the effect of water stress can also affect the computation of the crop coefficient kcb act during the period of full development pôças et al 2020 the water stressed data are characterized by a drop of kc act duchemin et al 2006 in this study the data lower than one standard deviation of the mid season period data average is discarded by this point we assume that the remaining data correspond to kc act kcb act ii the relationships between kcb act from one hand and ρ vv ρ vh pr and ndvi from the other hand are investigated for both fields and both seasons iii relationships are first established using data from 2017 2018 season s1 over field 1 and then used to derive kcb act and consequently etc act over the other seasons fields 2 4 satellite data 2 4 1 sentinel 1 data sentinel 1 is a constellation composed of two satellites sentinel 1a launched in 2014 and sentinel 1b launched in 2016 each satellite is equipped with a c band sar sensor with a frequency of 5 33 ghz the two satellites map the entire world in 175 orbits with a revisit time of six days torres et al 2012 the operational mode iw interferometric wide swath mode allows the acquisition of data in dual polarization vv and vh with an azimuth resolution of 20 m and a ground range resolution of 5 m european space agency 2012 the sentinel 1 data hub website https scihub copernicus eu gives free access to two types of products i slc products single look complex which are raw images that contain the radar measurement as a complex number and ii grdh products ground range detected high resolution which are multi looked to reduce the speckle and projected to ground range to have square pixels that contains only a measurement of the intensity of the measured signal the descending relative orbit number 52 maps the study area at 06 30 utc with an incidence angle of about 35 2 over both fields grd and slc products are used to compute the backscattering coefficient and the interferometric coherence respectively as described in the following sections the data availability is illustrated in fig a1 in the appendix please note that the relationships between radar and vegetation variables are not shown in this paper as they have been already studied in detail in ouaadi et al 2021a the reader is invited to consult this reference for more details on these relationships during the agricultural season 2 4 1 1 backscattering coefficient the backscattering coefficient is computed from the grdh products using the orfeo toolbox cnes 2018 with a processing chain that consists of three modules applied to each image for each polarization frison and lardeux 2018 thermal noise removal calibration and terrain correction the last aims to project the images on the surface of the earth using the digital terrain model srtm shuttle radar topography mission at 30 m resolution the obtained products are the backscattering coefficient at vv σ vv 0 and vh σ vh 0 with a spatial resolution of 10 m finally the radar backscattering coefficient is obtained from averaging all the pixels values within a field details of the processing steps are provided in ouaadi et al 2021a the polarization ratio pr is calculated as the ratio between σ vh 0 and σ vv 0 and then converted to db for a better visualization of the data dynamics 2 4 1 2 interferometric coherence the interferometric coherence ρ is a complementary information to σ 0 and well correlated with vegetation development since it contains the phase information the slc products allows computing ρ by exploiting the repeated orbits of sentinel 1 6 days between two consecutive acquisitions using sentinel 1 a and b of the same orbit the combination of the two successive images allows measuring the change occurred to the scene between these two dates the result is a scalar ranging between 0 when there is no correlation between the two images and 1 when the correlation is perfect over an agricultural area the main cause of ρ decrease is the temporal decorelation caused by the change in orientation size and position of the scatterers canopy components indeed it was found that the coherence is almost constant at high values 0 9 at vv in summer when the soil is bare ouaadi et al 2020 while the natural movement of vegetation components leaves stems under the effect of wind and rainfall in addition to the change caused by the growth of vegetation induce a gradual decrease in ρ to reach levels down to 0 2 during the agricultural season it is worth mentioning that soil moisture change has also been shown to impact ρ in some cases de zan et al 2014 morrison et al 2011 scott et al 2017 and does not highlight high impact on others ouaadi et al 2020 the sentinel snap application platform is used to calculate the interferometric coherence at vv ρ vv and vh ρ vh based on a five steps processing chain apply orbit file back geocoding coherence topsar deburst and terrain correction as for σ 0 ρ is obtained from averaging all the pixel values within a plot for more details on the processing chain the reader is referred to ouaadi et al 2021a 2 4 2 sentinel 2 ndvi the sentinel 2 is an optical constellation of two satellites sentinel 2a launched on 2015 and sentinel 2b launched on 2017 providing data on 13 spectral bands in the visible near and medium infrared domains with a spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m and a revisit time of 5 days over the study area the data are atmospherically corrected using the maja chain developed at cesbio hagolle et al 2015 the products are freely distributed by the national centre for space studies cnes via two platforms peps https peps cnes fr and theia https theia cnes fr among the 45 available images over the two agricultural seasons only 28 are free of clouds less than 30 of clouds over the study area see data availability in fig a1 in the appendix the 28 images are downloaded and processed to extract the ndvi using the red and near infrared bands bands 4 and 8 and finally an average per field is computed 3 results the first section is devoted to crop coefficients analysis over the agricultural season the second section is dedicated to the investigation of the relationships between kcb act and remote sensing variables finally the third section is dealing with the estimation of kcb act and etc act the raw le data are used but the results of kcb act and etc act estimation with corrected le are also reported 3 1 time series of the crop coefficients fig 3 displays the time series of the crop coefficient obtained from the measured etc act over the two fields during the two seasons s1 and s2 sowing and harvest dates for each season are marked with arrows in the figure for the season s1 data are available only from january 9 the kc act shape is a trapezoidal shape with low values at the start of the season when the soil is almost bare increasing values during the development stage a plateau of maximum values during the full development and then the kc act decreases progressively at the end of the season with the senescence of the vegetation the first values of kc act around the sowing dates are very low probably because the soil is almost dry at this time thereafter kc act can reach high values in response to high evaporation i e the red points in fig 3 because of rainfall and frequent irrigation see fig 2 for rainfall and irrigation distribution applied by the farmer to accelerate wheat emergence and development ouaadi et al 2021b likewise the kc act values corresponding to water stress during the period of full development are presented in black the red and black points are removed and it is assumed that the remaining data correspond to ks 1 and ke 0 and therefore kc act kcb act considering the mean value for each stage initial kcb init mid season kcb mid and late season kcb end the kcb act segmented curve is constructed magenta curve in fig 3 for each field and each season for comparison purposes the kcb curve obtained using fao 56 tabulated values with crop stages duration adjusted based on the field observations and ndvi cycle is also displayed in black in fig 3 table 2 reports the default fao 56 and adjusted lengths of the crop growth stages initial linit crop development ldev mid season lmid and late season llate significant discrepancies are observed between the tabulated fao 56 values and the adjusted values for the fields this highlights the need for local calibration of fao 56 as reported by many authors er raki et al 2008 pôças et al 2020 among others see introduction a value of kcb init 0 15 is given in fao 56 assuming that there is always some moisture in the soil while in this study kcb init is 0 07 probably because the tilling is not deep and the soil surface is very dry surface soil moisture average 0 03 m3 m3 on 27 11 2017 over both fields this is also the reason why the obtained kcb at the end of the season about 0 1 0 17 is lower than the fao 56 value 0 23 for mid season period fao 56 kcb mid is equal to 0 9 which is close to the kcb mid obtained over field 1 during season s2 while the values obtained are lower for field 2 and field 1 s1 this is related to the combined effect of the meteorological conditions with cropping system and vegetation physiological properties see the introduction section indeed the average of kcb act reached at mid season is different between the fields during season s1 the average kcb mid for both fields are close with 0 7 over field 1 and 0 6 over field 2 by contrast noticeable differences between the two fields are observed during season s2 with significantly lower values of kcb mid on field 2 the higher kcb mid over field 1 during s2 compared to s1 could be attributed to the wetter conditions of the 2017 2018 growing season compared to the 2016 2017 season resulting in much more vegetation as illustrated by the difference in the amount of biomass between the two seasons presented in ouaadi et al 2021a on the other hand the low values of kcb mid on field 2 are probably the result of the particular growing conditions of this field during s2 with a mixture of barley and wheat in addition to the high presence of adventices see above indeed etc act is highly affected by the specific canopy characteristics geometric and physiological such as the leaf arrangement the height of the vegetation and stomata properties araya et al 2011 the time series of pr ρ vv ρ vh and ndvi over the four growing seasons are presented in fig 4 the evolution of these variables illustrates a seasonal evolution following the development of wheat early in the season the values are low high and start to increase decrease with the development of the vegetation until a maximum minimum value is reached in full development for ndvi pr and interferometric coherences respectively with the onset of senescence a progressive decreasing increasing trend is observed until harvest it can be pointed out that for low values of ρ 0 4 corresponding to full development of vegetation ρ vv and ρ vh are quite identical however for high values 0 4 corresponding to low vegetation i e when vegetation is at early stage of development or during senescence ρ vv ρ vh traducing the higher sensitivity of vh polarization to small amounts of vegetation it should be kept in mind however that high values of the interferometric coherence 0 5 are more significant than the low values that are contaminated by noise 3 2 relationships between kcb act and satellite variables the relationships between kcb act and the different radar data including pr ρ vv and ρ vh with the same x axis scale 0 15 0 7 for ρ vv and ρ vh are presented in fig 5 for field 1 and field 2 the relationship between kcb act and ndvi is also displayed to compare the performance of the radar variables with this commonly used optical index using the complete wheat cycle from sowing to harvest the best fit is found to be exponential between kcb act and all the satellite variables the regression equation r and rmse calculated between the predicted variable using the fitted relationship in red and the observations are displayed in each subplot results show that the best fitting is obtained between kcb act and ρ vv hereafter named kcb act ρ vv and between kcb act and ndvi kcb act ndvi regarding data from both fields in contrast the relationships are more scattered using ρ vh kcb act ρ vh and pr kcb act pr the problem is due to a significant dispersion of the data in particular during the transition phase between the low high plateaus values see fig 4 pr was introduced to describe vegetation development while reducing the effect of soil variables on the backscattered signal yet it seems to contain some of these effects this may be related to a combined effect of wheat geometry and soil drying after heading σ vh 0 is still high because of the volume contribution from the head layer while σ vv 0 is low and quite constant as the soil is dry consequently the pr remained high late in the season the weak relationship with ρ vh is not surprising due to the low overall values 0 4 which are less significant than ρ vv 0 65 this is due to the highest sensitivity of vh polarization to low vegetation leading to lowest coherence values at vh fig 4 it is the reason why better relationship is observed for ρ vv which show an amplitude of 0 45 0 2 ρ vv 0 65 it is interesting to note that ρ vh and ρ vv when 0 35 are less scattered for field 2 than for field 1 indeed kcb act is more scattered on field 1 in particular around mid season when ρ vh is at its lowest level ρ vh 0 33 in general the statistical metrics using the radar variables are better for field 2 than for field 1 because of the scattering of kcb act around mid season fig 3 in contrast the best metrics are obtained on field 1 for kcb act ndvi which are also the best metrics obtained for the 8 subplots investigated in this study with an rmse limited to 0 15 this kcb act ndvi relationship is compared to similar relationships previously published 1 duchemin et al 2006 have used a linear relationship k cb act 1 64 ndvi 0 14 2 hunsaker et al 2005 have fitted kcb act to ndvi using a third order regression model k cb act 0 18 1 63 ndvi n 2 57 ndvi n 2 1 93 ndvi n 3 with ndvi n ndvi ndvi min ndvi max ndvi min 3 er raki et al 2007 derived kcb act from ndvi using an exponential relationship k cb act 1 07 1 ndvi m 0 84 0 54 with ndvi m ndvi max ndvi ndvi max ndvi min fig a2 displays our observations and the different relationships including ours in red over field 1 the different relationships provide with quite close results the closest being provided by duchemin et al 2006 for wheat fields also grown in the tensift catchment near marrakech with similar climate conditions considering all the results of this study kcb act ndvi provides good performance but the statistics of kcb act ρ vv comparable with those of kcb act ndvi are also promising 3 3 kcb act and crop evapotranspiration estimation in this section kcb act is estimated from different kcb act satellite variables relationships and then the estimated kcb act is used to calculate the etc act first the data from one season field 1 season s2 was chosen to calibrate the 4 relationships using the four variables pr ρ vv ρ vh and ndvi this relationship is then used to estimate kcb act over all fields seasons this season is chosen because the 2016 2017 season is not complete as previously mentioned the results obtained are presented in fig 6 for both fields and both seasons as expected the best results are obtained with kcb act ndvi and kcb act ρ vv over field 1 the retrieved kcb act from radar data is limited to almost 1 because of the quick saturation of the c band data while the kcb act ndvi can reach up to 1 2 and thus reproduce well the kcb act this advantage is reflected on the good statics on this field with r 0 88 slope 0 91 rmse 0 16 and a bias limited to 0 02 however this can also be a drawback from another point of view obviously when the canopy is very dense and consists of a mixture of several vegetation types as is the case in field 2 on this field a significant overestimation up to kcb act 2 is observed with a reduction in statistical metrics to r 0 70 slope 1 66 rmse 0 52 and bias 0 35 this can be explained by fig 4 and fig 3 where ndvi is higher in field 2 than in field 1 while kcb act is lower in field 2 than in field 1 in fact the low kcb act values are obviously due to the lower etc act of season s1 of field 2 compared to field 1 this is due to the presence of adventices with two possible scenarios i adventices do not transpire much which leads to a reduction in etc act ii adventices lead to a reduction in soil evaporation as they cover the entire soil indeed the measured canopy cover fc not shown shows high values since the beginning of the season where fc has reached 0 9 on 31 01 2018 on field 2 versus 0 7 on field 1 and had only reached 0 9 52 days later 13 03 2018 in contrast the higher cover fraction of green vegetation adventices and wheat is obviously driven at a much higher ndvi than field 1 and thus kcb act is overestimated in contrast similar statistical metrics are obtained between field 1 and field 2 using the radar variables the statistical metrics of kcb act ρ vv are lower than kcb act ndvi for field 1 but they are better for field 2 in addition kcb act ρ vv demonstrates a more stable performance between the two fields where r 0 76 and 0 77 for field 1 and field 2 respectively nevertheless the bias is higher for field 2 indicating a slight overestimation y intercept 0 44 this was mainly attributed to the end of the season when the estimated kcb act does not decrease enough to reach the lowest measured kcb act values not shown the kcb act ρ vh and kcb act pr provides with less accurate estimates with a better performance on field 2 due to a lower scattering of kcb act on this field as discussed in the previous section fig 5 using the estimated kcb act the etc act is then calculated and the results obtained for both fields are presented in fig 7 the outcomes with kcb act ndvi and kcb act ρ vv are encouraging because of the good estimates of kcb act fig 6 consequently similar comments can be drawn the kcb act ndvi has yielded very good estimate of etc act over field 1 with r 0 80 and rmse 0 65 mm day for etc act values up to 4 5 mm day as expected the performance drops to r 0 53 and bias 1 46 mm day over field 2 and the rmse increased from 0 65 to 2 15 mm day due to the overestimation of kcb act knowing that the maximum etc act is around 6 mm day on field 2 the stable estimate of kcb act by the kcb act ρ vv is reflected in the etc act estimation metrics where r is equal to 0 7 for both fields however the overestimation of kcb act at the end of the season led to a higher rmse on field 2 1 15 mm day on field 2 versus 0 75 mm day on field 1 interestingly enough kcb act pr and kcb act ρ vh methods provided with similar metrics as kcb act ndvi and kcb act ρ vv in estimating etc act even that the relationships used to estimate kcb act are of poor quality see fig 5 for kcb act pr and kcb act ρ vh relationships for instance kcb act pr provided an estimate of etc act with r 0 63 slope 0 89 rmse 1 02 mm day and bias 0 38 mm day over field 2 this is probably related to the quasi absence of water stressed period that could lead to strong discrepancies between etc act and et0 on these irrigated fields within these conditions the inter daily dynamics of etc act is mainly governed by et0 explaining the acceptable correlation coefficients for all the methods assessed in this study to summarize when passing from kcb act ndvi to kcb act radar variables r was decreased by 12 5 using ρ vv and more than 27 using pr and ρ vh for field 1 in contrast r is improved on field 2 using radar variables over ndvi with 24 using ρ vv and more than 18 using pr and ρ vh when corrected le values are considered the estimation of kcb act and etc act over field 1 and field 2 yielded the statistical metrics summarized in table a1 in the appendix the same approach as for raw le values is adopted 1 the relationships between kcb act and different remote sensing variables are first computed using data of field 1 s2 2 kcb act is estimated from these relationships and used to compute etc act the statistical metrics are close to those obtained with the raw data the best relationships with kcb act are obviously obtained with ndvi but using ρ vv also provided with acceptable metrics the main differences are related to higher biases leading to higher rmse mainly on field 1 while bias is lower on field 2 when using ndvi for a temporal inter comparison of the etc act estimated from different methods fig 8 presents the time series of etc act estimated over field 1 and field 2 for the two agricultural seasons considering raw le data the et0 the measured etc act rainfall and irrigation are also displayed results show good reproduction of the etc act time series especially using kcb act ndvi and kcb act ρ vv for the field 1 both seasons and field 2 season s1 for field 2 season s2 the presence of weed as well as the wind that laid down the high stems in april may be the reason for the low values obtained especially since the etc act estimated by the different methods is high this highlights the effect of different growing conditions for the same crop planted in the same soil in the same climate and with the same irrigation technique overall the studies that have used ndvi and other optical variables so far have been conducted on fields with similar crop characteristics the question of the generality of the relationships established to estimate kcb act is still raised in previously published work it has been reported that the effect of geometric properties plant structure and development on etc act varies not only between crops but also between varieties of the same crop araya et al 2011 campos et al 2017 pôças et al 2020 and thus may change if the crop is mixed with another type of vegetation such as adventices in our case by comparing the estimated etc act from the kcb act retrieved from different satellite data a slight underestimation is observed at the beginning of the season for the radar variables which is due to the low estimated kcb act compared to the ndvi that seems to estimate correctly the start of the season but then switches to a slight overestimation clearly visible in field 2 s1 this is in agreement with the results of french et al 2020 using kcb act estimated from sentinel 2 and venus dick et al 2022 ndvi where they found that the performance is less accurate during the first 60 days after sowing the authors who conducted their study at 7 different wheat fields in usa have reported accurate et estimates from mid season onwards the significant overestimation observed on field 2 fig 6 is illustrated in fig 3 even though field 2 during season s2 presents some specific growing conditions as already mentioned the estimated etc act is much higher than the et0 and this is due to the high kcb act values caused by high ndvi values as discussed earlier however many shortcomings are highlighted in the literature concerning ndvi even though it is widely used huete 1988 huete et al 2002 huete and liu 1994 pôças et al 2020 among ρ vv ρ vh and pr it appears that kcb act ρ vv provides better results for etc act estimation until senescence at this time of the season even though the change in cover structure has stopped and the water content of the vegetation is low water content is about 27 of total biomass in field 1 season 1 the coherence is generally still low due to the movement of scatters wheat components which leads to high kcb act values and consequently high etc act values this sensitivity of coherence to scatterers motion explains also the underestimation of etc act by ρ vv and ρ vh between 22 03 2018 and 06 04 2018 where an increase in ρ vv and ρ vh is observed fig 4 such anomalies could be avoided in future works by a simple smoothing 4 discussion so far the research and efforts in estimating kcb act have been focused only on using optical data this is mainly due to the intrinsic simplicity and ease of interpretation and understanding of these indices pôças et al 2020 that have made their use widespread for irrigation assessment in particular they can be used by technicians and farmers allen et al 2011 in addition they demonstrated good results in the estimation of etc act however the continuous availability of optical time series throughout the agricultural season is prevented by cloudy conditions this has led some researchers to seek alternative solutions for estimating vegetation indices when significant data gaps are presented one of the most prominent approaches has been the consideration of radar data to fill these gaps filgueiras et al 2019 our results in this study show encouraging prospects for using radar data instead of optical indices for etc act estimation yet it is also feasible to use the radar as a complement to the optics for instance sentinel 2 images for the period from 11 02 2017 02 04 2017 are not useful due to cloud cover therefore kcb act is estimated from ρ vv for this period and the rest is estimated from ndvi hereafter called hybrid kcb act fig 9 shows the estimated etc act from the hybrid kcb act for field 1 and field 2 for comparison the estimated etc act from kcb act ndvi kcb act ρ vv and the measured etc act are also shown in the figure the corresponding statistical metrics are presented in table 3 the results show an obvious improvement in the estimation of etc act using the hybrid kcb act where an improvement of 6 7 and 15 9 on field 1 and field 2 respectively in the correlation is obtained interestingly the bias is reduced by 63 6 on field 1 and the rmse and bias are reduced by 21 8 and 27 respectively on field 2 when using the hybrid kcb act the use of kcb act estimated from ρ vv for the cloudy period reduced the overestimation by the kcb act ndvi over field 2 clearly observed in the etc act time series between 05 02 and 15 03 in fig 9 in addition to a hybrid approach that uses the radar and optical variables separately it can be expected that combining both through multiple linear regression or machine learning algorithms would be a promising way to improve the estimation of kcb act however it is worth mentioning that radar data are relatively more complicated to process and interpret than optical data which can be a problem for direct applications by managers although these difficulties are decreasing thanks to the rapid evolution of electronic equipment and platforms that can process radar data on a large scale and make them available to users for example the cnes platform https peps cnes fr can now offer σ 0 maps on demand google earth engine also provides large scale products using free scripts found on the internet it is hoped that these efforts will increase and make the processed data easily available to users who are not primarily radar data specialists this work is the first step in its concept and further research is obviously required here the simple kcb act approach is used as a first step to check the accuracies and potential use of different radar variables the simple kcb act approach is generally preferred because it allows for rapid analysis and rough quantification of etc act with relatively moderate accuracy of vegetation water stress and soil evaporation on one hand it is an approach well suited for large scale agricultural water management for instance it can be used for irrigation scheduling by estimating kcb from the proposed approach and the water stress coefficient ks estimated typically from a water balance model such as the two layer soil budget of the fao 56 double coefficient approach however for operational irrigation management at large scale the estimation of ks from the water balance model is limited by the unavailability of irrigation data at the field scale over most irrigated areas as well as the difficulty in modeling the root zone soil moisture because of uncertain root depth and soil texture olivera guerra et al 2018 consequently several studies have assessed the potentialities of thermal infrared data to estimate ks e g ihuoma and madramootoo 2017 kullberg et al 2016 olivera guerra et al 2018 on the other hand a better description of physical processes is beneficial our current work focuses on the partition of evaporation from the soil and the transpiration component this approach which is based on the resolution of the soil water balance should also be corrected using ks this application would be very interesting and compatible with the resolution of sentinels 1 and 2 with the upcoming availability of high spatio temporal resolution of thermal data with the launch of future missions such as hyspiri 2022 sentinel 8 2024 trishna 2025 and lstm 2028 the transferability of the obtained relationships between kcb act and remote sensing variables is a key issue the fao 56 been a very conceptual model the relationships between kcb act and ndvi as ndvi is the most commonly used variable to estimate kcb act in the literature are well known to be specific to the site region where they have been established this is because kcb act take into account all factors that make a specific crop different from the reference grass including development stage density geometry and health it also depends on climate and on agricultural practices as discussed in the introduction as such the domain of application of the kcb act relationships with radar variables presented in this study should be limited to wheat under similar semi arid climate and agricultural practices to extend the genericity of the method by developing relationships for other conditions a larger data base should be used from another perspective the study should be extended to include other annual crops such as tree crops where the seasonal evolution of ρ and σ 0 hence pr is limited frison et al 2018 also the investigation should be extended to other sites with different irrigation techniques such as flooding and sprinkling some studies have shown sensitivity of ρ to soil moisture such as morrison et al 2011 who demonstrated a relationship between ρ and soil moisture on bare soil in c band similarly de zan et al 2014 found a loss of ρ in response to increasing and decreasing soil moisture levels using l band data on bare fields for our database no significant sensitivity to soil moisture is observed details on ouaadi et al 2020 on one hand this could be related to the low fraction of wetted soil surface fw as the fields are drip irrigated fw 0 3 allen et al 1998 compared to other techniques such as flooding where fw is equal to 1 on the other hand it is most likely that in the presence of vegetation the effect of soil moisture is negligible compared to the decorelation or loss of ρ caused by the vegetation indeed moeremans and dautrebande 2000 reported that some ρ changes can be related to soil moisture variations on bare soils but these changes become negligible when the soil is vegetated similarly barrett et al 2012 found that the effect of soil moisture variation is suppressed by the predominant effect of vegetation particularly for c band which is sensitive to both soil and vegetation characteristics ulaby et al 1986 using c and l band data molan and lu 2020 also revealed that ρ is not related to changes in soil moisture over agricultural fields however it should be kept in mind that ρ is calculated in these studies as in ours with a minimum of 6 days between the two images baseline which is largely sufficient for agricultural cover to grow and in most cases weather conditions change which will be the main sources of ρ loss stated differently soil moisture could have an observable impact if ρ is calculated with a short baseline where the temporal development of vegetation is limited indeed the experiment conducted by albinet et al 2016 on a tree demonstrated that watering the tree leads to an abrupt decrease in ρ that requires between 30 min and 6 h depending on polarization to recover the previous level before watering from another perspective the results of albinet et al 2016 shows that the presence of water on the surface of vegetation components due to watering events such as artificial or natural rainfall or due to dew disrupts ρ this was highlighted in the tropical forest by hamadi et al 2014 the further investigation of these different circumstances is necessary for a better evaluation of the kcb act ρ relationships since the degradation of ρ will automatically induce a degradation of the kcb act ρ relationships in this context sub daily measurements of radar data over annual crops are needed to understand the impact of soil moisture on ρ an experiment is currently installed in morocco to measure ρ and σ 0 over a wheat field with a step of 15 min the data are being processed and will be used in our future work 5 conclusions this work seeks to evaluate the potential use of sar data to estimate the crop coefficient kcb act and crop evapotranspiration etc act the commonly used ndvi is also considered for comparison purposes the study was conducted over four agricultural seasons of irrigated winter wheat in morocco radar variables are estimated from the c band sentinel 1 sensor with a revisit time of 6 days and a resolution of 10 m the ndvi is derived from sentinel 2 with similar resolutions first the relationship between kcb act on one hand and pr ρ vv and ρ vh on the other hand is studied for the whole agricultural season second the relationships kcb act pr kcb act ρ vv kcb act ρ vh and kcb act ndvi are calibrated using an agricultural season and the derived relationships are used to estimate kcb act and etc act over the four seasons the outcomes of this study showed that the variables derived from the sar data can also be successfully used to estimate kcb act and etc act in particular etc act is estimated using kcb act ρ vv with an rmse 0 75 mm day which is close to the rmse obtained using kcb act ndvi rmse 0 65 mm day over field 1 in contrast rmse values have increased to 1 15 mm day versus 2 15 mm day using kcb act ρ vv and kcb act ndvi respectively on field 2 due to the specific growing conditions of this field with a high presence of adventices however based on our results the radar variables and in particular ρ vv demonstrates good performance and in particular a stability of the statistical metrics from one field and one season to another in the estimation of etc act over the two fields this opens new perspectives for robust and operational applications at large spatial scales especially in regions where optical data are inoperable or for crops grown in winter usually characterized by frequent cloudy conditions most importantly the shortcomings obtained for etc act estimation using radar data are at the end of the season a period that is not important for etc act applications and crop water requirement management since vegetation dries out at this time and irrigation is already stopped the results also show that radar can be used as a complement to optics in particular the use of kcb act derived from ρ vv during the period of unavailability of optical images improved the correlation coefficient of etc act estimate by 7 16 and reduced the bias by over 27 our study presents the first attempt at estimating kcb act and etc act from sar data but further work is required for additional validation of the results as well as for a better and deeper investigation of the behavior of the kcb act radar and kcb act optical variables relationships and their robustness in estimating etc act when the geometrical and physiological properties of the canopy change as for example the case presented by
