8995,in the current study the standardized precipitation evaporation index spei was forecasted using a combination of the empirical wavelet transform ewt discrete wavelet transforms dwt extended kalman filter ekf two models of multilayer perceptrons mlp and group method of data handling gmdh neural networks two synoptic stations of tabriz semi arid climate and rasht humid climate covering data period 1987 2019 were selected for forecasting 70 of the data was used for model training and 30 for validation three forecasting horizons 1 3 and 6 months ahead spei were investigated autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function were used to determine the optimal inputs to the models the outcomes of the present study showed that in both stations the combination of machine learning models with two types of wavelet transforms ewt and dwt compared to the standalone models improved the performance of the forecasting correlation coefficient r 0 9980 root mean square error rmse 0 0483 for tabriz station and r 0 9988 rmse 0 0521 for rasht station a comparison of the ewt and dwt wavelets showed that the ewt had better performance in all forecasting intervals by raising the forecasting interval from one month to six months ewt performance was more evident than dwt performance in 6 month forecasting horizon the dwt had almost no effect on model performance improvement in both stations the combination of the ewt and mlp ekf model had the best performance in forecasting spei drought index keywords drought forecasting empirical wavelet transform extended kalman filter neural networks spei drought index data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is a natural disaster that affects most world regions malik et al 2021b natural disasters account for about 22 of global economic damage wilhite et al 2007 different regions of the world have recently experienced drought in different magnitudes it has caused great losses to various sectors and added to the level of food scarcity in different regions of the world alsubih et al 2021 in the u s the drought that occurred in 2012 remains the most extensive drought impact that the country has experienced in many years as it accounted for more than 30 0 billion in losses smith and matthews 2015 drought monitoring and prediction remain as one the major techniques for assessing the ecosystem s health and preventing the negative impacts of extreme weather events on earth ali et al 2019 poonia et al 2021 meteorological drought results from a significant decline in the rate of annual precipitation as it causes a reduction in the availability of water on land and rivers aravinthasamy et al 2021 the associated complexity of drought and the need for its assessment have led to the development of several indices for its assessment yaseen and shahid 2020 in most of the studies meteorological parameters are used as the drought indicators some of these indicators are drought severity index dsi standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evaporation index spei bouaziz et al 2021 weather temperature plays a significant role in meteorological drought due to its importance several indices have been developed that consider the role of temperature based on the spi concepts aadhar and mishra 2017 awadh et al 2022 tirivarombo et al 2018 hence the index in addition to rain and the rate of evapotranspiration can help monitor present and future climatic changes based on climatic conditions this index is mostly advantageous compared to the other drought monitoring indices by being highly applicable and capable of detecting the role of changing temperature and evapotranspiration rate in global warming the spei relies on rainfall and evapotranspiration data for drought monitoring as proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 hence it is more beneficial in monitoring the effect of changes in temperature and drought intensity compared to the spi method jiang et al 2015 the prevention and management of future drought episodes demand the development of an efficient drought prediction method with a tracking system that can assist in setting up a drought early warning system quansah et al 2010 yaseen et al 2021 as a matter of fact drought time series is associated with instability and nonlinearity and thus it remains as highly challenging climatology phenomenon as linear time series prediction techniques are limited to detect this kind of time series properties wei et al 2012 as such scholars have developed various machine learning ml approaches for the modeling of complex hydrological systems that can be used to predict drought such as artificial neural networks anns p p aghelpour et al 2020 pouya aghelpour et al 2020 pouya p aghelpour et al 2020 pouya aghelpour et al 2020 ghasemi et al 2021 jamei et al 2022 nabipour et al 2020 support vector regression svr mokhtarzad et al 2017 extreme

em ganguli and reddy 2013 and several other like integration ml models with preprocessing techniques such as wavelet transformation wt belayneh et al 2014 jamei et al 2023 karbasi 2017 karbasi et al 2022 among all the applied models ann is the most applied ml method in climate science ann is a robust and adaptable data driven method that can establish and represent complex relationships between inputs and output fung et al 2019 ann models have been studied for temperature and precipitation prediction in different regions of the world yaseen and shahid 2020 however the major problem of these models is the need for iterative tuning of their parameters coupled with the slow response of the gradient based learning algorithm used the models also return low prediction precision based on the generated algorithm of vosviewer fig 1 signifies the major keywords that appeared over the literature review based on the search in the scopus database search it is clearly exhibiting the significance and the research progress of the ml models implementation for drought prediction and analysis studying drought has a major impact on diverse applications such as water sustainability and management agriculture and crop production vegetation distribution and several others in addition fig 1 reveals that 44 countries have established this type of research indicating the significance of drought analysis and forecasting although several studies have been conducted on this research domain of drought prediction the researches are still ongoing for a better understanding of the actual drought phenomena in addition there is no single ml model is generally configured for drought prediction that can be globally implemented hence research on the exploration of different regions different drought indexing and more robust ml models is still the interest of climate scientists the foregoing limitations inspired this research and thus the following objectives are designed the main aim of the present study is the combination of empirical wavelet transform ewt with an extended kalman filter ekf based multilayer perceptron mlp ann to forecast multi step ahead spei drought index in two different climatic regions of iran the novel model s performance is compared to a mlp and group method of data handling gmdh neural networks also the performance of the conventional discrete wavelet transform dwt is compared with new ewt based models model efficiency indices and graphical comparisons are used to assess models performance the paper framework is as follows the second chapter discusses the methodology which includes the research area the ekf mlp and gmdh models as well as the various preprocessing techniques dwt and ewt the third and fourth chapters present the results and discussion respectively conclusions are located at the end 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in the present study two synoptic stations of tabriz and rasht were selected to forecast drought using various preprocessing technics rasht and tabriz are situated at longitude 49 34 e latitude 37 16 n elevation 5 m and longitude 46 18 e latitude 38 04 n elevation 1351 m respectively the statistical period used to calculate the drought index was from 1987 to 2019 33 years the climatic characteristics of the two stations are presented in table 1 tabriz has a semi arid climate located in the northwest of iran and rasht has a humid climate in the north of iran fig 2 table 2 displays descriptive statistics for spei 12 12 months standardized precipitation and evaporation index drought indices in tabriz and rasht stations from 1987 to 2019 the reason for using the spei 12 index is its high correlation with hydrological drought indices cheraghalizadeh et al 2018 both stations spei 12 indices are symmetrically distributed with a skewness of 0 021 skewness 0 034 in addition skewness and kurtosis imply that their distribution is almost normal the tabriz station experienced the most severe drought 2 529 while the rasht station experienced the wettest conditions 2 229 2 2 spei drought index nowadays standard precipitation evaporation index spei is identified as one of the most widely used drought indices for forecasting purposes which was introduced by vicente serrano et al 2010 in this index in contrast to the spi which only uses the rainfall datasets both rainfall and potential evapotranspiration datasets are implemented to determine monthly spei based on the salvador et al 2020 study salvador et al 2020 spei can be computed for multi scale periods from one to 24 months for monitoring aims based on the agricultural hydrological agricultural droughts for this purpose the degree of deviation between monthly potential evapotranspiration pet j and precipitation p j is computed to quantify the severity of drought using the following equation 1 d j p j p et j where george h hargreaves and zohrab a samani 1985 approach was implemented to compute the pet i as follows 2 d n k j 0 k 1 p n j pet n j as a result spei describes the probability of an occurrence using three parameters of the log logistic probability distribution function the accumulative probability function is written as 3 f x β α x λ α β 1 1 x λ α β 2 where parameters α β and λ are defined as the scale form and origin and x denotes the cumulative series for the λ d values for determining the parameters of log logistic distribution a different approach can be adopted here the l moment method as one the most robust and simple schemes was utilized to obtain the coefficient of upper cumulative function as ahmad et al 1988 singh et al 1993 4 β 2 ω 1 ω 0 6 ω 1 ω 0 6 ω 2 5 α ω 0 2 ω 1 β γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β 6 λ ω 0 α γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β where ω 0 ω 1 and ω 2 are the probability weighted moments and г β is the gamma function according to the log logistic distribution the probability distribution function of the d can be introduced by 7 f x 1 α x λ β 1 regarding the probability distribution function f x for the d series the spei index for different time scales can be achieved as the standardized values of f x abramowitz and stegun 1965 as 8 spei ψ δ 0 δ 1 ψ δ 2 ψ 2 1 d 1 ψ d 2 ψ 2 d 3 ψ 3 where 9 ψ 2 ln p for p 0 5 p 1 f x for p 0 5 where the p denotes the exceeding probability for the d series for more detail about the spei obtaining process and constant values of δ 0 δ 1 δ 2 d 1 d 1 and d 3 the readers are referred to vicente serrano et al 2010 in the current study just the spei 12 month was implemented to reflect the inter annual drought variation in two climate zones in iran according to the vicente serrano et al 2010 investigation on the spei index the common classification for drought is reported in table 3 fig 3 shows the spei 12 time series at tabriz and rasht stations using run theory yevjevich 1967 defined and described three important characteristics of drought duration severity and magnitude of drought and concluded that run theory has effective applications in analyzing drought trends a specific definition was given for drought based on the run test method run refers to a continuous sequence of larger or smaller sequences than the base in this definition drought refers to an uninterrupted array of variables that lies below the base level brasil neto et al 2021 according to fig 3 the most extended duration of drought occurred in tabriz station between 2008 and 2012 with a maximum severity of 40 28 the drought peak was also observed in 2018 2 41 at rasht station the longest drought duration occurred between 1998 and 2002 with a maximum severity of 30 13 the peak of the drought was in 2008 2 18 2 3 discrete wavelet transform the idea of wavelet transform wt was proposed by grossmann and morlet 1984 for non stationary signal analysis wt decomposed inputs in high resolution based on time and frequency domain ruwangika et al 2020 over time the wt became popular in water resources engineering for instance drought forecasting belayneh et al 2014 2016 deo et al 2016 streamflow analysis nourani et al 2014 sang 2013 smith et al 1998 trend investigation in streamflow and precipitation nalley et al 2013 2012 pandey et al 2017 clustering analysis hong fa 2012 flood forecasting kumar and sahay 2018 modelling urban water demand tiwari and adamowski 2013 evapotranspiration forecasting bachour et al 2016 and rainfall prediction partal et al 2015 two forms of wt are available i e i continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt cwt identifies and decomposes signals on all scales based on smooth continuous functions while dwt works on scales with discrete numbers through mallat or à trous algorithms in addition the wavelet coefficients produced by dwt are based on a dyadic procedure tiwari and adamowski 2013 two coefficients including approximations represents the high scale and low frequency components of data and details denotes the low scale and high frequency components of data are produced during signal decomposition by dwt prasad et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 mathematically dwt is expressed as pandey et al 2017 partal and küçük 2006 10 ψ m n t b a a 0 m 2 ψ t n b 0 a 0 m a 0 m here ψ represents the mother wavelet m and n are the integers that signify wavelet dilation scaling and translation factors separately furthermore b 0 and a 0 designate location varibale zero and dilation step one usually the value of a 0 2 and b 0 1 are preferred for practical applications dadu and deka 2016 sehgal et al 2014 this integer power of two logarithmic scalings of translations and dilations is called dyadic grid arrangement finally the wavelet coefficients are computed as 11 w m n 2 m 2 t 0 n 1 ψ 2 m t n x i where w m n defines wavelet coefficients for the dwt at scale a 2 m and location b 2 m n also x i states a finite time series i 0 1 2 n 1 and n 2 m this way of dwt can perform multi scale modelling this work utilized dwt for multi step ahead drought forecasting based on spei broad information on dwt can be obtained from deo et al 2016 2 4 empirical wavelet transform ewt one of the most recent preprocessing tools for signal decomposition is empirical wavelet transform ewt which was first developed by gilles 2013 and hu and wang 2015 the main motivation proposing this technique was lacking the mathematical theory in traditional decomposing tools such as empirical mode decomposition emd ali and prasad 2019 ewt identifies and extracts different intrinsic modes of a signal segmentation time series using an appropriate wavelets filter family and removes its stochastic volatility santos et al 2019 saraiva et al 2021 this technique processed the time series signal based on peak frequency component preprocessing followed by maxima based spectrum segmentation and consequently decomposes it into specific intrinsic modes from the methodology of emd for decomposing the signals as a finite sum of n 1 intrinsic mode functions imf g t can be defined as 12 g t k 0 n g k t the stages of constructing a set of empirical wavelets for a time series x t as a bandpass filter can be described as following two steps gilles 2013 honorato et al 2018 calculating the fourier spectrum f ω associated with the original signal on the basis of the fast fourier transform algorithm to extract the modes specify the appropriate boundaries and compute the detail and approximation coefficients using the empirical scaling function and the empirical wavelets it is assumed that the fourier support is partitioned into contiguous segments and the boundaries ω i of each segment are defined as the center between two consecutive maxima using the acquired set of local maxima plus 0 and π let g 0 g 1 g 2 g n denotes the frequencies of a set of local maxima and g n π the boundaries by suitable segmentation of f ω ω i g i g i 1 2 g i i 1 2 n according to the above expressions the empirical scaling function φ i ω and the empirical wavelets ψ i ω can be defined as 13 φ i ω 1 if ω 1 χ ω n cos π β ω 1 χ ω n 2 χ ω n 2 if 1 χ ω n ω 1 χ ω n 0 other wise ψ i ω 1 if 1 r ω n ω 1 χ ω n 1 cos π β ω 1 χ ω n 1 2 χ ω n 1 2 if 1 χ ω n 1 ω 1 χ ω n 1 sin π β ω 1 χ ω n 2 χ ω n 2 if 1 χ ω n ω 1 χ ω n 0 where χ min i ω i 1 ω i ω i 1 ω i also β x denotes an c k 0 1 function as 14 β x 0 if x 0 and β x β 1 x 1 x 0 1 1 if x 1 there are several functions that can satisfy the upper condition for instance eq 3 can be introduced for this aim as daubechies 1992 15 β x x 4 35 84 x 70 x 2 20 x 3 for simple describing the eq 13 τ n can be chosen by a linear distribution ω n τ n χ ω n where 0 χ 1 thus those are simplified as gilles 2013 16 φ i ω 1 if ω 1 χ ω n cos π 2 β 1 2 χ ω n ω 1 χ ω n if 1 χ ω n ω 1 χ ω n 0 otherwise and 17 ψ i ω 1 if 1 χ ω n ω 1 χ ω n 1 cos π 2 β 1 2 χ ω n 1 ω 1 χ ω n 1 if 1 χ ω n 1 ω 1 χ ω n 1 sin π 2 β 1 2 χ ω n ω 1 χ ω n if 1 χ ω n ω 1 χ ω n 0 otherwise the preceding equations were simplified to this form after assuming that the fourier support is divided into n contiguous segments e g gilles 2013 the limits between each segment are represented by the frequency ω i guimarães santos and silva 2014 peng et al 2017 according to the aforementioned methodology gilles 2013 similar to the classical dwt presents the detail and approximation coefficients of ewt ψ g e i t based on the inner products as 18 ψ g e i t g ψ i g τ ψ i τ t d τ g ω ψ i ω 19 ψ g e 0 t g φ 1 g τ φ i τ t d τ g ω φ i ω the reconstructed form of the original signal can be demonstrated by 20 f t ψ g e 0 t φ 1 t i 1 n ψ g e i t ψ i t 2 5 ann mlp multi layer perceptron mlp is a version of the ann artificial neural network developed by haykin 1998 in the last two decades the mlp model standalone and hybrid received many effective applications in diverse water resources engineering khaledian et al 2020 malik et al 2021a pham et al 2019 rehamnia et al 2021 sanikhani et al 2018 yaseen 2021 yaseen et al 2020 zhu et al 2020 the basic structure of the mlp is comprised of an input layer single i a hidden layer varies with neurons according to the problem j and an output layer single k as shown in fig 4 these layers are linked to each other through interconnected weights w ij and w jk the number of neurons in the hidden layer s are determined by a trial and error procedure to reduce error here the mlp models is discussed briefly for more comprehensive background of the mlp can be obtained from haykin 1998 in this research the topology of the mlp model was improved by forward and backward passes through levenberg marquardt algorithm deo et al 2018 sabour et al 2022 the information from input layer to hidden layer and hidden layer to output layer was mapped using a sigmoid activation function naganna et al 2019 2 6 extended kalman filter this study utilized the extended kalman filter ekf tool to improve the efficiency of the ann model ekf ann for predicting the multi time scale standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at two stations the ekf is the extended form of the traditional kalman filter invented by reif and unbehauen 1999 to tackle the complex non linear system the extended kalman filter ekf is a generalization of the basic kalman filter for nonlinear systems in which nonlinearity is approximated using the first or second order derivative the entire process of the ekf is summarized in fig 5 the ekf is described by considering stochastic state space functions sun et al 2015 yeh and huang 2005 21 x k f x k 1 u k w k 1 22 z k h x k ν k here x k actual state vector at

gundogdu et al 2020 muluye 2011 sun et al 2016 here the ekf is briefly discussed for more information readers are referred to chui and chen 1987 and welch and bishop 2004 2 7 hybrid ekf mlp method the synaptic weights of a feed forward neural network make it a non linear dynamic system chen et al 2011 like the challenge of trying to estimate the state of a non linear system training a neural network is pretty hard in this way an extended kalman filter may be used to estimate the neural network s weights and biases in this case x k represents the weights of the neural network while z k represents the output of the neural network as shown in eqs 21 and 22 to lower the mean square of the estimation error the extended kalman filter adjusts the weights of the neural network here is a brief overview of how the ekf algorithm decides which values in the neural network should be used as weights yang et al 2007 1 obtaining the neural network s output vector in step k using the following equations 25 w n w 1 k 1 w n w 1 k n n w 1 k 26 y n 2 1 k 1 h w k x k v n 2 1 k eq 25 is a process model that shows how the neural network weights vector w k should be seeded as a process state n 0 as a system state the measurement model used to determine the nonlinear neural network s output to the input vector x k and its weights is denoted by eq 26 the parameter ν k is the measured noise and it is utilized as the activation function h w k x k to explain the model s nonlinearity measurement noise is assumed to be random with zero mean and r 0 covariance whereas process noise is assumed to be random with zero mean and q 0 covariance zhang and luh 2005 the weight vector which is regarded as the non linear model s state vector contains all of the weights of the intermediate layers as well as the neural network output to n w number which is specified as a column vector according to the following equation 27 w n w 1 w 1 w 2 w n w t in this particular instance a neural network with an activating median layer is being investigated where n 0 n 1 and n 2 are the number of input intermediate and output signals respectively as a result the total number of weights is n w n 1 n 0 n 2 n 1 the extended kalman filter modifies the neural network weights in order to reduce the mean squares of the estimation error 2 obtaining the derivative matrix of the output matrix in

distribution with a mean of rivals and personnaz 1998 fig 6 illustrates the structure of the ekf ann model 2 8 gmdh the gmdh method belongs to the field of artificial intelligence techniques and is used to solve several problems like prediction classification simulation and pattern recognition azimi et al 2018 the concept of gmdh was initially proposed by ivakhnenko 1971 and later explored in numerous fields of engineering ebtehaj et al 2018 2016 2015 gholami et al 2017 lal and datta 2021 shaghaghi et al 2017 shen et al 2019 soltani et al 2021 yahya et al 2019 the structure of the gmdh model included multi input and single output fig 7 furthermore the gmdh algorithm includes the principle of the self organizing feed forward neural network which provides a platform for automatically electing optimal variables of the modeling framework structure number of layers and neurons within a hidden layer and parameters of the model the relationship among the input output variables was mapped by employing a non linear function named as volterra series of kolmogorov gabor polynomials ivakhnenko 1971 lal and datta 2021 33 y ˆ a 0 i 1 n a i x i i 1 n j 1 n a ij x i x j i 1 n j 1 n k 1

and preprocessing 2 9 1 feature selection when developing a robust drought time series forecasting model it is necessary to select training predictor variables with a minimal amount of overfitting and evaluate performance using the appropriate performance assessment measures as there is no rule of thumb for determining relevant inputs deo et al 2016 tiwari and adamowski 2013 correlation statistics specifically the autocorrelation function acf and partial acfs pacf were used to identify patterns embedded in the spei signal the optimal inputs for each time lag were then established using correlation coefficients r and statistical analysis of the lagged combinations the pacf eliminated any dependency on intermediate elements those inside lags which may be thought of as a regression of the time series against its prior lagged value whereas the acf found seasonality in the inputs the acf and pacf values were determined using eqs 35 and 36 deo et al 2016 malik et al 2019 tiwari and adamowski 2013 aghelpour et al 2019 35 acf k t 1 n k x t y m x t k x m t 1 n x t x m 2 36 pacf k k acf j 1 k 1 pacf k 1 j acf k 1 1 j 1 k 1 pacf k 1 j acf k 1 where k denotes the lag of the time series data x m is the mean value and n is the total number of drought series correlationograms of acf and pacf for two stations are depicted in fig 8 along with the 95 confidence interval for the value of r which is statistically significant for all stations with r 75 100 there was a statistically significant peak in the lagged spei of the one month spei combinations this revealed that the spei signal was substantially linked with both the current and prior month s values and was statistically significant at the 95 confidence level qutbudin et al 2019 as a result a lagged spei of up to three months was deemed appropriate for forecasting the spei for the next one to six months in tabriz and rasht stations namely spei 12 t 1 f spei 12 t spei 12 t 3 spei 12 t 3 f spei 12 t spei 12 t 3 spei 12 t 6 f spei 12 t spei 12 t 3 2 9 2 dwt based models the choice of an effective mother wavelet and the level of decomposition are two critical problems when using wavelet transforms for time series forecasting proper selection of the mother wavelet is the first step for the most critical decision this is true for both discrete and continuous wavelet transformations nourani et al 2014 in general mother wavelets with a compact support form e g daubechies 1 haar and daubechies 4 db4 are the most efficient in creating temporal localization features for time series with short memory and transient features rajaee et al 2010 liu et al 2013 accordingly the db4 wavelet has been chosen for drought time series decomposition to execute dwt based models we first decomposed the spei 12 time series initially the optimal degree of decomposition was discovered by trial and error however subsequently in the research a formula was published that correlated the least amount of decomposition level l with the number of data points in the time series nourani et al 2009 37 l int log m since m is the number of datasets and the length of our time series is 384 there will be two levels of decomposition so the original signals for drought modeling were split into two levels of detail and two levels of approximation after the series was broken up new subseries were made such as the low frequency subseries a and the high frequency subseries d the a and d subseries were used as inputs for the proposed models in the next step mlp mlp ekf and gmdh matlab 2021a software was used to code and implement the proposed models 2 9 3 ewt based models the hybrid ewt ekf model s architecture is presented in fig 1 the following thorough descriptions are provided i using the ewt technique the original drought data is decomposed into a series of subseries section 2 2 describes the ewt algorithm in depth f9f10figs 9 and 10 show the ewt based decomposed series of spei 12 drought index for both stations ii the training 70 and testing 30 sets are created using the original drought data iii an mlp model is constructed to forecast the deconstructed drought index data and the ekf technique is used to optimize the model s weights and biases iv for each subseries the forecasted results are combined with the corresponding original subseries v this study examines the 1 step 3 step and 6 step ahead predictions eight alternative forecasting models are compared to the suggested hybrid ewt ekf model they include the single mlp mlp ekf and gmdh models as well as the hybrid models dwt ekf dwt mlp dwt gmdh ewt mlp and ewt gmdh the optimal parameters of the mentioned models are given in tables 4 and 5 for tabriz and rasht respectively optimal parameters were determined using a grid search approach application of the different numbers of layers in neural network models showed that a single layer ann had the highest accuracy and the lowest computational cost fig 11 shows the

model based on the empirical wavelet ewt outperforms the dwt ekf model rmse 0 1572 r 0 9891 in the test stage also for mlp similar outcomes can be observed the calculated spei 12 values vs the anticipated values for the three months ahead are depicted in fig 16 for the test stage as apparent from fig 16 ewt based models having less scattered points are more successful than the single and dwt based models in forecasting three months ahead spei 12 3 2 3 six months ahead forecasting finally table 11 summarizes the findings of the six month ahead predictions for the rasht station when three single models are examined the ekf model having r of 0 5074 and rmse of 0 8907 performs superior to the mlp model with r 0 4646 and rmse 0 9335 while the gmdh model produces the most inferior

index the ewt ekf model rmse 0 3962 r 0 9230 predicts the spei 12 drought index as the best empirical wavelet based model the ewt gmdh rmse 0 4583 r 0 9014 and ewt mlp rmse 0 5341 r 0 8667 models can get the second and third places in the test stage respectively the results also indicate that combining discrete wavelet dwt and mlp ekf and gmdh models slightly improves the individual models the most accurate model is the dwt ekf with r 0 5781 and rmse 0 8493 and it is followed by the dwt gmdh r 0 5633 and dwt mlp r 0 5056 models in the test stage due to the inherent inaccuracy of dwt based models they should not be utilized to forecast six months ahead spei 12 drought index the ekf model based on the empirical wavelet ewt ekf rmse 0 3962 r 0 9230 fares better than the other models fig 17 compares the calculated spei 12 values to the six month predicted values in the test stage as shown in fig 17 single and dwt based models have low accuracy and their results are not applicable whereas the ewt based models can forecast six months ahead drought index with reasonable accuracy as the last validation stage the taylor diagrams corresponding to ewt mlp ekf dwt mlp ekf and single mlp ekf models were designed in figs 18 and 19 for the testing period in tabriz and rasht stations this validation tool can concurrently assess the variation of the correlation coefficient standard deviation and cantered root mean square error values at an individual radial graph fig 18 shows the taylor diagram for the tabriz station according to fig 18 the ewt mlp ekf due to having the smallest physical distance to the reference point redpoint outperforms the dwt mlp ekf and single mlp ekf for all the forecasting periods 1 3 and 6 months fig 19 shows the taylor diagram for the rasht station a similar result is observed in the rasht station and the ewt mlp ekf model can accurately forecast the spei 12 drought index fig 20 shows the comparison of ewt and dwt preprocessing methods and their combinations with the mlp ekf model in tabriz and rasht stations as clearly observed from fig 20 in the ewt preprocessing method the results at the rasht station are slightly better than the tabriz station better performance of ewt is more evident in forecasting six months ahead for the ewt r 0 904 in tabriz station and r 0 923 in rasht station while the corresponding values are 0 465 and 0 578 for the dwt the obtained results show that the model s performance in a rainy humid station rasht has been better than a semi arid station tabriz which can be related to high fluctuations in rainfall in semi arid stations 4 discussion by creating the ewt mlp ekf and dwt mlp ekf models this study makes a novel contribution to the field of drought forecasting research the spei drought index relates drought characteristics to the differential between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration wavelet decomposition dwt significantly improved the performance of single models wavelets are selected because a significant body of literature demonstrates their usefulness in hydrology nourani et al 2014 they provide the user with flexibility by allowing them to choose from a large number of different wavelet basis functions this contrasts with the ssa strategy which relies on singular value decomposition and phase space reconstruction and the emd approach which employs cubic splines chau and wu 2010 however wavelet transformation was able to identify non linear irregular trends and periodicities in this work resulting an increased model performance and model assessment metrics the ewt mlp ekf forecasted the spei most accurately in both stations evaluated empirical mode decomposition emd empirical wavelet transform ewt and variational mode decomposition vmd are all frequently used algorithms for signal decomposition shi et al 2021 emd has a number of issues including mode aliasing sensitivity to noise and boundary effects emd has a worse signal decomposition effect than vmd and ewt in comparison to vmd ewt can extract sub signals with a narrower bandwidth from the signal s fourier spectrum as a result ewt requires a greater number of decomposition numbers than vmd in order to achieve a more comprehensive breakdown of signals with more frequency components 5 conclusion in recent years drought has been one of the most serious concerns having a devastating impact on numerous sectors such as agriculture and iran s economy drought forecasting is critical for early warning and planning the most susceptible regions for their damaging consequences the purpose of this work was to investigate three advanced machine learning approaches namely mlp ekf gmdh and mlp and their combination with ewt and dwt wavelets for forecasting the 12 month time scale drought index to calculate the spei drought index monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data from two iranian synoptic stations tabriz and rasht have been used this study s findings support the following conclusions i single models without wavelets performed relatively well in forecasting the drought index for the next month in the rasht and tabriz stations the gmdh model had the best performance r 0 9407 rmse 0 3524 and r 0 8707 rmse 0 33746 in forecasting drought by increasing the forecast period from one month to three months the performance of the models decreased significantly in both tabriz e g for the ekf r 0 6799 rmse 0 5580 and rasht e g for the ekf r 0 7736 rmse 0 6628 stations in forecasting the next six months single models did not perform well and in most cases the r value was less than 0 5 therefore their use is not recommended in forecasting the spei 12 drought index for the next six months ii the combination of dwt discrete wavelet transform with mlp gmdh and ekf models improved the performance of the single models at the tabriz station the dwt ekf model had the best performance for the next month the dwt gmdh model for the next three months and the dwt ekf model for the next six months at the rasht station the dwt gmdh dwt ekf and dwt ekf models were the most accurate models for the next month r 0 9891 rmse 0 1508 for the next three months r 0 8915 rmse 0 4770 and for the next six months r 0 5781 rmse 0 8493 respectively due to the poor results in forecasting six months ahead the use of discrete wavelet transform dwt is not recommended iii combining single models with the empirical wavelet transform ewt has improved the performance of models compared to single and dwt based models at tabriz station the ewt ekf model had the best performance for forecasting next month s drought in forecasting three months ahead of spei 12 the ewt ekf model was the best finally the ewt ekf model had the best performance for forecasting six months ahead drought index at rasht station the ewt ekf model had the best performance in all three forecasting periods iv comparing the performance of the models in a wet station of rasht and a semi arid station of tabriz showed that the models in rasht station perform slightly better than tabriz station in predicting drought utilizing lagged data of spei12 drought index for its forecasting is one of the advantages of the present study using lagged data as input the created model successfully predicted the reference spei12 drought index over the next six months the hargreaves and samani technique was used to compute evapotranspiration in this study this approach requires just a modest amount of meteorological data minimum and maximum temperature if comprehensive meteorological data are available it is recommended to utilize the pmf56 approach which is more accurate in addition with the growth of deep learning techniques such as lstm and gru they can be employed to forecast drought finally future studies can forecast drought using climate indicators and remotely sensed data the findings of this research may help hydrologists agriculturalists and water resource planners

kalman filter ekf two models of multilayer perceptrons mlp and group method of data handling gmdh neural networks two synoptic stations of tabriz semi arid climate and rasht humid climate covering

autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function were used to determine the optimal inputs to the models the outcomes of the present study showed that in both stations the combination of machine learning models with two types of wavelet transforms ewt and dwt compared to the standalone models improved the performance of the forecasting correlation coefficient r 0 9980 root mean square error rmse 0 0483 for tabriz station and r 0 9988 rmse 0 0521 for rasht station a comparison of the ewt and dwt wavelets showed that the ewt had better performance in all forecasting intervals by raising the forecasting interval from one month to six months ewt performance was more evident than dwt performance in 6 month forecasting horizon the dwt had almost no effect on model performance improvement in both stations the combination of the ewt and mlp ekf model had the best performance in forecasting spei drought index keywords drought forecasting empirical wavelet transform extended

natural disasters account for about 22 of global economic damage wilhite et al 2007 different regions of the world have recently experienced drought in different magnitudes it has caused great losses to various sectors and added to the level of food scarcity in different regions of the world alsubih et al 2021 in the u s the drought that occurred in 2012 remains the most extensive drought impact that the country has experienced in many years as it accounted for more than 30 0 billion in losses smith and matthews 2015 drought monitoring and prediction remain as one the major techniques for assessing the ecosystem s health and preventing the negative impacts of extreme weather events on earth ali et al 2019 poonia et al 2021 meteorological drought results from a significant decline in the rate of annual precipitation as it causes a reduction in the availability of water on land and rivers aravinthasamy et al 2021 the associated complexity of drought and the need for its assessment have led to the development of several indices for its assessment yaseen and shahid 2020 in most of the studies meteorological parameters are used as the drought indicators some of these indicators are drought severity index dsi standardized precipitation index spi and standardized precipitation evaporation index spei bouaziz et al 2021 weather temperature plays a significant role in meteorological drought due to its importance several indices have been developed that consider the role of temperature based on the spi concepts aadhar and mishra 2017 awadh et al 2022 tirivarombo et al 2018 hence the index in addition to rain and the rate of evapotranspiration can help monitor present and future climatic changes based on climatic conditions this index is mostly advantageous compared to the other drought monitoring indices by being highly applicable and capable of detecting the role of changing temperature and evapotranspiration rate in global warming the spei relies on rainfall and evapotranspiration data for drought monitoring as proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 hence it is more beneficial in monitoring the effect of changes in temperature and drought intensity compared to the spi method jiang et al 2015 the prevention and management of future drought episodes demand the development of an efficient drought prediction method with a tracking system that can assist in setting up a drought early warning system quansah et al 2010 yaseen et al 2021 as a matter of fact drought time series is associated with instability and nonlinearity and thus it remains as highly challenging climatology phenomenon as linear time series prediction techniques are limited to detect this kind of time series properties wei et al 2012 as such scholars have developed various machine learning ml approaches for the modeling of complex hydrological systems that can be used to predict drought such as artificial neural networks anns p p aghelpour et al 2020

models is the need for iterative tuning of their parameters coupled with the slow response of the gradient based learning algorithm used the models also return low prediction precision based on the generated algorithm of vosviewer fig 1 signifies the major keywords that appeared over the literature review based on the search in the scopus database search it is clearly exhibiting the significance and the research progress of the ml models implementation for drought prediction and analysis studying drought has a major impact on diverse applications such as water sustainability and management agriculture and crop production vegetation distribution and several others in addition fig 1 reveals that 44 countries have established this type of research indicating the significance of drought analysis and forecasting although several studies have been conducted on this research domain of drought prediction the researches are still ongoing for a better understanding of the actual drought phenomena in addition there is no single ml model is generally configured for drought prediction that can be globally implemented hence research on the exploration of different regions different drought indexing and more robust ml models is still the interest of climate scientists the foregoing limitations inspired this research and thus the following objectives are designed the main aim of the present study is the combination of empirical wavelet transform ewt with an extended kalman filter ekf based multilayer perceptron mlp ann to forecast multi step ahead spei drought index in two different climatic regions of iran the novel model s performance is compared to a mlp and group method of data handling gmdh neural networks also the performance of the conventional discrete wavelet transform dwt is compared with new ewt based models model efficiency indices and graphical comparisons are used to assess models performance the paper framework is as follows the second chapter discusses the methodology which includes the research area the ekf mlp and gmdh models as well as the various preprocessing techniques dwt and ewt the third and fourth chapters present the results and discussion respectively conclusions are located at the end 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in the present study two synoptic stations of tabriz and rasht were selected to forecast drought using various preprocessing technics rasht and tabriz are situated at longitude 49 34 e latitude 37 16 n elevation 5 m and longitude 46 18 e latitude 38 04 n elevation 1351 m respectively the statistical period used to calculate the drought index was from 1987 to 2019 33 years the climatic characteristics of the two stations are presented in table 1 tabriz has a semi arid climate located in the northwest of iran and rasht has a humid climate in the north of iran fig 2 table 2 displays descriptive statistics for spei 12 12 months standardized precipitation and evaporation index drought indices in tabriz and rasht stations from 1987 to 2019 the reason for using the spei 12 index is its high correlation with hydrological drought indices cheraghalizadeh et al 2018 both stations spei 12 indices are symmetrically distributed with a skewness of 0 021 skewness 0 034 in addition skewness and kurtosis imply that their distribution is almost normal the tabriz station experienced the most severe drought 2 529 while the rasht station experienced the wettest conditions 2 229 2 2 spei drought index nowadays standard precipitation evaporation index spei is identified as one of the most widely used drought indices for forecasting purposes which was introduced by vicente serrano et al 2010 in this index in contrast to the spi which only uses the rainfall datasets both rainfall and potential evapotranspiration datasets are implemented to determine monthly spei based on the salvador et al 2020 study salvador et al 2020 spei can be computed for multi scale periods from one to 24 months for monitoring aims based on the agricultural hydrological agricultural droughts for this purpose the degree of deviation between monthly potential evapotranspiration pet j and precipitation p j is computed to quantify the severity of drought using the following equation 1 d j p j p et j where george h hargreaves and zohrab a samani 1985 approach was implemented to compute the pet i as follows 2 d n k j 0 k 1 p n j pet n j as a result spei describes the probability of an occurrence using three parameters of the log logistic probability distribution function the accumulative probability function is written as 3 f x β α x λ α β 1 1 x λ α β 2 where parameters α β and λ are defined as the scale form and origin and x denotes the cumulative series for the λ d values for determining the parameters of log logistic distribution a different approach can be adopted here the l moment method as one the most robust and simple schemes was utilized to obtain the coefficient of upper cumulative function as ahmad et al 1988 singh et al 1993 4 β 2 ω 1 ω 0 6 ω 1 ω 0 6 ω 2 5 α ω 0 2 ω 1 β γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β 6 λ ω 0 α γ 1 1 β γ 1 1 β where ω 0 ω 1 and ω 2 are the probability weighted moments and г β is the gamma function according to the log logistic distribution the probability distribution function of the d can be introduced by 7 f x 1 α x λ β 1 regarding the probability distribution function f x for the d series the spei index for different time scales can be achieved as the standardized values of f x abramowitz and stegun 1965 as 8 spei ψ δ 0 δ 1 ψ δ 2 ψ 2 1 d 1 ψ d 2 ψ 2 d 3 ψ 3 where 9 ψ 2 ln p for p 0 5 p 1 f x for p 0 5 where the p denotes the exceeding probability for the d series for more detail about the spei obtaining process and constant values of δ 0 δ 1 δ 2 d 1 d 1 and d 3 the readers are referred to vicente serrano et al 2010 in the current study just the spei 12 month was implemented to reflect the inter annual drought variation in two climate zones in iran according to the vicente serrano et al 2010 investigation on the spei index the common classification for drought is reported in table 3 fig 3 shows the spei 12 time series at tabriz and rasht stations using run theory yevjevich 1967 defined and described three important characteristics of drought duration severity and magnitude of drought and concluded that run theory has effective applications in analyzing drought trends a specific definition was given for drought based on the run test method run refers to a continuous sequence of larger or smaller sequences than the base in this definition drought refers to an uninterrupted array of variables that lies below the base level brasil neto et al 2021 according to fig 3 the most extended duration of drought occurred in tabriz station between 2008 and 2012 with a maximum severity of 40 28 the drought peak was also observed in 2018 2 41 at rasht station the longest drought duration occurred between 1998 and 2002 with a maximum severity of 30 13 the peak of the drought was in 2008 2 18 2 3 discrete wavelet transform the idea of wavelet transform wt was proposed by grossmann and morlet 1984 for non stationary signal analysis wt decomposed inputs in high resolution based on time and frequency domain ruwangika et al 2020 over time the wt became popular in water resources engineering for

2016 and rainfall prediction partal et al 2015 two forms of wt are available i e i continuous wavelet transform cwt and discrete wavelet transform dwt cwt identifies and decomposes signals on all scales based on smooth continuous functions while dwt works on scales with discrete numbers through mallat or à trous algorithms in addition the wavelet coefficients produced by dwt are based on a dyadic procedure tiwari and adamowski 2013 two coefficients including approximations represents the high scale and low frequency components of data and details denotes the low scale and high frequency components of data are produced during signal decomposition by dwt prasad et al 2020 sharma et al 2018 mathematically dwt is expressed as pandey et al 2017 partal and küçük 2006 10 ψ m n t b a a 0 m 2 ψ t n b 0 a 0 m a 0 m here ψ represents the mother wavelet m and n are the integers that signify wavelet dilation scaling and translation factors separately furthermore b 0 and a 0 designate location varibale zero and dilation step one usually the value of a 0 2 and b 0 1 are preferred for practical applications dadu and deka 2016 sehgal et al 2014 this integer power of two logarithmic scalings of translations and dilations is called dyadic grid arrangement finally the wavelet coefficients are computed as 11 w m n 2 m 2 t 0 n 1 ψ 2 m t n x i where w m n defines wavelet coefficients for the dwt

forecasting based on spei broad information on dwt can be obtained from deo et al 2016 2 4 empirical wavelet transform ewt one of the most recent preprocessing tools for signal decomposition is empirical wavelet transform ewt which was first developed by gilles 2013 and hu and wang 2015 the main motivation proposing this technique was lacking the mathematical theory in traditional decomposing tools such as empirical mode decomposition emd ali and prasad 2019 ewt identifies and extracts different intrinsic modes of a signal segmentation time series using an appropriate wavelets filter family and removes its stochastic volatility santos et al 2019 saraiva et al 2021 this technique processed the time series signal based on peak frequency component preprocessing followed by maxima based spectrum segmentation and consequently decomposes it into specific intrinsic modes from the methodology of emd for decomposing the signals as a finite sum of n 1 intrinsic mode functions imf g t can be defined as 12 g t k 0 n g k t the stages of constructing a set of empirical wavelets for a time series x t as a bandpass filter can be described as following two steps gilles 2013 honorato et al 2018 calculating the fourier spectrum f ω associated with the original signal on the basis of the fast fourier transform algorithm to extract the modes specify the appropriate boundaries and compute the detail and approximation coefficients using the empirical scaling function and the empirical wavelets it is assumed that the fourier support is partitioned into contiguous segments and the boundaries ω i of each segment are defined as the center between two consecutive maxima using the acquired set of local maxima plus 0 and π let g 0 g 1 g 2 g n denotes the frequencies of a set of local maxima and g n π the boundaries by suitable segmentation of f ω ω i g i g i 1 2 g i i 1 2 n according to the above expressions the empirical scaling function φ i ω and the empirical wavelets ψ i ω can be defined as 13 φ i ω 1 if ω 1 χ ω n cos π β ω 1 χ ω n 2 χ ω n 2 if 1 χ ω n ω 1 χ ω n 0 other wise ψ i ω 1 if 1 r ω n ω 1 χ ω n 1 cos π β ω 1 χ ω n 1 2 χ ω n 1 2 if 1 χ ω n 1 ω 1 χ ω n 1 sin π β ω 1 χ ω n 2 χ ω n 2 if 1 χ ω n ω 1 χ ω n 0 where χ min i ω i 1 ω i ω i 1 ω i also β x denotes an c k 0 1 function as 14 β x 0 if x 0 and β x β 1 x 1 x 0 1 1 if x 1 there are several functions that can satisfy the upper condition for instance eq 3 can be introduced for this aim as daubechies 1992 15 β x x 4 35 84 x 70 x 2 20 x 3 for simple describing the eq 13 τ n can be chosen by a linear distribution ω n τ n χ ω n where 0 χ 1 thus those are simplified as gilles 2013 16 φ i ω 1 if ω 1 χ ω n cos π 2 β 1 2 χ ω n ω 1 χ ω n if 1 χ ω n ω 1 χ ω n 0 otherwise and 17 ψ i ω 1 if 1 χ ω

assuming that the fourier support is divided into n contiguous segments e g gilles 2013 the limits between each segment are represented by the frequency ω i guimarães santos and silva 2014 peng et al 2017 according to the aforementioned methodology gilles 2013 similar to the classical dwt presents the detail and approximation coefficients of ewt ψ g e i t based on the inner products as 18 ψ g e i t g ψ i g τ ψ i τ t d τ g ω ψ i ω 19 ψ g e 0 t g φ 1 g τ φ i τ t d τ g ω φ i ω the reconstructed form of the original signal can be demonstrated by 20 f t ψ g e 0 t φ 1 t i 1 n ψ g e i t ψ i t 2 5 ann

briefly for more comprehensive background of the mlp can be obtained from haykin 1998 in this research the topology of the mlp model was improved by forward and backward passes through levenberg marquardt algorithm deo et al 2018 sabour et al 2022 the information from input layer to hidden layer and hidden layer to output layer was mapped using a sigmoid activation function naganna et al 2019 2 6 extended kalman filter this study utilized the extended kalman filter ekf tool to improve the efficiency of the ann model ekf ann for predicting the multi time scale standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei at two stations the ekf is the extended form of the traditional kalman filter invented by reif and unbehauen 1999 to tackle the complex non linear system the extended kalman filter ekf is a generalization of the basic kalman filter for nonlinear systems in which nonlinearity is approximated using the first or second order derivative the entire process of the ekf is

gundogdu et al 2020 muluye 2011 sun et al 2016 here the ekf is briefly discussed for more information readers are referred to chui and chen 1987 and welch and bishop 2004 2 7 hybrid ekf mlp method the synaptic weights of a feed forward neural network make it a non linear dynamic system chen et al 2011 like the challenge of trying to estimate the state of a non linear system training a neural network is pretty hard in this way an extended kalman filter may be used to estimate the neural network s weights and biases in this case x k represents the weights of the neural network while z k represents the output of the neural network as shown in eqs 21 and 22 to lower the mean square of the estimation error the extended kalman filter adjusts the weights of the neural network here is a brief overview of how the ekf algorithm decides which values in the neural network should be used as weights yang et al 2007 1 obtaining the neural network s output vector in step k using the following equations 25 w n w 1 k 1 w n w 1 k n n w 1 k 26 y n 2 1 k 1 h w k x k v n 2 1 k eq 25 is a process model that shows how the neural network weights vector w k should be seeded as a process state n 0 as a system state the measurement model used to determine the nonlinear neural network s output to the input vector x k and its weights is denoted by eq 26 the parameter ν k is the measured noise and it is utilized as the activation function h w k x k to explain the model s nonlinearity measurement noise is assumed to be random with zero mean and r 0 covariance whereas process noise is assumed to be random with zero mean and q 0 covariance zhang and luh 2005 the weight vector which is regarded as the non linear model s state vector contains all of the weights of the intermediate layers as well as the neural network output to n w number which is specified as a column vector according to the following equation 27 w n w 1 w 1 w 2 w n w t in this particular instance a neural network with an activating median layer is being investigated where n 0 n 1 and n 2 are the number of input intermediate and output signals respectively as a result the total number of weights is n w n 1 n 0 n 2 n 1 the extended kalman filter modifies the neural network weights in order to reduce the mean squares of the estimation error 2 obtaining the derivative matrix of the output matrix in

distribution with a mean of rivals and personnaz 1998 fig 6 illustrates the structure of the ekf ann model 2 8 gmdh the gmdh method belongs to the field of artificial intelligence techniques and is used to solve several problems like prediction classification simulation and pattern recognition azimi et al 2018 the concept of gmdh was initially proposed by ivakhnenko 1971 and later explored in numerous fields of engineering ebtehaj et al 2018 2016 2015 gholami et al 2017 lal and datta 2021 shaghaghi et al 2017 shen et al 2019 soltani et al 2021 yahya et al 2019 the structure of the gmdh model included multi input and single output fig 7 furthermore the gmdh algorithm includes the principle of the self organizing feed forward neural network which provides a platform for automatically electing optimal variables of the modeling framework structure number of layers and neurons within a hidden layer and parameters of the model the relationship among the input output variables was

and preprocessing 2 9 1 feature selection when developing a robust drought time series forecasting model it is necessary to select training predictor variables with a minimal amount of overfitting and evaluate performance using the appropriate performance assessment measures as there is no rule of thumb for determining relevant inputs deo et al 2016 tiwari and adamowski 2013 correlation statistics specifically the autocorrelation function acf and partial acfs pacf were used to identify patterns embedded in the spei signal the optimal inputs for each time lag were then established using correlation coefficients r and statistical analysis of the lagged combinations the pacf eliminated any dependency on intermediate elements those inside lags which may be thought of as a regression of the time series against its prior lagged value whereas the acf found seasonality in the inputs the acf and pacf values were determined using eqs 35 and 36 deo et al 2016 malik et al 2019 tiwari and adamowski 2013 aghelpour et al 2019 35 acf k t 1 n k x t y m x t k x m t 1 n x t x m 2 36 pacf k k acf j 1 k 1 pacf k 1 j acf k 1 1 j 1 k 1 pacf k 1 j acf k 1 where k denotes the lag of the time series data x m is the mean value and n is the total number of drought series correlationograms of acf and pacf for two stations are depicted in fig 8 along with the 95 confidence interval for the value of r which is statistically significant for all stations with r 75 100 there was a statistically significant peak in the lagged spei of the one month spei combinations this revealed that the spei signal was substantially linked with both the current and prior month s values and was statistically significant at the 95 confidence level qutbudin et al 2019 as a result a lagged spei of up to three months was deemed appropriate for forecasting the spei for the next one to six months in tabriz and rasht stations namely spei 12 t 1 f spei 12 t spei 12 t 3 spei 12 t 3 f spei 12 t spei 12 t 3 spei 12 t 6 f spei 12 t spei 12 t 3 2 9 2 dwt based models the choice of an effective mother wavelet and the level of decomposition are two critical problems when using wavelet transforms for time series forecasting proper selection of the mother wavelet is the first step for the most critical decision this is true for both discrete and continuous wavelet transformations nourani et al 2014 in general mother wavelets with a compact support form e g daubechies 1 haar and daubechies 4 db4 are the most efficient in creating temporal localization features for time series with short memory and transient features rajaee et al 2010 liu et al 2013 accordingly the db4 wavelet has been chosen for drought time series decomposition to execute dwt based models we first decomposed the spei 12 time series initially the optimal degree of decomposition was discovered by trial and error however subsequently in the research a formula was published that correlated the least amount of decomposition level l with the number of data points in the time series nourani et al 2009 37 l int log m since m is the number of datasets and the length of our time series is 384 there will be two levels of decomposition so the original signals for drought modeling were split into two levels of detail and two levels of approximation after the series was broken up new subseries were made such as the low frequency subseries a and the high frequency subseries d the a and d subseries were used as inputs for the proposed models in the next step mlp mlp ekf and gmdh matlab 2021a software was used to code

dwt based models in forecasting three months ahead spei 12 3 2 3 six months ahead forecasting finally table 11 summarizes the findings of the six month ahead predictions for the rasht station when three single models are examined the ekf model having r of 0 5074 and rmse of 0 8907 performs superior to the mlp model with r 0 4646 and rmse 0 9335 while the gmdh model produces the most inferior outcomes rmse 0 9340 r 0 4402 in the test stage similar to the tabriz station here also single models due to their low accuracy are not recommended for forecasting six months ahead spei 12 drought index the ewt ekf model rmse 0 3962 r 0 9230 predicts the spei 12 drought index as the best empirical wavelet based model the ewt gmdh rmse 0 4583 r 0 9014 and ewt mlp rmse 0 5341 r 0 8667 models can get the second and third places in the test stage respectively the results also indicate that combining discrete wavelet dwt and mlp ekf and gmdh models slightly improves the individual models the most accurate model is the dwt ekf with r 0 5781 and rmse 0 8493 and it is followed by the dwt gmdh r 0 5633 and dwt mlp r 0 5056 models in the test stage due to the inherent inaccuracy of dwt based models they should not be utilized to forecast six months ahead spei 12 drought index the ekf model based on the empirical wavelet ewt ekf rmse 0 3962 r 0 9230 fares better than the other models fig 17 compares the calculated spei 12 values to the six month predicted values in the test stage as shown in fig 17 single and dwt based models have low accuracy and their results are not applicable whereas the ewt based models can forecast six months ahead drought index with reasonable accuracy as the last validation stage the taylor diagrams corresponding to ewt mlp ekf dwt mlp ekf and single mlp ekf models were designed in figs 18 and 19 for the testing period in tabriz and rasht stations this validation tool can concurrently assess the variation of the correlation coefficient standard deviation and cantered root mean square error values at an individual radial graph fig 18 shows the taylor diagram for the tabriz station according to fig 18 the ewt mlp ekf due to having the smallest physical distance to the reference point redpoint outperforms the dwt mlp ekf and single mlp ekf for all the forecasting periods 1 3 and 6 months fig 19 shows the taylor diagram for the rasht station a similar result is observed in the rasht station and the ewt mlp ekf model can accurately forecast the spei 12 drought index fig 20 shows the comparison of ewt and dwt preprocessing methods and their combinations with the mlp ekf model in tabriz and rasht stations as clearly observed from fig 20 in the ewt preprocessing method the results at the rasht station are slightly better than the tabriz station better performance of ewt is more evident in forecasting six months ahead for the ewt r 0 904 in tabriz station and r 0 923 in rasht station while the corresponding values are 0 465 and 0 578 for the dwt the obtained results show that the model s performance in a rainy humid station rasht has been better than a semi arid station tabriz which can be related to high fluctuations in rainfall in semi arid stations 4 discussion by creating the ewt mlp ekf and dwt mlp ekf models this study makes a novel contribution to the field of drought forecasting research the spei drought index relates drought characteristics to the differential between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration wavelet decomposition dwt significantly improved the performance of single models wavelets are selected because a significant body of literature demonstrates their usefulness in hydrology nourani et al 2014 they provide the user with flexibility by allowing them to choose from a large number of different wavelet basis functions this contrasts with the ssa strategy which relies on singular value decomposition and phase space reconstruction and the emd approach which employs cubic splines chau and wu 2010 however wavelet transformation was able to identify non linear irregular trends and periodicities in this work resulting an increased model performance and model assessment metrics the ewt mlp ekf forecasted the spei most accurately in both stations evaluated empirical mode decomposition emd empirical wavelet transform ewt and variational mode decomposition vmd are all frequently used algorithms for signal decomposition shi et al 2021 emd has a number of issues including mode aliasing sensitivity to noise and boundary effects emd has a worse signal decomposition effect than vmd and ewt in comparison to vmd ewt can extract sub signals with a narrower bandwidth from the signal s fourier spectrum as a result ewt requires a greater number of decomposition numbers than vmd in order to achieve a more comprehensive breakdown of signals with more frequency components 5 conclusion in recent years drought has been one of the most serious concerns having a devastating impact on numerous sectors such as agriculture and iran s economy drought forecasting is critical for early warning and planning the most susceptible regions for their damaging consequences the purpose of this work was to investigate three advanced machine learning approaches namely mlp ekf gmdh and mlp and their combination with ewt and dwt wavelets for forecasting the 12 month time scale drought index to calculate the spei drought index monthly precipitation and potential evapotranspiration data from two iranian synoptic stations tabriz and rasht have been used this study s findings support the following conclusions i single models without wavelets performed relatively well in forecasting the drought index for the next month in the rasht and tabriz stations the gmdh model had the best performance r 0 9407 rmse 0 3524 and r 0 8707 rmse 0 33746 in forecasting drought by increasing the forecast period from one month to three months the performance of the models decreased significantly in both tabriz e g for the ekf r 0 6799 rmse 0 5580 and rasht e g for the ekf r 0 7736 rmse 0 6628 stations in forecasting the next six months single models did not perform well and in most cases the r value was less than 0 5 therefore their use is not recommended in forecasting the spei 12 drought index for the next six months ii the combination of dwt discrete wavelet transform with mlp gmdh and ekf models improved the performance of the single models at the tabriz station the dwt ekf model had the best performance for the next month the dwt gmdh model for the next three months and the dwt ekf model for the next six months at the rasht station the dwt gmdh dwt ekf and dwt ekf models were the most accurate models for the next month r 0 9891 rmse 0 1508 for the next three months r 0 8915 rmse 0 4770 and for the next six months r 0 5781 rmse 0 8493 respectively due to the poor results in forecasting six months ahead the use of discrete wavelet transform dwt is not recommended iii combining single models with the empirical wavelet transform ewt has improved the performance of models compared to single and dwt based models at tabriz station the ewt ekf model had the best performance for forecasting next month s drought in forecasting three months ahead of spei 12 the ewt ekf model was the best finally the ewt ekf model had the best performance for forecasting six months ahead drought index at rasht station the ewt ekf model had the best performance in all three forecasting periods iv comparing the performance of the models in a wet station of rasht and a semi arid station of tabriz showed that the models in rasht station perform slightly better than tabriz station in predicting drought utilizing lagged data of spei12 drought index for its forecasting is one of the advantages of the present study using lagged data as input the created model successfully predicted the reference spei12 drought index over the next six months the hargreaves and samani technique was used to compute evapotranspiration in this study this approach requires just a modest amount of meteorological data minimum and maximum temperature if comprehensive meteorological data are available it is recommended to utilize the pmf56 approach which is more accurate in addition with the growth of deep learning techniques such as lstm and gru they can be employed to forecast drought finally future studies can forecast drought using climate indicators and remotely sensed data the findings of this research may help hydrologists agriculturalists and water resource planners

personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgments authors acknowledge their appreciation to the iran metrology organization for providing

8996,climate change and variability threaten the sustainability of future food production especially in semi arid regions where water resources are limited and irrigated agriculture is widespread increasing temperatures will exacerbate evaporative losses and increase plant water needs in this regard higher irrigation intensities have been posited as a solution to mitigate climate change impacts in these regions here using the agro hydrological model swat and the biophysical crop model apsim we show that this mitigation measure is oversimplified we find that heat stress driven by strong temperature increases might be the dominating factor in controlling future crop yields and plant water needs our analysis encompasses agricultural areas of the lower chenab canal system in punjab pakistan 15 000 km2 which is part of the indus river irrigation system the largest irrigation system in the world covering major cotton rice and maize cropping zones climate models project a strong increase in temperature over the study region of up to 1 8 c 0 5 c until the mid century both models predict a decline in future crop yields for maize and rice crops while cotton yields are less effected by rising temperatures and strongly benefit from elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations for a high carbon emission scenario the models simulate yield declines for maize of up to 10 apsim and 19 swat for rice yields of up to 4 apsim to 26 swat and for cotton yields of 1 apsim to 11 swat until 2050 relative to the baseline scenario 1996 2005 our modeling results further suggest that irrigation demands do not align with increasing temperature trends average irrigation demands increase less under higher temperatures overall our study emphasizes the role of elevated heat stress its effects on agricultural productivity as well as water demand and its implications for climate change adaption strategies to mitigate adverse impacts in an intensively irrigated region plain language summary climate change is one of the most important challenge facing agriculture and hence future food security farmers struggle more and more to ensure a reliable food production this is especially true for semi arid regions where water resources are limited but at the same time urgently needed for irrigation such as in the lower chenab canal area in punjab pakistan the search for adaptation measures to weaken the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural systems becomes increasingly important one option could be the intensification of irrigation we use two models to simulate crop growth processes under various climate conditions our results show that heat stress would be the dominating stress for plants in the selected study region and that this heat stress might even lead to a reduction in water demand intensive irrigation can not necessarily help to prevent climate change related yield losses the models further predict that rising co2 can have a positive effect on crop yield by enhancing plant growth nevertheless our results indicate that these positive effects could not compensate the negative impacts of heat stress under constantly rising temperatures keywords regional climate change yield water demand swat apsim data availability the data is freely available and i have shared the link to the repository in the manuscript 1 introduction in recent years climate change and its impact on the environment is one of the main concerns facing societies globally specifically its effect on agricultural systems has become a major problem considering the alarming global developments regarding water and food security hanjra and qureshi 2010 schewe et al 2014 one of the latest special report of the un intergovernmental panel on climate change shukla et al 2019 predicts with high confidence that future changes in climatic conditions will exacerbate existing water and food shortages for billions of people one of the main reasons considered responsible for the predicted food shortage is the inability to meet future agricultural water demands fader et al 2016 globally irrigation volumes have more than doubled since the 1960s shukla et al 2019 and are likely to increase further due to climate change in regions with already limited water supply wada et al 2013 wang et al 2016 in semi arid and developing regions like pakistan agriculture is the most important economic sector employing nearly half of the population qureshi 2011 a large part of agricultural workers are small scale farmers who are highly vulnerable to yield losses which have become increasingly frequent in the recent decades oxfam 2009 the projected increase in water scarcity due to climate change along with the increasing demand of the fast growing population poses a severe threat to the national food supply and the production of economically important cash crops such as cotton maize and rice ahmad et al 2015 khan et al 2016 schewe et al 2014 the indus basin in pakistan s punjab province is a hot spot for climate change impacts on water availability and agricultural production as it constitutes one of the world s largest closed irrigation areas mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 irrigation water accounts for over 90 of the total water demand in the region fischer et al 2007 significant climate induced changes in the upstream glacier hydrology the major water source for the indus basin are threatening future water availability in the basin immerzeel et al 2010 along with the rising temperatures which are projected to increase faster than the global average saeed and athar 2018 under such conditions water related adaptation strategies such as increased irrigation amounts and enhanced irrigation efficiency are potential solutions to cope with these challenges the effects of such adaptation measures have been studied for agricultural systems experiencing similar climate change pressures and have been suggested as possible actions elliott et al 2014 fader et al 2016 molden et al 2010 however the direct role of increasing temperatures in affecting crop yields is gaining importance across the globe and could be an important factor in the indus basin temperature induced stress on crop growth could counteract the potential of enhanced irrigation to increase productivity zaveri and lobell 2019 it is therefore imperative to understand the role of temperature stress on crop growth and resulting plant water demand in combination with water stress improved knowledge on the potential impacts of temperature and water stress as well as their interlinkages is important to define adequate adaptation strategies lesk et al 2022 in terms of adequate water availability for crop growth especially in semi arid regions previous studies highlight that there is still very limited understanding of the potentials and limits of irrigation related climate change adaptation tack et al 2017 taraz 2018 and that more research is needed to disentangle the effects of temperature and water stress related climate change impacts on agricultural yields carter et al 2016 the main objective of this study is to quantify the impact of heat stress on yield and crop water demand in the lower chenab canal system in pakistan we hypothesize that future temperature conditions will have a strong negative impact on crop yields in our study area further we propose the counter intuitive hypothesis increasing temperatures will lead to a reduction in irrigation requirements driven by a strong decrease in crop growth which leads to reduced plant water needs to assess these hypotheses the study elaborates on how temperature stress controls agricultural productivity and plant water requirements in an intensively irrigated agricultural system to explore whether our counter intuitive assumption that increasing temperatures will lead to decreasing irrigation demands holds true we apply two models the hydrological swat model arnold et al 2012 and the biophysical crop modelling framework apsim holzworth et al 2014 while biophysical crop models are the classical models to be used to assess climate change impacts on crops studies have shown their low performance in reproducing hydrodynamics such as soil moisture storage or plant water availability faria and bowen 2003 which are crucial processes for the estimation of water requirements and demands hydrological models on the other hand show low performances in simulating plant physiological behaviour and yield estimations in this study we therefore use a hydrological and a biophysical crop model in an ensemble framework to assess climate change impacts on crop production as well as climate change impacts on plant water demands a hard coupling of both models is beyond the scope of this study yet the profound comparative analysis of both model types is expected to allow a more detailed understanding of strengths and weaknesses of either model and will result in a more reliable assessment of changes in future yield and water demands uncertainties of the respective model applications are discussed in detail and give valuable insights for modellers of both modelling communities as they reveal important limits of climate impact assessment based on process based hydrological as well as crop models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is part of the lower chenab canal system area lcc in pakistan which comprises about 15 000 km2 of agricultural land on the floodplains between the rivers chenab and ravi fig 1a and b it belongs to the indus basin irrigation system ibis the world s largest irrigation system feeding more than 200 million people immerzeel et al 2010 the area is characterized by small scale and highly fragmented agricultural cropping patterns during the dry winter season rabi the dominating crop type is winter wheat while during the wetter and hot summer kharif the crop pattern diversifies and mainly cotton maize rice and fodder are grown on small scale farms annual reference evaporation approx 1800 mm a is more than three times larger than annual precipitation approx 500 mm a resulting in a strong demand for additional irrigation knowing about potential negative impacts on agricultural production and defining possible adaptation strategies is therefore of paramount importance for water and food security in this region in this study we focused on analysing the impacts of future climate change on summer crops namely cotton maize and rice grown between may and october impacts are evaluated based on changes in crop yield and relevant hydrologic and biophysical variables including evapotranspiration irrigation demand leaf area growth and biomass production the selected crops represent high value crops with a wide distribution in the study area fig 1a thus changes in their production levels will have significant economic impacts and changes in irrigation needs will have a strong impact on basin wide water demand 2 2 models swat and apsim to analyse climate change impacts on yield and water demand we apply two models from different scientific disciplines we consider the agro hydrological swat model arnold et al 2012 with high performance in simulating complex hydrological plant soil atmosphere interactions and the biophysical crop modelling framework apsim holzworth et al 2014 with high performance in simulating complex plant growth dynamics the models are briefly described below the agro hydrological swat model soil water assessment tool simulates the quantity and quality of water flow within catchments incorporates detailed management strategies e g irrigation schedules planting schedules and basic plant physiognomic stages e g root development leaf area development and biomass change arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 the main underlying principle for the simulation of water fluxes is the water balance closure neitsch et al 2009 swat accounts for spatially distributed environmental and climatic changes and it simulates their effects on individual water balance components such as evapotranspiration infiltration soil moisture changes and runoff fig 2 its strengths are therefore the detection of spatially distributed changes in water availability and demand impacts of increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations are accounted for in the estimation of potential evapotranspiration affecting i e reducing plant water demand as well as in the estimation of plant radiation use efficiency affecting i e enhancing biomass production to ensure correct and spatially differentiated parameterization the model is calibrated following an automated and spatially distributed calibration approach a detailed description of this calibration procedure can be found in becker et al 2019 in this study the model was run on a daily timescale with daily climate input data the spatially distributed swat results are averaged over each respective crop growing region resulting in one maize one rice and one cotton data set the agricultural production system simulator apsim is a biophysical crop modelling framework which simulates agricultural crop dynamics with respect to varying climatic and environmental conditions holzworth et al 2014 it has been extensively used to assess climate change impacts on agricultural productivity deihimfard et al 2018 gaydon et al 2021 khaliq et al 2019 model performance and applications are studied in depths within the scope of the agricultural modelling intercomparison and improvement project agmip boote et al 2021 rosenzweig et al 2014 in which apsim was applied in the same study region of southern punjab to assess climate change impact on crop production focus and strength of the apsim framework is the plant specific simulation of biophysical dynamics such as biomass production yield or root growths fig 2 due to its modular approach with individual sub models for each crop type it can account for plant specific reactions to climate change for example with individual models for cotton rice and maize it accounts for plant type specific carbon assimilation processes c3 vs c4 plants and hence differentiates between plant type reactions to increased atmospheric co2 levels different to swat apsim is a plot scale model to allow for a model comparison between the spatially distributed swat model and apsim we calibrated the apsim model by adopting the most important soil and management parameter configurations from the calibrated swat model to rule out uncertainties which would arise due to spatial differences in soil and climate conditions over the large lcc area we conducted a sensitivity analysis to analyse the effect of varying soil and climate parameters on apsim simulated crop yields this further allowed us to constrain appropriate parameters for the apsim model soil parameters were furthermore verified through laboratory analysis of soil samples collected during a field campaign in the study region schulz et al 2021 details of the used parameters and underlying estimation procedure for both crop models are described in the supplementary information s2 and tables s1 s3 like the swat model apsim was run on a daily time scale with daily climate input data two central management related assumptions were made in both models i water stress is minimized by including regular irrigation events as soon as soil moisture drops below 90 and ii nutrient stress is minimized by assuring sufficient fertilizer application applying 100 kg ha of nitrogenous fertilizer at each irrigation event simulated trends of future yield biomass production evapotranspiration lai and water demand can therefore be ascribed to the effect of temperature increase by ruling out the influence of irrigation and nutrient management the skill of both models to correctly reproduce plant water demands was validated against observed crop specific evapotranspiration et rates for the years 2009 2010 this time period was chosen based on the availability of high resolution and crop specific et data to validate the model performances with respect to yield simulations annual yield estimates were validated using observed yield data provided by agricultural statistics of pakistan published by the ministry of national food security research mnfsr 2021 observed yield data could be obtained for the years 2002 2013 at the province level for the province of punjab 2 3 climate data sets daily climate forecast system reanalysis data saha et al 2010 was taken as historical reference climate data for a baseline period 1996 2005 the data set encompasses temperature precipitation relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed to ensure the accuracy of the baseline data set the cfsr data was bias corrected using climate records of three available local climate stations supplementary section 1 1 climate projection datasets were taken from the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex which provides a suite of regional climate projections based on the global climate models of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 taylor et al 2012 we considered medium rcp 4 5 and high rcp 8 5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios from the ipcc fifth assessment record ar5 and analysed the impacts in the near future short until 2030 and the mid future medium until 2050 the short term time frame was selected to show the potential changes expected to occur in the coming next decade and to show the necessity for immediate actions the medium term scenario was chosen to show the consequences of climate change at a time scale still relevant for today s population due to the capabilities of management and plants to adapt to changes in climate as well as long term reactions of the farming community to adapt to new environmental conditions we do not include a long term impact assessment for the short and medium term scenarios we assumed that factors such as plant genetics and management strategies remain constant and at a current level the projections of future co2 concentration were based on van vuuren et al 2011 and were assumed to be 420 ppm co2 rcp 4 5 and 450 ppm co2 rcp 8 5 during the time period 2021 2030 and 470 ppm co2 rcp 4 5 and 520 ppm co2 rcp 8 5 for the period 2041 2050 the study uses climate projections based on the older representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios used in cmip5 rather than the newer shared socio economic pathways ssp scenarios from cmip6 in terms of co2 emission scenarios the scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 used in this study can be compared with the ssp2 4 5 and the early century ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively fuglestvedt et al 2021 we acknowledge that the newer climate projections might yield slightly different results however these are rather small given the mid century time frame of the analysis until 2050 in which cmip5 and cmip6 scenarios are still comparable fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation results of swat and apsim the skill of both the models to correctly reproduce plant water demands was validated against observed crop specific evapotranspiration et rates for the years 2009 2010 validation results are given in terms of mean monthly absolute et values and the coefficient of determination r2 in table 1 the skill of the models to correctly reproduce plant growths dynamics was validated against observed yield data for the province punjab for the years 2002 2013 validation results of yield simulations are given in terms of mean absolute yields and the relative error re in table 2 and are visualised in fig 2 both models show their strengths in their respective domains swat performs slightly better in reproducing et due to its focus on hydrological processes and apsim performs better in yields due to its focus on plant growth dynamics all models overestimate evapotranspiration rates and with the exemption of the swat rice model they all overestimate crop yields this consistent overestimation of et and yield is not surprising considering the fact that we simulate hypothetical cases in which farm management practices are assumed to be close to optimal with sufficient water and fertilizer supply even though this is not a perfect representation of reality it is an important assumption in order to rule out yield variations due to management while studying the potential risks of climate impacts on agricultural production note that in this study we use the models for studying relative changes for two future time periods rather than studying the change in absolute values the model structural reasons for the discrepancies in their performances are discussed in more detail further below they give important insights into model uncertainties and their use as climate impact assessment tools 3 2 future climate trends in the lcc study area climate models project a strong increase in temperature over the study region under the high emission scenario rcp 8 5 as well as under the moderate emission scenario rcp 4 5 fig 1c for the summer season may october the ensemble means predict an increase of 1 0 c 0 4 c for rcp 4 5 and 1 0 c 0 3 c for rcp 8 5 until 2030 compared to the reference period of 1996 2005 a warming of 1 6 c 0 5 c and 1 8 c 0 5 c is projected for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively until 2050 fig 4a strong increases in temperature under both scenarios point towards higher pressure on agricultural production resulting from increased heat stress on crop growth especially during summer months ahmad et al 2015 awan et al 2021 yasin et al 2022 during the four central months of the growing season may august mean monthly temperatures are projected to exceed 32 c fig 4b a high agreement between single climate model ensemble members regarding the consistent increase in future temperature indicates that the future summer season warming in the lcc area can be projected with high confidence fig 1c fig 4a and b precipitation projections on the other hand are highly uncertain and no clear trend in annual or monthly precipitation amounts can be detected fig 1d fig 4c and d estimations of future water availability based on precipitation projections for the study area are therefore difficult in this study we assume that due to the constant irrigation activities in the lcc irrigation system agricultural water availability is always assured and plant water demand is met thus impacts of changes in precipitation are small and water stress is kept low scenarios in which future water availability can no longer meet irrigation demands e g due to shrinking surface or groundwater resources are not analysed in this study we focus exclusively on the effects of climate change on agricultural production given sufficient water supply and examine if the pressure on water resources will increase in future 3 3 declining yield levels under increasing temperatures both models swat and apsim show that climate change will lead to a substantial reduction of future yield levels in the study area under current co2 concentrations mean yield levels of all three crops are projected to decrease by up to 24 12 under the high emission and mid century scenario fig 5a light grey bar rcp 8 5 2041 50 swat simulates yield reductions of up to 63 19 for rice 18 12 for cotton and 40 12 for maize apsim simulates yield reductions of up to 22 4 for rice 20 11 for cotton and 12 3 for maize fig 5 a c despite differences in the predicted magnitudes of yield declines swat and apsim models agree in their trends sign and show that increasing yield losses align with increasing temperatures for all crop types considering that water demand and nutrient availability is assumed to be met the results underline that increasing heat stress will play an important role in the decline of future crop yields this is in line with the findings of previous studies which show that declining yields can be strongly related to temperature increases ortiz bobea et al 2019 saddique et al 2020 yasin et al 2022 zhao et al 2017 regional studies from pakistan agree with our results and show that heat stress is the major factor threatening future yields in important agricultural regions in pakistan awan et al 2021 khan et al 2021 yasin et al 2022 exact estimates of projected yield declines for our study region and our selected crops vary the above cited studies suggest yield declines of approx up to 17 to 25 in rice yields khan et al 2021 up to 30 in cotton yields awan et al 2021 and 8 to 55 in maize yields yasin et al 2022 for mid century climate change scenarios in addition it is worth noticing that the negative effects of rising temperatures on yields are often non linear lobell et al 2011 schauberger et al 2017 schlenker and roberts 2009 of particular importance is the exceedance of crop specific critical temperature thresholds above which crops experience significant yield reductions cotton which has a higher optimal temperature approx 30 32 c reddy et al 1999 schlenker and roberts 2009 and thus a higher heat resistance than rice approx 25 c luo 2011 and maize approx 29 c schlenker and roberts 2009 can therefore better cope with elevated temperatures this is also reflected in the results of this study which show a strong crop specific sensitivity to heat stress with stronger heat stress impacts for rice and maize and a lower heat stress impact for cotton furthermore swat shows significantly higher sensitivities to temperature than apsim resulting in strong yield declines for all three crops the stronger temperature sensitivity of swat explains the larger uncertainties in swat yield predictions as temperature projections of the nine selected climate models are stronger reflected in the final swat results compared to aspim results despite the differences between apsim and swat estimates simulated yield losses of both models are unequivocal and would have large implications for future agricultural productivity in the study area 3 4 impact of rising co2 on plant development increasing atmospheric co2 levels dampen the negative effects of rising temperatures on yields and reveals the significant positive effect of elevated co2 concentrations on agricultural productivity fig 5 dark grey bars this effect is also known as co2 fertilization for the short term scenario 2021 2030 increasing co2 concentrations could even prevent a significant decline in simulated crop yields apsim results show that average yield losses could be approx 4 4 rcp4 5 2021 2030 to 6 rcp8 5 2021 2030 less severe due to increasing co2 concentrations averaging yield levels of all tree crops swat projects a full offset of climate related yield losses under enhanced co2 levels for the short term scenario swat simulates increasing yields of 1 8 rcp4 5 to 5 5 rcp8 5 fig 5a strong positive effects of increasing co2 concentrations on plant growth as seen in our results have proven to counteract plant growth limiting effects parry et al 2004 singh et al 2020 at this point it is worth to recall that in this study we assume a sufficient supply of nutrients at any time nutrient stress would limit the co2 fertilization effect reich et al 2014 but in this study the positive effect of co2 enrichment on plant development is unimpeded overall the effectiveness of co2 fertilization is still a large source of uncertainty elliott et al 2014 mcgrath and lobell 2013 which is yet to be improved in bio physical crop models toreti et al 2020 in the context of our study uncertainty arises through the differences in representing co2 impacts on plant physiology by swat and apsim swat accounts for the positive effects of co2 by increasing the radiation use efficiency of plants under rising co2 levels eqs s1 and s2 this increases the plants ability to capture photosynthetically active radiation and leads to more efficient biomass production yet the model equally applies this formulation to all crops irrespective of their different photosynthetic pathways i e c3 or c4 pathway hence the agro hydrological swat model does not account for plant type specific impacts of co2 and might overestimate the positive effects of co2 wu et al 2012 the apsim crop models on the other hand consider plant specific impacts vanuytrecht and thorburn 2017 in the case of c3 plants such as rice and cotton the models account for the photorespiratory part in the photosynthetic process e g eq s8 for cotton higher photorespiration lowers carbon assimilation under stress conditions and elevates it under higher co2 concentrations morison and lawlor d w 1999 the apsim maize model fig 5c correctly assumes insensitivity to changing co2 effects for c4 plants while this leads to unchanged maize yields with respect to co2 changes in apsim simulations swat assumes positive effects of co2 on maize growth for cotton rising co2 levels lead to increased cotton yields of approx up to 6 apsim and 14 swat until 2050 under the high emission scenario fig 5b likewise the simulated rice dynamics are consistent in both models rice yields fig 5d experience similar positive impacts under rising co2 levels compared to cotton both c3 plants but their yield reductions due to heat stress are too severe to be compensated by increasing co2 concentrations fig 5d large discrepancies in the rice and maize simulations of the two models can be seen with respect to temperature changes these are further discussed below previous studies have indicated that increasing co2 improves water use efficiency by reducing plant transpiration which facilitates plant growth during drought conditions singh et al 2020 wullschleger et al 2002 yoo et al 2009 at the same time it has also been reported that reduced plant transpiration leads to increased heat stress due to reduced evaporative cooling siebert et al 2014 vanuytrecht et al 2012 these two effects are currently not captured by either of the models as the strong increase in future temperature is projected under both rcp scenarios and together with the abundance of water due to irrigation the positive effect of co2 on yield levels is most likely overestimated by both crop models under further rising temperatures scenarios for the period 2041 2050 apsim and swat project a decline in crop yields indicating that even with further elevated co2 concentrations and unlimited water and nutrient availability climate change induced yield declines cannot be prevented apsim projects an average yield decline of 8 3 rcp 4 5 and 7 2 3 rcp 8 5 while swat projects a similar yield decline with larger uncertainties of 7 13 rcp 4 5 and 7 18 rcp 8 5 all estimated crop yields show that the positive effects of increasing co2 levels are likely to diminish as temperatures continue to rise fig 5a 3 5 future irrigation and evaporative demand in the following we analyse if rising temperatures will lead to an increase in irrigation demand and if irrigation is an effective measure to counteract the severe yield losses further we discuss the reasons behind estimated yield declines in the context of changes in irrigation demand and evapotranspiration et considering the significant temperature increase one would expect a strong increasing signal in plant water demand döll 2002 wada et al 2013 examining irrigation and evaporative demands in the study area however reveals that trends in future water demand do not align with projected temperature trends against the expectation of increasing irrigation needs due to rising temperatures both crop models show that average irrigation demands increase less under higher temperatures under both emission scenarios and for both models the strongest increase in irrigation demand is predicted for the moderate short term scenario rcp 4 5 2021 2030 while less increase is predicted for the high end emission scenario rcp 8 5 2041 2050 fig 6 displays the results for apsim and swat separately to reveal important differences in their simulation results results are averaged over the selected summer crops cotton maize and rice to focus on unraveling the complex dynamics of heat and water stress interactions under different climate scenarios crop specific results are presented in more detail the supplementary material figs s4 s5 for conditions with historical co2 levels swat projects the lowest irrigation needs for the rcp 8 5 and mid term future scenario increase of irrigation needs by 1 8 fig 6a under elevated co2 concentrations fig 6b water demand even reduces 4 7 which agrees with the effect of reduced plant water needs due to reduced stomatal conductance fernández martínez et al 2019 kimball et al 2002 for the same scenario irrigation demand simulated by apsim will increase by approx 5 5 it appears insensitive to co2 changes as irrigation demand remains constant regardless of changes in co2 levels fig 6a vs b yet the significant increase in lai under elevated co2 levels fig 6b as well as the negligible change in irrigation demand illustrates that apsim likewise accounts for positive co2 effects on water demand and shows decreasing irrigation demand relative to leaf area growth the reason for the surprisingly low increase in irrigation needs can be explained by a similarly low increase in actual evapotranspiration rates fig 6c and d irrespective of the strong temperature rise up to 1 8 c until 2041 2050 increases in et are projected by both crop models to stay on average below 3 4 for model differences see fig 6 and do not increase with further rising temperatures finally the fact that biomass and yield strongly decline while future irrigation demands do not align with future temperature trends indicates that even if more water for intensified irrigation activity would be applied it would not help to prevent yield losses when significant heat stress is the main yield controlling factor this is further underlined by the strong impact of heat stress on leaf area growth and the already mentioned dynamics of biomass production which are discussed in more detail below 3 6 future plant growth and plant productivity swat model results suggest a significant reduction in lai by up to 27 6 under the high emission scenario median of all three crop models for rcp 8 5 2041 2050 crop specific declines are estimated to be up to 31 for maize 25 for cotton and 58 for rice fig s8 the decreasing lai trend clearly follows the increasing temperature trend with the highest lai reductions under the rcp 8 5 scenario fig 6a and reveals a strong sensitivity of leaf area growth to temperature changes fig 6c the reason for this strong temperature sensitivity is the following swat estimates lai development based on the influence of one predominant environmental stress factor eq s4 which is heat stress in this study further lai calculations in swat do not account for co2 effects fig 7a vs b which results in strong lai decreases even under higher co2 concentrations fig 7b and in decreasing et rates fig 7d apsim on the other hand which does not account for a specific heat stress factor in its lai calculations shows a clear lai insensitivity to temperature fig 7a vs b apsim leaf area calculations are primarily controlled by water stress but as constant water supply is guaranteed in this study lai development is unimpeded yet apsim lai predictions show a notable sensitivity to co2 concentrations and increasing leaf growth under rising co2 levels for c3 plants consequently apsim based simulated lais are projected to increase by up to 15 10 under the high emission scenario which explains why apsim et rates do not decrease despite et reducing co2 effects fig 5d crop specific results are 1 for maize c4 plant 24 for cotton and 29 for rice both c3 plants fig s8 similar effects were observed and described by singh et al 2020 revealing a strong increase in lai due to co2 increases offsetting higher water use efficiency as leaf area and temperature jointly control the evaporative demands and ultimately irrigation water needs the differences in lai simulations highlight the importance of model sensitivity to heat stress the differences in the underlying model structures result in two dissimilar conclusions on the one hand swat projects a decline in future plant growth which is strong enough to reduce et and irrigation demand this leads to the conclusion that irrigation intensification cannot help to mitigate future yield losses apsim on the other hand forecast increasing leaf area growth and indicates that intensified irrigation will be needed due to the resulting albeit modest rise in water demands yet even in the latter case intensified irrigation cannot prevent future yield losses the discrepancy between the projected increase in lai and the decrease in biomass estimates by apsim results from the way apsim accounts for biomass partitioning processes as a biophysical crop model apsim accounts for carbon assimilation in different plant fragments such as leaves stem fruits and roots the produced biomass can dynamically be allocated to different plant parts leaf area can therefore remain constant or even increase while the overall biomass decreases while swat and apsim disagree in their lai estimates both models predict a substantial reduction in plant biomass under increasing temperatures fig 7c under historical co2 levels swat predicts a reduction in biomass of up to 33 11 up to 41 for maize 20 for cotton and 64 for rice while apsim predicts a reduction of up to 25 11 up to 17 for maize 23 for cotton and 5 for rice rcp 8 5 2041 2050 to this end both models show a good agreement in their predicting trends and in their sensitivity towards co2 changes rising co2 levels might compensate negative temperature effects in the near future but for the mid century scenario 2041 2050 biomass is projected to decline despite further elevated co2 levels fig 7d this aligns with observations which show a clear temperature dependent co2 fertilization effect fernández martínez et al 2019 as mentioned above elevated co2 concentrations can lead to an enhanced carbon fixation rate under higher co2 concentrations yet at the same time it has been reported that reduced plant transpiration due to enhanced co2 availability leads to increased heat stress the reason is reduced evaporative cooling which induces higher leaf and plant organ temperatures siebert et al 2014 vanuytrecht et al 2012 at the same time the temperature increase can speed up the plant development and lead to less time for carbon assimilation and reduced biomass production the results are supported by morison and lawlor d w 1999 who point out that a temperature increase of just a few tenths of a degree can act cumulatively over time and can significantly accelerate plant development and reduce time for biomass production recalling that both models assume a sufficient supply of irrigation water and enough nutrient supply our results reveal once more that heat stress is the dominating factor controlling future yield developments we therefore conclude that the mitigation potential of irrigation to counteract future yield losses is severely limited under further rising temperatures an intensification of irrigation might be able to mitigate yield declines in the near future when positive co2 effects balance the harmful temperature effects and irrigation demands are still increasing fig 6b for the mid century scenario however the positive co2 effects as well as irrigation intensification will not be able to compensate for the yield losses 4 conclusions the study examines potential climate change impacts on cotton maize and rice crops in the punjab region of pakistan the main finding is that under expected climate change scenarios a substantial reduction in summer crop yields is likely to occur in the study region it could be shown that plant development is dominantly controlled by heat stress and that negative climate change impacts on agricultural production can only be marginally mitigated by an intensification of irrigation in the medium term future under further rising temperatures irrigation cannot prevent increasing yield losses temperature related adaptation strategies such as the selection of more heat resistant crops or changes in crop planting schedules seem therefore more suitable than water related adaptation measures this aligns with current efforts in pakistan to re define eco agrological zones according to changing climate patterns and to choose earlier planting dates to avoid summer heat waves by using two models from different scientific disciplines and with two different model architectures the study is able to point out important model structural limitations which influence the final results of climate impacts on local crop production and water demands lai simulations and the simulation of co2 sensitivities were identified as important model routines leading to discrepancies in the results of our climate change impact assessment using the swat and the apsim models this also leads to important differences in the estimation of irrigation water demand we therefore conclude by suggesting a better combination of the strengths of hydrological and biophysical crop models the integration of more robust hydrological routines into biophysical crop models is a promising way forward such a hard coupled model integration will be valuable for agricultural climate change impact studies as it enables a simultaneous consideration of the hydroclimatic environment with specific bio physical responses of plants to climate

8996,climate change and variability threaten the sustainability of future food production especially in semi arid regions where water resources are limited and irrigated agriculture is widespread increasing temperatures will exacerbate evaporative losses and increase plant water needs in this regard higher irrigation intensities have been posited as a solution to mitigate climate change impacts in these regions here using the agro hydrological model swat and the biophysical crop model apsim we show that this mitigation measure is oversimplified we find that heat stress driven by strong temperature increases might be the dominating factor in controlling future crop yields and plant water needs our analysis encompasses agricultural areas of the lower chenab canal system in punjab pakistan 15 000 km2 which is part of the indus river irrigation system the largest irrigation system in the world covering major cotton rice and maize cropping zones climate models project a strong increase in temperature over the study region of up to 1 8 c 0 5 c until the mid century both models predict a decline in future crop yields for maize and rice crops while cotton yields are less effected by rising temperatures and strongly benefit from elevated atmospheric co2 concentrations for a high carbon emission scenario the models simulate yield declines for maize of up to 10 apsim and 19 swat for rice yields of up to 4 apsim to 26 swat and for cotton yields of 1 apsim to 11 swat until 2050 relative to the baseline scenario 1996 2005 our modeling results further suggest that irrigation demands do not align with increasing temperature trends average irrigation demands increase less under higher temperatures overall our study emphasizes the role of elevated heat stress its effects on agricultural productivity as well as water demand and its implications for climate change adaption strategies to mitigate adverse impacts in an intensively irrigated region plain language summary climate change is one of the most important challenge facing agriculture and hence future food security farmers struggle more and more to ensure a reliable food production this is especially true for semi arid regions where water resources are limited but at the same time urgently needed for irrigation such as in the lower chenab canal area in punjab pakistan the search for adaptation measures to weaken the negative impacts of climate change on agricultural systems becomes increasingly important one option could be the intensification of irrigation we use two models to simulate crop growth processes under various climate conditions our results show that heat stress would be the dominating stress for plants in the selected study region and that this heat stress might even lead to a reduction in water demand intensive irrigation can not necessarily help to prevent climate change related yield losses the models further predict that rising co2 can have a positive effect on crop yield by enhancing plant growth nevertheless our results indicate that these positive effects could not compensate the negative impacts of heat stress under constantly rising temperatures keywords regional climate change yield water demand swat apsim data availability the data is freely available and i have shared the link to the repository in the manuscript 1 introduction in recent years climate change and its impact on the environment is one of the main concerns facing societies globally specifically its effect on agricultural systems has become a major problem considering the alarming global developments regarding water and food security hanjra and qureshi 2010 schewe et al 2014 one of the latest special report of the un intergovernmental panel on climate change shukla et al 2019 predicts with high confidence that future changes in climatic conditions will exacerbate existing water and food shortages for billions of people one of the main reasons considered responsible for the predicted food shortage is the inability to meet future agricultural water demands fader et al 2016 globally irrigation volumes have more than doubled since the 1960s shukla et al 2019 and are likely to increase further due to climate change in regions with already limited water supply wada et al 2013 wang et al 2016 in semi arid and developing regions like pakistan agriculture is the most important economic sector employing nearly half of the population qureshi 2011 a large part of agricultural workers are small scale farmers who are highly vulnerable to yield losses which have become increasingly frequent in the recent decades oxfam 2009 the projected increase in water scarcity due to climate change along with the increasing demand of the fast growing population poses a severe threat to the national food supply and the production of economically important cash crops such as cotton maize and rice ahmad et al 2015 khan et al 2016 schewe et al 2014 the indus basin in pakistan s punjab province is a hot spot for climate change impacts on water availability and agricultural production as it constitutes one of the world s largest closed irrigation areas mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 irrigation water accounts for over 90 of the total water demand in the region fischer et al 2007 significant climate induced changes in the upstream glacier hydrology the major water source for the indus basin are threatening future water availability in the basin immerzeel et al 2010 along with the rising temperatures which are projected to increase faster than the global average saeed and athar 2018 under such conditions water related adaptation strategies such as increased irrigation amounts and enhanced irrigation efficiency are potential solutions to cope with these challenges the effects of such adaptation measures have been studied for agricultural systems experiencing similar climate change pressures and have been suggested as possible actions elliott et al 2014 fader et al 2016 molden et al 2010 however the direct role of increasing temperatures in affecting crop yields is gaining importance across the globe and could be an important factor in the indus basin temperature induced stress on crop growth could counteract the potential of enhanced irrigation to increase productivity zaveri and lobell 2019 it is therefore imperative to understand the role of temperature stress on crop growth and resulting plant water demand in combination with water stress improved knowledge on the potential impacts of temperature and water stress as well as their interlinkages is important to define adequate adaptation strategies lesk et al 2022 in terms of adequate water availability for crop growth especially in semi arid regions previous studies highlight that there is still very limited understanding of the potentials and limits of irrigation related climate change adaptation tack et al 2017 taraz 2018 and that more research is needed to disentangle the effects of temperature and water stress related climate change impacts on agricultural yields carter et al 2016 the main objective of this study is to quantify the impact of heat stress on yield and crop water demand in the lower chenab canal system in pakistan we hypothesize that future temperature conditions will have a strong negative impact on crop yields in our study area further we propose the counter intuitive hypothesis increasing temperatures will lead to a reduction in irrigation requirements driven by a strong decrease in crop growth which leads to reduced plant water needs to assess these hypotheses the study elaborates on how temperature stress controls agricultural productivity and plant water requirements in an intensively irrigated agricultural system to explore whether our counter intuitive assumption that increasing temperatures will lead to decreasing irrigation demands holds true we apply two models the hydrological swat model arnold et al 2012 and the biophysical crop modelling framework apsim holzworth et al 2014 while biophysical crop models are the classical models to be used to assess climate change impacts on crops studies have shown their low performance in reproducing hydrodynamics such as soil moisture storage or plant water availability faria and bowen 2003 which are crucial processes for the estimation of water requirements and demands hydrological models on the other hand show low performances in simulating plant physiological behaviour and yield estimations in this study we therefore use a hydrological and a biophysical crop model in an ensemble framework to assess climate change impacts on crop production as well as climate change impacts on plant water demands a hard coupling of both models is beyond the scope of this study yet the profound comparative analysis of both model types is expected to allow a more detailed understanding of strengths and weaknesses of either model and will result in a more reliable assessment of changes in future yield and water demands uncertainties of the respective model applications are discussed in detail and give valuable insights for modellers of both modelling communities as they reveal important limits of climate impact assessment based on process based hydrological as well as crop models 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is part of the lower chenab canal system area lcc in pakistan which comprises about 15 000 km2 of agricultural land on the floodplains between the rivers chenab and ravi fig 1a and b it belongs to the indus basin irrigation system ibis the world s largest irrigation system feeding more than 200 million people immerzeel et al 2010 the area is characterized by small scale and highly fragmented agricultural cropping patterns during the dry winter season rabi the dominating crop type is winter wheat while during the wetter and hot summer kharif the crop pattern diversifies and mainly cotton maize rice and fodder are grown on small scale farms annual reference evaporation approx 1800 mm a is more than three times larger than annual precipitation approx 500 mm a resulting in a strong demand for additional irrigation knowing about potential negative impacts on agricultural production and defining possible adaptation strategies is therefore of paramount importance for water and food security in this region in this study we focused on analysing the impacts of future climate change on summer crops namely cotton maize and rice grown between may and october impacts are evaluated based on changes in crop yield and relevant hydrologic and biophysical variables including evapotranspiration irrigation demand leaf area growth and biomass production the selected crops represent high value crops with a wide distribution in the study area fig 1a thus changes in their production levels will have significant economic impacts and changes in irrigation needs will have a strong impact on basin wide water demand 2 2 models swat and apsim to analyse climate change impacts on yield and water demand we apply two models from different scientific disciplines we consider the agro hydrological swat model arnold et al 2012 with high performance in simulating complex hydrological plant soil atmosphere interactions and the biophysical crop modelling framework apsim holzworth et al 2014 with high performance in simulating complex plant growth dynamics the models are briefly described below the agro hydrological swat model soil water assessment tool simulates the quantity and quality of water flow within catchments incorporates detailed management strategies e g irrigation schedules planting schedules and basic plant physiognomic stages e g root development leaf area development and biomass change arnold et al 2012 gassman et al 2014 the main underlying principle for the simulation of water fluxes is the water balance closure neitsch et al 2009 swat accounts for spatially distributed environmental and climatic changes and it simulates their effects on individual water balance components such as evapotranspiration infiltration soil moisture changes and runoff fig 2 its strengths are therefore the detection of spatially distributed changes in water availability and demand impacts of increasing atmospheric co2 concentrations are accounted for in the estimation of potential evapotranspiration affecting i e reducing plant water demand as well as in the estimation of plant radiation use efficiency affecting i e enhancing biomass production to ensure correct and spatially differentiated parameterization the model is calibrated following an automated and spatially distributed calibration approach a detailed description of this calibration procedure can be found in becker et al 2019 in this study the model was run on a daily timescale with daily climate input data the spatially distributed swat results are averaged over each respective crop growing region resulting in one maize one rice and one cotton data set the agricultural production system simulator apsim is a biophysical crop modelling framework which simulates agricultural crop dynamics with respect to varying climatic and environmental conditions holzworth et al 2014 it has been extensively used to assess climate change impacts on agricultural productivity deihimfard et al 2018 gaydon et al 2021 khaliq et al 2019 model performance and applications are studied in depths within the scope of the agricultural modelling intercomparison and improvement project agmip boote et al 2021 rosenzweig et al 2014 in which apsim was applied in the same study region of southern punjab to assess climate change impact on crop production focus and strength of the apsim framework is the plant specific simulation of biophysical dynamics such as biomass production yield or root growths fig 2 due to its modular approach with individual sub models for each crop type it can account for plant specific reactions to climate change for example with individual models for cotton rice and maize it accounts for plant type specific carbon assimilation processes c3 vs c4 plants and hence differentiates between plant type reactions to increased atmospheric co2 levels different to swat apsim is a plot scale model to allow for a model comparison between the spatially distributed swat model and apsim we calibrated the apsim model by adopting the most important soil and management parameter configurations from the calibrated swat model to rule out uncertainties which would arise due to spatial differences in soil and climate conditions over the large lcc area we conducted a sensitivity analysis to analyse the effect of varying soil and climate parameters on apsim simulated crop yields this further allowed us to constrain appropriate parameters for the apsim model soil parameters were furthermore verified through laboratory analysis of soil samples collected during a field campaign in the study region schulz et al 2021 details of the used parameters and underlying estimation procedure for both crop models are described in the supplementary information s2 and tables s1 s3 like the swat model apsim was run on a daily time scale with daily climate input data two central management related assumptions were made in both models i water stress is minimized by including regular irrigation events as soon as soil moisture drops below 90 and ii nutrient stress is minimized by assuring sufficient fertilizer application applying 100 kg ha of nitrogenous fertilizer at each irrigation event simulated trends of future yield biomass production evapotranspiration lai and water demand can therefore be ascribed to the effect of temperature increase by ruling out the influence of irrigation and nutrient management the skill of both models to correctly reproduce plant water demands was validated against observed crop specific evapotranspiration et rates for the years 2009 2010 this time period was chosen based on the availability of high resolution and crop specific et data to validate the model performances with respect to yield simulations annual yield estimates were validated using observed yield data provided by agricultural statistics of pakistan published by the ministry of national food security research mnfsr 2021 observed yield data could be obtained for the years 2002 2013 at the province level for the province of punjab 2 3 climate data sets daily climate forecast system reanalysis data saha et al 2010 was taken as historical reference climate data for a baseline period 1996 2005 the data set encompasses temperature precipitation relative humidity solar radiation and wind speed to ensure the accuracy of the baseline data set the cfsr data was bias corrected using climate records of three available local climate stations supplementary section 1 1 climate projection datasets were taken from the coordinated regional downscaling experiment cordex which provides a suite of regional climate projections based on the global climate models of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 taylor et al 2012 we considered medium rcp 4 5 and high rcp 8 5 greenhouse gas emission scenarios from the ipcc fifth assessment record ar5 and analysed the impacts in the near future short until 2030 and the mid future medium until 2050 the short term time frame was selected to show the potential changes expected to occur in the coming next decade and to show the necessity for immediate actions the medium term scenario was chosen to show the consequences of climate change at a time scale still relevant for today s population due to the capabilities of management and plants to adapt to changes in climate as well as long term reactions of the farming community to adapt to new environmental conditions we do not include a long term impact assessment for the short and medium term scenarios we assumed that factors such as plant genetics and management strategies remain constant and at a current level the projections of future co2 concentration were based on van vuuren et al 2011 and were assumed to be 420 ppm co2 rcp 4 5 and 450 ppm co2 rcp 8 5 during the time period 2021 2030 and 470 ppm co2 rcp 4 5 and 520 ppm co2 rcp 8 5 for the period 2041 2050 the study uses climate projections based on the older representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios used in cmip5 rather than the newer shared socio economic pathways ssp scenarios from cmip6 in terms of co2 emission scenarios the scenarios rcp 4 5 and rcp 8 5 used in this study can be compared with the ssp2 4 5 and the early century ssp5 8 5 scenario respectively fuglestvedt et al 2021 we acknowledge that the newer climate projections might yield slightly different results however these are rather small given the mid century time frame of the analysis until 2050 in which cmip5 and cmip6 scenarios are still comparable fig 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 validation results of swat and apsim the skill of both the models to correctly reproduce plant water demands was validated against observed crop specific evapotranspiration et rates for the years 2009 2010 validation results are given in terms of mean monthly absolute et values and the coefficient of determination r2 in table 1 the skill of the models to correctly reproduce plant growths dynamics was validated against observed yield data for the province punjab for the years 2002 2013 validation results of yield simulations are given in terms of mean absolute yields and the relative error re in table 2 and are visualised in fig 2 both models show their strengths in their respective domains swat performs slightly better in reproducing et due to its focus on hydrological processes and apsim performs better in yields due to its focus on plant growth dynamics all models overestimate evapotranspiration rates and with the exemption of the swat rice model they all overestimate crop yields this consistent overestimation of et and yield is not surprising considering the fact that we simulate hypothetical cases in which farm management practices are assumed to be close to optimal with sufficient water and fertilizer supply even though this is not a perfect representation of reality it is an important assumption in order to rule out yield variations due to management while studying the potential risks of climate impacts on agricultural production note that in this study we use the models for studying relative changes for two future time periods rather than studying the change in absolute values the model structural reasons for the discrepancies in their performances are discussed in more detail further below they give important insights into model uncertainties and their use as climate impact assessment tools 3 2 future climate trends in the lcc study area climate models project a strong increase in temperature over the study region under the high emission scenario rcp 8 5 as well as under the moderate emission scenario rcp 4 5 fig 1c for the summer season may october the ensemble means predict an increase of 1 0 c 0 4 c for rcp 4 5 and 1 0 c 0 3 c for rcp 8 5 until 2030 compared to the reference period of 1996 2005 a warming of 1 6 c 0 5 c and 1 8 c 0 5 c is projected for rcp 4 5 and 8 5 respectively until 2050 fig 4a strong increases in temperature under both scenarios point towards higher pressure on agricultural production resulting from increased heat stress on crop growth especially during summer months ahmad et al 2015 awan et al 2021 yasin et al 2022 during the four central months of the growing season may august mean monthly temperatures are projected to exceed 32 c fig 4b a high agreement between single climate model ensemble members regarding the consistent increase in future temperature indicates that the future summer season warming in the lcc area can be projected with high confidence fig 1c fig 4a and b precipitation projections on the other hand are highly uncertain and no clear trend in annual or monthly precipitation amounts can be detected fig 1d fig 4c and d estimations of future water availability based on precipitation projections for the study area are therefore difficult in this study we assume that due to the constant irrigation activities in the lcc irrigation system agricultural water availability is always assured and plant water demand is met thus impacts of changes in precipitation are small and water stress is kept low scenarios in which future water availability can no longer meet irrigation demands e g due to shrinking surface or groundwater resources are not analysed in this study we focus exclusively on the effects of climate change on agricultural production given sufficient water supply and examine if the pressure on water resources will increase in future 3 3 declining yield levels under increasing temperatures both models swat and apsim show that climate change will lead to a substantial reduction of future yield levels in the study area under current co2 concentrations mean yield levels of all three crops are projected to decrease by up to 24 12 under the high emission and mid century scenario fig 5a light grey bar rcp 8 5 2041 50 swat simulates yield reductions of up to 63 19 for rice 18 12 for cotton and 40 12 for maize apsim simulates yield reductions of up to 22 4 for rice 20 11 for cotton and 12 3 for maize fig 5 a c despite differences in the predicted magnitudes of yield declines swat and apsim models agree in their trends sign and show that increasing yield losses align with increasing temperatures for all crop types considering that water demand and nutrient availability is assumed to be met the results underline that increasing heat stress will play an important role in the decline of future crop yields this is in line with the findings of previous studies which show that declining yields can be strongly related to temperature increases ortiz bobea et al 2019 saddique et al 2020 yasin et al 2022 zhao et al 2017 regional studies from pakistan agree with our results and show that heat stress is the major factor threatening future yields in important agricultural regions in pakistan awan et al 2021 khan et al 2021 yasin et al 2022 exact estimates of projected yield declines for our study region and our selected crops vary the above cited studies suggest yield declines of approx up to 17 to 25 in rice yields khan et al 2021 up to 30 in cotton yields awan et al 2021 and 8 to 55 in maize yields yasin et al 2022 for mid century climate change scenarios in addition it is worth noticing that the negative effects of rising temperatures on yields are often non linear lobell et al 2011 schauberger et al 2017 schlenker and roberts 2009 of particular importance is the exceedance of crop specific critical temperature thresholds above which crops experience significant yield reductions cotton which has a higher optimal temperature approx 30 32 c reddy et al 1999 schlenker and roberts 2009 and thus a higher heat resistance than rice approx 25 c luo 2011 and maize approx 29 c schlenker and roberts 2009 can therefore better cope with elevated temperatures this is also reflected in the results of this study which show a strong crop specific sensitivity to heat stress with stronger heat stress impacts for rice and maize and a lower heat stress impact for cotton furthermore swat shows significantly higher sensitivities to temperature than apsim resulting in strong yield declines for all three crops the stronger temperature sensitivity of swat explains the larger uncertainties in swat yield predictions as temperature projections of the nine selected climate models are stronger reflected in the final swat results compared to aspim results despite the differences between apsim and swat estimates simulated yield losses of both models are unequivocal and would have large implications for future agricultural productivity in the study area 3 4 impact of rising co2 on plant development increasing atmospheric co2 levels dampen the negative effects of rising temperatures on yields and reveals the significant positive effect of elevated co2 concentrations on agricultural productivity fig 5 dark grey bars this effect is also known as co2 fertilization for the short term scenario 2021 2030 increasing co2 concentrations could even prevent a significant decline in simulated crop yields apsim results show that average yield losses could be approx 4 4 rcp4 5 2021 2030 to 6 rcp8 5 2021 2030 less severe due to increasing co2 concentrations averaging yield levels of all tree crops swat projects a full offset of climate related yield losses under enhanced co2 levels for the short term scenario swat simulates increasing yields of 1 8 rcp4 5 to 5 5 rcp8 5 fig 5a strong positive effects of increasing co2 concentrations on plant growth as seen in our results have proven to counteract plant growth limiting effects parry et al 2004 singh et al 2020 at this point it is worth to recall that in this study we assume a sufficient supply of nutrients at any time nutrient stress would limit the co2 fertilization effect reich et al 2014 but in this study the positive effect of co2 enrichment on plant development is unimpeded overall the effectiveness of co2 fertilization is still a large source of uncertainty elliott et al 2014 mcgrath and lobell 2013 which is yet to be improved in bio physical crop models toreti et al 2020 in the context of our study uncertainty arises through the differences in representing co2 impacts on plant physiology by swat and apsim swat accounts for the positive effects of co2 by increasing the radiation use efficiency of plants under rising co2 levels eqs s1 and s2 this increases the plants ability to capture photosynthetically active radiation and leads to more efficient biomass production yet the model equally applies this formulation to all crops irrespective of their different photosynthetic pathways i e c3 or c4 pathway hence the agro hydrological swat model does not account for plant type specific impacts of co2 and might overestimate the positive effects of co2 wu et al 2012 the apsim crop models on the other hand consider plant specific impacts vanuytrecht and thorburn 2017 in the case of c3 plants such as rice and cotton the models account for the photorespiratory part in the photosynthetic process e g eq s8 for cotton higher photorespiration lowers carbon assimilation under stress conditions and elevates it under higher co2 concentrations morison and lawlor d w 1999 the apsim maize model fig 5c correctly assumes insensitivity to changing co2 effects for c4 plants while this leads to unchanged maize yields with respect to co2 changes in apsim simulations swat assumes positive effects of co2 on maize growth for cotton rising co2 levels lead to increased cotton yields of approx up to 6 apsim and 14 swat until 2050 under the high emission scenario fig 5b likewise the simulated rice dynamics are consistent in both models rice yields fig 5d experience similar positive impacts under rising co2 levels compared to cotton both c3 plants but their yield reductions due to heat stress are too severe to be compensated by increasing co2 concentrations fig 5d large discrepancies in the rice and maize simulations of the two models can be seen with respect to temperature changes these are further discussed below previous studies have indicated that increasing co2 improves water use efficiency by reducing plant transpiration which facilitates plant growth during drought conditions singh et al 2020 wullschleger et al 2002 yoo et al 2009 at the same time it has also been reported that reduced plant transpiration leads to increased heat stress due to reduced evaporative cooling siebert et al 2014 vanuytrecht et al 2012 these two effects are currently not captured by either of the models as the strong increase in future temperature is projected under both rcp scenarios and together with the abundance of water due to irrigation the positive effect of co2 on yield levels is most likely overestimated by both crop models under further rising temperatures scenarios for the period 2041 2050 apsim and swat project a decline in crop yields indicating that even with further elevated co2 concentrations and unlimited water and nutrient availability climate change induced yield declines cannot be prevented apsim projects an average yield decline of 8 3 rcp 4 5 and 7 2 3 rcp 8 5 while swat projects a similar yield decline with larger uncertainties of 7 13 rcp 4 5 and 7 18 rcp 8 5 all estimated crop yields show that the positive effects of increasing co2 levels are likely to diminish as temperatures continue to rise fig 5a 3 5 future irrigation and evaporative demand in the following we analyse if rising temperatures will lead to an increase in irrigation demand and if irrigation is an effective measure to counteract the severe yield losses further we discuss the reasons behind estimated yield declines in the context of changes in irrigation demand and evapotranspiration et considering the significant temperature increase one would expect a strong increasing signal in plant water demand döll 2002 wada et al 2013 examining irrigation and evaporative demands in the study area however reveals that trends in future water demand do not align with projected temperature trends against the expectation of increasing irrigation needs due to rising temperatures both crop models show that average irrigation demands increase less under higher temperatures under both emission scenarios and for both models the strongest increase in irrigation demand is predicted for the moderate short term scenario rcp 4 5 2021 2030 while less increase is predicted for the high end emission scenario rcp 8 5 2041 2050 fig 6 displays the results for apsim and swat separately to reveal important differences in their simulation results results are averaged over the selected summer crops cotton maize and rice to focus on unraveling the complex dynamics of heat and water stress interactions under different climate scenarios crop specific results are presented in more detail the supplementary material figs s4 s5 for conditions with historical co2 levels swat projects the lowest irrigation needs for the rcp 8 5 and mid term future scenario increase of irrigation needs by 1 8 fig 6a under elevated co2 concentrations fig 6b water demand even reduces 4 7 which agrees with the effect of reduced plant water needs due to reduced stomatal conductance fernández martínez et al 2019 kimball et al 2002 for the same scenario irrigation demand simulated by apsim will increase by approx 5 5 it appears insensitive to co2 changes as irrigation demand remains constant regardless of changes in co2 levels fig 6a vs b yet the significant increase in lai under elevated co2 levels fig 6b as well as the negligible change in irrigation demand illustrates that apsim likewise accounts for positive co2 effects on water demand and shows decreasing irrigation demand relative to leaf area growth the reason for the surprisingly low increase in irrigation needs can be explained by a similarly low increase in actual evapotranspiration rates fig 6c and d irrespective of the strong temperature rise up to 1 8 c until 2041 2050 increases in et are projected by both crop models to stay on average below 3 4 for model differences see fig 6 and do not increase with further rising temperatures finally the fact that biomass and yield strongly decline while future irrigation demands do not align with future temperature trends indicates that even if more water for intensified irrigation activity would be applied it would not help to prevent yield losses when significant heat stress is the main yield controlling factor this is further underlined by the strong impact of heat stress on leaf area growth and the already mentioned dynamics of biomass production which are discussed in more detail below 3 6 future plant growth and plant productivity swat model results suggest a significant reduction in lai by up to 27 6 under the high emission scenario median of all three crop models for rcp 8 5 2041 2050 crop specific declines are estimated to be up to 31 for maize 25 for cotton and 58 for rice fig s8 the decreasing lai trend clearly follows the increasing temperature trend with the highest lai reductions under the rcp 8 5 scenario fig 6a and reveals a strong sensitivity of leaf area growth to temperature changes fig 6c the reason for this strong temperature sensitivity is the following swat estimates lai development based on the influence of one predominant environmental stress factor eq s4 which is heat stress in this study further lai calculations in swat do not account for co2 effects fig 7a vs b which results in strong lai decreases even under higher co2 concentrations fig 7b and in decreasing et rates fig 7d apsim on the other hand which does not account for a specific heat stress factor in its lai calculations shows a clear lai insensitivity to temperature fig 7a vs b apsim leaf area calculations are primarily controlled by water stress but as constant water supply is guaranteed in this study lai development is unimpeded yet apsim lai predictions show a notable sensitivity to co2 concentrations and increasing leaf growth under rising co2 levels for c3 plants consequently apsim based simulated lais are projected to increase by up to 15 10 under the high emission scenario which explains why apsim et rates do not decrease despite et reducing co2 effects fig 5d crop specific results are 1 for maize c4 plant 24 for cotton and 29 for rice both c3 plants fig s8 similar effects were observed and described by singh et al 2020 revealing a strong increase in lai due to co2 increases offsetting higher water use efficiency as leaf area and temperature jointly control the evaporative demands and ultimately irrigation water needs the differences in lai simulations highlight the importance of model sensitivity to heat stress the differences in the underlying model structures result in two dissimilar conclusions on the one hand swat projects a decline in future plant growth which is strong enough to reduce et and irrigation demand this leads to the conclusion that irrigation intensification cannot help to mitigate future yield losses apsim on the other hand forecast increasing leaf area growth and indicates that intensified irrigation will be needed due to the resulting albeit modest rise in water demands yet even in the latter case intensified irrigation cannot prevent future yield losses the discrepancy between the projected increase in lai and the decrease in biomass estimates by apsim results from the way apsim accounts for biomass partitioning processes as a biophysical crop model apsim accounts for carbon assimilation in different plant fragments such as leaves stem fruits and roots the produced biomass can dynamically be allocated to different plant parts leaf area can therefore remain constant or even increase while the overall biomass decreases while swat and apsim disagree in their lai estimates both models predict a substantial reduction in plant biomass under increasing temperatures fig 7c under historical co2 levels swat predicts a reduction in biomass of up to 33 11 up to 41 for maize 20 for cotton and 64 for rice while apsim predicts a reduction of up to 25 11 up to 17 for maize 23 for cotton and 5 for rice rcp 8 5 2041 2050 to this end both models show a good agreement in their predicting trends and in their sensitivity towards co2 changes rising co2 levels might compensate negative temperature effects in the near future but for the mid century scenario 2041 2050 biomass is projected to decline despite further elevated co2 levels fig 7d this aligns with observations which show a clear temperature dependent co2 fertilization effect fernández martínez et al 2019 as mentioned above elevated co2 concentrations can lead to an enhanced carbon fixation rate under higher co2 concentrations yet at the same time it has been reported that reduced plant transpiration due to enhanced co2 availability leads to increased heat stress the reason is reduced evaporative cooling which induces higher leaf and plant organ temperatures siebert et al 2014 vanuytrecht et al 2012 at the same time the temperature increase can speed up the plant development and lead to less time for carbon assimilation and reduced biomass production the results are supported by morison and lawlor d w 1999 who point out that a temperature increase of just a few tenths of a degree can act cumulatively over time and can significantly accelerate plant development and reduce time for biomass production recalling that both models assume a sufficient supply of irrigation water and enough nutrient supply our results reveal once more that heat stress is the dominating factor controlling future yield developments we therefore conclude that the mitigation potential of irrigation to counteract future yield losses is severely limited under further rising temperatures an intensification of irrigation might be able to mitigate yield declines in the near future when positive co2 effects balance the harmful temperature effects and irrigation demands are still increasing fig 6b for the mid century scenario however the positive co2 effects as well as irrigation intensification will not be able to compensate for the yield losses 4 conclusions the study examines potential climate change impacts on cotton maize and rice crops in the punjab region of pakistan the main finding is that under expected climate change scenarios a substantial reduction in summer crop yields is likely to occur in the study region it could be shown that plant development is dominantly controlled by heat stress and that negative climate change impacts on agricultural production can only be marginally mitigated by an intensification of irrigation in the medium term future under further rising temperatures irrigation cannot prevent increasing yield losses temperature related adaptation strategies such as the selection of more heat resistant crops or changes in crop planting schedules seem therefore more suitable than water related adaptation measures this aligns with current efforts in pakistan to re define eco agrological zones according to changing climate patterns and to choose earlier planting dates to avoid summer heat waves by using two models from different scientific disciplines and with two different model architectures the study is able to point out important model structural limitations which influence the final results of climate impacts on local crop production and water demands lai simulations and the simulation of co2 sensitivities were identified as important model routines leading to discrepancies in the results of our climate change impact assessment using the swat and the apsim models this also leads to important differences in the estimation of irrigation water demand we therefore conclude by suggesting a better combination of the strengths of hydrological and biophysical crop models the integration of more robust hydrological routines into biophysical crop models is a promising way forward such a hard coupled model integration will be valuable for agricultural climate change impact studies as it enables a simultaneous consideration of the hydroclimatic environment with specific bio physical responses of plants to climate

8997,vineyards occupy large areas in many mediterranean agroecosystems in which their evapotranspiration is a major component of the water cycle the correct determination of the actual crop evapotranspiration eta is critical for accurate irrigation scheduling allowing to match irrigation applications to crop water needs this study was conducted to monitor the vineyard eta and its partitioning into soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t under deficit irrigation and rainfed conditions and to obtain the relationship between the estimated relative water stress coefficient ks r and measured midday stem water potential ψstem a 2 year field experiment was carried out in a monastrell commercial vineyard located in fuente álamo albacete se spain thermal infrared radiometers were deployed in both treatments together with a weather station to gather all the inputs required in the simplified two source energy balance stseb approach results showed that the accumulated eta ranged between 183 and 253 mm for the irrigated treatment and between 121 and 158 mm for the rainfed conditions canopy transpiration in the irrigation treatment almost double the value obtained in rainfed conditions for both years and the ratio t eta increases around 8 9 in the irrigation treatment the e component ranged from 21 for the irrigated treatment up to 50 for the rainfed treatment confirming its importance in the vineyard water balance a good linear relationship r2 0 650 was obtained between ks r and ψstem indicating the potential of using a surface energy balance approach in conjunction with plant radiometric temperature measurements to monitor the vines water status moreover the rainfed treatment reduced the values of stomatal conductance gs transpiration el and net photosynthesis an compared to the irrigated treatment whereas no increase in the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei nor the instantaneous water use efficiency wueinst was observed the reported results will be useful for improving deficit irrigation scheduling techniques for monastrell red grapes keywords actual evapotranspiration grapevine water stress stress coefficient wue radiometric temperature data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction grapevines occupy large areas in traditional european countries i e spain italy and france and in other countries around the world such as the usa china and argentina sadras et al 2012 many of these vineyards are located in arid and semi arid environments in which their evapotranspiration is a major component of the water cycle trambouze and voltz 2001 currently there is 7 5 million ha of vineyards worldwide producing over 85 million mg of grapes resulting in about 280 million hectoliters of wine which generates a value market of 30 525 million euros in sales oiv 2019 the region of castilla la mancha spain has the largest surface area devoted to grapevines in the world with more than 465 000 ha representing about 48 of the spanish harvested grapevine area and the wine industry employs a significant portion of the agricultural labor furthermore the wine sector is not only of great economic but also social cultural and environmental importance in this region mapa 2020 in spain there are currently almost 400 000 ha of vineyard under irrigation accounting for 41 of the total harvested area whereas in the study area la mancha the irrigated vineyard area exceeds 50 of the total harvested area mapa 2020 although vineyards were traditionally cultivated under rainfed conditions the grapevine area under irrigation is increasing year by year as the data presented above show due to aspects related to wine quality and yield stability moreover in areas with very high evaporative demand i e arid and semi arid conditions and scarce and erratic precipitation patterns throughout the grapevine growing season irrigation becomes necessary for yield intensification and even for the survival of vines aiming at achieving an economically profitable activity in water scarce areas such as la mancha irrigation is conditional on water availability and the standard allocation ranges between about 700 and 1300 m3 ha 1 year 1 therefore well below the potential vine crop evapotranspiration etc lópez urrea et al 2012 2020 an accurate estimation of the actual crop evapotranspiration eta is important to achieve more effective irrigation scheduling chávez et al 2009 evett et al 2012 kustas et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 this becomes critical in arid and semi arid environments where eta plays a key role in both the water and energy balances also the climate change scenarios forecasted for coming years ipcc 2022 are boosting strategies to reduce the farm consumptive water and deficit irrigation is a well known technique which efficiency needs to be explored under the conditions of this study a good knowledge on the vineyard water requirements is essential for a correct irrigation strategy furthermore water management is a critical driver to improve vine performance and grape and wine composition intrigliolo and castel 2008 irrigating grapevines to fulfil potential vine evapotranspiration etc i e for pristine non stressed cropping conditions normally reduces wine quality williams and matthews 1990 and many studies have attempted to identify the effects of the irrigation regime and water status on grape and wine composition see for instance review by mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 these kind of studies are still needed because it seems that the final effects of irrigation on grape and wine composition are very dependent on many local factors and it is not easy to derive general conclusions however the research attempting to quantify vineyard water use is much scarcer despite the importance of obtaining more quantitative information on how irrigation regime and vine water status determine grapevine water use and its productivity buesa et al 2022 this is particularly important to correctly determine the effects of water status on the vine water balance and to properly assess the vineyard agro ecosystem sustainability in response to the irrigation regime applied in this sense while previous studies have recently reported how water use and crop coefficients vary among the season under conditions of no soil water limitations picón toro et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 munitz et al 2019 the information under some water stress conditions has not been so well documented buesa et al 2022 for all these reasons an accurate estimation of vineyard evapotranspiration in semi arid regions becomes crucial a variety of methods and techniques have been reported in the literature to derive actual water use or evapotranspiration in this crop

evaporation e and canopy transpiration t contribute to better determining the water use efficiency of crops especially under these environmental conditions kustas et al 2018 lópez urrea et al 2012 surface energy balance has been shown effective for both aims ortega farias et al 2007 2008 zhang et al shapland et al 2012 gonzález dugo et al xia et al 2016 nieto et al 2018 kustas et al 2018 andreu

components using ground measurements of soil ts and canopy tc temperatures the assessment of this methodology was evaluated using both lysimeter and eddy covariance measurements in a drip irrigated vineyard in southeastern spain sánchez et al 2019 and will be now adapted for the present work this study was aimed at a monitoring the actual vineyard evapotranspiration eta and its partitioning into

álamo albacete se spain 38 43 n 1 28 w at an altitude of 820 m a s l fig 1 according to the soil survey staff 2014 the soil texture is sandy loam with 56 sand 27 silt and 17 clay with a basic ph 8 9 and an average bulk density of 1 17 g cm 3 average soil depth of the vineyard plot is 0 90 m the vineyard floor was maintained with bare soil soil tillage was carried out with a cultivator three times per season in autumn early and late spring the ploughing depth was at most 15 cm during the experiment and also for at least 10 years before it began the space between vines was maintained without weeds using herbicide the climate is semi arid temperate mediterranean with very hot and dry summers the long term 20 year mean average annual precipitation is about 290 mm which is mainly

netherlands all meteorological data were stored in a cr1000 data logger logger campbell scientific inc logan utah the vineyard vitis vinifera l cv monastrell was planted in 2007 grafted onto paulsen 1103 rootstock on a 6 8 ha vineyard vine spacing was 1 5 m within row and 3 0 m inter row giving 2222 vines ha 1 vines were trained on a vertical trellis using a two sided cordon system with a north south orientation during dormancy grapevines were pruned to eight 2 bud spurs i e 16 buds per vine the vineyard was drip irrigated with emitters of 3 8 l h 1 spaced every 1 0 m and the lowest wire of the trellis about 0 5 m above the ground supported the lateral irrigation pipe the vineyard was managed according to cultural practices commonly applied in the area and those were conducted by the winegrower the present research was carried out within the framework of an irrigation trial carried out in a 1 3 ha area within the vineyard up to 6 watering regimes were tested in an experimental design with 4 randomized blocks as described in martínez moreno et al 2022 however this experiment focuses on the two treatments applied during the 2 year study as follows rainfed non irrigation and deficit irrigated where irrigation began when vines stem water potential at midday ψstem reached values of 0 8 mpa and finished before crop senescence the vines monitored were located in one of the experimental blocks fig 1 each experimental unit comprised 4 rows with 12 vines per row of which the surrounding perimeter vines were considered as buffers due to the configuration of this experiment it was not feasible to monitor variations in air vapor pressure deficit vpd between watering regimes based on the single agrometeorological station deployed 2 2 irrigation management crop development and plant and yield determinations deficit irrigation scheduling was conducted weekly based on the soil water balance method according to the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2021 eta was computed based on the product of daily eto estimated with the fao56 penman monteith equation times a single crop coefficient kc which was reduced throughout the growing season to meet the water available for irrigating vineyards in this area climate data for eto estimations were provided by a weather station located 10 km away from the experimental vineyard which belongs to the spanish agro climatic information system for irrigation and it is handled by the spanish ministry of agriculture siar 2022 the kc values were obtained from lysimeter observations for tempranillo wine grapes under fully irrigated non stressed conditions in the study area lópez urrea et al 2012 those values were adjusted to the canopy cover values of this vineyard and reduced ranging between 0 15 in the initial stage and 0 30 in mid season to supply a deficit irrigation of 1000 m 3 ha 1 y 1 in accordance with the maximum allowance permitted by the authorities for irrigation of wine grapes in the area in addition the climatic conditions specifically minimum relative humidity and wind speed along the experimental periods were similar to those reported in the study by lopez urrea et al 2012 therefore mid season kc values were not adjusted according to the prevailing climatic conditions phenological growth stages of grapevine were identified following the biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt and chemical industry bbch identification keys lorenz et al 1994 height of vines monitored with the thermal infrared sensors was measured throughout the growing seasons and remained stable at around 1 55 m every 15 20 days digital photographs of one vine per treatment were acquired at solar noon vertically from 2 5 m height above the canopy to determine the fraction of ground covered by vegetation fc measurements of midday stem water potential ψstem were carried out every 15 day using a pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument company albany or usa on three representative vines per replicate the measurements were performed close to solar noon on mature leaves located in the upper third of the canopy that were enclosed in hermetic plastic bags and covered with aluminium foil for at least one hour before being excised from the plant choné et al 2001 additionally leaf gas exchange parameters were determined in august of two experimental years 2017 and 2018 stomatal conductance gs transpiration el and net photosynthesis an were measured at the leaf level by means of a portable photosynthesis analyzer lcpro adc bioscientific ltd hoddesdon england gas exchange was assessed in 3 vines and 2 leaves per vine a total of 6 determinations per treatment gas exchange measurements were taken under ambient conditions in basal and mature leaves of the sun exposed side of the canopy avoiding the modification of the natural leaf arrangement without fixing co2 light intensity relative humidity or leaf disposition the co2 mole fractions were measured in the ambient air ca and in the intercellular air spaces ci gas flow was set not to exceed 2 3 c the ambient temperature determinations were carried out during the morning at 11 00 am 13 00 pm finally intrinsic water use efficiency wuei and instantaneous water use efficiency wueinst at the leaf level was calculated as the ratio of an to gs and of an to el respectively flexas et al 2010 unfortunately sap flow measurements of plant transpiration or volumetric soil water content data were not available for this experiment yield and its components were obtained by harvesting all the experimental vines counting the number of clusters per vine pruning weights were obtained during the winter of each experimental season in 6 representative vines of the experimental unit for berry weight determination a sample of 400 berries was collected from each treatment from vines within the same field replicate 2 3 monitoring soil and canopy temperature and surface energy balance model the two source models allow the estimation of both e and t by establishing a separate energy balance for soil and canopy components respectively in a specific crop colaizzi et al 2012 kustas et al 2012 2018 kustas and anderson 2009 nieto et al

2008 an accurate thermal characterization of the vineyard is needed to derive the soil and canopy temperatures to be used as key inputs in the stseb approach two separate sets of 4 thermal instruments

both sides of the row were calculated to integrate sunlit and shaded soil and canopy components of the vine structure differences between treatments reach up to 7 c in terms of tc and up to 10 c in terms of ts this will have an impact in the estimated surface fluxes and eta derived 2 4 statistical analysis the statistics used in this work comprise those focused on the uncertainty of the field

meteorological conditions during the 2017 and 2018 vineyard growing seasons both seasons can be considered representative of the long term average weather conditions in the study area although the

over the growing seasons in both treatments although a larger dataset could have improved statistics data reported in fig 3 shows the expected seasonal trend comparing the two irrigation regimes indicating that the number of samples collected can be considered sufficient for this study similar values of ψstem were observed in the two treatments until the start of the irrigation events thereafter in rain fed treatment a progressive decrease in water potentials was observed until mid to late august when they stabilised 2017 season or increased significantly 2018 season due to substantial precipitation in late summer however in the irrigation treatment the ψstem values were maintained with small oscillations until harvesting as expected the lowest ψstem values were recorded in the rain fed treatment with 1 15 mpa and 1 49 mpa in 2017 and 2018 respectively which implies moderate water stress in 2017 and severe water stress in 2018 van leeuwen et al 2009 romero et al 2010 lower less negative ψstem values were recorded in 2018 than in 2017 probably because higher rainfall was registered during dormancy of season 2017 than in 2018 in fact cumulative precipitation during the period november 2016 to march 2017 was 267 mm while it was only 159 mm from november 2017 to march 2018 in relation to the leaf gas exchange determinations in both seasons stomatal conductance gs transpiration el and net photosynthesis an was overall affected by the water regime table 3 however for the el and an parameters there was a significant interaction between the treatment and the date of measurement this was because in the determination carried out in july both water regimes showed similar vine water status whereas in the other three dates the rainfed treatment significantly reduced gs el and an contrarily leaf wuei and wueinst was not significantly affected by the watering regime in any date of measurement moreover there was an overall significant effect of the water regime on the ratio of internal to ambient co2 concentration ci ca however no significant differences in this ratio were detected on the individual measurement dates table 3 3 3 vineyard actual evapotranspiration estimations using the stseb model the available period for the radiometric thermal measurements in 2018 almost covered the full phenological development of the vineyard however irt measurements started in middle july in 2017 in between fruit set and veraison and then seasonal eta values cannot be derived nor compared to soil water balance estimations for this reason in this work stseb estimations will be used to analyze the differences between deficit irrigation and rainfed treatments to explore the partition e t and to derive a relative water stress coefficient ks r to be correlated with the measurements of midday water stem potential ψstem soil and canopy temperatures together with all the meteorological data and biophysical information described above were introduced as inputs in the stseb equations results of the different terms of the energy balance equation were obtained every 15 min using data from the net radiometer installed in the rainfed treatment a validation of this term was carried out fig 4 shows the linear regression between modeled and ground measurement of net radiation rn for the full 2017 2018 dataset an underestimation of 8 w m 2 and a rmse of 13 w m 2 were obtained for 2017 similar statistics were observed for 2018 with an underestimation of 13 w m 2 and a rmse of 29 w m 2 these results are in agreement with those reported in sánchez et al 2019 and then reinforce the feasibility of the radiometric temperature measurements in this experiment unfortunately no ground measurements of the other terms of the energy balance equation were available for this experiment with no option for testing the performance of the stseb runs on turbulent fluxes or the soil heat flux however note this was beyond the scope of this study eta values were accumulated at daily scale for the total 146 day period in 2018 and the 103 day period in 2017 for a more in depth analysis of the different irrigation treatments separated canopy t and soil e values were also calculated following the stseb scheme fig 5 shows the evolution for both treatments in terms of daily values of total eta and separated t e for the available dataset table 4 lists a summary of these values accumulated as well as the ratios e eta and t eta for the full 2017 2018 study periods transpiration is clearly the dominant term in both water regimes except for initial stage in 2018 as a consequence of the spring rainfalls combined with the low fc values still registered but also at the end of the season in 2018 for the rainfed treatment fig 5 transpiration in the irrigation treatment almost double the value obtained in the rainfed one in both years and the ratio t eta increases around 8 9 when comparing both treatments table 4 however the large amount of rainfall in 2018 combined with the different study periods avoid any further comparison analysis between the crop water use efficiency wuec defined as the ratio of eta irrigation rainfall 3 4 effects of water stress on vineyard eta relationship between the estimated relative water stress coefficient ks r and the plant water status to explore the connection between the water status and the reduction in eta this section focuses on the transpiration t and discards the evaporation component from the analysis due to the variability that this term introduces in the total eta results a basal crop coefficient was calculated as the ratio between transpiration and reference evapotranspiration kcb t eto fig 6 shows the daily evolution of this kcb for both irrigation and rainfed treatments values of kcb peak in july august with maximum values of 0 5 and 0 3 for the irrigation and rainfed treatments respectively registered by the end of august for a better understanding of the differences between deficit irrigation rainfed a relative water stress coefficient ks r was calculated as the ratio in terms of transpiration or kcb between both treatments assuming the irrigation as the reference this relative stress coefficient ranges between 0 and 1 reaching the unity when no difference between treatments is observed to calculate this ks r 5 day averages were used to account for the daily variability see fig 6 observed values of ks r range between 0 2 and 0 9 from middle june to middle october for both years fig 7 shows the regression between the estimated values of ks r and the values of ψstem for the rainfed treatment despite the large scatter consequence of the intrinsic uncertainty in the measurements of ψstem or the variability within the 5 day average periods there is a significant linear correlation between the reduction of t and ψstem note the intercept differs from unity this means differences in transpiration are maintained although low values of ψstem are measured this can be explained by the differences in fc between treatments more remarkable in 2017 3 5 effects of irrigation treatment on whole vine performance in the first experimental season differences in yield and pruning weights between the two watering regimes were not statistically significant despite berry weights were significantly larger in the deficit irrigation treatment table 5 however in the second season under a general larger crop level deficit irrigation significantly increased yield and pruning weights by 65 and 55 respectively in 2018 likely because of the higher crop level grapes had much lower total soluble solids tss level at harvest and the differences between the treatments were in line to what observed at the whole vineyard level as reported in depth by martínez moreno et al 2022 4 discussion estimating vineyard water consumption through the stseb approach combined with the radiometric thermal characterization of the vineyard had already been validated in a drip irrigated vineyard by sánchez et al 2019 using a weighing lysimeter as a reference and results confirmed stseb model as an attractive alternative to determine short and long term accurate actual evapotranspiration in vineyards these authors reported an average underestimation of 0 04 mm d 1 with a rmse value of 0 6 mm d 1 for daily values and a deviation lower than 10 for the total accumulated seasonal eta in the present research the stseb approach was applied in a vineyard under two watering regimes that are frequently applied in mediterranean vineyard rainfed and deficit irrigation results for the 2017 season show a ratio t eta of 0 79 and 0 70 for irrigation and rainfed respectively this means an average percentage of 21 and 30 respectively of total eta correspond to soil evaporation these findings are in agreement with values reported in the literature sánchez et al 2019 reported t e ratios of 1 5 and 1 8 for 2014 and 2015 seasons respectively this means an average percentage of 61 and 64 of total eta corresponded to plant transpiration in 2014 and 2015 respectively these results are also in agreement with those reported by sánchez et al 2016 using data from the 2013 growing season also in las tiesas experimental vineyard and similar ratios of e eta 0 35 were estimated by gonzález dugo et al 2010 xia et al 2016 or kustas et al 2018 also using tseb model obviously the ratio e eta is highly variable and dependent on the amount and frequency of water availability in the inter row and canopy size in addition soil evaporation can change dramatically during the season and between seasons this is the case of the 2018 season table 4 for which 48 and up to 50 of the total eta corresponds to soil evaporation due to the amount of rainfall registered table 1 for instance zhang et al 2010 or lascano et al 1992 found values of e eta of 0 47 in furrow irrigated and 0 77 in flood irrigated grapevines respectively indeed it is confirmed that soil evaporation is an important component of the vineyard water budget and therefore aims for improving the overall vineyard wue should be targeted to reduce soil evaporation transpiration in rainfed treatment was 41 and 46 lower than in deficit irrigation one for 2017 and 2018 respectively table 4 these large differences were well reflected in the kcb values fig 6 but also on vine water status fig 3 a recent research by santesteban et al 2019 based on more than 78 000 determinations across many different varieties and regions showed the high discrimination potential of the midday stem water potential when comparing different irrigation regimes although some uncertainties may appear due to plant environment interaction garcía tejera et al 2020 conclusions by santesteban et al 2019 are robust enough to consider midday stem water potential as a reliable indicator of the actual vine water status nevertheless two seasonal measurements of stomatal conductance medrano et al 2002 were also included in this study as shown in fig 7 there is a linear relationship between the reductions in transpiration modeled for the rainfed treatment and the values of stem water potential in fact the rainfed vines overall reduced gs el and an in comparison to the deficit irrigated ones but showed no increase neither in wuei nor in wueinst table 3 this may be explained by the overall increase in the ci ca ratio found in rainfed leaves compared to irrigated ones which points to a slight decrease in the photosynthetic capacity of rainfed vines escalona et al 2000 cernusak et al 2013 romero et al 2010 established physiological thresholds to optimize water use efficiency in this cultivar indicating that under gs values of 0 110 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and ψstem of 1 3 mpa both wuei and wueinst start to be impaired in 2018 our rainfed vines exceeded these thresholds table 3 and fig 3 the linear relationship shown in fig 7 is more clearly established for the 2018 dataset due to the larger range of ψstem registered with values ranging between 0 4 mpa by middle june and 1 5 mpa by middle august the corresponding values of the relative ks r for this 2018 season decreased starting from 0 9 in june down to 0 3 0 4 for most august and september rising up again in october although the 2017 season was drier than 2018 with less rainfall and higher evaporative demand ψstem values for the rainfed treatment remained above 1 2 mpa also only 5 time specific measurements of ψstem were gathered from middle june to the end of the experiment for this reason the connection between the reduction in t and the ψstem observed for the rainfed treatment is more difficult to capture in this year moreover fc values in 2017 were up to 30 lower in the rainfed treatment compared to the irrigation see fig 2 and this has a direct impact in the transpiration values modelled through the surface energy balance then reducing the correlation between ks r and ψstem focusing this analysis on the 2018 data 11 points the adjustment improves r2 0 834 and the equation ks r 0 38 ψstem 0 92 is derived these results are encouraging and show the potential of this technique surface energy balance combined to canopy radiometric temperature measurements to monitor the water status of a vineyard it is obvious that in an operational application of this approach a fully irrigated vineyard will not be available to be used as a reference but corresponding values of potential crop et etc which refers to optimal well watered conditions based on both phenological and environmental conditions can be used instead e g using the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 in our companion study martínez moreno et al 2022 have reported the effects of the irrigation regime on grape and wine composition indicating that the deficit irrigation procedure here employed despite increasing yield and vine vegetative vigour negatively affected grape composition by diluting the main berry quality components this implies that precise irrigation management needs to be carried out in order to optimize the balance between yield and grape quality in order to ensure an economically profitable wine growing activity in this sense the results obtained are indeed useful for improving the irrigation scheduling procedures in monastrell red wine grapes for instance romero et al 2010 suggested maintaining vines in ψstem values around 1 3 mpa post veraison which would correspond to ks r value of 0 45 our research will be then of aid for computing a vineyard water balance under deficit irrigation conditions this has implications both for vine growers but also for the water management authorities that can now better perform water accountings for better matching sources and demand in a given water basin area 5 conclusions the results in this work support previous findings in the study area and reinforce the potential of the stseb model together with canopy and soil radiometric temperature measurements to monitor vineyard eta and its partitioning into canopy transpiration t and soil evaporation e under two water regimes frequently used in the mediterranean agro ecosystems although t was the dominant component of eta ranging between 79 and 58 for the irrigated treatment and between 70 and 50 for the rainfed conditions the magnitude of e values obtained should be considered reaching up to a 50 for the rainfed treatment in 2018 this confirms the need to reduce e in attempts to improve the vineyard wue the reasonably good relationship obtained between ks r and ψstem demonstrates the potential of using radiometric measurements of plant temperature as an input in surface energy balance approaches to monitor the vines water status and for estimating evapotranspiration reductions as a function of the vine water status overall the rainfed treatment reduced the values of gs el and an compared to the irrigated treatment but did not result in an increase in the wuei and wueinst probably due to an increase in the ci ca ratio found in leaves under rainfed conditions indeed the reported results will be useful for improving deficit irrigation scheduling techniques for monastrell red grapes

8997,vineyards occupy large areas in many mediterranean agroecosystems in which their evapotranspiration is a major component of the water cycle the correct determination of the actual crop evapotranspiration eta is critical for accurate irrigation scheduling allowing to match irrigation applications to crop water needs this study was conducted to monitor the vineyard eta and its partitioning into soil evaporation e and plant transpiration t under deficit irrigation and rainfed conditions and to obtain the relationship between the estimated relative water stress coefficient ks r and measured midday stem water potential ψstem a 2 year field experiment was carried out in a monastrell commercial vineyard located in fuente álamo albacete se spain thermal infrared radiometers were deployed in both treatments together with a weather station to gather all the inputs required in the simplified two source energy balance stseb approach results showed that the accumulated eta ranged between 183 and 253 mm for the irrigated treatment and between 121 and 158 mm for the rainfed conditions canopy transpiration in the irrigation treatment almost double the value obtained in rainfed conditions for both years and the ratio t eta increases around 8 9 in the irrigation treatment the e component ranged from 21 for the irrigated treatment up to 50 for the rainfed treatment confirming its importance in the vineyard water balance a good linear relationship r2 0 650 was obtained between ks r and ψstem indicating the potential of using a surface energy balance approach in conjunction with plant radiometric temperature measurements to monitor the vines water status moreover the rainfed treatment reduced the values of stomatal conductance gs transpiration el and net photosynthesis an compared to the irrigated treatment whereas no increase in the intrinsic water use efficiency wuei nor the instantaneous water use efficiency wueinst was observed the reported results will be useful for improving deficit irrigation scheduling techniques for monastrell red grapes keywords actual evapotranspiration grapevine water stress stress coefficient wue radiometric temperature data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction grapevines occupy large areas in traditional european countries i e spain italy and france and in other countries around the world such as the usa china and argentina sadras et al 2012 many of these vineyards are located in arid and semi arid environments in which their evapotranspiration is a major component of the water cycle trambouze and voltz 2001 currently there is 7 5 million ha of vineyards worldwide producing over 85 million mg of grapes resulting in about 280 million hectoliters of wine which generates a value market of 30 525 million euros in sales oiv 2019 the region of castilla la mancha spain has the largest surface area devoted to grapevines in the world with more than 465 000 ha representing about 48 of the spanish harvested grapevine area and the wine industry employs a significant portion of the agricultural labor furthermore the wine sector is not only of great economic but also social cultural and environmental importance in this region mapa 2020 in spain there are currently almost 400 000 ha of vineyard under irrigation accounting for 41 of the total harvested area whereas in the study area la mancha the irrigated vineyard area exceeds 50 of the total harvested area mapa 2020 although vineyards were traditionally cultivated under rainfed conditions the grapevine area under irrigation is increasing year by year as the data presented above show due to aspects related to wine quality and yield stability moreover in areas with very high evaporative demand i e arid and semi arid conditions and scarce and erratic precipitation patterns throughout the grapevine growing season irrigation becomes necessary for yield intensification and even for the survival of vines aiming at achieving an economically profitable activity in water scarce areas such as la mancha irrigation is conditional on water availability and the standard allocation ranges between about 700 and 1300 m3 ha 1 year 1 therefore well below the potential vine crop evapotranspiration etc lópez urrea et al 2012 2020 an accurate estimation of the actual crop evapotranspiration eta is important to achieve more effective irrigation scheduling chávez et al 2009 evett et al 2012 kustas et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 this becomes critical in arid and semi arid environments where eta plays a key role in both the water and energy balances also the climate change scenarios forecasted for coming years ipcc 2022 are boosting strategies to reduce the farm consumptive water and deficit irrigation is a well known technique which efficiency needs to be explored under the conditions of this study a good knowledge on the vineyard water requirements is essential for a correct irrigation strategy furthermore water management is a critical driver to improve vine performance and grape and wine composition intrigliolo and castel 2008 irrigating grapevines to fulfil potential vine evapotranspiration etc i e for pristine non stressed cropping conditions normally reduces wine quality williams and matthews 1990 and many studies have attempted to identify the effects of the irrigation regime and water status on grape and wine composition see for instance review by mirás avalos and intrigliolo 2017 these kind of studies are still needed because it seems that the final effects of irrigation on grape and wine composition are very dependent on many local factors and it is not easy to derive general conclusions however the research attempting to quantify vineyard water use is much scarcer despite the importance of obtaining more quantitative information on how irrigation regime and vine water status determine grapevine water use and its productivity buesa et al 2022 this is particularly important to correctly determine the effects of water status on the vine water balance and to properly assess the vineyard agro ecosystem sustainability in response to the irrigation regime applied in this sense while previous studies have recently reported how water use and crop coefficients vary among the season under conditions of no soil water limitations picón toro et al 2012 lópez urrea et al 2012 munitz et al 2019 the information under some water stress conditions has not been so well documented buesa et al 2022 for all these reasons an accurate estimation of vineyard evapotranspiration in semi arid regions becomes crucial a variety of methods and techniques have been reported in the literature to derive actual water use or evapotranspiration in this crop

components using ground measurements of soil ts and canopy tc temperatures the assessment of this methodology was evaluated using both lysimeter and eddy covariance measurements in a drip irrigated

álamo albacete se spain 38 43 n 1 28 w at an altitude of 820 m a s l fig 1 according to the soil survey staff 2014 the soil texture is sandy loam with 56 sand 27 silt and 17 clay with a basic ph 8 9 and an average bulk density of 1 17 g cm 3 average soil depth of the vineyard plot is 0 90 m the vineyard floor was maintained with bare soil soil tillage was carried out with a cultivator three times per season in autumn early and late spring the ploughing depth was at most 15 cm during the experiment and also for at least 10 years before it began the space between vines was maintained without weeds using herbicide the climate is semi arid temperate mediterranean with very hot and dry summers the long term 20 year mean average annual precipitation is about 290 mm which is mainly concentrated throughout the autumn and spring months i e during the dormant period the annual cumulative grass reference evapotranspiration eto is about 1270 mm and the average mean temperature is 14

netherlands all meteorological data were stored in a cr1000 data logger logger campbell scientific inc logan utah the vineyard vitis vinifera l cv monastrell was planted in 2007 grafted onto paulsen 1103 rootstock on a 6 8 ha vineyard vine spacing was 1 5 m within row and 3 0 m inter row giving 2222 vines ha 1 vines were trained on a vertical trellis using a two sided cordon system with a north south orientation during dormancy grapevines were pruned to eight 2 bud spurs i e 16 buds per vine the vineyard was drip irrigated with emitters of 3 8 l h 1 spaced every 1 0 m and the lowest wire of the trellis about 0 5 m above the ground supported the lateral irrigation pipe the vineyard was managed according to cultural practices commonly applied in the area and those were conducted by the winegrower the present research was carried out within the framework of an irrigation trial carried out in a 1 3 ha area within the vineyard up to 6 watering regimes were tested in an experimental design with 4 randomized blocks as described in martínez moreno et al 2022 however this experiment focuses on the two treatments applied during the 2 year study as follows rainfed non irrigation and deficit irrigated where irrigation began when vines stem water potential at midday ψstem reached values of 0 8 mpa and finished before crop senescence the vines monitored were located in one of the experimental blocks fig 1 each experimental unit comprised 4 rows with 12 vines per row of which the surrounding perimeter vines were considered as buffers due to the configuration of this experiment it was not feasible to monitor variations in air vapor pressure deficit vpd between watering regimes based on the single agrometeorological station deployed 2 2 irrigation management crop development and plant and yield determinations deficit irrigation scheduling was conducted weekly based on the soil water balance method according to the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 pereira et al 2021 eta was computed based on the product of daily eto estimated with the fao56 penman monteith equation times a single crop coefficient kc which was reduced throughout the growing season to meet the water available for irrigating vineyards in this area climate data for eto estimations were provided by a weather station located 10 km away from the experimental vineyard which belongs to the spanish agro climatic information system for irrigation and it is handled by the spanish ministry of agriculture siar 2022 the kc values were obtained from lysimeter observations for tempranillo wine grapes under fully irrigated non stressed conditions in the study area lópez urrea et al 2012 those values were adjusted to the canopy cover values of this vineyard and reduced ranging between 0 15 in the initial stage and 0 30 in mid season to supply a deficit irrigation of 1000 m 3 ha 1 y 1 in accordance with the maximum allowance permitted by the authorities for irrigation of wine grapes in the area in addition the climatic conditions specifically minimum relative humidity and wind speed along the experimental periods were similar to those reported in the study by lopez urrea et al 2012 therefore mid season kc values were not adjusted according to the prevailing climatic conditions phenological growth stages of grapevine were identified following the biologische bundesanstalt bundessortenamt and chemical industry bbch identification keys lorenz et al 1994 height of vines monitored with the thermal infrared sensors was measured throughout the growing seasons and remained stable at around 1 55 m every 15 20 days digital photographs of one vine per treatment were acquired at solar noon vertically from 2 5 m height above the canopy to determine the fraction of ground covered by vegetation fc measurements of midday stem water potential ψstem were carried out every 15 day using a pressure chamber model 600 pms instrument company albany or usa on three representative vines per replicate the measurements were performed close to solar noon on mature leaves located in the upper third of the canopy that were enclosed in hermetic plastic bags and covered with aluminium foil for at least one hour before being excised from the plant choné et al 2001 additionally leaf gas exchange parameters were determined in august of two experimental years 2017 and 2018 stomatal conductance gs transpiration el and net photosynthesis an were measured at the leaf level by means of a portable photosynthesis analyzer lcpro adc bioscientific ltd hoddesdon england gas exchange was assessed in 3 vines and 2 leaves per vine a total of 6 determinations per treatment gas exchange measurements were taken under ambient conditions in basal and mature leaves of the sun exposed side of the canopy avoiding the modification of the natural leaf arrangement without fixing co2 light intensity relative humidity or leaf disposition the co2 mole fractions were measured in the ambient air ca and in the intercellular air spaces ci gas flow was set not to exceed 2 3 c the ambient temperature determinations were carried out during the morning at 11 00 am 13 00 pm finally intrinsic water use efficiency wuei and instantaneous water use efficiency wueinst at the leaf level was calculated as the ratio of an to gs and of an to el respectively flexas et al 2010 unfortunately sap flow measurements of plant transpiration or volumetric soil water content data were not available for this experiment yield and its components were obtained by harvesting all the experimental vines counting the number of clusters per vine pruning weights were obtained during the winter of each experimental season in 6 representative vines of the experimental unit for berry weight determination a sample of 400 berries was collected from each treatment from vines within the same field replicate 2 3 monitoring soil and canopy temperature and surface energy balance model the two source models allow the estimation of both e and t by establishing a separate energy balance for soil and canopy components respectively in a specific crop colaizzi et al 2012 kustas et al 2012 2018 kustas and anderson 2009 nieto et al 2018 norman et al 1995 the simplified version of this two source approach stseb stands on the soil and canopy temperatures derived through an appropriate radiometric thermal characterization of the components together with biophysical information and meteorological data this stseb method has been shown effective to monitor actual crop evapotranspiration eta and separating e and t in a variety of crops in the last decade sánchez et al 2021 2019 2015 2014 2011 valentín et al 2020 häusler et al 2018 for a comprehensive description of the stseb approach the reader is referred to sánchez et al 2008 an accurate thermal characterization of the vineyard is needed to derive the soil and canopy temperatures to be used as key inputs in the stseb approach two separate sets of 4 thermal instruments each were installed to guarantee representative temperatures at both irrigated and rainfed treatments following the experimental setup in sánchez et al 2019 thermal infrared radiometers irts si 121

every field campaign using a blackbody source hyperion r 982 isotech england the irts were deployed in a mast placed in the line with the row see fig 1 two sensors were pointing to the east and west sides of the plant canopy from a height of 1 5 m and a distance previously calculated considering the instrument fov the other two irts pointed to the east and west sides of the inter row soil from a height of 0 5 m an additional irt was ensembled pointing upward for the collection of the downwelling sky radiance required for the atmospheric correction of all radiometric temperatures irt measurements were limited to the period doys 195 298 in 2017 and 136 283 in 2018 once corrected from emissivity and atmospheric effects sánchez et al 2008 average values of the ts and tc measured at both sides of the row were calculated to integrate sunlit and shaded soil and canopy components of the vine structure differences between treatments reach up to 7 c in terms of tc and up to 10 c in terms of ts this will have an impact in the estimated surface fluxes and eta derived 2 4 statistical analysis the statistics used in this work comprise those focused on the uncertainty of the field

meteorological conditions during the 2017 and 2018 vineyard growing seasons both seasons can be considered representative of the long term average weather conditions in the study area although the rainfall during 2017 was 52 lower than average for the same period may to october whereas in 2018 accumulated rainfall was 30 larger than the 20 year mean also note the rainfall of about 30 mm registered in august for both years is anomalous the average evaporative demand was higher in 2017 than in 2018 with the main differences in june and september due to the wet conditions for these two

codes during 2017 and 2018 seasons for the two treatments in 2018 phenology was advanced by 6 15 days in comparison to that in 2017 likely due to an average temperature 2 3 c higher during spring and early summer in 2017 than in 2018 digital images were classified using the maximum probability algorithm technique aiming at assigning the current classes of green vegetation in the image based on the methodology reported by cihlar et al 1987 a more meticulous description of this approach is given by lópez urrea et al 2020 these periodic ground measurements were used to model fc during 2017 and 2018 growing seasons fig 2 in the irrigated treatment surface drip applications were applied every 3 4 days depending on the eta rate i e two irrigation events per week this treatment received 21 and 20 irrigations throughout 2017 and 2018 respectively with a depth of about 4 5 mm per irrigation event resulting in a total water applied of 104 mm in both seasons fig 3 shows the evolution of ψstem over the growing seasons in both treatments although a larger dataset could have improved statistics data reported in fig 3 shows the expected seasonal trend comparing the two irrigation regimes indicating that the number of samples collected can be considered sufficient for this study similar values of ψstem were observed in the two treatments until the start of the irrigation events thereafter in rain fed treatment a progressive decrease in water potentials was observed until mid to late august when they stabilised 2017 season or increased significantly 2018 season due to substantial precipitation in late summer however in the irrigation treatment the ψstem values were maintained with small oscillations until harvesting as expected the lowest ψstem values were recorded in the rain fed treatment with 1 15 mpa and 1 49 mpa in 2017 and 2018 respectively which implies moderate water stress in 2017 and severe water stress in 2018 van leeuwen et al 2009 romero et al 2010 lower less negative ψstem values were recorded in 2018 than in 2017 probably because higher rainfall was registered during dormancy of season 2017 than in 2018 in fact cumulative precipitation during the period november 2016 to march 2017 was 267 mm while it was only 159 mm from november 2017 to march 2018 in relation to the leaf gas exchange determinations in both seasons stomatal conductance gs transpiration el and net photosynthesis an was overall affected by the water regime table 3 however for the el and an parameters there was a significant interaction between the treatment and the date of measurement this was because in the determination carried out in july both water regimes showed similar vine water status whereas in the other three dates the rainfed treatment significantly reduced gs el and an contrarily leaf wuei and wueinst was not significantly affected by the watering regime in any date of measurement moreover there was an overall significant effect of the water regime on the ratio of internal to ambient co2 concentration ci ca however no significant differences in this ratio were detected on the individual measurement dates table 3 3 3 vineyard actual evapotranspiration estimations using the stseb model the available period for the radiometric thermal measurements in 2018 almost covered the full phenological development of the vineyard however irt measurements started in middle july in 2017 in between fruit set and veraison and then seasonal eta values cannot be derived nor compared to soil water balance estimations for this reason in this work stseb estimations will be used to analyze the differences between deficit irrigation and rainfed treatments to explore the partition e t and to derive a relative water stress coefficient ks r to be correlated with the measurements of midday water stem potential ψstem soil and canopy temperatures together with all the meteorological data and biophysical information described above were introduced as inputs in the stseb equations results of the different terms of the energy balance equation were obtained every 15 min using data from the net radiometer installed in the rainfed treatment a validation of this term was carried out fig 4 shows the linear regression between modeled and ground measurement of net radiation rn for the full 2017 2018 dataset an underestimation of 8 w m 2 and a rmse of 13 w m 2 were obtained for 2017 similar statistics were observed for 2018 with an underestimation of 13 w m 2 and a rmse of 29 w m 2 these results are in agreement with those reported in sánchez et al 2019 and then reinforce the feasibility of the radiometric temperature measurements in this experiment unfortunately no ground measurements of the other terms of the energy balance equation were available for this experiment with no option for testing the performance of the stseb runs on turbulent fluxes or the soil heat flux however note this was beyond the scope of this study eta values were accumulated at daily scale for the total 146 day period in 2018 and the 103 day period in 2017 for a more in depth analysis of the different irrigation treatments separated canopy t and soil e values were also calculated following the stseb scheme fig 5 shows the evolution for both treatments in terms of daily values of total eta and separated t e for the available dataset table 4 lists a summary of these values accumulated as well as the ratios e eta and t eta for the full 2017 2018 study periods transpiration is clearly the dominant term in both water regimes except for initial stage in 2018 as a consequence of the spring rainfalls combined with the low fc values still registered but also at the end of the season in 2018 for the rainfed treatment fig 5 transpiration in the irrigation treatment almost double the value obtained in the rainfed one in both years and the ratio t eta increases around 8 9 when comparing both treatments table 4 however the large amount of rainfall in 2018 combined with the different study periods avoid any further comparison analysis between the crop water use efficiency wuec defined as the ratio of eta irrigation rainfall 3 4 effects of water stress on vineyard eta relationship between the estimated relative water stress coefficient ks r and the plant water status to explore the connection between the water status and the reduction in eta this section focuses on the transpiration t and discards the evaporation component from the analysis due to the variability that this term introduces in the total eta results a basal crop coefficient was calculated as the ratio between transpiration and reference evapotranspiration kcb t eto fig 6 shows the daily evolution of this kcb for both irrigation and rainfed treatments values of kcb peak in july august with maximum values of 0 5 and 0 3 for the irrigation and rainfed treatments respectively registered by the end of august for a better understanding of the differences between deficit irrigation rainfed a relative water stress coefficient ks r was calculated as the ratio in terms of transpiration or kcb between both treatments assuming the irrigation as the reference this relative stress coefficient ranges between 0 and 1 reaching the unity when no difference between treatments is observed to calculate this ks r 5 day averages were used to account for the daily variability see fig 6 observed values of ks r range between 0 2 and 0 9 from middle june to middle october for both years fig 7 shows the regression between the estimated values of ks r and the values of ψstem for the rainfed treatment despite the large scatter consequence of the intrinsic uncertainty in the measurements of ψstem or the variability within the 5 day average periods there is a significant linear correlation between the reduction of t and ψstem note the intercept differs from unity this means differences in transpiration are maintained although low values of ψstem are measured this can be explained by the differences in fc between treatments more remarkable in 2017 3 5 effects of irrigation treatment on whole vine performance in the first experimental season differences in yield and pruning weights between the two watering regimes were not statistically significant despite berry weights were significantly larger in the deficit irrigation treatment table 5 however in the second season under a general larger crop level deficit irrigation significantly increased yield and pruning weights by 65 and 55 respectively in 2018 likely because of the higher crop level grapes had much lower total soluble solids tss level at harvest and the differences between the treatments were in line to what observed at the whole vineyard level as reported in depth by martínez moreno et al 2022 4 discussion estimating vineyard water consumption through the stseb approach combined with the radiometric thermal characterization of the vineyard had already been validated in a drip irrigated vineyard by sánchez et al 2019 using a weighing lysimeter as a reference and results confirmed stseb model as an attractive alternative to determine short and long term accurate actual evapotranspiration in vineyards these authors reported an average underestimation of 0 04 mm d 1 with a rmse value of 0 6 mm d 1 for daily values and a deviation lower than 10 for the total accumulated seasonal eta in the present research the stseb approach was applied in a vineyard under two watering regimes that are frequently applied in mediterranean vineyard rainfed and deficit irrigation results for the 2017 season show a ratio t eta of 0 79 and 0 70 for irrigation and rainfed respectively this means an average percentage of 21 and 30 respectively of total eta correspond to soil evaporation these findings are in agreement with values reported in the literature sánchez et al 2019 reported t e ratios of 1 5 and 1 8 for 2014 and 2015 seasons respectively this means an average percentage of 61 and 64 of total eta corresponded to plant transpiration in 2014 and 2015 respectively these results are also in agreement with those reported by sánchez et al 2016 using data from the 2013 growing season also in las tiesas experimental vineyard and similar ratios of e eta 0 35 were estimated by gonzález dugo et al 2010 xia et al 2016 or kustas et al 2018 also using tseb model obviously the ratio e eta is highly variable and dependent on the amount and frequency of water availability in the inter row and canopy size in addition soil evaporation can change dramatically during the season and between seasons this is the case of the 2018 season table 4 for which 48 and up to 50 of the total eta corresponds to soil evaporation due to the amount of rainfall registered table 1 for instance zhang et al 2010 or lascano et al 1992 found values of e eta of 0 47 in furrow irrigated and 0 77 in flood irrigated grapevines respectively indeed it is confirmed that soil evaporation is an important component of the vineyard water budget and therefore aims for improving the overall vineyard wue should be targeted to reduce soil evaporation transpiration in rainfed treatment was 41 and 46 lower than in deficit irrigation one for 2017 and 2018 respectively table 4 these large differences were well reflected in the kcb values fig 6 but also on vine water status fig 3 a recent research by santesteban et al 2019 based on more than 78 000 determinations across many different varieties and regions showed the high discrimination potential of the midday stem water potential when comparing different irrigation regimes although some uncertainties may appear due to plant environment interaction garcía tejera et al 2020 conclusions by santesteban et al 2019 are robust enough to consider midday stem water potential as a reliable indicator of the actual vine water status nevertheless two seasonal measurements of stomatal conductance medrano et al 2002 were also included in this study as shown in fig 7 there is a linear relationship between the reductions in transpiration modeled for the rainfed treatment and the values of stem water potential in fact the rainfed vines overall reduced gs el and an in comparison to the deficit irrigated ones but showed no increase neither in wuei nor in wueinst table 3 this may be explained by the overall increase in the ci ca ratio found in rainfed leaves compared to irrigated ones which points to a slight decrease in the photosynthetic capacity of rainfed vines escalona et al 2000 cernusak et al 2013 romero et al 2010 established physiological thresholds to optimize water use efficiency in this cultivar indicating that under gs values of 0 110 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and ψstem of 1 3 mpa both wuei and wueinst start to be impaired in 2018 our rainfed vines exceeded these thresholds table 3 and fig 3 the linear relationship shown in fig 7 is more clearly established for the 2018 dataset due to the larger range of ψstem registered with values ranging between 0 4 mpa by middle june and 1 5 mpa by middle august the corresponding values of the relative ks r for this 2018 season decreased starting from 0 9 in june down to 0 3 0 4 for most august and september rising up again in october although the 2017 season was drier than 2018 with less rainfall and higher evaporative demand ψstem values for the rainfed treatment remained above 1 2 mpa also only 5 time specific measurements of ψstem were gathered from middle june to the end of the experiment for this reason the connection between the reduction in t and the ψstem observed for the rainfed treatment is more difficult to capture in this year moreover fc values in 2017 were up to 30 lower in the rainfed treatment compared to the irrigation see fig 2 and this has a direct impact in the transpiration values modelled through the surface energy balance then reducing the correlation between ks r and ψstem focusing this analysis on the 2018 data 11 points the adjustment improves r2 0 834 and the equation ks r 0 38 ψstem 0 92 is derived these results are encouraging and show the potential of this technique surface energy balance combined to canopy radiometric temperature measurements to monitor the water status of a vineyard it is obvious that in an operational application of this approach a fully irrigated vineyard will not be available to be used as a reference but corresponding values of potential crop et etc which refers to optimal well watered conditions based on both phenological and environmental conditions can be used instead e g using the fao56 approach allen et al 1998 in our companion study martínez moreno et al 2022 have reported the effects of the irrigation regime on grape and wine composition indicating that the deficit irrigation procedure here employed despite increasing yield and vine vegetative vigour negatively affected grape composition by diluting the main berry quality components this implies that precise irrigation management needs to be carried out in order to optimize the balance between yield and grape quality in order to ensure an economically profitable wine growing activity in this sense the results obtained are indeed useful for improving the irrigation scheduling procedures in monastrell red wine grapes for instance romero et al 2010 suggested maintaining vines in ψstem values around 1 3 mpa post veraison which would correspond to ks r value of 0 45 our research will be then of aid for computing a vineyard water balance under deficit irrigation conditions this has implications both for vine growers but also for the water management authorities that can now better perform water accountings for better matching sources and demand in a given water basin area 5 conclusions the results in this work support previous findings in the study area and reinforce the potential of the stseb model together with canopy and soil radiometric temperature measurements to monitor vineyard eta and its partitioning into canopy transpiration t and soil evaporation e under two water regimes frequently used in the mediterranean agro ecosystems although t was the dominant component of eta ranging between 79 and 58 for the irrigated treatment and between 70 and 50 for the rainfed conditions the magnitude of e values obtained should be considered reaching up to a 50 for the rainfed treatment in 2018 this confirms the need to reduce e in attempts to improve the vineyard wue the reasonably good relationship obtained between ks r and ψstem demonstrates the potential of using radiometric measurements of plant temperature as an input in surface energy balance approaches to monitor the vines water status and for estimating evapotranspiration reductions as a function of the vine water status overall the rainfed treatment reduced the values of gs el and an compared to the irrigated treatment but did not result in an increase in the wuei and wueinst probably due to an increase in the ci ca ratio found in leaves under rainfed conditions indeed the reported results will be useful for improving deficit irrigation scheduling techniques for monastrell red grapes

8998,in aquifer dependent regions balancing aquifer protection desalination economic development agricultural irrigation and food security can be better managed through discovery and development of sources of sustainable groundwater pumping aquifer desalination for irrigation to protect food security can mitigate pressure on local freshwater aquifers despite its importance little peer reviewed work to date has identified the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation to mitigate freshwater aquifer drawdown the novel contribution of this work is the development and application of an innovative method to assess the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation for a recently discovered large saline aquifer it develops an original framework to assess the capacity to pay for aquifer desalination the results of which can help guide policymakers on efficient and sustainable pumping approaches across users aquifers and time periods a mathematical programming model is developed to economically analyze the 200 billion cubic meter lotikipi aquifer discovered in 2013 in northern kenya using modern remote sensing methods while initial pumping of the lotikipi aquifer was halted due to high groundwater salinity levels interest remains strong in assessing the economic capacity to pay for groundwater desalination because of its potential role in protecting regional food security generated by aquifer pumping for irrigation the model is formulated by calibrating optimized pumping patterns in two existing freshwater aquifers to replicate observed historical pumping levels based on that exercise a second model is developed to identify a least cost set of pumping restrictions that return each of three regional aquifers to starting conditions over a seven year time period a third model extends the second by adding a constraint of a minimum required level of food grain security supported by irrigation pumping from the aquifer system results show that the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigated agriculture lies in the range of 0 08 0 18 usd per cubic meter under current economic conditions and desalination technologies available while this economic capacity to pay is lower than its current cost in most places the future could be more optimistic advances in desalination technology higher crop prices technical advance in agriculture and development of drought resistant crops can all contribute to a future capacity to economically justify the expense of desalination keywords

contribution to the literature that brings together these disparate elements into a unified framework such an integrated approach has the potential to be replicable in various regions internationally using locally available data for which aquifer stress challenges will be magnified by climate change 1 4 contribution this investigation s novel contribution is to conduct an economic assessment of the capacity to pay for desalinated water used for irrigation in a region where a recently discovered aquifer identified large supplies of water that were later found to be too saline for commercially viable irrigation with continued population growth and climate stressed freshwater resources the design of policies to improve development of sustainable useable water while respecting environmental constraints is timely relevant and necessary this contribution assesses the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalinated water used for crop irrigation where existing freshwater aquifers face long term declines because of high levels of irrigation pumping in local freshwater aquifers to support regional food security methods developed in this work could be adapted to support the assessment of proposed policies that would desalinate aquifers in places where freshwater aquifers face high pumping rates 2 methods of analysis 2 1 study area and hydrologic elements turkana county in northern kenya fig 1 shares a border with uganda south sudan and ethiopia marsabit county is in the eastern part of the country approximately 927 000 people live in the semi arid landscape of turkana average temperatures range from 20 to 41 degrees celsius sporadic rainfall and erratic weather patterns due to climate variability create ongoing challenges for local farmers who have limited access to surface water aside from seasonal rivers and streams high rates of runoff and evapotranspiration are common long rains akiporo fall between april and july while short rains occur in october and november dry periods akamu occur in january february and september unprotected boreholes provide access to underground water resources but are under threat of overuse especially during drought periods republic of kenya 2020 lake turkana is a notable surface water source for local fishers but is currently unfit for irrigated agriculture as it is the most saline of all the freshwater rift valley lakes radar technologies international 2013 little work to date has been published describing the economic costs of making the water from lake turkana fit for uses like irrigated agriculture and drinking so the data that could characterize the benefits and costs of cleaning turkana s water are not readily available marsabit county lies directly to the east of turkana county fig 1 borders ethiopia and is a semi arid region turkana is the largest county in kenya for which its population in 2019 was estimated at just under 460 000 republic of kenya 2019 long term average temperatures range from 10 to 30 degrees celsius marsabit experiences regular drought erratic precipitation underdeveloped infrastructure and regional political insecurity farmers there face high prices of inputs used in agriculture such as land water labor and machinery they also face weakly developed food markets in this region plains volcanic areas and the chalbi desert break up the landscape seasonal rivers the milgis and merille occasionally provide water kenyan ministry of agriculture 2017 but the region still suffers from water insecurity overall both counties are hard places to live and thrive nationwide 17 million kenyans have little access to affordable and reliable freshwater and almost twice that number 28 million lack viable access to sanitation radar technologies international 2013 out of all county municipalities in kenya the regions most vulnerable to chronic malnutrition are turkana and marsabit counties where 60 of the combined populations live below the poverty line korir et al 2021 further complications due to covid 19 have elevated food shortages and contributed to farm income shocks made worse by reductions in normal regional economic activity these challenges are combined with stress placed on local vegetation by the locust species shistocerca gregaria which has caused significant devastation in the area since december 2019 kansiime et al 2021 in 2013 the us geological survey took part in a remote sensing effort in northern kenya that helped assess several previously poorly characterized underground aquifers the largest of these aquifers was the lotikipi aquifer with a potential to hold just over 200 billion cubic meters of water radar technologies international 2013 the lotikipi was estimated to sustain the entire population of kenya for over 70 years if the water could be made of acceptable quality however preliminary borehole testing showed the water was too saline for human consumption so construction of abstraction plants was halted for several years radar technologies international 2013 in 2019 the kenyan government announced its plans to partner with almar water of spain to construct desalination plants to make the water fit for human consumption takouleu october 31 2019 aquifer desalination is an expensive proposition so a big question with considerable food policy implications surrounds the economic capacity to pay for this water destined to be used for crop irrigation one of the lowest commercially valued uses of water cai et al 2003 chandrasekaran et al 2009 martinez granados et al 2011 medellin azuara et al 2010 tilmant et al 2008 ward and pulido velazquez 2012 both turkana and marsabit counties face the risk of depleting local freshwater resources seasonal rivers and rainfall make up some of the water use for agriculture but renewable groundwater resources coming from natural recharge and irrigation return flows provide a greater volume of the water in the region and with suitable quality upgrades at an affordable cost could represent a sustainable way to increase food security in the area the lodwar aquifer in turkana county is estimated radar technologies international 2013 to hold about 10 000 million m3 mcm we found little to no peer reviewed sources presenting research grade hydrologic estimates comparable to those in the radar technologies report the merti is a large aquifer that underlies several regions but the freshwater portion available and useable for pumping is much smaller and is partially situated in the marsabit wajir regions referred to here as the central merti aquifer the central merti is significantly larger than the lodwar aquifer at 50 000 mcm the central merti is the local aquifer connected to marsabit region and is a vital renewable groundwater resource used by many domestic users as well as use by refugees living in the region mumma et al 2011 the lotikipi is estimated to hold just over 200 000 mcm radar technologies international 2013 it is significantly larger than the other two this water source if made economically useable through desalination can be shared by both counties alleviate local groundwater stress for both the lodwar and central merti aquifers and create more sustainable economic and food security outcomes targeted development of the lotikipi can help water planners identify where to develop new wellfields to reach a wider population table 2 depth to pumping is an important indicator of the current economic costs for all these aquifers after calibrating our model to replicate observed pumping table 3 and pumping depths for observed base conditions the model was re optimized at a second stage using adjusted constraints so that its optimized pumping produces depths in the final year that return to starting depths i e use is reduced compared to base conditions so that the aquifer s depth is sustainable over the study period this approach has the effect of identifying a target for pumping over a range of years to allow flexibility for varying depth requirements in different years costs of pumping can be a significant part of total costs and will grow as aquifer groundwater depths decline varying weather patterns and varying food demands can be expected to alter pumping depths from year to year overall a long term balanced and sustained aquifer to guide discovery of the economic capacity to pay for a desalinated lotikipi motivates the current work the lotikipi holds greater stocks of water but it more expensive to pump and put to economical use because of its need for desalination because little research grade data were available to assess the cost of desalination we developed an innovative method to assess the economic capacity to pay for desalinated water if that desalination occurred to compare the capacity to pay to the cost once that cost is better understood this capacity to pay for desalination is a useful piece of information to compare to the cost of desalination when that cost falls sufficiently in future years table 4 2 2 hydrologic agronomic and economic data available data on cropping patterns in both turkana and marsabit were secured from the national drought management authority national drought management authority 2020 and government of kenya government of kenya kenya food security steering group kfssg 2019a b containing published cropping patterns and crop economics radar technologies international radar technologies international 2013 and acacia water acacia water et al 2013 completed work containing data on aquifer characteristics for regional and local aquifers discovered through new innovative remote sensing methods conducted in northern kenya as discussed in more detail elsewhere baah kumi et al 2021 pumping cost formulas as a function of depth were based on an earlier work mckinney and lin 1994 while water use per unit land was based on one of the classic published works hargreaves and samani 1982 net crop revenue per unit land equals crop price multiplied by crop yield minus average costs of production there was no observed land in production for the lotikipi aquifer because the highly saline aquifer reserves for our historical period of record precluding pumping so counterfactual estimates were required da cunha et al 2015 dillon 2011 gunda et al 2018 sampson and perry 2019 siegfried and bernauer 2007 zuo et al 2018 for land that would have been in production with suitable desalination of the aquifer at an irrigation affordable cost these estimates were based on proportion of volume of the lotikipi aquifer compared to the other two aquifers allocated to a suitable amount of land supported for irrigation had that aquifer s water been desalinated to the point that aquifer water would have been economically viable for crop production barron et al 2015 garcia marin et al 2020 hipolito valencia et al 2021 ruperez moreno et al 2017 this approach to estimating land that would have been in production adjusting to conditions for lands that were in production at other places is sometimes referred to as a data transfer approach a long literature for conducting data transfer exercises has

resources the maximization of net economic benefits across water users while allocating water to its highest valued uses is a state of the art approach to regional economic development assessments bekchanov et al 2017 harou et al 2010 kahil et al 2018 maneta et al 2009 rosenberg et al 2008 ward 2009 income gains by local farmers due to expanded supply conditions with suitably affordable desalinated water will influence economic development and regional food security net revenue per unit land and net total farm income net revenue per unit land multiplied by total land in production are used in our model to reflect overall potential regional agricultural economic welfare the natural resource economics literature relies heavily on the principle of discounted net present value the economic value to current and future users from consumption of a resource measured in present value terms ward 2006 competition for water remains high in the arid regions of the world and in these regions enacting policies that ensure water goes to its highest valued uses remains an important policy goal optimizing the discounted net present value of pumping while respecting the need for aquifer sustainability is the novel contribution of the present work 2 4 mathematical optimization modeling mathematical programming implemented with the gams general algebraic modeling system package is used to construct a hydro economic groundwater economic optimization model that seeks the highest valued economic returns in discounted net present value terms associated with any given allocation of scarce aquifer pumped water data on aquifer starting storage appear in table 1 calibration is achieved by varying the model parameters so that under optimization observed pumping depths over time match historical levels for the two regional freshwater aquifers currently in use the model code structure is formatted using sets parameters variables equations bounds and separate runs of the model both without and with aquifer protection and with and without food grain security requirements the complete gams code is in the attached appendix a with a spreadsheet output in appendix b the groundwater models were calibrated to reflect recharge that occurred based on estimated pumping associated with implied water used for observed cropping activities to produce the pumping depth increases seen in the region more details for a similar approach are described in an earlier work baah kumi et al 2022 two groups of crops were established based on similar dietary function across the regions each produced legumes and wheat products but had slightly different individual crops for this reason beans and cowpeas were grouped together as was as sorghum and wheat this was done to keep the model to a manageable scale the final choice of most relevant crops was limited to ones with a long history of cultivation in the region maize sorghum cowpeas kale and tomatoes 2 5 positive

optimization model and is characterized by observed data on pumping pumping depth and farm income it is a state of the art methodology for formulating scenarios where policy assessments are being investigated paris 2010 one way to view pmp is the discovery of unknown parameters through inverse modeling processes droogers et al 2010 foolad et al 2017 kitanidis 2015 mbonimpa et al 2015 pistocchi et al 2012 based on theoretically well understood economic and hydrologic principles use of the pmp method is based on calculating parameters in a linear crop yield function for which yields decline linearly with an expanded scale of production these calculated parameters are those which if used by the agricultural sector would produce a maximized level of income that matches the observed level actually seen 2 6 constraints and objective the model sets up a series of equations subject to institutional and food production constraints seeking optimized values of annual pumping land in production crop yield farm income and net revenue to assess the discounted net present value of the three policies described above the equations used are included as appendix a the tables produced by those optimized equations are attached in appendix b a crop water production function has two parameters that are discovered through the pmp calibration process the parameters once recovered are used to explain each crop s optimized yield as a linear function of its scale of its optimized land in production this calibration assures that model optimized land in production and yield match observed base conditions while being consistent with available land and water use the demand for water is achieved by setting its price equal to the value of its marginal product each crop s optimized crop yield levels in each of our farming regions is specified as 1 yield β 0 β 1 optimized land in production an earlier work describes the method by which these two terms can be calculated from observed net revenue land in production and crop prices dagnino and ward 2012 these two parameters shown in 1 are calculated as follows 2 β 1 net revenue per unit land crop price observed land in production for which β 1 estimated slope of the crop water production function while from 1 above 3 β 0 observed yield β 1 optimized land in production the term β 1 is interpreted as the change in optimized crop yield from one more unit of optimized land in production based on the principle of ricardian rent the term β 0 is the maximum yield for the first unit of land entering production use of eq 1 shows that lower yielding lands enter production in the face of higher crop prices only after the higher yielding lands are used when prices are too low to support farming on lower yielding lands bromley 2009 kratena 2008 souty et al 2012 the complete optimization model contains 24 blocks of equations 2038 individual equations 24 blocks of variables and 2759 individual variables from which 1932 have nonlinear elements making it too large to include in the body of this text the complete gams code and spreadsheet output are attached as two appendices permitting complete replication of the model the gams code is written with a standard algebraic formulation making every piece of data variables and equations easy to read for readers lacking access to the software itself 2 7 integration the lodwar and central merti were pumped historically while the lokipiti would have been pumped had suitable investments been made in desalination the three aquifers are mapped to four farming regions in the model producing five separate crop categories across counties the first model was calibrated to optimize discounted net present value of farm income while calibrating the crop yield functions using eqs 1 3 above to match historical hydrological and economic conditions the second model used the calibrated coefficients from the first model to minimize farm income losses needed to return aquifers to starting conditions the third investigation began with model 2 then added a lower bound on required grain production to protect food security the latter two models have considerably lower amounts of groundwater optimally pumped so showed a much higher economic capacity to pay for desalinated water since there would have been much lower amounts of desalinated water to be pumped we dealt with desalination and protection of the lotikipi aquifer using these steps base historical scenario without aquifer protection we simulated historical land in production and pumping in the lotikipi that would have occurred had desalination taken place prior to our first year 2014 we assumed a sufficient level of desalination to make pumping for crops in the lotipiki as economically viable as actually occurred for our other two study aquifers we simulated land in production and related pumping that would have occurred in the lokitipi with desalinated water beginning in 2014 proportional by land area to observed land in production for the two other aquifers based on observed changes in depth in the lodwar and central merti along with observed hydrologic characteristics like depth and porosity for the lotipiti changes in depth for the lotipiti were calculated as if pumping had started in 2014 effective aquifer recharge flux for all 3 aquifers was calculated based on total pumping aquifer area change in depth and porosity the hydrologic characteristics of the lotipiki were established in an earlier report radar technologies international 2013 non base counterfactual scenarios with aquifer protection after simulating pumping that would have occurred in the lotikipi with desalination to replicate basedline history without pumping regulations we re optimizied the model to pump sufficiently less to return the lotikipi to its 2014 starting level by the terminal year 2020 this resulted in predicting impacts of sustainable pumping reductions implemented both without and with a food grain security requirement overall desalination with no pumping restrictions would increase the lotikipi s drawdown but with the restrictions the lotikipi can be pumped sustainably by which the pumping would use nothing more than renewable recharge and no more to summarize our analysis runs three separate models 1 baseline observed 2 minimum cost of aquifer protection and 3 minimum cost of aquifer protection with additional protections for food security the first model discovers optimized variables without pumping constraints to sustain the aquifer the second achieves a maximization of net economic benefits in discounted net present value terms with the added constraints of sustaining the three aquifers the third augments the second for which added minimum grain crops production targets are assigned to support minimum acceptable levels of food security 3 results 3 1 overall several tables summarize results produced from the optimization model tables are presented for land in production table 2 total aquifer pumping table 3 total farm income table 4 and economic capacity to pay for desalinated water table 5 for each of three policies 3 2 land optimized land in production is shown for both regions by policy table 2 1 baseline 2 minimum cost of aquifer protection and 3 minimum cost of aquifer protection with added food security results are presented by policy aquifer area and farming region for which some results are summed over crops and years additionally the inclusion of a lower bound on maize the most important staple food crop used for this work is shown maize is the most widely produced grain crop in this part of kenya so lower bounds were set for maize to guide the choice of policies to support food grain security despite limitations placed on only one grain crop our approach has considerable generalizability for which total land in production for any number of grain crops could be established using the same approach regions in our study area allocate varying amounts of land in production to each of the crops based on total available water aquifer pumping constraints cost of pumping and agricultural inputs for which results are shown to vary slightly for each of the three policies assessed augmented production shown by differences in the second and third policy described above indicate that even with aquifer protection protocols limiting pumping in place much farm income and regional food security can continue to be sustained 3 3 total pumping table 3 shows optimized total pumping by year and policy under minimum cost of aquifer protection policy cap and trade aghaie et al 2020 debaere et al 2014 khan and brown 2019 optimized pumping is reduced considerably from years 2015 2020 in comparison to baseline observed levels shown for year 2014 the minimum cost aquifer protection cap and trade policy indicates that water conservation occurs with only a minimum economic loss in income in table 9 for example looking at year 2015 pumping is reduced from just over 253 mcm to just over 68 mcm summed over the aquifers under the base policy while income summed over the aquifers is reduced much less optimized farm income is reduced by less than one percent in the lodwar region by about 50 in the lotikipi region and almost no reduction in the central merti region minimum costs of achieving food security reduce pumping by different amounts in different aquifers to permit each region to grow crops and adapt to shortages based on their comparative advantage our results indicate that farmers show considerable flexibility to adapt to pumping constraints imposed to protect aquifers results show that even comparatively large pumping reductions produce small impacts on farm income and food production when designing policies for food insecure regions internationally short term needs faced by growing populations met by irrigation farming are important to consider when formulating science informed policy carver and boland 1980 cassman and harwood 1995 hussain and hanjra 2004 malik 2002 tilmant et al 2008 reduced pumping even brought on by the need to protect aquifers for future generations can be achieved even while meeting the needs of current populations facing threats of malnutrition kirby et al 2017 aquifer desalination if it can be accomplished affordably can be a treasured resource to provide water resources to take the pressure off unsustainable pumping of existing freshwater aquifers that would otherwise preclude protection of those freshwater aquifers for future generations if the desalination cost is suitably low brackish groundwater improvement through desalination could in some places be an economically sound investment that helps keep optimized values of pumping within acceptably high levels to sustain food security in both current and future years martinez alvarez et al 2020 qadir et al 2007 in addition to optimized pumping the model is calibrated to ensure that aquifer starting depths return to that level for which that requirement is achieved by appropriate bounding for policies number two aquifer protection and number three aquifer protection combined with food grain security protection 3 4 depth to pumping depth to pumping is also calculated for each of the three aquifers investigated its results show that though there is variability of depths in the intermediate years starting and ending depths are the same amount for aquifer protection policies 2 and 3 for all three aquifers depth to pumping depends on many kinds of data including weather local events such as a global pandemic locust invasions that have historically hit this region hielkema and snijders 1994 kiage and liu 2009 kimathi et al 2020 and changes in pumping due to regional political instability or greater refugee migration national drought management authority 2020 the bounds set on depth to return to historical levels are calibrated in the model and shown in that table for each of the three aquifers all begin at recorded depth to pumping levels in year 2014 and by the year 2020 return pumping to the starting depth for the second and third aquifer protection policies viewing the lotikipi aquifer for the year 2014 starting depth to pumping is shown to be 80 m 800 tenths of meters drawdown of the aquifer over the study period from years 2014 2020 fluctuates from 80 0 to just over 79 m for both the second and the third policy in the year 2019 the model is designed to find the water management choices that would ensure the aquifer is restored to 80 0 m depth by the end of 2020 in addition to pumping variability across years for agricultural uses drawdown on the aquifer can occur because of evapotranspiration for pumping as well as from precipitation as described in more detail by earlier work baah kumi et al 2021 results of pumping depths are not shown here because of space limitations 3 5 economic outcomes tables 4 and 5 shows results of important economic outcomes the marginal cost of returning pumping at each aquifer sometimes described as the shadow price of water is measured in us per thousand cubic meters while that shadow price is higher for the lotikipi aquifer region if desalination could be developed it also is seen that lodwar s shadow prices are higher than those of the central merti the shadow price of the central merti s is 17 38 while that of the lodwar s is 39 84 measured in us per 1000 cubic meter it is therefore more expensive in economic benefits displaced to reduce pumping from lodwar under both the second and third policy indicating a greater need for development of an alternate water supply to alleviate stress on turkana s local aquifer the shared aquifer lotikipi incurs the highest marginal cost of returning pumping to starting depth equals 570 85 while the lotikipi begins at a shallower level with associated lower costs linked to initial pumping it produces a higher overall economic welfare from having access to that aquifer if desalinated so welfare losses would be higher if its pumping were limited to return it to starting values the shadow price results are not shown because of table space limitations table 4 shows total farm income summed over crops and lands in production by year policy and aquifer in us 1000 it is notable to mention that total net income does depend on total acres in production for each of the crops which varies widely from crop to crop and year to year for several reasons including sporadic weather patterns and regional violence further analysis beyond that performed for this work would show that total net revenue in the model could be adjusted for future conditions varying with environmental and economic conditions for which the total would see considerable fluctuations due to these kinds of external factors the optimized model results show that farm incomes can remain comparatively high while still protecting local groundwater resources incomes are aggregated over crops for which results are shown by year aquifer and policy for the year 2015 farm income differs only slightly between baseline policy and food grain policy for lodwar aquifer at 40 043 and 39 967 in 1000 usd indicating further that livelihoods can largely be protected in two of the three aquifers in the face of environmental constraints the high increase in farm incomes in 2018 and 2019 can be attributed to rising prices of agricultural commodities globally in those years specifically regional institutional complications leading to food shortages are likely to have affected local prices especially for staples like maize national drought management authority 2020 results communicate an important message for the use of science to inform policy for the two policies for protecting the aquifers considered this protection does not negatively affect overall livelihoods for local farmers very much farm incomes adjust for depth to pumping restrictions in 2020 16 910 for lodwar aquifer but do end up higher in 2020 than in 2014 3758 we had very little access to research grade data for this region therefore net revenue and measured farm income could be described with more confidence with access to more research grade data even with lack of peer reviewed crop and aquifer data it is important to include net revenue and farm income when investigating overall economic effects of policies table 5 shows the all important capacity to pay for desalinated water results presented there show the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigated agriculture averaged over our years lies in the range of 0 08 per cubic meter under current conditions to 0 18 per cubic meter with efficient pumping caps in place indicating a greater capacity to pay per unit of water when pumping is more restricted for purposes of aquifer protection while this economic capacity to pay for desalinated water for irrigation is typically lower than the costs of desalination in most places worldwide today 2022 advances in desalination productivity reduced costs of brine disposal higher crop prices technical advance in agriculture and development of drought resistant crops could all contribute to a future capacity to pay enough for desalination for irrigation to justify its expense to summarize economic assessment under each policy shows that valuing pumped water from a depletable aquifer while accounting for their scarcity can be achieved with only minimal cost to regional food security poverty mitigation can be simultaneously attained alongside aquifer protection policies where aquifers are managed and developed carefully the optimization modeling approach used for this paper is used to discover the highest valued uses of water allocation over time space crop and policy these results contribute to future integrated works seeking to balance a variety of issues and constraints in a world of growing populations faced by deep uncertainties in water supplies 4 discussion 4 1 relevance results of our economic assessment show that desalination of brackish groundwater can increase food security as well as secure aquifer protection in a region where local conflicts climate variability and access to water have created food and security hardship for local inhabitants in recent years while our particular application is applied to a region in kenya east africa the methods of analysis could have some generalizability to other places where irrigation is important aquifer sustainability is under threat and substitute resources are available or can be developed 4 2 scope the discovery of programs to protect aquifers in irrigation dominant regions of the world while protecting food security supplied by local food grains will continue to challenge water and agricultural science and management as well as water and food policy growing evidence of climate change with deep uncertainty over future water supplies will compound the challenges of achieving these important missions in order to protect depletable aquifer resources in the world s arid regions for future as well as current generations there remains an ongoing search for policies that will both protect aquifers and assure acceptable food security while our study region is limited to two regions in kenya east africa it shows that where the backstop technology churchill et al 2019 hoel and kverndokk 1996 of inland aquifer desalination can be developed affordably aquifer protection measures when designed efficiently and scientifically need not pose insurmountable burdens on farm incomes or food security the current economic capacity to pay for desalinated water for irrigation water is less than its current cost but commercially economic viability of aquifer desalination for crop irrigation could grow in future years and desalination costs are likely to continue falling nevertheless desalination developments to make pumping sufficiently affordable for irrigation remains a big challenge in this part of the world for which these costs are still not completely documented for this region mimides et al 2015 missimer et al 2014 rivett et al 2019 or in other parts of east africa our findings show that regional economic growth in a dominant irrigation economy can be sustained while protecting local aquifer water sources for this work inclusion of desalinated water from a recently discovered aquifer the lotikipi under optimistic assumptions about the future cost of desalination can help protect local aquifers by providing an alternate source of freshwater through desalination as a backstop technology just et al 2005 ward and becker 2015b arid regions can benefit from a backstop technology like desalination that provides freshwater at a high cost government subsidization of desalination infrastructure can help encourage users to choose desalinated water as an alternative to net discharge of local freshwater aquifers the case study done in turkana and marsabit counties kenya has implications for similar arid regions and has the potential to be replicable by adjusting the parameters we used for the current integrated economic and hydrologic model the model offers some optimistic evidence that improving pastoral livelihoods while simultaneously protecting water resources is possible for kenya as well as other irrigation dominant regions where water is pumped to protect local food grain security 4 3 limitations this work has several limitations including a lack of research grade data due to these understudied regions for which modern science has produced few peer reviewed results we secured and used data from the national drought management authority of kenya and publications from unesco and radar technologies international on crop land area and aquifer dimensions but little is available that we were able to find on evapotranspiration rates in this region ansems et al 2015 our economic data requiring reliable information crop prices for the various crops were not much better in addition to this limitations of the model include having to roughly assign data to pumping costs from each of the aquifers moreover effectiveness of existing policies are limited in light of weakly implemented and enforced aquifer protection policies based on the large number of unregulated boreholes foster et al 2018a 2018b whaley et al 2019 another limitation of this work is the exclusive focus on pumping to support irrigated agriculture to widen this scope in future work we plan to investigate sustainable aquifer pumping in this region to better assess the competition for water among all sectors competing for scarce pumping rights even without direct competition for scarce water irrigated agriculture buys inputs from many other sectors as well as selling outputs to those sectors we would like to broaden our scope to account for these multiple sectors in future work an additional limitation of this paper that it leaves untouched the detailed policy implementations that can achieve the sustainability outcomes discussed for example there are several institutional economic factors that act to constrain or regulate the depletion of these aquifers a few include 1 regulation of the pumping technology such as the number and sizes of boreholes 2 regulation of water pumping licenses 3 regulation of the demand side such as limiting the amount of land under irrigation and of other elements such as crop type or season length 4 regulation of crop prices that determine pumping rates 5 or regulation of factors that set prices such as the provision of renewable energy and 6 other economic measures that assist the draw down or recharge of the aquifer such as crop markets or incentives to recharge aquifers 5 conclusions international water shortages made more difficult by climate change have spurred needs for innovative research addressing protection of food and water security while protecting scarce water resources for future generations searching for policies that can solve these problems in an integrated way will be of growing importance in coming years because of the strain of population growth on existing water resources coupled with growing climate variability and sporadic weather patterns hydro economic analysis such as conducted for this work that includes case studies in arid regions can help further research applicable to many regions internationally with similar climates desalination of the lotikipi aquifer presents an example of searching for alternative water sources at the regional level to protect against depletion of key local sources of water that are under threat this work developed three pumping models and a mathematical planning model in order to determine the affordability of paying for aquifer desalination irrigation to mitigate freshwater aquifer depletion study results provide an original framework for assessing the capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation of large saline freshwater formations as well as guiding policy makers in pumping allocations for different crops different aquifers and different time periods findings indicate that when pumping is unrestricted with no attempt to return the pumping depth of the lotikipi aquifer to its starting value the maximum capacity to pay is about 0 08 usd m3 considerably less than the cost of aquifer desalination using today s best technology however when pumping is restricted to aquifer sustainable levels pumping levels fall by about 2 3 of historical levels while incomes fall by only about 1 3 of historical levels raising the average capacity to pay from about 0 08 usd m3 to about 0 18 usd per m3 such a sustainability policy more than doubles the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination because of the much larger proportion pumping reduction than income generation the capacity to pay of 0 18 usd per m3 is still lower than the best desal costs today which according to one estimate can be as low as 0 25 usd per m3 depending on which costs are included nativ et al 2021 desalination is a continuously

8998,in aquifer dependent regions balancing aquifer protection desalination economic development agricultural irrigation and food security can be better managed through discovery and development of sources of sustainable groundwater pumping aquifer desalination for irrigation to protect food security can mitigate pressure on local freshwater aquifers despite its importance little peer reviewed work to date has identified the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation to mitigate freshwater aquifer drawdown the novel contribution of this work is the development and application of an innovative method to assess the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation for a recently discovered large saline aquifer it develops an original framework to assess the capacity to pay for aquifer desalination the results of which can help guide policymakers on efficient and sustainable pumping approaches across users aquifers and time periods a mathematical programming model is developed to economically analyze the 200 billion cubic meter lotikipi aquifer discovered in 2013 in northern kenya using modern remote sensing methods while initial pumping of the lotikipi aquifer was halted due to high groundwater salinity levels interest remains strong in assessing the economic capacity to pay for groundwater desalination because of its potential role in protecting regional food security generated by aquifer pumping for irrigation the model is formulated by calibrating optimized pumping patterns in two existing freshwater aquifers to replicate observed historical pumping levels based on that exercise a second model is developed to identify a least cost set of pumping restrictions that return each of three regional aquifers to starting conditions over a seven year time period a third model extends the second by adding a constraint of a minimum required level of food grain security supported by irrigation pumping from the aquifer system results show that the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigated agriculture lies in the range of 0 08 0 18 usd per cubic meter under current economic conditions and desalination technologies available while this economic capacity to pay is lower than its current cost in most places the future could be more optimistic advances in desalination technology higher crop prices technical advance in agriculture and development of drought resistant crops can all contribute to a future capacity to economically justify the expense of desalination keywords

growing importance in future years with continued growth in climate water stress gohar et al 2019 habteyes and ward 2020 ward et al 2022 2019 yoffe et al 2003 there remains an unmet need for a unique contribution to the literature that brings together these disparate elements into a unified framework such an integrated approach has the potential to be replicable in various regions internationally using locally available data for which aquifer stress challenges will be magnified by climate change 1 4 contribution this investigation s novel contribution is to conduct an economic assessment of the capacity to pay for desalinated water used for irrigation in a region where a recently discovered aquifer identified large supplies of water that were later found to be too saline for commercially viable irrigation with continued population growth and climate stressed freshwater resources the design of policies to improve development of sustainable useable water while respecting environmental constraints is timely relevant and necessary this contribution assesses the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalinated water used for crop irrigation where existing freshwater aquifers face long term declines because of high levels of irrigation pumping in local freshwater aquifers to support regional food security methods developed in this work could be adapted to support the assessment of proposed policies that would desalinate aquifers in places where freshwater aquifers face high pumping rates 2 methods of analysis 2 1 study area and hydrologic elements turkana county in northern kenya fig 1 shares a border with uganda south sudan and ethiopia marsabit county is in the eastern part of the country approximately 927 000 people live in the semi arid landscape of turkana average temperatures range from 20 to 41 degrees celsius sporadic rainfall and erratic weather patterns due to climate variability create ongoing challenges for local farmers who have limited access to surface water aside from seasonal rivers and streams high rates of runoff and evapotranspiration are common long rains akiporo fall between april and july while short rains occur in october and november dry periods akamu occur in january february and september unprotected boreholes provide access to underground water resources but are under threat of overuse especially during drought periods republic of kenya 2020 lake turkana is a notable surface water source for local fishers but is currently unfit for irrigated agriculture as it is the most saline of all the freshwater rift valley lakes radar technologies international 2013 little work to date has been published describing the economic costs of making the water from lake turkana fit for uses like irrigated agriculture and drinking so the data that could characterize the benefits and costs of cleaning turkana s water are not readily available marsabit county lies directly to the east of turkana county fig 1 borders ethiopia and is a semi arid region turkana is the largest county in kenya for which its population in 2019 was estimated at just under 460 000 republic of kenya 2019 long term average temperatures range from 10 to 30 degrees celsius marsabit experiences regular drought erratic precipitation underdeveloped infrastructure and regional political insecurity farmers there face high prices of inputs used in agriculture such as land water labor and machinery they also face weakly developed food markets in this region plains volcanic areas and the chalbi desert break up the landscape seasonal rivers the milgis and merille occasionally provide water kenyan ministry of agriculture 2017 but the region still suffers from water insecurity overall both counties are hard places to live and thrive nationwide 17 million kenyans have little access to affordable and reliable freshwater and almost twice that number 28 million lack viable access to sanitation radar technologies international 2013 out of all county municipalities in kenya the regions most vulnerable to chronic malnutrition are turkana and marsabit counties where 60 of the combined populations live below the poverty line korir et al 2021 further complications due to covid 19 have elevated food shortages and contributed to farm income shocks made worse by reductions in normal regional economic activity these challenges are combined with stress placed on local vegetation by the locust species shistocerca gregaria which has caused significant devastation in the area since december 2019 kansiime et al 2021 in 2013 the us geological survey took part in a remote sensing effort in northern kenya that helped assess several previously poorly characterized underground aquifers the largest of these aquifers was the lotikipi aquifer with a potential to hold just over 200 billion cubic meters of water radar technologies international 2013 the lotikipi was estimated to sustain the entire population of kenya for over 70 years if the water could be made of acceptable quality however preliminary borehole testing showed the water was too saline for human consumption so construction of abstraction plants was halted for several years radar technologies international 2013 in 2019 the kenyan government announced its plans to partner with almar water of spain to construct desalination plants to make the water fit for human consumption takouleu october 31 2019 aquifer desalination is an expensive proposition so a big question with considerable food policy implications surrounds the economic capacity to pay for this water destined to be used for crop irrigation one of the lowest commercially valued uses of water cai et al 2003 chandrasekaran et al 2009 martinez granados et al 2011 medellin azuara et al 2010 tilmant et al 2008 ward and pulido velazquez 2012 both turkana and marsabit counties face the risk of depleting local freshwater resources seasonal rivers and rainfall make up some of the water use for agriculture but renewable groundwater resources coming from natural recharge and irrigation return flows provide a greater volume of the water in the region and with suitable quality upgrades at an affordable cost could represent a sustainable way to increase food security in the area the lodwar aquifer in turkana county is estimated radar technologies international 2013 to hold about 10 000 million m3 mcm we found little to no peer reviewed sources presenting research grade hydrologic estimates comparable to those in the radar technologies report the merti is a large aquifer that underlies several regions but the freshwater portion available and useable for pumping is much smaller and is partially situated in the marsabit wajir regions referred to here as the central merti aquifer the central merti is significantly larger than the lodwar aquifer at 50 000 mcm the central merti is the local aquifer connected to marsabit region and is a vital renewable groundwater resource used by many domestic users as well as use by refugees living in the region mumma et al 2011 the lotikipi is estimated to hold just over 200 000 mcm radar technologies international 2013 it is significantly larger than the other two this water source if made economically useable through desalination can be shared by both counties alleviate local groundwater stress for both the lodwar and central merti aquifers and create more sustainable economic and food security outcomes targeted development of the lotikipi can help water planners identify where to develop new wellfields to reach a wider population table 2 depth to pumping is an important indicator of the current economic costs for all these aquifers after calibrating our model to replicate observed pumping table 3 and pumping depths for observed base conditions the model was re optimized at a second stage using adjusted constraints so that its optimized pumping produces depths in the final year that return to starting depths i e use is reduced compared to base conditions so that the aquifer s depth is sustainable over the study period this approach has the effect of identifying a target for pumping over a range of years to allow flexibility for varying depth requirements in different years costs of pumping can be a significant part of total costs and will grow as aquifer groundwater depths decline varying weather patterns and varying food demands can be expected to alter pumping depths from year to year overall a long term balanced and sustained aquifer to guide discovery of the economic capacity to pay for a desalinated lotikipi motivates the current work the lotikipi holds greater stocks of water but it more expensive to pump and put to economical use because of its need for desalination because little research grade data were available to assess the cost of desalination we developed an innovative method to assess the economic capacity to pay for desalinated water if that desalination occurred to compare the capacity to pay to the cost once that cost is better understood this capacity to pay for desalination is a useful piece of information to compare to the cost of desalination when that cost falls sufficiently in future years table 4 2 2 hydrologic agronomic and economic data available data on cropping patterns in both turkana and marsabit were secured from the national

for regional and local aquifers discovered through new innovative remote sensing methods conducted in northern kenya as discussed in more detail elsewhere baah kumi et al 2021 pumping cost formulas as a function of depth were based on an earlier work mckinney and lin 1994 while water use per unit land was based on one of the classic published works hargreaves and samani 1982 net crop revenue per unit land equals crop price multiplied by crop yield minus average costs of production there was no observed land in production for the lotikipi aquifer because the highly saline aquifer reserves for our historical period of record precluding pumping so counterfactual estimates were required da cunha et al 2015 dillon 2011 gunda et al 2018 sampson and perry 2019 siegfried and bernauer 2007 zuo et al 2018 for land that would have been in production with suitable desalination of the aquifer at an irrigation affordable cost these estimates were based on proportion of volume of the lotikipi aquifer compared to the other two aquifers allocated to a suitable amount of land supported for irrigation had that aquifer s water been desalinated to the point that aquifer water would have been economically viable for crop production barron et al 2015 garcia marin et al 2020 hipolito valencia et al 2021 ruperez moreno et al 2017 this approach to estimating land that would have been in production adjusting to conditions for lands that were in production at other places is sometimes referred to as a data transfer approach a long literature for conducting data transfer exercises has been developed since the early 1990 s johnston and rosenberger 2010 loomis 1992 nelson and kennedy 2009 richardson et al 2015 wilson and hoehn 2006 2 3 conceptual framework facing finite water resources the maximization of net economic benefits across water users while allocating water to its highest valued uses is a state of the art approach to regional economic development assessments bekchanov et al 2017 harou et al 2010 kahil et al 2018 maneta et al 2009 rosenberg et al 2008 ward 2009 income gains by local farmers due to expanded supply conditions with suitably affordable desalinated water will influence economic development and regional food security net revenue per unit land and net total farm income net revenue per unit land multiplied by total land in production are used in our model to reflect overall potential regional agricultural economic welfare the natural resource economics literature relies heavily on the principle of discounted net present value the economic value to current and future users from consumption of a resource measured in present value terms ward 2006 competition for water remains high in the arid regions of the world and in these regions enacting policies that ensure water goes to its highest valued uses remains an important policy goal optimizing the discounted net present value of pumping while respecting the need for aquifer sustainability is the novel contribution of the present work 2 4 mathematical optimization modeling mathematical programming implemented with the gams general algebraic modeling system package is used to construct a hydro economic groundwater economic optimization model that seeks the highest valued economic returns in discounted net present value terms associated with any given allocation of scarce aquifer pumped water data on aquifer starting storage appear in table 1 calibration is achieved by varying the model parameters so that under optimization observed pumping depths over time match historical levels for the two regional freshwater aquifers currently in use the model code structure is formatted using sets parameters variables equations bounds and separate runs of the model both without and with aquifer protection and with and without food grain security requirements the complete gams code is in the attached appendix a with a spreadsheet output in appendix b the groundwater models were calibrated to reflect recharge that occurred based on estimated pumping associated with implied water used for observed cropping activities to produce the pumping depth increases seen in the region more details for a similar approach are described in an earlier work baah kumi et al 2022 two groups of crops were established based on similar dietary function across the regions each produced legumes and wheat products but had slightly different individual crops for this reason beans and cowpeas were grouped together as was as sorghum and wheat this was done to keep the model to a manageable scale the final choice of most relevant crops was limited to ones with a long history of cultivation in the region maize sorghum cowpeas kale and tomatoes 2 5 positive

optimization model and is characterized by observed data on pumping pumping depth and farm income it is a state of the art methodology for formulating scenarios where policy assessments are being investigated paris 2010 one way to view pmp is the discovery of unknown parameters through inverse modeling processes droogers et al 2010 foolad et al 2017 kitanidis 2015 mbonimpa et al 2015 pistocchi et al 2012 based on theoretically well understood economic and hydrologic principles use of the pmp method is based on calculating parameters in a linear crop yield function for which yields decline linearly with an expanded scale of production these calculated parameters are those which if used by the agricultural sector would produce a maximized level of income that matches the observed level actually seen 2 6 constraints and objective the model sets up a series of equations subject to institutional and food production constraints seeking optimized values of annual pumping land in production crop yield farm income and net revenue to assess the discounted net present value of the three policies described above the equations used are included as appendix a the tables produced by those optimized equations are attached in appendix b a crop water production function has two parameters that are discovered through the pmp calibration process the parameters once recovered are used to explain each crop s optimized yield as a linear function of its scale of its optimized land in production this calibration assures that model optimized land in production and yield match observed base conditions while being consistent with available land and water use the demand for water is achieved by setting its price equal to the value of its marginal product each crop s optimized crop yield levels in each of our farming regions is specified as 1 yield β 0 β 1 optimized land in production an earlier work describes the method by which these two terms can be calculated from observed net revenue land in production and crop prices dagnino and ward 2012 these two parameters shown in 1 are calculated as follows 2 β 1 net revenue per unit land crop price observed land in production for which β 1 estimated slope of the crop water production function while from 1 above 3 β 0 observed yield β 1 optimized land in production the term β 1 is interpreted as the change in optimized crop yield from one more unit of optimized land in production based on the principle of ricardian rent the term β 0 is the maximum yield for the first unit of land entering production use of eq 1 shows that lower yielding lands enter production in the face of higher crop prices only after the higher yielding lands are used when prices are too low to support farming on lower yielding lands bromley 2009 kratena 2008 souty et al 2012 the complete optimization model contains 24 blocks of equations 2038 individual equations 24 blocks of variables and 2759 individual variables from which 1932 have nonlinear elements making it too large to include in the body of this text the complete gams code and spreadsheet output are attached as two appendices permitting complete replication of the model the gams code is written with a standard algebraic formulation making every piece of data variables and equations easy to read for readers lacking access to the software itself 2 7 integration the lodwar and central merti were pumped historically while the lokipiti would have been pumped had suitable investments been made in desalination the three aquifers are mapped to four farming regions in the model producing five separate crop categories across counties the first model was calibrated to optimize discounted net present value of farm income while calibrating the crop yield functions using eqs 1 3 above to match historical hydrological and economic conditions the second model used the calibrated coefficients from the first model to minimize farm income losses needed to return aquifers to starting conditions the third investigation began with model 2 then added a lower bound on required grain production to protect food security the latter two models have considerably lower amounts of groundwater optimally pumped so showed a much higher economic capacity to pay for desalinated water since there would have been much lower amounts of desalinated water to be pumped we dealt with desalination and protection of the lotikipi aquifer using these steps base historical scenario without aquifer protection we simulated historical land in production and pumping in the lotikipi that would have occurred had desalination taken place prior to our first year 2014 we assumed a sufficient level of desalination to make pumping for crops in the lotipiki as economically viable as actually occurred for our other two study aquifers we simulated land in production and related pumping that would have occurred in the lokitipi with desalinated water beginning in 2014 proportional by land area to observed land in production for the two other aquifers based on observed changes in depth in the lodwar and central merti along with observed hydrologic characteristics like depth and porosity for the lotipiti changes in depth for the lotipiti were calculated as if pumping had started in 2014 effective aquifer recharge flux for all 3 aquifers was calculated based on total pumping aquifer area change in depth and porosity the hydrologic characteristics of the lotipiki were established in an earlier report radar technologies international 2013 non base counterfactual scenarios with aquifer protection after simulating pumping that would have occurred in the lotikipi with desalination to replicate basedline history without pumping regulations we re optimizied the model to pump sufficiently less to return the lotikipi to its 2014 starting level by the terminal year 2020 this resulted in predicting impacts of sustainable pumping reductions implemented both without and with a food grain security requirement overall desalination with no pumping restrictions would increase the lotikipi s drawdown but with the restrictions the lotikipi can be pumped sustainably by which the pumping would use nothing more than renewable recharge and no more to summarize our analysis runs three separate models 1 baseline observed 2 minimum cost of aquifer protection and 3 minimum cost of aquifer protection with additional protections for food security the first model discovers optimized variables without pumping constraints to sustain the aquifer the second achieves a maximization of net economic benefits in discounted net present value terms with the added constraints of sustaining the three aquifers the third augments the second for which added minimum grain crops production targets are assigned to support minimum acceptable levels of food security 3 results 3 1 overall several tables summarize results produced from the optimization model tables are presented for land in production table 2 total aquifer pumping table 3 total farm income table 4 and economic capacity to pay for desalinated water table 5 for each of three policies 3 2 land optimized land in production is shown for both regions by policy table 2 1 baseline 2 minimum cost of aquifer protection and 3 minimum cost of aquifer protection with added food security results are presented by policy aquifer area and farming region for which some results are summed over crops and years additionally the inclusion of a lower bound on maize the most important staple food crop used for this work is shown maize is the most widely produced grain crop in this part of kenya so lower bounds were set for maize to guide the choice of policies to support food grain security despite limitations placed on only one grain crop our approach has considerable generalizability for which total land in production for any number of grain crops could be established using the same approach regions in our study area allocate varying amounts of land in production to each of the crops based on total available water aquifer pumping constraints cost of pumping and agricultural inputs for which results are shown to vary slightly for each of the three policies assessed augmented production shown by differences in the second and third policy described above indicate that even with aquifer protection protocols limiting pumping in place much farm income and regional food security can continue to be sustained 3 3 total pumping table 3 shows optimized total pumping by year and policy under minimum cost of aquifer protection policy cap and trade aghaie et al 2020 debaere et al 2014 khan and brown 2019 optimized pumping is reduced considerably from years 2015 2020 in comparison to baseline observed levels shown for year 2014 the minimum cost aquifer protection cap and trade policy indicates that water conservation occurs with only a minimum economic loss in income in table 9 for example looking at year 2015 pumping is reduced from just over 253 mcm to just over 68 mcm summed over the aquifers under the base policy while income summed over the aquifers is reduced much less optimized farm income is reduced by less than one percent in the lodwar region by about 50 in the lotikipi region and almost no reduction in the central merti region minimum costs of achieving food security reduce pumping by different amounts in different aquifers to permit each region to grow crops and adapt to shortages based on their comparative advantage our results indicate that farmers show considerable flexibility to adapt to pumping constraints imposed to protect aquifers results show that even comparatively large pumping reductions produce small impacts on farm income and food production when designing policies for food insecure regions internationally short term needs faced by growing populations met by irrigation farming are important to consider when formulating science informed policy carver and boland 1980 cassman and harwood 1995 hussain and hanjra 2004 malik 2002 tilmant et al 2008 reduced pumping even brought on by the need to protect aquifers for future generations can be achieved even while meeting the needs of current populations facing threats of malnutrition kirby et al 2017 aquifer desalination if it can be accomplished affordably can be a treasured resource to provide water resources to take the pressure off unsustainable pumping of existing freshwater aquifers that would otherwise preclude protection of those freshwater aquifers for future generations if the desalination cost is suitably low brackish groundwater improvement through desalination could in some places be an economically sound investment that helps keep optimized values of pumping within acceptably high levels to sustain food security in both current and future years martinez alvarez et al 2020 qadir et al 2007 in addition to optimized pumping the model is calibrated to ensure that aquifer starting depths return to that level for which that requirement is achieved by appropriate bounding for policies number two aquifer protection and number three aquifer protection combined with food grain security protection 3 4 depth to pumping depth to pumping is also calculated for each of the three aquifers investigated its results show that though there is variability of depths in the intermediate years starting and ending depths are the same amount for aquifer protection policies 2 and 3 for all three aquifers depth to pumping depends on many kinds of data including weather local events such as a global pandemic locust invasions that have historically hit this region hielkema and snijders 1994 kiage and liu 2009 kimathi et al 2020 and changes in pumping due to regional political instability or greater refugee migration national drought management authority 2020 the bounds set on depth to return to historical levels are calibrated in the model and shown in that table for each of the three aquifers all begin at recorded depth to pumping levels in year 2014 and by the year 2020 return pumping to the starting depth for the second and third aquifer protection policies viewing the lotikipi aquifer for the year 2014 starting depth to pumping is shown to be 80 m 800 tenths of meters drawdown of the aquifer over the study period from years 2014 2020 fluctuates from 80 0 to just over 79 m for both the second and the third policy in the year 2019 the model is designed to find the water management choices that would ensure the aquifer is restored to 80 0 m depth by the end of 2020 in addition to pumping variability across years for agricultural uses drawdown on the aquifer can occur because of evapotranspiration for pumping as well as from precipitation as described in more detail by earlier work baah kumi et al 2021 results of pumping depths are not shown here because of space limitations 3 5 economic outcomes tables 4 and 5 shows results of important economic outcomes the marginal cost of returning pumping at each aquifer sometimes described as the shadow price of water is measured in us per thousand cubic meters while that shadow price is higher for the lotikipi aquifer region if desalination could be developed it also is seen that lodwar s shadow prices are higher than those of the central merti the shadow price of the central merti s is 17 38 while that of the lodwar s is 39 84 measured in us per 1000 cubic meter it is therefore more expensive in economic benefits displaced to reduce pumping from lodwar under both the second and third policy indicating a greater need for development of an alternate water supply to alleviate stress on turkana s local aquifer the shared aquifer lotikipi incurs the highest marginal cost of returning pumping to starting depth equals 570 85 while the lotikipi begins at a shallower level with associated lower costs linked to initial pumping it produces a higher overall economic welfare from having access to that aquifer if desalinated so welfare losses would be higher if its pumping were limited to return it to starting values the shadow price results are not shown because of table space limitations table 4 shows total farm income summed over crops and lands in production by year policy and aquifer in us 1000 it is notable to mention that total net income does depend on total acres in production for each of the crops which varies widely from crop to crop and year to year for several reasons including sporadic weather patterns and regional violence further analysis beyond that performed for this work would show that total net revenue in the model could be adjusted for future conditions varying with environmental and economic conditions for which the total would see considerable fluctuations due to these kinds of external factors the optimized model results show that farm incomes can remain comparatively high while still protecting local groundwater resources incomes are aggregated over crops for which results are shown by year aquifer and policy for the year 2015 farm income differs only slightly between baseline policy and food grain policy for lodwar aquifer at 40 043 and 39 967 in 1000 usd indicating further that livelihoods can largely be protected in two of the three aquifers in the face of environmental constraints the high increase in farm incomes in 2018 and 2019 can be attributed to rising prices of agricultural commodities globally in those years specifically regional institutional complications leading to food shortages are likely to have affected local prices especially for staples like maize national drought management authority 2020 results communicate an important message for the use of science to inform policy for the two policies for protecting the aquifers considered this protection does not negatively affect overall livelihoods for local farmers very much farm incomes adjust for depth to pumping restrictions in 2020 16 910 for lodwar aquifer but do end up higher in 2020 than in 2014 3758 we had very little access to research grade data for this region therefore net revenue and measured farm income could be described with more confidence with access to more research grade data even with lack of peer reviewed crop and aquifer data it is important to include net revenue and farm income when investigating overall economic effects of policies table 5 shows the all important capacity to pay for desalinated water results presented there show the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigated agriculture averaged over our years lies in the range of 0 08 per cubic meter under current conditions to 0 18 per cubic meter with efficient pumping caps in place indicating a greater capacity to pay per unit of water when pumping is more restricted for purposes of aquifer protection while this economic capacity to pay for desalinated water for irrigation is typically lower than the costs of desalination in most places worldwide today 2022 advances in desalination productivity reduced costs of brine disposal higher crop prices technical advance in agriculture and development of drought resistant crops could all contribute to a future capacity to pay enough for desalination for irrigation to justify its expense to summarize economic assessment under each policy shows that valuing pumped water from a depletable aquifer while accounting for their scarcity can be achieved with only minimal cost to regional food security poverty mitigation can be simultaneously attained alongside aquifer protection policies where aquifers are managed and developed carefully the optimization modeling approach used for this paper is used to discover the highest valued uses of water allocation over time space crop and policy these results contribute to future integrated works seeking to balance a variety of issues and constraints in a world of growing populations faced by deep uncertainties in water supplies 4 discussion 4 1 relevance results of our economic assessment show that desalination of brackish groundwater can increase food security as well as secure aquifer protection in a region where local conflicts climate variability and access to water have created food and security hardship for local inhabitants in recent years while our particular application is applied to a region in kenya east africa the methods of analysis could have some generalizability to other places where irrigation is important aquifer sustainability is under threat and substitute resources are available or can be developed 4 2 scope the discovery of programs to protect aquifers in irrigation dominant regions of the world while protecting food security supplied by local food grains will continue to challenge water and agricultural science and management as well as water and food policy growing evidence of climate change with deep uncertainty over future water supplies will compound the challenges of achieving these important missions in order to protect depletable aquifer resources in the world s arid regions for future as well as current generations there remains an ongoing search for policies that will both protect aquifers and assure acceptable food security while our study region is limited to two regions in kenya east africa it shows that where the backstop technology churchill et al 2019 hoel and kverndokk 1996 of inland aquifer desalination can be developed affordably aquifer protection measures when designed efficiently and scientifically need not pose insurmountable burdens on farm incomes or food security the current economic capacity to pay for desalinated water for irrigation water is less than its current cost but commercially economic viability of aquifer desalination for crop irrigation could grow in future years and desalination costs are likely to continue falling nevertheless desalination developments to make pumping sufficiently affordable for irrigation remains a big challenge in this part of the world for which these costs are still not completely documented for this region mimides et al 2015 missimer et al 2014 rivett et al 2019 or in other parts of east africa our findings show that regional economic growth in a dominant irrigation economy can be sustained while protecting local aquifer water sources for this work inclusion of desalinated water from a recently discovered aquifer the lotikipi under optimistic assumptions about the future cost of desalination can help protect local aquifers by providing an alternate source of freshwater through desalination as a backstop technology just et al 2005 ward and becker 2015b arid regions can benefit from a backstop technology like desalination that provides freshwater at a high cost government subsidization of desalination infrastructure can help encourage users to choose desalinated water as an alternative to net discharge of local freshwater aquifers the case study done in turkana and marsabit counties kenya has implications for similar arid regions and has the potential to be replicable by adjusting the parameters we used for the current integrated economic and hydrologic model the model offers some optimistic evidence that improving pastoral livelihoods while simultaneously protecting water resources is possible for kenya as well as other irrigation dominant regions where water is pumped to protect local food grain security 4 3 limitations this work has several limitations including a lack of research grade data due to these understudied regions for which modern science has produced few peer reviewed results we secured and used data from the national drought management authority of kenya and publications from unesco and radar technologies international on crop land area and aquifer dimensions but little is available that we were able to find on evapotranspiration rates in this region ansems et al 2015 our economic data requiring reliable information crop prices for the various crops were not much better in addition to this limitations of the model include having to roughly assign data to pumping costs from each of the aquifers moreover effectiveness of existing policies are limited in light of weakly implemented and enforced aquifer protection policies based on the large number of unregulated boreholes foster et al 2018a 2018b whaley et al 2019 another limitation of this work is the exclusive focus on pumping to support irrigated agriculture to widen this scope in future work we plan to investigate sustainable aquifer pumping in this region to better assess the competition for water among all sectors competing for scarce pumping rights even without direct competition for scarce water irrigated agriculture buys inputs from many other sectors as well as selling outputs to those sectors we would like to broaden our scope to account for these multiple sectors in future work an additional limitation of this paper that it leaves untouched the detailed policy implementations that can achieve the sustainability outcomes discussed for example there are several institutional economic factors that act to constrain or regulate the depletion of these aquifers a few include 1 regulation of the pumping technology such as the number and sizes of boreholes 2 regulation of water pumping licenses 3 regulation of the demand side such as limiting the amount of land under irrigation and of other elements such as crop type or season length 4 regulation of crop prices that determine pumping rates 5 or regulation of factors that set prices such as the provision of renewable energy and 6 other economic measures that assist the draw down or recharge of the aquifer such as crop markets or incentives to recharge aquifers 5 conclusions international water shortages made more difficult by climate change have spurred needs for innovative research addressing protection of food and water security while protecting scarce water resources for future generations searching for policies that can solve these problems in an integrated way will be of growing importance in coming years because of the strain of population growth on existing water resources coupled with growing climate variability and sporadic weather patterns hydro economic analysis such as conducted for this work that includes case studies in arid regions can help further research applicable to many regions internationally with similar climates desalination of the lotikipi aquifer presents an example of searching for alternative water sources at the regional level to protect against depletion of key local sources of water that are under threat this work developed three pumping models and a mathematical planning model in order to determine the affordability of paying for aquifer desalination irrigation to mitigate freshwater aquifer depletion study results provide an original framework for assessing the capacity to pay for aquifer desalination for irrigation of large saline freshwater formations as well as guiding policy makers in pumping allocations for different crops different aquifers and different time periods findings indicate that when pumping is unrestricted with no attempt to return the pumping depth of the lotikipi aquifer to its starting value the maximum capacity to pay is about 0 08 usd m3 considerably less than the cost of aquifer desalination using today s best technology however when pumping is restricted to aquifer sustainable levels pumping levels fall by about 2 3 of historical levels while incomes fall by only about 1 3 of historical levels raising the average capacity to pay from about 0 08 usd m3 to about 0 18 usd per m3 such a sustainability policy more than doubles the economic capacity to pay for aquifer desalination because of the much larger proportion pumping reduction than income generation the capacity to pay of 0 18 usd per m3 is still lower than the best desal costs today which according to one estimate can be as low as 0 25 usd per m3 depending on which costs are included nativ et al 2021 desalination is a continuously

8999,irrigated agriculture has been in a quandary of sustaining its productivity for centuries while attempting to cope with soil and water salinity issues that continue to devastate crop production several of the research gaps associated with current irrigation practices include how to assess leaching requirement lr and efficiency le for different soils crops and irrigation regimes the objective of this study was to test irrigation water application methods on salinity leaching efficiency using laboratory soil column experiments and computer model simulations three water application methods continuous ponding cp intermittent ponding ip and unsaturated application ua were imposed on packed columns of 3 different soils to evaluate salinity leaching efficiency the hydrus 1d model was employed to inversely estimate water and solute transport parameters from the column experimental data while the hydrus 2d model was used to simulate water and salinity transport under flexible actual field practice and fixed frequency irrigation every 7 5 and 3 days under the same field conditions our column results showed that water application methods had greater impact on leaching efficiency le in coarse soil than that in fine soil the soil quality s index also changed with water application methods continuous ponding had higher le for the sandy loam and silt loam unsaturated application was the best for the silt loam while intermittent ponding and unsaturated application were good for both the silt loam and clay model simulations indicated that flexible frequency irrigation resulted in lower salinity in the rootzone than that of fixed frequency irrigation while for the fixed frequency irrigation more frequent application with smaller amount of water was better for the silt loam leaching efficiency under flexible frequency irrigation was 94 2 while for the fixed frequency irrigation the le values were 87 8 95 4 98 0 respectively for 7 5 and 3 d intervals the findings from this research can help farmers improve water use efficiency by considering water application methods and soil conditions keywords leaching efficiency irrigation methods rootzone hydrus 1d 2d agriculture water management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasing water use efficiency in irrigated cropland is critical to sustaining water resources and improving agricultural productivity especially in arid and semiarid regions where soils are most affected by salts expansion of irrigated cropland and increased reliance on marginal water sources combining with low leaching efficiency le the ratio of the drained salt mass to the applied salt mass and poor soil internal drainage conditions can often lead to soil salinization kitamura et al 2006 minhas et al 2020 standard guidelines for managing irrigation and salinity are mostly designed with the goal of meeting the leaching requirement lr to maintain rootzone salinity at a level that avoids any reduction in crop growth or yield yang et al 2019 an important aspect for the success of such strategy is the adoption of appropriate irrigation methods for specific soils and climate conditions a range of pressurized irrigation methods sprinkler drip offer alternatives to the traditional surface irrigation furrow basin in terms of efficiency environmental impact health risks and more barnard et al 2010 in general for a water of specific quality and for a given crop the impact of an irrigation method on the rate of salinization will depend on several variables including vertical and spatial distribution of soil properties topography irrigation management cultural practices climatic conditions and regional hydrological conditions oster et al 2012 nassah et al 2018 minhas et al 2020 different irrigation methods such as flood furrow sprinkler or drip can result in different patterns of saturated and unsaturated water flow in the rootzone under continuous ponding cp the soil is always saturated and the flow is steady during an irrigation event while under intermittent ponding ip it consists of two periods a water application period and a rest period during the rest period the soil is saturated at the beginning but flow is interrupted for a predetermined period and no convective transport will occur in this period i e it is assumed that solute transfer is only by radial diffusion from the immobile water region within the spheres to the mobile water region between them rezaei et al 2021 pressurized drip irrigation can be treated as unsaturated application ua barnard et al 2010 callaghan et al 2017 which allows enough time for solute diffusing to the surface of aggregates so that it can subsequently be removed by convective dispersion transport through larger pores and minimize the effects of bypass flow barnard et al 2010 the traditional leaching guidelines usually follow the leaching requirement lr concept that is based on steady state water flow and salt mass balance although true steady state conditions do not exist in the real world irrigated systems steady state may become a reasonable approximation over a sufficiently long period such as a season or more mathematically a steady state flow analysis does not include a time variable and thus there are many factors that can violate the steady state assumption under the field conditions especially in irrigated croplands where alternating wetting and drying conditions are more the rule than exception letey et al 2011 for drip irrigation the use of conventional lr can result in excessive leaching yang et al 2019 this further justifies the reassessment of the traditional one value lr and adopting a more comprehensive approach to determine leaching requirement by considering the relationships among water salinity water application rate soil texture and the amount of leaching letey et al 2011 oster et al 2012 minhas et al 2020 the performances of irrigation methods concerning their efficiency and crop response have been extensively studied but very little is known about the impact of water application methods on leaching efficiency in various textured soils with different hydraulic properties as indicated by hoffman 2009 application rates have effects on soil salinity leaching efficiency and the leaching coefficient is approximately 0 3 for ponding and 0 15 for sprinkler application mathematical models can represent the natural system and objective use of models can guide both our future research efforts and current management practices mirbagheri 2004 while column experiments are useful tools for constructing models and estimating model parameters li et al 2007 the overall objective of this research was to assess irrigation management practices on salinity leaching efficiency in three soils of different textures specifically we aimed to 1 conduct laboratory column experiments to evaluate the effect of water application methods on salinity leaching efficiency in the test soils 2 use inverse modeling of column experiment to estimate water and solute transport parameters and assess the effect of water application methods on soil quality s index and 3 identify water application methods to achieve optimal leaching efficiency through a series of simulations under field conditions by taking into account of soil properties crop type irrigation water quantity and quality and irrigation methods 2 material and methods 2 1 laboratory leaching experiments 2 1 1 soil sampling and preparation three surface soils 0 25 cm were collected from three field sites in california a sandy loam coarse loamy mixed superactive calcareous thermic typic xerofluvents was from south coast research extension center south coast rec in irvine ca a silt loam fine loamy mixed superactive thermic durinodic xeric haplargids was from an almond orchard in kern county ca and a clay soil fine smectitic calcareous hyperthermic vertic torrifluvents was from the desert research extension center desert rec in holtville ca respectively the collected bulk soils were air dried gently crumbled to pass through a 2 mm sieve and mixed thoroughly before packing particle size analysis was performed to verify soil texture using a laser particle size analyzer beckman coulter ls 13 320 table 1 2 1 2 soil column setup and pretreatments plex glass cylinders 10 cm dia by 35 cm high were used for packing the soil columns in each column a cellulose sheet was placed at the bottom of the column followed by 1 cm homogeneous grain sized sand 1 mm dia to facilitate free drainage and ensure one dimensional water movement the air dried soil was then packed in 5 cm increments according to the measured field soil bulk density to a total height of 30 cm table 1 the column experimental treatments included 3 soil types and 3 water application methods and each treatment was replicated 3 times resulting in a total of 27 packed soil columns two additional columns of each soil type were also used for measuring initial soil salinity distribution after pretreatment of the columns before leaching each packed soil column was slowly saturated from the bottom with a saline solution applied by a mariotte bottle fig 1a the saline solution was created by mixing 0 90 g l of cacl2 and 0 48 g l of nacl in distilled water approximately ec w 3 ds m sar 16 and ph 7 55 after water appeared at the surface for 24 hrs the soil columns were allowed to dry for 3 days to stabilize the soil formation so that the columns can better mimic field conditions pretreated columns as illustrated in fig 1b after leaching two columns from each of the three test soils were sectioned into 3 cm layers to measure vertical salinity distributions in the columns fig 2 the collected soil samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve then using ec1 5 1 5 soil to water ratio method to extract solution with measured ca mg na al co3 2 hco3 so4 2 ec1 5 was converted to ec1 1 ec sw by the unsatchem model 2 1 3 column leaching experiments three water application methods continuous ponding cp intermittent ponding ip and unsaturated application ua were imposed on the pretreated columns using tap water electrical conductivity ec 0 4 ds m sar 5 and ph 8 2 to leach salts in the soils an individual marriott bottle was used to apply water and control the pressure head for each column for the cp and ip methods the ponding head for the soil columns was maintained at 1 cm fig 1b for the ip water ponding was maintained for about 8 10 hrs in all the columns then it was turned off for approximately 4 8 hrs in the sandy loam 5 8 hrs in the silt loam and 10 30 hrs in the clay soil respectively to collect approximately same amount of drainage water each time after water application was turned off and before it was resumed for next ponding for the ua method a 2 cm layer of fine grained glass beads was used both at the bottom and the top in each of the packed soil columns the air entry value of the glass beads layer is about 10 cm and thus it acts like a porous plate and allows to control water application under negative pressure at the top of the column like a suction permeameter a 0 5 cm diameter and 9 cm long plastic tube closed end with three small holes was attached to the water supply line and buried in the glass beads to ensure water was evenly distributed at the column surface aluminum foil was used to cover the soil columns to prevent water loss from evaporation during the entire experimental period drainage water leachate was collected with a 200 ml flask at an interval of approximately 100 ml and ec of the leachate was measured by an electric conductivity meter accumet research ar50 ph mv ion conductivity meter fisher scientific il 2 2 leaching efficiency simulations in the columns and under field conditions the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate the effects of different application methods of continuous ponding unsaturated application and intermittent ponding methods on leaching efficiencies in the soil columns to mimic the irrigation scheme at the almond orchard field the simulations used the fixed frequency methods every 7 5 and 3 days to evaluate the leaching efficiency in addition the hydrus 2d model was used to simulate the effects of fixed flexible frequency intervals every 7 5 and 3 days vs actual scheduling on leaching efficiency for drip irrigation in the almond orchard under the field conditions 2 2 1 transport equations in the hydrus 2d model the richards equation is numerically solved to simulate water flow šimůnek et al 2016 1 θ t x k h h x z k h h z k h z r h where θ is the volumetric water content cm3 cm 3 as a function of soil matric pressure head h cm h2o k h is the soil

the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 and mualem s 1976 model respectively our preliminary results showed that the original hydrus 1d model did not simulate water and solute transport well in the clay columns thus the dual porosity version of the hydrus 1d was used to simulate water and solute transport in the clay soil columns where soil water may exist both in the mobile θ m moving in inter aggregate and immobile θ im stagnant in intra aggregate regions under such circumstance the soil water content can be expressed as 2 θ θ m θ im the dual porosity formulation for water flow used in the hydrus 1d uses the richards equation to describe water flow in the fractures macropores and a mass balance equation to describe moisture dynamics in the matrix as follows šimůnek et al 2003 3 θ m t z k h h z 1 s m г w 4 θ im t s im г w where s m and s im are the sink terms for the two respective regions and г w is the transfer rate for water from inter to the intra aggregate pores the dual porosity formulation for solute transport in the hydrus 1d is similarly based on the convection dispersion and mass balance equations as follows šimůnek et al 2016 5 θ m c m t f ρ s m t z θ m d m c m

reactions in the two respective regions g cm 3 h 1 and г s is the mass transfer term for the solutes between the mobile and immobile regions g cm 3 h 1 the obtained hydraulic parameters for the van genuchten equation were further used to calculate slope s eq 7 dexter 2004 for each of the soil columns under different water application method 7 s n θ sat θ r 1 1 m 1 m where s is used as a soil physical quality index that indicates the extent to which part of the soil porosity is concentrated into a narrow range of pore size 2 2 2 initial and boundary conditions the initial ec sw distributions in the soil columns are shown in fig 2 the initial soil water condition was expressed as pressure head cm which increased linearly from the top 30 cm to the bottom 0 cm the upper boundary conditions of water flow in the columns receiving continuously ponding cp and unsaturated water applications ua were set to a constant positive pressure cp 5 cm and negative pressure ua 2 cm respectively in the columns receiving intermittent ponding ip the upper boundary condition used variable pressure heads which was entered as a time series in the model input file salt flux for the upper boundary condition was based on the concentration of the infiltrating water 3 ds m the lower boundary condition in the columns was imposed as seepage face on the sandy and silt loams for all the three water application methods while in the clay soil columns a vacuum pressure of 40 cm at the seepage face was applied to facilitate the collection of leachate a zero concentration gradient was used at the lower boundary condition for solute transport in all soil columns for simulations under field conditions the initial matric pressure head was 1500 cm the upper boundary condition was set as variable flux field irrigation scheme and atmosphere boundary conditions for evapotranspiration eto fig 3a the lower boundary condition was free drainage for all the treatments the initial ec sw distribution in the profile was set to the same for the three water application methods as measured in the field fig 3b salinity effect on root distribution and root water uptake was considered in the simulations under the field conditions the maximum rooting depth of almond was set to 122 cm 4 feet and the maximum rooting radius was 152 4 cm 5 feet and the shape parameters of p z and p x were 1 the matric pressure head parameters in the feddes et al 1978 model were h 1 10 cm h 2 25 cm h 3 500 cm and h 4 8000 cm the threshold salinity value was ec e 3 ds m and the slope of almond yield function was 19 the climate and crop information of the almond orchard in kern county ca was based on the cimis station 5 shafter ca near the field as well as field measured data irrigation water was applied by double line drip irrigation in the orchard and the amount of water application was calculated based on eto multiplying the almond crop coefficients ranged from 0 8 to 1 kirr the changes of daily irrigation scheme and eto are showed in fig 3a 2 3 leaching efficiency evaluation the total drained salts can be calculated as follows yang et al 2019 8 t salts d dw tds where t salts is total

dw d iw and d iw and ec iw are depth and ec of irrigation water respectively a lower le indicates that more salts are retained higher salinity in the rootzone 2 4 data analysis three commonly used evaluation criteria the coefficient of determination r 2 the root mean square error rmse and the mean error me of the measured vs calculated values were used to evaluate the accuracy of model

effect of water application methods on salinity leaching in the packed soil columns to assess the salinity leaching efficiency leachate from each of the 27 packed soil columns subjected to different treatments 3 soil textures and 3 water application methods with 3 replications was collected and the ec of the leachate ec dw was measured on average the observed ec dw breakthrough curves with respect to dimensionless time relative pore volumes rpv differed substantially under various water application methods fig 4 with most of salts coming out at approximately 2 rpv for the sandy loam the ec dw came out and reached the plateau earlier 1 rpv and the peak ec dw values were lower 8 ds m with ec iw 1 ds m under ip and ua than that under cp 1rpv ec dw 18 ds m fig 4a in the silt loam the ec dw reached the plateau 22 ds m at 1 rpv earlier under ip than that under cp 1rpv ec dw 20 ds m and ua 1rpv ec dw 8 ds m methods fig 4b however all the three water application methods have very similar breakthrough time 1 rpv and peak value ec dw ec iw 14 ds m in the clay soil fig 4c the above observations indicate that the effect of water application methods on salinity leaching is more profound in coarse soils sandy and silt loam than that in fine soils clay which agrees with the observations by russo et al 2009 for a given irrigation water quality ec iw coarse textured soils have weak capillary force thus the amount of water 2 rpv required to leach out the salts in coarse soils is less than that in fine soils as shown by the ratio of ec dw ec iw besides most of the salts were leached out before 2 2 rpv for all the three test soils fig 5a c in the sandy loam fig 5a almost all salts were removed at 1 2 rpv with 2 42 g and 2 03 g salts respectively removed by cp and ua in their respective columns which were slightly higher than that of ip 1 69 g as rpv increased from 1 to 2 there was little increase in total salt removal among the three methods cp 2 76 g ip 2 08 g and ua 2 44 g like the sandy loam most of the salts were leached out at 2 2 rpv in the silt loam fig 5b as rpv increased from 1 to 2 there was only small increase in salt removal after 3 rpv no more salts were removed under cp 4 79 g and ip 4 92 g but salt leaching continued after 3 rpv under ua 3 38 g indicating that in the silt loam leaching is more efficient under cp and ip than that under ua in the clay soil more salts were leached out under cp 11 12 g and ip 11 4 g than that under ua 7 8 g at the same drainage volume of 2 2 rpv among the three soils more salts were leached out from the clay columns than that from the sandy loam 3 2 5 5 times and the silt loam 2 3 2 75 times columns at 2 2 rpv for all the three water application methods fig 5c nevertheless because the initial salinity in the clay columns was much higher than that in the sandy loam and silt loam columns it requires more water to remove all salts in the clay columns about 5 rpv fig 5c our laboratory results indicate that salt leaching efficiency varies with soil texture as well as water application methods in the packed soil columns cp led to saturated soil steady flow and convective dispersion solute transport in the soil for ip the soils were saturated at the beginning but flow was interrupted for a predetermined period and no convective transport occurred during this period which allowed the soils have more time for salts to diffuse out of the aggregates during leaching the experimental data from the columns suggest that leaching efficiency in coarser soils sandy and silt loam is higher than that in fine soils clay under the three water application methods cp ip and ua 3 2 model estimated hydraulic and solute transport parameters the effects of both soil texture and water application methods on salinity leaching are reflected in the hydraulic parameters table 2 and solute transport and reactive parameters table 3 that were obtained by inverse modeling through simulating the observed cumulative drainage fig 6 and ec dw of the drainage water fig 7 as a function of time under cp ip and ua respectively in the soil columns for the sandy loam and silt loam the parameters were inversely estimated based on the van genuchten hydraulic function eq 1 and the equilibrium solute transport model eq 5 while for the clay soil they were obtained based on the dual porosity mobile immobile water model eqs 2 4 and the physical non equilibrium model eq 6 by considering that a suction was applied at the bottom of the soil columns since the dual porosity model fitted the experimental data better for the clay soil using the estimated hydraulic parameters the hydrus 1d simulated cumulative drainage cm as a function of time matched the experimentally measured data well in the sandy loam for all the three water application methods fig 6a to better fit the experimental data of the cumulative drainage depth vs time for the silt loam and clay soil the measured drainage curves were divided into two pieces first stage and second stage of leaching based on the turning point as shown in fig 6b c the simulated data at the end of the first period were set as the initial conditions for the second period the two piece model fittings matched the experimental data much better than those of the simple linear regression model fittings fig 6d the observed ec dw change with time under cp ip ua fitted by equilibrium sandy loam and silt loam and non equilibrium clay soil models are shown in fig 7 and the data error analysis for the three soils under different treatments are shown in table 4 besides the obtained hydraulic parameters from inverse modeling were applied to calculate parameter s a soil physical quality index that is related to water transmission properties the s index varies with soil structure total porosity and water content rezaei et al 2021 when the s value is greater than 0 050 the soil is considered as very good 0 050 s 0 035 as good 0 035 s 0 020 as poor and s 0 020 as very poor quality dexter 2004 under cp the s values were 0 097 for the sandy loam 0 044 for silt loam and 0 031 for the first stage of leaching and 0 019 for the second stage of leaching in the clay soil respectively in terms of s the quality of the sandy loam is very good the silt loam is good and the clay soil is poor under ip the s values were 0 25 0 046 and 0 042 for the sandy loam silt loam and clay soil respectively the s values of silt loam 0 046 and clay soil 0 042 were very close and they were higher under ip than those under cp which implies that compared with cp water transmission of the three soils was improved under ip under ua the s values were 0 049 for the sandy loam 0 05 and 0 062 for the first and second stage of leaching for the silt loam and 0 042 for the clay soil different from the s values obtained under cp and ip the silt loam had a very high s value under ua indicating the silt loam and clay soil quality in terms of water transmission was improved under ua while the sandy loam quality declined from very good to good quality level under ua the s index change with water application methods indicates that this soil quality index s can be improved through irrigation management based on our data cp and ip were better irrigation methods for the sandy loam very good quality than ua good quality for the silt loam ua performed better very good quality than cp and ip good quality and for the clay soil ip and ua were substantially better good quality than cp very poor quality in other words continuous ponding was the best choice for coarser soils to maintain soil quality at very good level for finer soils intermittent ponding and unsaturated application were better water application methods and unsaturated application was the best for the silt loam 3 3 effect of irrigation frequency on leaching efficiency in the almond orchard salinity leaching efficiency under different irrigation schemes of 7 5 and 3 day intervals versus the actual field irrigation scheme flexible frequency was evaluated for the almond orchard located in kern county ca daily drainage flux water balance salt flux and cumulative drained salts during the growing season and ec sw distribution in the soil profiles at the end of the season for the 4 irrigation schemes are shown in fig 8a d compared with the et based actual field irrigation scheme flexible frequency fig 8a the daily drainage fluxes under fixed frequency irrigation decreased as irrigation frequency increased the simulated peak drainage fluxes and cumulative drainage depths decreased gradually from the 7 to 3 day irrigation interval from lower to higher frequency since shorter irrigation interval provided more opportunity for root water uptake compared with fixed irrigation frequency drainage flux was reduced and cumulative root water uptake and evapotranspiration increased in the flexible frequency irrigation the orchard irrigation scheme thus we conclude that fixed interval high frequency irrigation can help to provide more water for root uptake fig 8b the simulated daily salt flux and cumulative drained salts under flexible frequency irrigation orchard irrigation scheme and fixed frequency irrigation 3 5 and 7 day intervals are shown in fig 8c for the flexible frequency irrigation the first peak of salt leaching out of the rootzone started about 125 days and the second peak started about 225 days after irrigation initiated see cum drained salts after then the salts drainage rate started declining salinity distributions in the soil profiles at the end of the season under different irrigation schemes are shown in fig 8d the salinity in the rootzone 0 152 4 cm decreased from 40 to lower than 5 ds m salinity near the emitter was lower but the cumulative drained salts was less under flexible frequency irrigation than that under fixed frequency irrigation of 7 5 or 3 day interval for fixed frequency irrigation more frequent irrigation with smaller amount of water is preferable in the almond orchard soil which indicates that fixed higher frequency irrigation scheme can reduce the effect of salinity stress on the crop due to lower ec in the rootzone 4 discussion 4 1 dominant factors affecting soil salinity leaching the effect of both soil texture and irrigation water application methods on soil salinity leaching can also be observed from the hydraulic and solute transport parameters salinity leaching is coupled with water movement thus it depends on the darcy velocity which differs among the water application methods of saturated cp semi saturated ip or unsaturated ua condition al sibai et al 1997 hoffman 2009 chu et al 2016 callaghan et al 2017 in the silt loam the model overestimated the cumulative drainage depths after 200 hrs of leaching under ua due to a decrease in drainage rate during the leaching experiment fig 6b there exist large differences between the measured and simulated cumulative drainage depths between cp and ip methods in the clay soil fig 6c the discrepancies between the simulated and observed data under ua in the silt loam and under cp and ip in the clay soil are attributed to the possible clogging and interaction between ions and soil particles in these soil columns which changed the soil structure and permeability and consequently the drainage rate van der zee et al 2014 besides a finer soil has greater specific surface area and porosity and their adsorption capacity is generally greater than that of the coarse soils liu et al 2020 under different irrigation methods the inversely estimated hydraulic and solute transport parameters are different tables 2 and 3 for the same soil which can be attributed to the soil water hysteresis effect structured clay soils benefit mostly from leaching under unsaturated flow conditions tanton et al 1988 armstrong et al 1998 and intermittent water applications tagar et al 2010 hoffman o connor 1980 under saturated conditions fine soils can retain some of the original soil solution during continuous leaching whereas drier soils with intermittent ponding allow a larger fraction of water flowing through the fine pores and displacing the salts more efficiently hoffman o connor 1980 at the same matric pressure a coarse textured soil has low water content and high leaching efficiency under continuous ponding however saturated volumetric water content does not affect leaching efficiency among different soils under intermittent ponding hoffman o connor 1980 phogat et al 2012 observed that intermittent water application pulsing has a smaller impact on leaching fraction and salt removal in light textured soils 4 2 effect of salinity on rootzone water and salt balance the effect of salinity on transpiration is usually attributed to its effect on water flux from a given soil volume to the plant roots carli et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 under surface drip irrigation the salt accumulation in a radial pattern above the wetting zone may reduce the effective soil volume from which water is extracted thus reduce transpiration dudley et al 2008 at the field scale large differences in salinity at the end of season in the soil profiles under various irrigation schemes and plant water uptake are due to disruption of water flux and distribution of water and salinity in the rootzone although the same amount of water is applied the soil moisture and wetting pattern can be different under various irrigation schemes root water uptake rate under flexible frequency irrigation was lower than that under fixed frequency irrigation while for the fixed frequency irrigation water uptake rate was lower under lower frequency irrigation longer interval than that under higher frequency irrigation indicating that high frequency irrigation can improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue and water use efficiency wue of plants wang et al 2006 kassem 2008 kanber et al 1991 reported that the amount of irrigation water decreased when iwue and wue values increased studies have shown that more frequent irrigation with smaller amount of water increases the yield because et is higher when irrigation starts at higher soil water content or matric pressure stansell and smittle 1989 for the fixed frequency irrigation schemes salt leaching appeared at about 75 days after the beginning of irrigation but the leaching rate decreased as irrigation frequency increased as shown by the cumulative drained salts fig 8c salts started to leach out of the rootzone at approximately 100 days after the beginning of irrigation which is much earlier than that 150 days of flexible frequency irrigation and the cumulative drained salts at the end of season was 749 g for the 7 day interval which is less than that of the flexible frequency irrigation 802 g but it increased as the irrigation frequency increased 813 g and 838 g respectively for the 5 and 3 day interval root water extraction affects not only soil water content and salinity but also the movement of water and salts in the rootzone plant water uptake is subjected to osmotic stress effect the soil water salinity ec sw was lower in the upper layer but higher in the lower layer as irrigation frequency decreased longer irrigation intervals fig 8d indicating that less water uptake under lower frequency irrigation tends to push the salinity to lower layers in terms of salinity leaching our results indicate that more frequent application with smaller amount of water every 3 5 days is preferable to that of less frequent with larger amount of water every 7 days as well as to the flexible frequent irrigation due to its higher le table 5 similar results were obtained by kumar et al 2007 and zhou et al 2018 5 conclusions in this study laboratory column study was conducted to evaluate salinity leaching in three soils of different textures under three irrigation methods our results showed that the test soils responded to water application methods differently continuous ponding cp was the best for the coarse soils sandy loam to maintain soil quality at very good level for the fine soil clay intermittent ponding ip and unsaturated application ua were better and ua was the best method for the silt loam using the hydraulic and solute transport parameters estimated by hydrus 1d from the column experiments to calculate the s index we found that proper water application methods can improve water transmission and salinity leaching hydrus 2d simulations based on the estimated hydraulic and solute transport parameters further indicated that irrigation schemes fixed and flexible frequency can affect plant water uptake drainage volume and salinity leaching under the field conditions of the almond orchard in kern county ca salinity leaching efficiency le under flexible frequency irrigation is higher than that of 7 day fixed irrigation interval but lower than those of 3 and 5 day fixed irrigation intervals for the fixed frequency irrigation the cumulative root water uptake as well as the salinity leaching efficiency le increased while the cumulative drainage decreased as the frequency decreased longer interval hence more frequent application with smaller amount of water is recommended to achieve higher leaching efficiency for the almond field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

field practice and fixed frequency irrigation every 7 5 and 3 days under the same field conditions our column results showed that water application methods had greater impact on leaching efficiency le in coarse soil than that in fine soil the soil quality s index also changed with water application methods continuous ponding had higher le for the sandy loam and silt loam unsaturated application was the best for the silt loam while intermittent ponding and unsaturated application were good for both the silt loam and clay model simulations indicated that flexible frequency irrigation resulted in lower salinity in the rootzone than that of fixed frequency irrigation while for the fixed frequency irrigation more frequent application with smaller amount of water was better for the silt loam leaching efficiency under flexible frequency irrigation was 94 2 while for the fixed frequency irrigation the le values were 87 8 95 4 98 0 respectively for 7 5 and 3 d intervals the findings from this research can help farmers improve water use efficiency by considering water application methods and soil conditions keywords leaching efficiency irrigation methods rootzone hydrus 1d 2d agriculture water management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction increasing water use efficiency in irrigated cropland is critical to sustaining water resources and improving agricultural productivity especially in arid and semiarid regions where soils are most affected by salts expansion of irrigated cropland and increased reliance on marginal water sources combining with low leaching efficiency le the ratio of the drained salt mass to the applied salt mass and poor soil internal drainage conditions can often lead to soil salinization kitamura et al 2006 minhas et al 2020 standard guidelines for managing irrigation and salinity are mostly designed with the goal of meeting the leaching requirement lr to maintain rootzone salinity at a level that avoids any reduction in crop growth or yield yang et al 2019 an important aspect for the success of such strategy is the adoption of appropriate irrigation methods for specific soils and climate conditions a range of pressurized irrigation methods sprinkler drip offer alternatives to the traditional surface irrigation furrow basin in terms of efficiency environmental impact health risks and more barnard et al 2010 in general for a water of specific quality and for a given crop the impact of an irrigation method on the rate of salinization will depend on several variables including vertical and spatial distribution of soil properties topography irrigation management cultural practices climatic conditions and regional hydrological conditions oster et al 2012 nassah et al 2018 minhas et al 2020 different irrigation methods such as flood furrow sprinkler or drip can result in different patterns of saturated and unsaturated water flow in the rootzone under continuous ponding cp the soil is always saturated and the flow is steady during an irrigation event while under intermittent ponding ip it consists of two periods a water application period and a rest period during the rest period the soil is saturated at the beginning but flow is interrupted for a predetermined period and no convective transport will occur in this period i e it is assumed that solute transfer is only by radial diffusion from the immobile water region within the spheres to the mobile water region between them rezaei et al 2021 pressurized drip irrigation can be treated as unsaturated application ua barnard et al 2010 callaghan et al 2017 which allows enough time for solute diffusing to the surface of aggregates so that it can subsequently be removed by convective dispersion transport through larger pores and minimize the effects of bypass flow barnard et al 2010 the traditional leaching guidelines usually follow the leaching requirement lr concept that is based on steady state water flow and salt mass balance although true steady state conditions do not exist in the real world irrigated systems steady state may become a reasonable approximation over a sufficiently long period such as a season or more mathematically a steady state flow analysis does not include a time variable and thus there are many factors that can violate the steady state assumption under the field conditions especially in irrigated croplands where alternating wetting and drying conditions are more the rule than exception letey et al 2011 for drip irrigation the use of conventional lr can result in excessive leaching yang et al 2019 this further justifies the reassessment of the traditional one value lr and adopting a more comprehensive approach to determine leaching requirement by considering the relationships among water salinity water application rate soil texture and the amount of leaching letey et al 2011 oster et al 2012 minhas et al 2020 the performances of irrigation methods concerning their efficiency and crop response have been extensively studied but very little is known about the impact of water application methods on leaching efficiency in various textured soils with different hydraulic properties as indicated by hoffman 2009 application rates have effects on soil salinity leaching efficiency and the leaching coefficient is approximately 0 3 for ponding and 0 15 for sprinkler application mathematical models can represent the natural system and objective use of models can guide both our future research efforts and current management practices mirbagheri 2004 while column experiments are useful tools for constructing models and estimating model parameters li et al 2007 the overall objective of this research was to assess irrigation management practices on salinity leaching efficiency in three soils of different textures specifically we aimed to 1 conduct laboratory column experiments to evaluate the effect of water application methods on salinity leaching efficiency in the test soils 2 use inverse modeling of column experiment to estimate water and solute transport parameters and assess the effect of water application methods on soil quality s

irrigation water quantity and quality and irrigation methods 2 material and methods 2 1 laboratory leaching experiments 2 1 1 soil sampling and preparation three surface soils 0 25 cm were collected from three field sites in california a sandy loam coarse loamy mixed superactive calcareous thermic typic xerofluvents was from south coast research extension center south coast rec in irvine ca a silt loam fine loamy mixed superactive thermic durinodic xeric haplargids was from an almond orchard in kern county ca and a clay soil fine smectitic calcareous hyperthermic vertic torrifluvents was from the desert research extension center desert rec in holtville ca respectively the collected bulk soils were air dried gently crumbled to pass through a 2 mm sieve and mixed thoroughly before packing particle size analysis was performed to verify soil texture using a laser particle size analyzer beckman coulter ls 13 320 table 1 2 1 2 soil column setup and pretreatments plex glass cylinders 10 cm dia by 35 cm high were used for packing the soil columns in each column a cellulose sheet was placed at the bottom of the column followed by 1 cm homogeneous grain sized sand 1 mm dia to facilitate free drainage and ensure one dimensional water movement the air dried soil was then packed in 5 cm increments according to the measured field soil bulk density to a total height of 30 cm table 1 the column experimental treatments included 3 soil types and 3 water application methods and each treatment was replicated 3 times resulting in a total of 27 packed soil columns two additional columns of each soil type were also used for measuring initial soil salinity distribution after pretreatment of the columns before leaching each packed soil column was slowly saturated from the bottom with a saline solution applied by a mariotte bottle fig 1a the saline solution was created by mixing 0 90 g l of cacl2 and 0 48 g l of nacl in distilled water approximately ec w 3 ds m sar 16 and ph 7 55 after water appeared at the surface for 24 hrs the soil columns were allowed to dry for 3 days to stabilize the soil formation so that the columns can better mimic field conditions pretreated columns as illustrated in fig 1b after leaching two columns from each of the three test soils were sectioned into 3 cm layers to measure vertical salinity distributions in the columns fig 2 the collected soil samples were air dried and passed through a 2 mm sieve then using ec1 5 1 5 soil to water ratio method to extract solution with measured ca mg na al co3 2 hco3 so4 2 ec1 5 was converted to ec1 1 ec sw by the unsatchem model 2 1 3 column leaching experiments three water application methods continuous ponding cp intermittent ponding ip and unsaturated application ua were imposed on the pretreated columns using tap water electrical conductivity ec 0 4 ds m sar 5 and ph 8 2 to leach salts in the soils an individual marriott bottle was used to apply water and control the pressure head for each column for the cp and ip methods the ponding head for the soil columns was maintained at 1 cm fig 1b for the ip water ponding was maintained for about 8 10 hrs in all the columns then it was turned off for approximately 4 8 hrs in the sandy loam 5 8 hrs in the silt loam and 10 30 hrs in the clay soil respectively to collect approximately same amount of drainage water each time after water application was turned off and before it was resumed for next ponding for the ua method a 2 cm layer of fine grained glass beads was used both at the bottom and the top in each of the packed soil columns the air entry value of the glass beads layer is about 10 cm and thus it acts like a porous plate and allows to control water application under negative pressure at the top of the column like a suction permeameter a 0 5 cm diameter and 9 cm long plastic tube closed end with three small holes was attached to the water supply line and buried in the glass beads to ensure water was evenly distributed at the column surface aluminum foil was used to cover the soil columns to prevent water loss from evaporation during the entire experimental period drainage water leachate was collected with a 200 ml flask at an interval of approximately 100 ml and ec of the leachate was measured by an electric conductivity meter accumet research ar50 ph mv ion conductivity meter fisher scientific il 2 2 leaching efficiency simulations in the columns and under field conditions the hydrus 1d model was used to simulate the effects of different application methods of continuous ponding unsaturated application and intermittent ponding methods on leaching efficiencies in the soil columns to mimic the irrigation scheme at the almond orchard field the simulations used the fixed frequency methods every 7 5 and 3 days to evaluate the leaching efficiency in addition the hydrus 2d model was used to simulate the effects of fixed flexible frequency intervals every 7 5 and 3 days vs actual scheduling on leaching efficiency for drip irrigation in the almond orchard under the field conditions 2 2 1 transport equations in the hydrus 2d model the richards equation is numerically solved to

the van genuchten model van genuchten 1980 and mualem s 1976 model respectively our preliminary results showed that the original hydrus 1d model did not simulate water and solute transport well in the clay columns thus the dual porosity version of the hydrus 1d was used to simulate water and solute transport in the clay soil columns where soil water may exist both in the mobile θ m moving in inter aggregate and immobile θ im stagnant in intra aggregate regions under such circumstance the soil water content can be expressed as 2 θ θ m θ im the dual porosity formulation for water flow used in the hydrus 1d uses the richards equation to describe water flow in the fractures macropores and a mass balance equation to describe moisture dynamics in the matrix as follows šimůnek et al 2003 3 θ m t z k h h z 1 s m г w 4 θ im t s im г w where s m and s im are the sink terms for the two respective regions and г w is the transfer rate for water from inter to the intra aggregate pores the dual

physical quality index that indicates the extent to which part of the soil porosity is concentrated into a narrow range of pore size 2 2 2 initial and boundary conditions the initial ec sw distributions in the soil columns are shown in fig 2 the initial soil water condition was expressed as pressure head cm which increased linearly from the top 30 cm to the bottom 0 cm the upper boundary conditions of water flow in the columns receiving continuously ponding cp and unsaturated water applications ua were set to a constant positive pressure cp 5 cm and negative pressure ua 2 cm respectively in the columns receiving intermittent ponding ip the upper boundary condition used variable pressure heads which was entered as a time series in the model input file salt flux for the upper boundary condition was based on the concentration of the infiltrating water 3 ds m the lower boundary condition in the columns was imposed as seepage face on the sandy and silt loams for all the three water application methods while in the clay soil columns a vacuum pressure of 40 cm at the seepage face was applied to facilitate the collection of leachate a zero concentration gradient was used at the lower boundary condition for solute transport in all soil columns for simulations under field conditions the initial matric pressure head was 1500 cm the upper boundary condition was set as variable flux field irrigation scheme and atmosphere boundary conditions for evapotranspiration eto fig 3a the lower boundary condition was free drainage for all the treatments the initial ec sw distribution in the profile was set to the same for the three water application methods as measured in the field fig 3b salinity effect on root distribution and root water uptake was considered in the simulations under the field conditions the maximum rooting depth of almond was set to 122 cm 4 feet and the maximum rooting radius was 152 4 cm 5 feet and the shape parameters of p z and p x were 1 the matric pressure head parameters in the feddes et al 1978 model were h 1 10 cm h 2 25 cm h 3 500 cm and h 4 8000 cm the threshold salinity value was ec e 3 ds m and the slope of almond yield function was 19 the climate and crop information of the almond orchard in kern county ca was based on the cimis station 5 shafter ca near the field as well as field measured data irrigation water was applied by double line drip irrigation in the orchard and the amount of water application was calculated based on eto multiplying the almond crop coefficients ranged from 0 8 to 1 kirr the changes of daily irrigation scheme and eto are showed in fig 3a 2 3 leaching efficiency evaluation the total drained salts can be calculated as follows yang et al 2019 8 t salts d dw tds where t salts is total

effect of water application methods on salinity leaching in the packed soil columns to assess the salinity leaching efficiency leachate from each of the 27 packed soil columns subjected to different treatments 3 soil textures and 3 water application methods with 3 replications was collected and the ec of the leachate ec dw was measured on average the observed ec dw breakthrough curves with respect to dimensionless time relative pore volumes rpv differed substantially under various water application methods fig 4 with most of salts coming out at approximately 2 rpv for the sandy loam the ec dw came out and reached the plateau earlier 1 rpv and the peak ec dw values were lower 8 ds m with ec iw 1 ds m under ip and ua than that under cp 1rpv ec dw 18 ds m fig 4a in the silt loam the ec dw reached the plateau 22 ds m at 1 rpv earlier under ip than that under cp 1rpv ec dw 20 ds m and ua 1rpv ec dw 8 ds m methods fig 4b however all the three water application methods have very similar breakthrough time 1 rpv and peak value ec dw ec iw 14 ds m in the clay soil fig 4c the above observations indicate that the effect of water application methods on salinity leaching is more profound in coarse soils sandy and silt loam than that in fine soils clay which agrees with the observations by russo et al 2009 for a given irrigation water quality ec iw coarse textured soils have weak capillary force thus the amount of water 2 rpv required to leach out the salts in coarse soils is less than that in fine soils as shown by the ratio of ec dw ec iw besides most of the salts were leached out before 2 2 rpv for all the three test soils fig 5a c in the sandy loam fig 5a almost all salts were removed at 1 2 rpv with 2 42 g and 2 03 g salts respectively removed by cp and ua in their respective columns which were slightly higher than that of ip 1 69 g as rpv increased from 1 to 2 there was little increase in total salt removal among the three methods cp 2 76 g ip 2 08 g and ua 2 44 g like the sandy loam most of the salts were leached out at 2 2 rpv in the silt loam fig 5b as rpv increased from 1 to 2 there was only small increase in salt removal after 3 rpv no more salts were removed under cp 4 79 g and ip 4 92 g but salt leaching continued after 3 rpv under ua 3 38 g indicating that in the silt loam leaching is more efficient under cp and ip than that under ua in the clay soil more salts were leached out under cp 11 12 g and ip 11 4 g than that under ua 7 8 g at the same drainage volume of 2 2 rpv among the three soils more salts were leached out from the clay columns than that from the sandy loam 3 2 5 5 times and the silt loam 2 3 2 75 times columns at 2 2 rpv for all the three water application methods fig 5c nevertheless because the initial salinity in the clay columns was much higher than that in the sandy loam and silt loam columns it requires more water to remove all salts in the clay columns about 5 rpv fig 5c our laboratory results indicate that salt leaching efficiency varies with soil texture as well as water application methods in the packed soil columns cp led to saturated soil steady flow and convective dispersion solute transport in the soil for ip the soils were saturated at the beginning but flow was interrupted for a predetermined period and no convective transport occurred during this period which allowed the soils have more time for salts to diffuse out of the aggregates during leaching the experimental data from the columns suggest that leaching efficiency in coarser soils sandy and silt loam is higher than that in fine soils clay under the three water application methods cp ip and ua 3 2 model estimated hydraulic and solute transport parameters the effects of both soil texture and water application methods on salinity leaching are reflected in the hydraulic parameters table 2 and solute transport and reactive parameters table 3 that were obtained by inverse modeling through simulating the observed cumulative drainage fig 6 and ec dw of the drainage water fig 7 as a function of time under cp ip and ua respectively in the soil columns for the sandy loam and silt loam the parameters were inversely estimated based on the van genuchten hydraulic function eq 1 and the equilibrium solute transport model eq 5 while for the clay soil they were obtained based on the dual porosity mobile immobile water model eqs 2 4 and the physical non equilibrium model eq 6 by considering that a suction was applied at the bottom of the soil columns since the dual porosity model fitted the experimental data better for the clay soil using the estimated hydraulic parameters the hydrus 1d simulated cumulative drainage cm as a function of time matched the experimentally measured data well in the sandy loam for all the three water application methods fig 6a to better fit the experimental data of the cumulative drainage depth vs time for the silt loam and clay soil the measured drainage curves were divided into two pieces first stage and second stage of leaching based on the turning point as shown in fig 6b c the simulated data at the end of the first period were set as the initial conditions for the second period the two piece model fittings matched the experimental data much better than those of the simple linear regression model fittings fig 6d the observed ec dw change with time under cp ip ua fitted by equilibrium sandy loam and silt loam and non equilibrium clay soil models are shown in fig 7 and the data error analysis for the three soils under different treatments are shown in table 4 besides the obtained hydraulic parameters from inverse modeling were applied to calculate parameter s a soil physical quality index that is related to water transmission properties the s index varies with soil structure total porosity and water content rezaei et al 2021 when the s value is greater than 0 050 the soil is considered as very good 0 050 s 0 035 as good 0 035 s 0 020 as poor and s 0 020 as very poor quality dexter 2004 under cp the s values were 0 097 for the sandy loam 0 044 for silt loam and 0 031 for the first stage of leaching and 0 019 for the second stage of leaching in the clay soil respectively in terms of s the quality of the sandy loam is very good the silt loam is good and the clay soil is poor under ip the s values were 0 25 0 046 and 0 042 for the sandy loam silt loam and clay soil respectively the s values of silt loam 0 046 and clay soil 0 042 were very close and they were higher under ip than those under cp which implies that compared with cp water transmission of the three soils was improved under ip under ua the s values were 0 049 for the sandy loam 0 05 and 0 062 for the first and second stage of leaching for the silt loam and 0 042 for the clay soil different from the s values obtained under cp and ip the silt loam had a very high s value under ua indicating the silt loam and clay soil quality in terms of water transmission was improved under ua while the sandy loam quality declined from very good to good quality level under ua the s index change with water application methods indicates that this soil quality index s can be improved through irrigation management based on our data cp and ip were better irrigation methods for the sandy loam very good quality than ua good quality for the silt loam ua performed better very good quality than cp and ip good quality and for the clay soil ip and ua were substantially better good quality than cp very poor quality in other words continuous ponding was the best choice for coarser soils to maintain soil quality at very good level for finer soils intermittent ponding and unsaturated application were better water application methods and unsaturated application was the best for the silt loam 3 3 effect of irrigation frequency on leaching efficiency in the almond orchard salinity leaching efficiency under different irrigation schemes of 7 5 and 3 day intervals versus the actual field irrigation scheme flexible frequency was evaluated for the almond orchard located in kern county ca daily drainage flux water balance salt flux and cumulative drained salts during the growing season and ec sw distribution in the soil profiles at the end of the season for the 4 irrigation schemes are shown in fig 8a d compared with the et based actual field irrigation scheme flexible frequency fig 8a the daily drainage fluxes under fixed frequency irrigation decreased as irrigation frequency increased the simulated peak drainage fluxes and cumulative drainage depths decreased gradually from the 7 to 3 day irrigation interval from lower to higher frequency since shorter irrigation interval provided more opportunity for root water uptake compared with fixed irrigation frequency drainage flux was reduced and cumulative root water uptake and evapotranspiration increased in the flexible frequency irrigation the orchard irrigation scheme thus we conclude that fixed interval high frequency irrigation can help to provide more water for root uptake fig 8b the simulated daily salt flux and cumulative drained salts under flexible frequency irrigation orchard irrigation scheme and fixed frequency irrigation 3 5 and 7 day intervals are shown in fig 8c for the flexible frequency irrigation the first peak of salt leaching out of the rootzone started about 125 days and the second peak started about 225 days after irrigation initiated see cum drained salts after then the salts drainage rate started declining salinity distributions in the soil profiles at the end of the season under different irrigation schemes are shown in fig 8d the salinity in the rootzone 0 152 4 cm decreased from 40 to lower than 5 ds m salinity near the emitter was lower but the cumulative drained salts was less under flexible frequency irrigation than that under fixed frequency irrigation of 7 5 or 3 day interval for fixed frequency irrigation more frequent irrigation with smaller amount of water is preferable in the almond orchard soil which indicates that fixed higher frequency irrigation scheme can reduce the effect of salinity stress on the crop due to lower ec in the rootzone 4 discussion 4 1 dominant factors affecting soil salinity leaching the effect of both soil texture and irrigation water application methods on soil salinity leaching can also be observed from the hydraulic and solute transport parameters salinity leaching is coupled with water movement thus it depends on the darcy velocity which differs among the water application methods of saturated cp semi saturated ip or unsaturated ua condition al sibai et al 1997 hoffman 2009 chu et al 2016 callaghan et al 2017 in the silt loam the model overestimated the cumulative drainage depths after 200 hrs of leaching under ua due to a decrease in drainage rate during the leaching experiment fig 6b there exist large differences between the measured and simulated cumulative drainage depths between cp and ip methods in the clay soil fig 6c the discrepancies between the simulated and observed data under ua in the silt loam and under cp and ip in the clay soil are attributed to the possible clogging and interaction between ions and soil particles in these soil columns which changed the soil structure and permeability and consequently the drainage rate van der zee et al 2014 besides a finer soil has greater specific surface area and porosity and their adsorption capacity is generally greater than that of the coarse soils liu et al 2020 under different irrigation methods the inversely estimated hydraulic and solute transport parameters are different tables 2 and 3 for the same soil which can be attributed to the soil water hysteresis effect structured clay soils benefit mostly from leaching under unsaturated flow conditions tanton et al 1988 armstrong et al 1998 and intermittent water applications tagar et al 2010 hoffman o connor 1980 under saturated conditions fine soils can retain some of the original soil solution during continuous leaching whereas drier soils with intermittent ponding allow a larger fraction of water flowing through the fine pores and displacing the salts more efficiently hoffman o connor 1980 at the same matric pressure a coarse textured soil has low water content and high leaching efficiency under continuous ponding however saturated volumetric water content does not affect leaching efficiency among different soils under intermittent ponding hoffman o connor 1980 phogat et al 2012 observed that intermittent water application pulsing has a smaller impact on leaching fraction and salt removal in light textured soils 4 2 effect of salinity on rootzone water and salt balance the effect of salinity on transpiration is usually attributed to its effect on water flux from a given soil volume to the plant roots carli et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 under surface drip irrigation the salt accumulation in a radial pattern above the wetting zone may reduce the effective soil volume from which water is extracted thus reduce transpiration dudley et al 2008 at the field scale large differences in salinity at the end of season in the soil profiles under various irrigation schemes and plant water uptake are due to disruption of water flux and distribution of water and salinity in the rootzone although the same amount of water is applied the soil moisture and wetting pattern can be different under various irrigation schemes root water uptake rate under flexible frequency irrigation was lower than that under fixed frequency irrigation while for the fixed frequency irrigation water uptake rate was lower under lower frequency irrigation longer interval than that under higher frequency irrigation indicating that high frequency irrigation can improve irrigation water use efficiency iwue and water use efficiency wue of plants wang et al 2006 kassem 2008 kanber et al 1991 reported that the amount of irrigation water decreased when iwue and wue values increased studies have shown that more frequent irrigation with smaller amount of water increases the yield because et is higher when irrigation starts at higher soil water content or matric pressure stansell and smittle 1989 for the fixed frequency irrigation schemes salt leaching appeared at about 75 days after the beginning of irrigation but the leaching rate decreased as irrigation frequency increased as shown by the cumulative drained salts fig 8c salts started to leach out of the rootzone at approximately 100 days after the beginning of irrigation which is much earlier than that 150 days of flexible frequency irrigation and the cumulative drained salts at the end of season was 749 g for the 7 day interval which is less than that of the flexible frequency irrigation 802 g but it increased as the irrigation frequency increased 813 g and 838 g respectively for the 5 and 3 day interval root water extraction affects not only soil water content and salinity but also the movement of water and salts in the rootzone plant water uptake is subjected to osmotic stress effect the soil water salinity ec sw was lower in the upper layer but higher in the lower layer as irrigation frequency decreased longer irrigation intervals fig 8d indicating that less water uptake under lower frequency irrigation tends to push the salinity to lower layers in terms of salinity leaching our results indicate that more frequent application with smaller amount of water every 3 5 days is preferable to that of less frequent with larger amount of water every 7 days as well as to the flexible frequent irrigation due to its higher le table 5 similar results were obtained by kumar et al 2007 and zhou et al 2018 5 conclusions in this study laboratory column study was conducted to evaluate salinity leaching in three soils of different textures under three irrigation methods our results showed that the test soils responded to water application methods differently continuous ponding cp was the best for the coarse soils sandy loam to maintain soil quality at very good level for the fine soil clay intermittent ponding ip and unsaturated application ua were better and ua was the best method for the silt loam using the hydraulic and solute transport parameters estimated by hydrus 1d from the column experiments to calculate the s index we found that proper water application methods can improve water transmission and salinity leaching hydrus 2d simulations based on the estimated hydraulic and solute transport parameters further indicated that irrigation schemes fixed and flexible frequency can affect plant water uptake drainage volume and salinity leaching under the field conditions of the almond orchard in kern county ca salinity leaching efficiency le under flexible frequency irrigation is higher than that of 7 day fixed irrigation interval but lower than those of 3 and 5 day fixed irrigation intervals for the fixed frequency irrigation the cumulative root water uptake as well as the salinity leaching efficiency le increased while the cumulative drainage decreased as the frequency decreased longer interval hence more frequent application with smaller amount of water is recommended to achieve higher leaching efficiency for the almond field declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial
