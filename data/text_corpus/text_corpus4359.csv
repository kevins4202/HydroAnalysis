21795,in this study a series of model tests was conducted to investigate the characteristics of wave impact loads and the associated air bubble effects on a vertical circular cylinder with various pressure and force sensors installed in a 2d wave flume spilling and plunging waves generated by the focusing wave method induced wave impact loads on the cylinder and these loads were measured by the sensors which had different natural frequencies and sensing areas each test condition was repeated 20 times to verify the repeatability of the impact loads and their effects the air bubble effects were investigated by analyzing the time histories of the impact forces and pressures and the effects were related to the natural frequency and sensing area of the sensors the air bubble effects were observed to increase as the breaking wave developed more at the position of the cylinder the generated waves and impact loads were also observed to change significantly when even a small noise occurred in the displacement of the wavemaker keywords wave impact breaking wave air bubble model test vertical cylinder 1 introduction ocean waves are regarded as dangerous external loads that threaten the safety of ships and offshore platforms the impact loads of breaking waves can cause local damage to these structures and must therefore be accurately predicted in the design stage to ensure structural safety in the sea the most significant water impacts are due to waves and the wave impact from a breaking wave is relatively higher than that of a non breaking wave at the same wave height kjeldsen et al 1986 basco and niedzwecki 1989 hong and shin 2007 breaking waves have a curled shape around air and the impact load on a structure is quite sensitive to slight changes in both the height and shape of the incoming wave zhou et al 1991 chan et al 1995 in the laboratory the measured impact load also occurred oscillations caused by air bubbles zhou et al 1991 various phenomena can be observed from the results of a water impact test for instance the water impact pattern generally shows a high peak load rapid rising time and slow decay time in addition mechanical vibration can be observed in the measured water impact pattern because of the characteristics of the measurement sensors and in breaking wave tests relatively high peak loads and large oscillations due to air bubbles can be observed in the measured water impact patterns using force sensors as load cells huang et al 2017 performed wave impact experiments on a gbs gravity based structure model in irregular waves from the results of these tests they identified three types of wave impact forces a general impact force time series an impact force time series with air bubble effects and an impact force time series with mechanical vibration effects where the relationship between the natural frequency of a sensor and its sampling rate should be well set up in order to capture the mechanical vibration in the past wave loads such as the slamming phenomenon have been obtained from analytical solutions by von karman 1929 wagner 1932 and goda et al 1966 however these methods can be applied only to simple structures arntsen et al 2011 performed a model tests for the wave impact force on a vertical cylinder in a breaking waves and the experimental results were directly compared with analytical method the results were good agreement with the analytical solutions so it can be found that the analytical solutions give a reasonable data sometimes slamming coefficients for the analytical solutions can be modified from an experimental data jose and choi 2017 carried out a study to modify the slamming coefficients they were performed a series of model tests and numerical simualtions for a jacket platform in breaking waves from the results of their study the maximum slamming coefficients for bracing members and vertical members were suggested in recent times computational fluid dynamics cfd has been widely used to estimate water impact loads mo et al 2013 and ha et al 2019 estimated the slamming impact loads of breaking waves on cylinders and showed the abnormal flow patterns and interactions between the breaking waves and the model cylinder bredmose and jacobsen 2010 performed numerical simulations using openfoam to estimate the slamming impact forces on a fixed monopole and they also considered the breaking locations with movement of the model their results showed the relationship between the breaking patterns and model locations in terms of the wave impact forces alagan chella et al 2019 studied wave impact conditions and wave breaking types on maximum wave impact pressure and kinematics using openfoam by level set method lsm they performed the numerical simulations for wave impact on a vertical cylinder in a spilling wave and plunging wave and the numerical simulation results were directlry compared with experimental results by arntsen et al 2011 they showed that maximum impact pressure could be different by each wave conditions and the breaking locations of incoming waves kamath et al 2016 studied the flow pattern and interactions between a breaking wave and a slender cylinder using large eddy simulations les that agreed well with previous experimental results however although cfd methods yield reasonable values these methods often require many dependency tests to determine the appropriate mesh and scheme that will obtain accurate impact loads these methods also require large grid numbers to capture air bubble effects with the mesh adjusted depending on the size of the air bubble in order to evaluate water impact loads with air bubbles many researchers have performed experiments in a wave tank bagnold 1939 performed experiments in a wave basin and showed a large impact force due to the air bubbles hattori et al 1994 bullock et al 2001 and peregrine 2003 studied wave impact pressures with air bubble effects on walls in model tests these experimental results also showed a large impact force due to the trapped air and showed oscillations in the measured pressure with rapid pressure increases however further studies on impact forces that include air bubbles are necessary to predict structural damage in a model test capturing the oscillation of the air bubble is difficult because the oscillation frequency of the air bubble is quite high in addition the measured signal in the model test can be different depending on the pressure and force sensors kim et al 2015 performed sloshing experiments using four pressure sensor types piezoresistive pr piezoelectric pe integrated electronics piezoelectric iepe icp their results showed different sensitivies to the impact pressures in each sensor kim et al 2017 conducted wedge drop tests to investigate the characteristics of pressure sensors they used seven pressure sensors that included piezoresistive piezoelectric and iepe types with different natural frequencies and the results of the experiments showed different rising and decay times and impulses for accurate estimation of impact loads many experiments need to be conducted to select a proper sensor therefore in this study a series of the model tests was conducted to measure the wave impact load on a cylinder under breaking waves spilling and plunging waves were generated and the impact force was measured by various pressure and force sensors to demonstrate repeatability the model tests were repeated 20 times for each wave condition from the measured data wave impact patterns and air bubble effects were investigated including the relationship between the oscillation frequency of the air bubble and the natural frequency of the sensor the repeated experiments also demonstrated the possibility of wavemaker malfunction over time and this observation is also discussed herein 2 experimental setup 2 1 model in this study a series of model tests was conducted to observe the characteristics of wave impact loads on a truncated cylinder the model tests were performed in a 2d wave flume at the korea research institute of ships and ocean engineering kriso the dimensions of the wave flume were 28 962 m 0 6 m x 0 5 m length x breadth x depth and the flume had a flap type wavemaker fig 1 shows the cylinder model and its location in the wave flume the diameter and draft of the cylinder model were 0 25 m and 0 3 m respectively the model was located 17 8 m 0 cm location from the wavemaker as shown in fig 1 the wave flows were captured by a high speed camera at 5000 frames per second 2 2 sensor configuration in the model tests a strain gauge force sensor and a piezoelectric pressure sensor were applied to measure the impact loads the characteristics of the sensors are summarized in table 1 the natural frequencies of the force sensor and pressure sensor were more than 2 and 70 khz respectively in table 1 the natural frequency of the sensors by the hammering tests were measured only in the conditions exposed to the air fig 2 shows the configurations of the sensors force panels with areas of 3 cm 3 cm and thicknesses of 5 cm were installed on all six force sensors kistler 4576a the surfaces of the force panels followed the curvature of the cylinderical model the distance between the centers of the force panels was 6 cm five pressure sensors kistler 701a which have flat sensing surfaces were attached as shown in fig 2 the sensing diameter of each pressure sensor was 9 5 mm and the distance between the centers of the pressure sensors was 3 cm the force and pressure sensors were installed at the front and rear of the cylinder respectively in the model tests the force and pressure were measured by rotating the cylinder forward and backward the wave impact forces and pressures were measured with 30 khz and 60 khz sampling rates respectively 2 3 test conditions in the model tests breaking waves were generated by using the focusing wave method davis and zarnick 1964 the target wave frequency and maximum amplitude were 3 93 rad s and 16 cm respectively to generate superposition of the wave components 25 wave components were applied within the range from 3 14 to 6 28 rad s see fig 3 spilling and plunging waves were generated by adjusting the strokes of the wavemaker fig 4 shows the wave shapes and elevations to check for repeatability five repetitions of each wave condition were performed in the case of the spilling wave the wave was slightly broken and the air and water were mixed as shown in fig 4 a although the wave breaking occurs the wave elevations from the repetitive tests showed good agreement as shown in fig 4 b the plunging wave had a curled shape and the breaking wave was passed with the air the wave elevations for this case also showed good agreement in the repetitive tests the fronts and backs of both the spilling and plunging waves were asymmetrical and therefore in the model tests the model location was slightly changed to investigate the sensitivity of the breaking wave impact to location from 2 cm closer to the wavemaker to 2 cm closer to the wave absorber to check for repeatability all of the model tests were repeated 20 times the test conditions are summarized in table 2 this report of the experimental results focuses on the measured data at the 0 16 m location where the highest wave impact forces were measured 3 experimental results 3 1 slamming impact force characteristics 3 1 1 wave impact force with a spilling wave fig 5 shows images of the wave shapes near the model during the spilling wave tests the incoming wave was slightly broken before the wave hit the model the breaking wave then mixed with the air and the water strongly impacted the model fig 6 shows the impact moment for the different model locations no clear change in the wave shapes at the impact were observed although the wave impact forces varied in accordance with the model locations as shown in fig 7 perhaps because of the effect of mixed air and water the time histories of the wave impact forces according to the model location are shown in fig 7 all of the measured wave impact forces for each model location showed good repeatability large impact forces occurred at the model locations of 2 cm and 0 cm and the impact forces were relatively small at the model location of 2 cm as shown in fig 8 very little wave runup occurred in the 2 cm and 0 cm conditions whereas significant runup occurred in the 2 cm condition and this runup was considered to dampen the impact load in this case fig 9 shows the relations between the rising decay times and the peak forces under the spilling wave it can be seen that the short rising and decay times occur with increasing the peak forces in this study the correlation coefficients from the relations between the rising decay times and the peak forces were evaluated using eq 1 1 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the correlation coefficient between the rising times and the peak forces is 0 65 and the correlation coefficient between the decay times and the peak forces is 0 77 therefore the peak force has relatively high correlation with the rising and decay times in the case of the spilling wave condition 3 1 2 wave impact force with a plunging wave fig 10 shows images from shortly before the impact according to the model location in the images the white lines show the wave shapes near the model the wave shapes changed slightly with the different model locations at 2 cm the breaking wave was facing up before the wave impact whereas at 0 and 2 cm the breaking wave was curling down before the wave impact a 2 cm closer to wavemaker b 0 cm 17 8 m from wavemaker c 2 cm closer to wave absorber fig 11 shows the time histories of the wave impact forces according to the model location one high impact occurred with the model at the 2 cm location whereas a small impact and then the high impact occurred with the model at the 0 and 2 cm locations in more detail fig 12 shows representative shapes of the wave impact for the 0 cm condition in the case of ① the one peak occurred in the wave impact force because the wave hit the model as the wave was still rising see fig 10 a in the case of ② of two spiky peaks occurrd in the wave impact forces because of the development of the breaking wave see fig 10 b in the case of ③ a blunt peak occurred in the wave impact force pattern because the impact occurred after the breaking wave had fully developed as shown in fig 10 c these phenomena are consistent with those reported by wienke et al 2000 as shown in fig 12 small vibrations appearred before and after the peak impact these vibrations were caused by the natural frequency of the force sensor as was also reported by huang et al 2017 fig 13 shows the relations between the rising decay times and the peak forces under the plunging wave it can be seen that the short rising and decay times occur with increasing the peak forces and the trends are similar to that under spilling wave condition the correlation coefficient between the rising times and the peak forces is 0 66 and the correlation coefficient between the decay times and the peak forces is 0 84 it can be found that the wave impact forces have the high correlation with the rising and decay times as shown in figs 9 and 13 3 2 slamming impact pressure characteristics 3 2 1 wave impact pressure with a spilling wave fig 14 shows the time histories of the wave impact pressures according to the model location the peak pressures were quite similar with the model at the 2 cm location showing good repeatability in the measured pressure however the peak pressures and pressure patterns varied significantly with the models at the 0 and 2 cm locations the large variability was caused by the further mixing of air and waves as the breaking wave developed fig 15 shows representative time histories of the wave impact force and pressure as shown in fig 15 a vibrations with a frequency of 2 5 khz occurred in the time history of the wave impact force the natural frequency of the force sensor with the force panel is approximately 2 5 khz as evaluated in a hammering test and therefore the vibrations were considered to be induced by the natural frequency of the force sensor as shown in fig 15 b oscillations with frequencies in the range from 3 2 to 4 4 khz occurred in the pressure signal these were not attributed to the pressure sensor s natural frequency which was 70 khz fig 16 a shows the result of applying a fast fourier transform to the pressure signal which shows a large physical quantity near 3 7 khz if these vibrations were caused by air bubbles the diameter of the air bubble can be estimated using eq 2 here r 0 is the bubble diameter ρ 0 is the water density p 0 is the peak pressure f is the oscillation frequency and γ is the polytrophic coefficient of the water in this study the polytrophic coefficient applied was 1 4 considering the standard temperature fig 16 b shows the bubble diameter estimated from the measured data and eq 2 the bubble diameter was estimated to be between 0 26 and 0 40 mm although the vibrations caused by air bubbles having such a small diameter can be measured by a sensitive pressure sensor they are difficult to measure in a force sensor which has a low natural frequency fig 17 shows the relations between the rising decay times and the peak pressures under the spilling wave the correlation coefficient between the rising times and the peak pressures is 0 56 and the correlation coefficient between the decay times and the peak pressures is 0 65 in the case of the spilling wave condition it can be found that the peak pressures have the relatively high correlation with the rising and decay times even if air bubble effects occur 3 2 2 wave impact pressure with a plunging wave fig 18 shows the time histories of the wave impact pressures according to the model location as with the spilling wave condition the pressures on the models at the 0 and 2 cm locations show significant variability compared with the 2 cm location the peak pressure with the model at the 2 cm location was approximately 20 times higher than that at the 2 cm location fig 19 shows air bubbles generated with the models at the 2 and 2m locations at 2 cm the air bubbles were frequently trapped near the sensing part of the pressure sensor which generated extreme impact pressures and vibrating signals in this study the shapes of the pressure data acquired through repeated experiments were classified into three types according to the effect of air bubbles as shown in fig 20 i strong ii weak and iii very weak effects in the case of the strong effect a large peak pressure occurred followed by positive and negative oscillations in the case of the weak effect a large peak pressure was followed by positive oscillations only in the case of the very weak effect the peak pressure was not so large and the oscillations were not significant compared with the strong and weak effects as mentioned above the effect of the air bubble cannot be captured by the force sensor perhaps because of the difference in sensing areas in addition to the sensor s low natural frequency fig 21 shows an image taken at the moment of impact at the model location of 2 cm the image shows the force sensors as well as an air bubble trapped near the sensing part of the force panel however oscillations due to air bubbles were not measured by the force sensors as shown in fig 11 as the air bubble size is very small it is difficult to distinct the air bubble size in figs 19 and 21 it is necessary to capture the air bubble size using a camera having a very high resolution to investigate whether the force sensor could not measure the air bubble effects because of its large sensing area or low natural frequency additional model tests were conducted using sensors with various sensing areas and natural frequencies fig 22 shows the relations between the rising decay times and the peak pressures under the plunging wave in the case of the plunging wave condition the pressures with the air bubbles have the very short rising and decay times while the pressures without the air bubbles have the relatively long rising and decay times it means that the strong wave impact instantaneously occurs on the model due to the air bubble the correlation coefficients between the rising times and the peak pressures according to the effect of air bubbles as follow without air bubble 0 81 with air bubble 0 75 also the correlation coefficients between the decay times and the peak pressures according to the effect of air bubbles as follow without air bubble 0 83 with air bubble 0 79 tables 3 and 4 summarized the characteristics of the wave impact loads it can be observed that the characteristics of the wave impact loads are varied by the model locations and the effect of air bubbles 3 2 3 sensing area and natural frequency in order to investigate the effects of air bubbles on the oscillation of the pressure additional model tests were conducted the model made to the bottom mouted model in order to tightly fix in 2d wave flume as shown in fig 23 in that case the incoming waves could be trapped in front of the model so the model diameter was reduced to be 0 2m which was relatively smaller than the diameter of the truncated cylinder model the model was bottom mounted in the wave flume at 17 82 m from the wavemaker the 2 cm location closer to wave absorber plunging waves were applied to the model and five different sensors were used as summarized in table 5 in the previous experiments the sensing area of the force sensor was 3 cm 3 cm in this experiment the sensing area of the force sensor was changed to a round shape with a diameter of 1 cm similar to the pressure sensor in the previous experiments the surface of the force panel followed the curvature of the cylinder s surface in this experiment the surface was changed to be flat similar to the pressure sensor the arrangement of the pressure and force sensors is shown in fig 24 the distance between the centers of the sensing part of the force sensors kistler 4576a was 6 cm and the distance between the centers of the other sensors was 3 cm in this model test adapters for the five different sensors shown in fig 23 were changed as necessary for each experiment fig 25 shows images of the wave shapes near the model the air bubbles were trapped in front of the cylinder as in the previous model tests fig 26 shows representative time histories of the wave impact pressures acquired by the piezoelectric pressure sensor kistler 701a as shown in fig 26 the oscillation frequencies were relatively lower than the previous experimental results the cylinder diameter was also different from the previous experiment and therefore the effect of the air bubbles was different because the generated wave patterns were different nonetheless in the case of the strong air bubble effect a relatively high oscillation frequency occurred compared to the weak air bubble effect showing a similar trend to the previous model tests the oscillation frequencies of the air bubble were noticeably lower than the sensor s natural frequency figs 27 29 show representative time histories of the wave impact pressures acquired by the piezoelectric pressure sensor kistler 601ca the integrated electronics piezoelectric pressure sensor kistler 601cba and the piezoelectric force sensor kistler 9301b respectively the oscillation frequencies induced by the air bubbles were similar to the results acquired by the piezoelectric sensor shown in fig 26 as in that case the oscillation frequencies were much lower than the sensors natural frequencies although the air bubble effects could not be captured by the strain gauge force sensor kistler 4576a in the previous model tests the weak air bubble effect was captured by the same force sensor in this model test in this model test the oscillation frequency of the air bubble was relatively lower than the natural frequency of the force sensor and the sensing area of the force sensor was small and flat compared to the previous model test as shown in figs 26 c fig 27 c fig 28 c figs 29 c and fig 30 b the patterns of the impact pressures were different from each other because of the different sensitivities of the various sensor types piezoelectric and integrated electronics piezoelectric sensor types are known to have fast response times kim et al 2015 2017 and many studies of sensor characteristics should be performed because these characteristics can change in response to different test conditions table 6 summarized the characteristics of the wave impact pressures according to the effect of air bubbles it can be observed that the characteristics of the wave impact loads are varied by the specifications of the measuring sensors 3 3 effect of displacement on the impact load in fig 11 c most of the 20 impact signals showed similar peak forces and patterns however one case showed an abnormally small peak force fig 31 shows the displacement of the wavemaker in the first second and thirteenth test repetitions and the abnormally small impact force occurred during the thirteenth test repetition the wavemaker displacements in the first and second cases showed the same tendency whereas the displacement in the thirteenth case showed some noise at approximately 29 s and the wave elevation was also considerably different compared with the first and second cases because the wave changed the generated impact load changed even more therefore the accuracy of the wavemaker displacement must also be verified during impact load measurements 4 conclusions an experimental study was conducted to investigate the characteristics of wave impact loads and the effects of air bubbles in breaking waves from a series of model tests the following conclusions were drawn as the breaking wave becomes more developed in front of the model the wave runup on the model increases the impact loads of breaking waves can be damped by pre generated wave runups when measuring the impact load with the force sensor however as the breaking wave becomes increasingly developed before impact the influence of air bubbles increases and the impact pressure measured by the pressure sensor increases extremely in other words the impact load can vary greatly depending on whether or not the effects of air bubbles are measured the impact load pattern can be classified into three types according to the effect of air bubble i a strong air bubble effect is indicated by a high peak with positive and negative oscillations ii a weak air bubble effect is indicated by a high peak with positive oscillations and iii a very weak effect is indicated by a low peak with no significant oscillations if the natural frequency of the sensor is smaller than the oscillation frequency of the air bubble measuring a large impact load or oscillation caused by the air bubble is difficult in general strain gauge force sensors have low natural frequencies making it difficult to measure impact loads caused by air bubbles accurately however piezoelectric force sensors have a high natural frequency and therefore they can accurately measure impact loads caused by air bubbles compared to the pressure sensors unlike pressure sensors force sensors are less affected by temperature allowing for more accurate measurements as the size or weight of the force panel applied to the force sensor increases the air bubble effect becomes increasingly difficult to measure this is also influenced by the inertia of the panel and may be due to the low natural frequency of the sensor therefore reducing the panel size and weight of the force sensor is recommended to improve accuracy in the measurement of air bubble effects the breaking and impact loads can vary greatly even if the displacement of the wavemaker is only slightly changed therefore in order to measure the impact load precisely the displacement of the wavemaker must be verified in this study the flow velocity was not evaluated because the results were focused on the air bubble effect in near future the relation between the flow velocity and the impact load needs to be investigated funding this

repeated 20 times the test conditions are summarized in table 2 this report of the experimental results focuses on the measured data at the 0 16 m location where the highest wave impact forces were measured 3 experimental results 3 1 slamming impact force characteristics 3 1 1 wave impact force with a spilling wave fig 5 shows images of the wave shapes near the model during the spilling wave tests the incoming wave was slightly broken before the wave hit the model the breaking wave then mixed with the air and the water strongly impacted the model fig 6 shows the impact moment for the different model locations no clear change in the wave shapes at the impact were observed although the wave impact forces varied in accordance with the model locations as shown in fig 7 perhaps because of the effect of mixed air and water the time histories of the wave impact forces according to the model location are shown in fig 7 all of the measured wave impact forces for each model location showed good repeatability large impact forces occurred at the model locations of 2 cm and 0 cm and the impact forces were relatively small at the model location of 2 cm as shown in fig 8 very little wave runup occurred in the 2 cm and 0 cm conditions whereas significant runup occurred in the 2 cm condition and this runup was considered to dampen the impact load in this case fig 9 shows the relations between the rising decay times and the peak forces under the spilling wave it can be seen that the short rising and decay times occur with increasing the peak forces in this study the correlation coefficients from the relations between the rising decay times and the peak forces were evaluated using eq 1 1 r x y i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 the correlation coefficient between the rising times and the peak forces is 0 65 and the correlation coefficient between the decay times and the peak forces is 0 77 therefore the peak force has relatively high correlation with the rising and decay times in the case of the spilling wave condition 3 1 2 wave impact force with a plunging wave fig 10 shows images from shortly before the impact according to the model location in the images the white lines show the wave shapes near the model the wave shapes changed slightly with the different model locations at 2 cm the breaking wave was facing up before the wave impact whereas at 0 and 2 cm the breaking wave was curling down before the wave impact a 2 cm closer to wavemaker b 0 cm 17 8 m from wavemaker c 2 cm closer to wave absorber fig 11 shows the time histories of the wave impact forces according to the model location one high impact occurred with the model at the 2 cm location whereas a small impact and then the high impact occurred with the model at the 0 and 2 cm locations in more detail fig 12 shows representative shapes of the wave impact for the 0 cm condition in the case of ① the one peak occurred in the wave impact force because the wave hit the model as the wave was still rising see fig 10 a in the case of ② of two spiky peaks occurrd in the wave impact forces because of the development of the breaking wave see fig 10 b in the case of ③ a blunt peak occurred in the wave impact force pattern because the impact occurred after the breaking wave had fully developed as shown in fig 10 c these phenomena are consistent with those reported by wienke et al 2000 as shown in fig 12 small vibrations appearred before and after the peak impact these vibrations were caused by the natural frequency of the force sensor as was also reported by huang et al 2017 fig 13 shows the relations between the rising decay times and the peak forces under the plunging wave it can be seen that the short rising and decay times occur with increasing the peak forces and the trends are similar to that under spilling wave condition the correlation coefficient between the rising times and the peak forces is 0 66 and the correlation coefficient between the decay times and the peak forces is 0 84 it can be found that the wave impact forces have the high correlation with the rising and decay times as shown in figs 9 and 13 3 2 slamming impact pressure characteristics 3 2 1 wave impact pressure with a spilling wave fig 14 shows the time histories of the wave impact pressures according to the model location the peak pressures were quite similar with the model at the 2 cm location showing good repeatability in the measured pressure however the peak pressures and pressure patterns varied significantly with the models at the 0 and 2 cm locations the large variability was caused by the further mixing of air and waves as the breaking wave developed fig 15 shows representative time histories of the wave impact force and pressure as shown in fig 15 a vibrations with a frequency of 2 5 khz occurred in the time history of the wave impact force the natural frequency of the force sensor with the force panel is approximately 2 5 khz as evaluated in a hammering test and therefore the vibrations were considered to be induced by the natural frequency of the force sensor as shown in fig 15 b oscillations with frequencies in the range from 3 2 to 4 4 khz occurred in the pressure signal these were not attributed to the pressure sensor s natural frequency which was 70 khz fig 16 a shows the result of applying a fast fourier transform to the pressure signal which shows a large physical quantity near 3 7 khz if these vibrations were caused by air bubbles the diameter of the air bubble can be estimated using eq 2 here r 0 is the bubble diameter ρ 0 is the water density p 0 is the peak pressure f is the oscillation frequency and γ is the polytrophic coefficient of the water in this study the polytrophic coefficient applied was 1 4 considering the standard temperature fig 16 b shows the bubble diameter estimated from the measured data and eq 2 the bubble diameter was estimated to be between 0 26 and 0 40 mm although the vibrations caused by air bubbles having such a small diameter can be measured by a sensitive pressure sensor they are difficult to measure in a force sensor which has a low natural frequency fig 17 shows the relations between the rising decay times and the peak pressures under the spilling wave the correlation coefficient between the rising times and the peak pressures is 0 56 and the correlation coefficient between the decay times and the peak pressures is 0 65 in the case of the spilling wave condition it can be found that the peak pressures have the relatively high correlation with the rising and decay times even if air bubble effects occur 3 2 2 wave impact pressure with a plunging wave fig 18 shows the time histories of the wave impact pressures according to the model location as with the spilling wave condition the pressures on the models at the 0 and 2 cm locations show significant variability compared with the 2 cm location the peak pressure with the model at the 2 cm location was approximately 20 times higher than that at the 2 cm location fig 19 shows air bubbles generated with the models at the 2 and 2m locations at 2 cm the air bubbles were frequently trapped near the sensing part of the pressure sensor which generated extreme impact pressures and vibrating signals in this study the shapes of the pressure data acquired through repeated experiments were classified into three types according to the effect of air bubbles as shown in fig 20 i strong ii weak and iii very weak effects in the case of the strong effect a large peak pressure occurred followed by positive and negative oscillations in the case of the weak effect a large peak pressure was followed by positive oscillations only in the case of the very weak effect the peak pressure was not so large and the oscillations were not significant compared with the strong and weak effects as mentioned above the effect of the air bubble cannot be captured by the force sensor perhaps because of the difference in sensing areas in addition to the sensor s low natural frequency fig 21 shows an image taken at the moment of impact at the model location of 2 cm the image shows the force sensors as well as an air bubble trapped near the sensing part of the force panel however oscillations due to air bubbles were not measured by the force sensors as shown in fig 11 as the air bubble size is very small it is difficult to distinct the air bubble size in figs 19 and 21 it is necessary to capture the air bubble size using a camera having a very high resolution to investigate whether the force sensor could not measure the air bubble effects because of its large sensing area or low natural frequency additional model tests were conducted using sensors with various sensing areas and natural frequencies fig 22 shows the relations between the rising decay times and the peak pressures under the plunging wave in the case of the plunging wave condition the pressures with the air bubbles have the very short rising and decay times while the pressures without the air bubbles have the relatively long rising and decay times it means that the strong wave impact instantaneously occurs on the model due to the air bubble the correlation coefficients between the rising times and the peak pressures according to the effect of air bubbles as follow without air bubble 0 81 with air bubble 0 75 also the correlation coefficients between the decay times and the peak pressures according to the effect of air bubbles as follow without air bubble 0 83 with air bubble 0 79 tables 3 and 4 summarized the characteristics of the wave impact loads it can be observed that the characteristics of the wave impact loads are varied by the model locations and the effect of air bubbles 3 2 3 sensing area and natural frequency in order to investigate the effects of air bubbles on the oscillation of the pressure additional model tests were conducted the model made to the bottom mouted model in order to tightly fix in 2d wave flume as shown in fig 23 in that case the incoming waves could be trapped in front of the model so the model diameter was reduced to be 0 2m which was relatively smaller than the diameter of the truncated cylinder model the model was bottom mounted in the wave flume at 17 82 m from the wavemaker the 2 cm location closer to wave absorber plunging waves were applied to the model and five different sensors were used as summarized in table 5 in the previous experiments the sensing area of the force sensor was 3 cm 3 cm in this experiment the sensing area of the force sensor was changed to a round shape with a diameter of 1 cm similar to the pressure sensor in the previous experiments the surface of the force panel followed the curvature of the cylinder s surface in this experiment the surface was changed to be flat similar to the pressure sensor the arrangement of the pressure and force sensors is shown in fig 24 the distance between the centers of the sensing part of the force sensors kistler 4576a was 6 cm and the distance between the centers of the other sensors was 3 cm in this model test adapters for the five different sensors shown in fig 23 were changed as necessary for each experiment fig 25 shows images of the wave shapes near the model the air bubbles were trapped in front of the cylinder as in the previous model tests fig 26 shows representative time histories of the wave impact pressures acquired by the piezoelectric pressure sensor kistler 701a as shown in fig 26 the oscillation frequencies were relatively lower than the previous experimental results the cylinder diameter was also different from the previous experiment and therefore the effect of the air bubbles was different because the generated wave patterns were different nonetheless in the case of the strong air bubble effect a relatively high oscillation frequency occurred compared to the weak air bubble effect showing a similar trend to the previous model tests the oscillation frequencies of the air bubble were noticeably lower than the sensor s natural frequency figs 27 29 show representative time histories of the wave impact pressures acquired by the piezoelectric pressure sensor kistler 601ca the integrated electronics piezoelectric pressure sensor kistler 601cba and the piezoelectric force sensor kistler 9301b respectively the oscillation frequencies induced by the air bubbles were similar to the results acquired by the piezoelectric sensor shown in fig 26 as in that case the oscillation frequencies were much lower than the sensors natural frequencies although the air bubble effects could not be captured by the strain gauge force sensor kistler 4576a in the previous model tests the weak air bubble effect was captured by the same force sensor in this model test in this model test the oscillation frequency of the air bubble was relatively lower than the natural frequency of the force sensor and the sensing area of the force sensor was small and flat compared to the previous model test as shown in figs 26 c fig 27 c fig 28 c figs 29 c and fig 30 b the patterns of the impact pressures were different from each other because of the different sensitivities of the various sensor types piezoelectric and integrated electronics piezoelectric sensor types are known to have fast response times kim et al 2015 2017 and many studies of sensor characteristics should be performed because these characteristics can change in response to different test conditions table 6 summarized the characteristics of the wave impact pressures according to the effect of air bubbles it can be observed that the characteristics of the wave impact loads are varied by the specifications of the measuring sensors 3 3 effect of displacement on the impact load in fig 11 c most of the 20 impact signals showed similar peak forces and patterns however one case showed an abnormally small peak force fig 31 shows the displacement of the wavemaker in the first second and thirteenth test repetitions and the abnormally small impact force occurred during the thirteenth test repetition the wavemaker displacements in the first and second cases showed the same tendency whereas the displacement in the thirteenth case showed some noise at approximately 29 s and the wave elevation was also considerably different compared with the first and second cases because the wave changed the generated impact load changed even more therefore the accuracy of the wavemaker displacement must also be verified during impact load measurements 4 conclusions an experimental study was conducted to investigate the characteristics of wave impact loads and the effects of air bubbles in breaking waves from a series of model tests the following conclusions were drawn as the breaking wave becomes more developed in front of the model the wave runup on the model increases the impact loads of breaking waves can be damped by pre generated wave runups when measuring the impact load with the force sensor however as the breaking wave becomes increasingly developed before impact the influence of air bubbles increases and the impact pressure measured by the pressure sensor increases extremely in other words the impact load can vary greatly depending on whether or not the effects of air bubbles are measured the impact load pattern can be classified into three types according to the effect of air bubble i a strong air bubble effect is indicated by a high peak with positive and negative oscillations ii a weak air bubble effect is indicated by a high peak with positive oscillations and iii a very weak effect is indicated by a low peak with no significant oscillations if the natural frequency of the sensor is smaller than the oscillation frequency of the air bubble measuring a large impact load or oscillation caused by the air bubble is difficult in general strain gauge force sensors have low natural frequencies making it difficult to measure impact loads caused by air bubbles accurately however piezoelectric force sensors have a high natural frequency and therefore they can accurately measure impact loads caused by air bubbles compared to the pressure sensors unlike pressure sensors force sensors are less affected by temperature allowing for more accurate measurements as the size or weight of the force panel applied to the force sensor increases the air bubble effect becomes increasingly difficult to measure this is also influenced by the inertia of the panel and may be due to the low natural frequency of the sensor therefore reducing the panel size and weight of the force sensor is recommended to improve accuracy in the measurement of air bubble effects the breaking and impact loads can vary greatly even if the displacement of the wavemaker is only slightly changed therefore in order to measure the impact load precisely the displacement of the wavemaker must be verified in this study the flow velocity was not evaluated because the results were focused on the air bubble effect in near future the relation between the flow velocity and the impact load needs to be investigated funding this

21796,the objective of this paper is to apply experimental and numerical methods to investigate the cavitating flow characteristics in an axial flow waterjet pump in the experiments the hydraulic and cavitation performance of the waterjet pump model are tested under different operation conditions in the numerical simulations the zwart cavitation model and the sst k ω turbulence model are employed to simulate the cavitating flow the results show that the cavitation process affects the structures of the attached cavitation on suction side ss as the pressure decreases continuously the growth of the cavity on ss narrows the passage and changes the flow field from the comparison of the induced velocity field ivf in four different cavitation numbers i e σ 1 0 81 σ 2 0 74 σ 3 0 72 σ 4 0 70 the impact of the cavitation can be summarized as two patterns namely the in out pattern and in out back pattern the blade loading c bl which reflects the energy conversion ability is found to be related to the cavitation process the analysis of the upstream flow field near the leading edge le demonstrates that the cavitation evolution has an influence on the incidence angle which further interacts with the flow structures on ss keywords axial flow waterjet pump experimental research numerical analysis cavitating flow 1 introduction axial flow waterjet propulsion system which is widely used in many high speed patrol boats amphibious vehicles and silent submarines commonly consists of suction pipe axial waterjet pump and nozzle the axial flow waterjet pump is the core component of the axial flow waterjet propulsion system which absorbs the shaft power and provides the thrust by ejecting water out of the nozzle rapidly as we all know to drive the waterjet pump consumes a lot of non renewable fossil fuels such as diesel oil therefore for the purpose to reduce the potential environmental pollution and save resources it is necessary to improve the propulsion efficiency of the waterjet pump however the cavitation is an inevitable issue for the axial flow waterjet pump which can cause deleterious consequences such as noise vibration cavitation breakdown material damage and propulsion efficiency degradation a well designed axial flow waterjet pump is expected to maintain resistance to cavitation and avoid thrust breakdown within a wide range of working conditions hence to better improve the hydraulic design and enhance the cavitation resistance of the axial flow waterjet pump it is important to have an in depth understanding of the cavitating flow characteristics in different working conditions the basic concepts and mechanisms of cavitation in hydraulic machinery have been introduced in many literatures brennen 2011 franc and michel 2005 when the local pressure decreases to a certain value the phase change will lead to the formation of vapor bubbles as the vapor bubbles moves to the region with high pressure the cavitation collapse will occur and cause deleterious consequences in order to improve the understanding of the complex structures of cavitating flow and their effects on the characteristics of the hydraulic machinery various experimental studies have been conducted in recent years coutier delgosha et al employed high speed video with the light sheet illumination to investigate the le cavitation in a centrifugal pump at different flow rates coutier delgosha et al 2003 they found that both the unsteadiness of the closure region of the attached cavitation and the shedding of the vapor structures have effect on the le cavitation meanwhile they further indicated that when the net positive suction head npsh keeps decreasing the fluctuation and the extent of the cavitation shedding become larger as for the turbopump inducers the rotating cavitation is one of the typical cavitation structures kamijo et al applied the high speed camera to observe the rotating cavitating structures and analyzed the oscillation induced by the cavitation kamijo et al 1980 the results showed that the circumferentially non uniform inlet flow may affect the rotating cavitation moreover they concluded that when the suction performance has a negative slope the cavitation induced low cycle oscillation occurs with regard to the waterjet pump or the axial flow pump the cavitating flow structures become much complexity due to the tip leakage flow thus the tip leakage vortex tlv and the tip leakage cavity have attracted enormous attention of researchers laborde et al 1997 wu et al 2009 2011 tan et al 2015 miorini et al employed high resolution piv measurements to investigate the inner structures of the tip flow and the evolution of the tlv miorini et al 2010 they found that the instantaneous tlv structure is composed of unsteady vortex filaments besides the leakage flow can induce flow separation by entraining the casing boundary layer with its counter rotating vorticity they also discussed the unsteadiness associated with the vortical structures at different evolution stages and found that the interacting vortex filaments and the massive vortex breakup have an influence on the flow structures and turbulence meanwhile the application of cfd has brought great convenience to investigate the flow structures and the cavitation process in waterjet pump and other kinds of hydraulic machinery it is well known that the cavitating flow always involves complex flow structures and physical changes such as the turbulent flow structures and the phase change dynamics of the flowing media tseng and shyy 2010 huang et al 2013 to better model the cavitating flow and capture the complex flow structures different turbulence models and cavitation models have been presented in recent years and many of them have been implemented and verified in some industrial cases launder and spalding 1983 elghobashi and abou arab 1983 yakhot 1986 menter 1993 sauer and schnerr 2000 singhal et al 2003 zwart et al 2004 athavale et al applied a full cavitation model and standard k ε model with standard wall functions to simulate the waterjet pump at different cavitation conditions athavale et al 2002 they investigated the proper trends in cavity strength and sizes then further analyzed the flow field the results clearly show that the cavitation covers the whole ss of the blades at extreme condition and the pressure keeps nearly constant and positive in the cavitating area kang et al numerically investigated the rotating cavitation and cavitation instability in a rocket inducer kang et al 2009 by analyzing the difference of the velocity vector between the cavitation conditions and the non cavitation conditions they found that there exists a disturbance flow towards the trailing edge i e te of the tip cavity this disturbance flow can affect the incidence angle of the neighboring blade which further leads to the cavitation instability hah and katz performed the numerical research on a waterjet pump with both reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans and large eddy simulation les hah and katz 2012 they presented that there exists the periodic tlv which cross the tip gap of the adjacent blade and the vortex ropes produced by these tlv lead to the pressure changes in the tip gap region cheng et al applied the schnerr sauer cavitation model and the les method to investigated the role of tip leakage cavitating flow in the vorticity and turbulence cheng et al 2020 they divided the spatial evolution of the tip leakage cavitating flow into three stages they also found that the tlv evolution is controlled by the stretching term while the dilatation term dominates the vorticity reduction inside the tlv cavity zhang et al simulated an axial flow pump focusing on the formation of 3 d tlv cavitation cloud and the breakdown of the suction side perpendicular cavitating vortices sspcv zhang et al 2015 the results show that the tlv cavitation cloud is mainly consist of tip clearance cavitation shear layer cavitation and the tlv cavitation the tail of the shedding cavitation cloud in the suction surface of the blade leads to the formation of sspcv which will gradually evolve under the influence of the tlv and the tip leakage flow the sspcv finally collapse accompanying the new born sspcv in the neighboring blade guo et al employed a modified zwart cavitation model to simulate the tlv cavitation in an axial flow rotor guo et al 2019 they found that the tlv cavitation can reduce the tip leakage flow rate and the relative motion in the tip region makes the major contribution to the vortex stretching term of the vorticity equation by considering the pressure pulsation they also found that the tlv moves to the downstream with the offset of the high pulse positions xu et al combined the numerical simulation with the high speed video to study the evolution of tip leakage cavitation and analyze the cavitation vortex interaction in the tip region xu et al 2019 their results shown that the cavitation has an effect on the turbulent kinetic energy in the vortex cavitation region and the downstream tlv cavitation region along the blade luo et al focused on the role of non uniform inflow in the performance and pressure fluctuations for a waterjet pump by using the numerical simulation luo et al 2020 they proposed that the non uniform inflow can cause energy loss which mainly includes the turbulent kinetic energy production and the diffusion of the reynolds stress they also found that the intake duct impeller and the diffuser inlet have the same frequency as the rotating frequency f n but the outlet of the diffuser is dominated by the frequency of 2f n in this work the test facility is presented firstly then followed by the briefly summary of the numerical setup including the waterjet pump model numerical models computational domains meshing and boundary conditions the transport equation based zwart cavitation model and the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model are summarized then the numerical results are compared with the experimental results including the performance curves and the cavitation characteristic curves for the convenience in flow analysis four typical cavitation conditions i e a σ 1 0 81 b σ 2 0 74 c σ 3 0 72 d σ 4 0 70 are selected and the corresponding cavitation structures are demonstrated in details to better understand the influence of cavitation process on the flow field in the blade passage the induced velocity field ivf is calculated and analyzed at the critical cavitation stage σ 2 0 74 the significant increase of the head rise from the numerical results is also investigated and attributed to the dramatically changing in blade loading the variation of the incidence angle near the le at four different cavitation numbers has also been discussed which demonstrates that the upstream flow structures can be affected by the cavitation in the blade passage 2 experimental setup 2 1 test facility the waterjet pump model is mounted in a closed test loop which is located in chinese national fluid machinery laboratory jiangsu university as shown in fig 1 the waterjet pump model is installed horizontally in the test section the major components of the closed test loop consist of a cavitation tank a vacuum pump a torque meter a booster pump a flow stabilized tank and an electromagnetic flowmeter the cavitation tank is located above the loop the lower half of which is filled with water and the rest is full of air it is huge enough to store plenty of water for experiment and ensure the circulating water to keep the constant temperature which is measured exactly no more than 0 5 c in 2 h the flow steadying grid is mounted at the middle section of the cavitation tank to reduce the swirl and scales of turbulence of the inflow of the pump the vacuum pump connected with the cavitation tank from the top is used to adjust the pressure of the inflow of the pump at different cavitation stages when the head rise of the pump decreases to a certain value the booster pump starts to work and maintains the circulation by increasing the flow rate with installing a honeycomb the flow stabilized tank can improve the uniformity of the flow in the test loop the motor which drives the waterjet pump model is precisely controlled by a frequency inverter and the shaft speed and power are measured by a torque meter the flow rate is measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter the pressure transducers are installed at both of the pump inlet and outlet where each of the cross sections has a total of four pressure measuring points in vertical and horizontal directions it should be noted that the pressure acquisition is the average value of the four measuring points on each cross section all the analog signals are converted to digital type and stored in the computer database the maximum head rise for the closed test loop is 100 m and the maximum volumetric flow rate is 0 694 m3 s the effective volume of the circulation system is more than 78 m3 the uncertainty of the electromagnetic flowmeter and the pressure transducer is less than 0 25 while the torque meter has an uncertainty of 0 2 the total permissible uncertainty of the efficiency for the closed test loop is less than 0 36 and the random uncertainty is less than 0 1 2 2 waterjet pump model the schematic diagram of the waterjet pump is shown in fig 2 a which only demonstrates the rotor stator and the casing not including the shaft and other complex components the real test section is shown in fig 2 b the parameters of the waterjet pump are listed in table 1 3 numerical setup 3 1 conservation of mass and momentum without considering the body forces and heat transfer of a multiphase newtonian fluid the incompressible and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations using einstein notation can be shown as follows in cartesian coordinates 1 ρ m t ρ m u j x j 0 2 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j p x i x j μ m μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 u k x k δ i j 3 ρ l α l t ρ l α l u j x j m m 4 ρ m ρ l α l ρ v α v 5 μ m μ l α l μ v α v where u is the velocity p is the pressure ρ m is the mixture density ρ l is the liquid density ρ v is the vapor density μ m is the mixture laminar viscosity μ l and μ v are respectively the liquid and vapor dynamic viscosity μ t is the turbulent viscosity m and m are the source term and sink term which respectively represent the condensation rate and evaporation rate 3 2 turbulence model mentor menter 1993 firstly presents the shear stress transport model i e sst turbulence model which is called as a hybridized model by tabatabaian 2015 in other words the sst model which is a combination of k ε model and k ω model can produce the reasonable simulation results for the flow regions away from the wall or near the wall the sst k ω turbulence model being used to solve the urans equations in this study is shown as follows in einstein notation 6 ρ m k t ρ m u j k x j p k d k x j μ m μ t σ k k x j 7 ρ m ω t ρ m u j ω x j c ω p ω β ω ρ m ω 2 x j μ m μ t σ k ω x j 2 ρ m 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j the viscosity is defined as 8 v t ρ a 1 k max a 1 ω s f 2 where v t μ t ρ f 1 and f 2 are the blending functions s is an invariant measure of the strain rate 3 3 cavitation model the zwart cavitation model zwart et al 2004 being applied in this study can be derived from rayleigh plesset equation the cavitating flow is governed by the mass transfer equation i e equation 3 and the condensation rate m and the evaporation rate m

into liquid when p p v 3 4 computational domain meshing and boundary conditions generally speaking the axial flow waterjet propulsion system applied in high speed boat and amphibious vehicle is usually installed horizontally thus it is necessary to use a suction pipe to connect the water intake on the underdeck with the pump inlet usually the suction pipe is a bending elbow and a well designed suction pipe has good performance and can reduce the non uniform flow but due to the asymmetry of the suction pipe and the effect of gravity the non uniformity of the inflow can t be fully eliminated in the present study the authors have focused on the investigation of the flow characteristics in the runner passage under cavitation conditions thus the suction pipe is simplified into the straight pipe as shown in fig 3 the computational domain primarily consists of four parts the inlet pipe domain the rotor domain including the tip gap region the stator domain and the outlet domain the rotor domain is set as the rotating zone and the rest domains are considered as the stationary zone to balance the simulation accuracy and the computation speed the length of the inlet and outlet pipe are 2 8d 1 and 3d 1 all of the domains are structured in hexahedral mesh using the commercial code icem and turbogrid see fig 4 because of the tip clearance the leakage flow is an inevitable phenomenon to better capture the tip leakage flow the tip gap region is set at least 40 grid nodes the near wall regions are refined to ensure that the average value of y remains less than 30 three sets of mesh number which give a constant refinement ratio r n fine n course 2 are used for the grid convergence study where n is the number of grid nodes as shown in table 2 the basic procedure for the estimation of the discretization error is based on the richardson extrapolation and the recommendation by journal of fluids engineering richardson 1910 richardson and gaunt 1927 celik et al 2008 the head rise coefficient h is selected as the indicator of the convergency and can be defined as h p t o t a l 2 p t o t a l 1 p n 2 d 2 2 where p total 2 and p total 1 represent the total pressure in measuring points 2 and measuring points 1 as shown in figs 1 and 2 b then the extrapolated value hext 21 the approximate relative error ea 21 the extrapolated relative error eext 21 and the fine grid convergence index gcifine 21 are calculated and listed in table 2 as the gcifine 21 is less than 2 the mesh iii is considered as mesh independent and the subsequent simulation works are used the mesh iii scheme as a famous commercial software the cfx solver has been widely used in the numerical simulations therefore the present study uses the cfx solver to simulate the cavitating flow and the boundary conditions are defined by the experimental setup the inlet boundary condition is set as the pressure inlet type which brings convenience to the cavitation simulation by changing the pressure conditions the outlet boundary condition is defined as the mass flow outlet type which helps to simulate the performance characteristics in different flow rates the boundary of the solid walls is set as the no slip wall type the steady state simulation can reflect the average characteristics of the cavitating flow thus for the convenience of comparing and analyzing the flow structures in different cavitation stages the steady results of the numerical simulation have been used 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the numerical models to validate the numerical models fig 5 shows the predicted head rise h shaft power coefficient p and the pump efficient eff versus the relative flow rate q rel for the waterjet pump as well as the measured values in the experiment the relative flow rate is defined as q rel q q d where q is the flow rate and q d is the design flow rate the head rise coefficient h has been defined in section 3 4 and the shaft power coefficient p is defined as p p ρn 3 d2 5 as shown in fig 5 in general reasonable agreement is observed between the computations and the measurements except for the h and the p in the period of q rel 0 75 with the decreasing of the q rel both the eff and the p rise gradually to a peak and then slowly decrease the best efficiency is approximately 85 when q rel is 0 9 as for the h it rises quickly to a peak around q rel 0 75 and then slowly decreases when q rel 0 75 the deviation of the numerical and experimental results enlarges remarkably it seems that the numerical and experimental results have smaller errors when the flow rate remains in the variation range of the 20 of the designed flow rate however when the flow rate below 0 75q d the flow condition fundamentally changes and the flow structures become more complex accompanied by the flow separation and the energy loss gülich 2008 4 2 typical cavitating flow structures at different cavitation stages fig 6 shows the comparison of cavitation performance between the numerical and experimental results at the design point i e q rel is 1 0 the relative head rise h rel is defined as h h nc where h nc represents the head rise of σ 1 32 considered as the cavitation free condition here the cavitation number σ is defined as σ p in p v 0 5ρu 2 where p in represents the inlet static pressure p v represents the saturated vapor pressure ρ means the density of the fluid and u is the velocity of the inlet flow it shows that there is a general agreement between the numerical and experimental results to capture the changing process in h rel with decreasing σ some difference could be observed as σ decreases to 0 77 i e the critical cavitation point with the decreasing of pressure at cavitation breakdown the initial peak of h rel is gradually formed for the numerical results for the experimental results h rel drops precipitously at the same condition without any peaks being captured as for the axial flow waterjet pump the phenomenon that the head rise curve rises slightly before going down has been reported in the previous researches for example tan et al have investigated the large scale cavitation vertical structures and their experimental results manifested that head rise curve rises up before going down at the critical cavitation number tan et al 2015 it should be noted that the developing process of the cavitation is highly unsteady and the cavitation incipient stage is a kind of critical state which may be difficult to distinguish accurately in addition the cavitation will dwindle down the flow rate during the experiments while the numerical simulations still keep flow condition the same thus all these possible reasons may lead to the significant difference between the numerical and experimental results the cavitation patterns on ss are presented in fig 6 the bluish grey area represents the isosurface of vapor volume fraction when α v 0 6 at σ 1 0 81 the small cavity region occurs near the blade tip approximately locating at 75 of the chord length the head rise almost stays the same as the conditions with higher cavitation number which means the small cavitation region has limited impact on the performance of the waterjet pump at σ 2 0 74 the cavitation area increases and extends from tip to root of the blades the relative head rise reaches the maximum value of 1 01 due to the flow structures changed by the cavitation on the ss at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the cavitation region almost covers the whole ss lindau et al found that the te of the blade has the minimum flow area when cavitation choking occurs lindau et al 2012 thus when cavitation region extends to the te the head rise should decrease dramatically which is quite well validated from the cavitation performance curve in fig 6 the tip leakage flow is driven by the pressure difference between the pressure surface and the suction surface due to the impact of the main stream the tip leakage vortex tlv will form and extend to the downstream although the focus of the present study is the attached cavitation structures the role of the tip leakage flow and the tlv should also be considered it should be noted that the tip leakage cavitation can be clearly observed in the tip gap region the tip leakage cavitation is limited to a small region which is close to the casing wall with the decreasing cavitation number the tip leakage cavitation finally blends together with the attached cavitation from the present numerical results the attached cavitation seems to dominate the whole cavitation structures in the blade passage in order to further investigate the spatial distribution of the cavitation in the circumferential direction the distribution of the vapor volume fraction i e α v is plotted on the 50 spanwise surface as shown in fig 7 the 50 spanwise surface as shown in fig 11 has the constant relative radius at r r shroud 0 5d 2 r shroud 0 5 which represents the middle position of the blade passage at σ 1 0 81 no significant cavitation region around the blade can be observed at σ 2 0 74 the cavitation region can be seen at ss extending from 60 to 80 of the chord line and the cavitation flow separation can be recognized at the te of the blade at σ 3 0 72 the cavitation region becomes more significant almost occupying the latter part of the blade and dramatically decreasing the blade spacing at σ 4 0 70 the cavitation starts from the le and terminates at the back of the te decreasing the blade spacing further from the stretch out view the blade passage of σ 1 0 81 and σ 2 0 74 presents a diffuser effect but as the cavitation evolving at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the blade passage contracts gradually the narrow flow passage implies the decreasing effective flow area therefore according to the conservation of energy or bernoulli s equation at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the local flow has higher kinetic energy and lower static pressure which means more flow loss in the blade passage and high probability of cavitation although the homogeneous model has been applied in the numerical simulations in fact the velocity of the vapor phase is different from that of the liquid phase and this kind of inhomogeneity can cause flow separation and the jet wake even the secondary flow fig 8 illustrates the distribution of induced velocity field ivf which is calculated by subtracting the velocity vector of cavitation free flow σ 1 43 from that of a specified cavitation flow the vector subtraction reflects the changes due to the cavitation in the local velocity field thus after the subtraction the newly acquired vector filed i e ivf can be used to further analyzed the influence from the cavitation region it is noted that for demonstration purpose the majority of the blade passage which is blue in fig 7 and representing the area has no cavitation is converted into white in fig 8 except for the attached cavitation on ss the red arrowed lines indicate the approximate direction of the ivf at σ 1 0 81 the cavitation region is relatively small and the impact of ivf on the local flow is limited at σ 2 0 74 the ivf presents a kind of aggregation effect probably driving the incoming flow close to the cavitation region the more significant phenomenon also can be observed at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 besides the ivf near the te of the attached cavitation presents evident features at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 at σ 3 0 72 the features can be summarized as the in out pattern which consists of two processes firstly the ivf gathers together like a sink as shown in black dotted box secondly the ivf moves out of the cavitation region and towards the downstream like a source kang et al also observed the source like flow near the le of the cavitation region in an inducer kang et al 2009 however at σ 4 0 70 the ivf adds a new feature and can be concluded as the in out back pattern when the ivf moves out of the cavitation region the direction of the induced velocity vector deflects to the neighboring blade not towards the downstream this is the reason why the backflow exists at σ 4 0 70 it should be noted that the ivf just demonstrates the trend of the fluid motion but not the real flow path although this approach just demonstrates the average impact of the cavitation region the changing tendency of the velocity can be regarded as representative of the local flow field fig 9 shows the distribution of pressure coefficient on the 50 spanwise surface the normalized pressure coefficient c p can be defined as p p v 0 5ρu 2 where p represents the local static pressure as shown in fig 9 the distribution of c p illustrates that the pressure gradient field changes dramatically with the cavitation process with the decreasing σ the low pressure area i e the dark blue region near the ss constantly expands from the latter part of the blade to the whole blade surface at the same time the thickness of the low pressure area near the ss continuously increases and finally occupies almost half of the blade passage on the contrary the high pressure area i e the red region keeps decreasing and contracts towards the downstream i e the top direction of the four images therefore the evolving cavitating flow varies the local pressure gradient which destabilizes the flow in the blade passage 4 3 the analysis of the flow characteristics of the waterjet pump in different cavitation conditions fig 10 shows the normalized blade loading i e c bl distribution at 50 spanwise from inlet to outlet zangeneh et al zangeneh 1991 zangeneh et al 1998 1999 and goto et al 2016 using inverse design method have done amount of work in terms of turbomachinery one of the core concepts of inverse design method is the blade loading which can be defined as equation 11 and converted into dimensionless factor i e c bl as equation 12 11 v u r m z 2 π p p s p s s ρ v m 12 c b l 4 ω d 2 2 v u r m 2 z ω d 2 2 π p p s p s s ρ v m in equation 11 and equation 12 v u is the circumferential component of absolute velocity v u r is the velocity circulation m is the meridional distance along the blade and v u r m represents blade loading p ps is the pressure on ps and p ss is the pressure on ss v m is the pitchwise averaged meridional velocity z is blade number the c bl integral over m means the total velocity circulation from inlet to outlet which is a symbol of the capacity of energy conversion for a rotor blade as shown in fig 10 all of the four c bl curves can be summarized as the aft loaded type which means the major loading distributes on the latter part of the blade nevertheless at σ 2 0 74 with m changes from 0 to 1 the c bl increases gradually and reaches to the top m 0 8 then declines slightly before rising again it is easy to find that the c bl curve for σ 2 0 74 has the largest integral area which implies the blade is able to convert more mechanical energy to liquid energy and this is confirmed by the numerical results in fig 6 where the initial peak of the relative head rise occurs it should be noted that the integral area of σ 1 0 81 is larger than that of σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 and the integral area of σ 4 0 70 is the smallest therefore the head rise declines with the decreasing cavitation number among the remaining three i e σ 1 0 81 σ 3 0 72 σ 4 0 70 which also agrees with the numerical results in fig 6 the meridional velocity i e v m1 distribution at le is shown in fig 12 the values of v m1 corresponding to the four different cavitation numbers can be ranked in a descending order as shown in fig 12 it has been found that the v m1 of σ 1 0 81 comes close to that of σ 2 0 74 and surpasses that of σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 considerably although the changing tendency of v m1 for the four different cavitation numbers from inlet to outlet presents the similar trend the distinction in values of v m1 implies the flow structures near the le has been influenced by the cavitation significantly according to the classic design theory of pump gülich 2008 the inlet flow to the le of the blade is mostly axial which means the circumferential component of the absolute inflow velocity i e v u approximately equals to zero based on this assumption the velocity triangles of the four different cavitation numbers are plotted in fig 13 it is noticeable that the size of the flow angles i e β 1 a β 1 b β 1 c and β 1 d is corresponding to the size of the v m the difference between the blade angle i e β 1b and the flow angles can be defined as the incidence angle i e i 1 a i 1 b i 1 c and i 1 d it should be noted that i 1 a is almost zero which can be confirmed by the streamlines in the research area as shown in fig 14 a therefore the direction of the relative velocity at σ 1 0 81 i e w 1 a is set as the reference direction for the further analysis the i 1 b is a positive value when σ 2 0 74 which means the inflow has a slight negative incidence angle as shown in fig 14 b however further decreasing the pressure to σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 both of the two incidence angles are positive as shown in fig 14 c and 14 d if further analysis on fig 14 with fig 9 it can be found that the pressure field around the le of the blade is influenced by the inflow field in fig 9 a a low pressure region exists in the ps near the le of the blade when the σ decreasing to 0 74 the low pressure region disappears completely shown in fig 9 b the probably reason is that the negative incidence angle transports the fluid from inflow and results in the pressure recovery at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the positive incidence angle aggravated the flow separation in the ss near the le of the blade which decreases the local pressure and promotes the formation of cavitation in the ss shown in fig 9 c and 9 d 5 conclusions in the present paper the cavitating flow characteristics and the cavitating flow structures for an axial flow model pump were investigated by using both the experimental and the numerical methods four typical cavitation conditions σ 1 0 81 σ 2 0 74 σ 3 0 72 σ 4 0 70 were selected and the corresponding cavitation flow structures were demonstrated the relationship between the cavitation process and the variation of the flow field was discussed in detail the major results obtained in this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the numerical results including the head rise shaft power and the efficiency agree well with the experimental results it reflects that the sst k ω turbulence model and the zwart cavitation model are capable to describe the cavitation flow characteristic in the axial waterjet pump 2 as the inlet pressure decreases gradually the cavitation structures present different scales types and locations from the numerical results at σ 1 0 81 the small cavity region approximately locates at the 75 of the chord length and near the blade tip at σ 2 0 74 the cavitation area increases and extends from tip to root of the blades at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the cavitation region almost covers the whole ss and the thickness becomes more significant the tip leakage induced cavitation can be clearly observed in the tip gap region the growth of the cavitation on ss narrows the blade passage and changes the flow field which leads to nonuniform of the pressure and velocity 3 the cavitating flow characteristics present the dramatically relevance to the cavitation process firstly the ivf clearly demonstrates that the evolution of cavitation leads to the change in cavitating flow field at σ 1 0 81 the impact of ivf on the local flow is limited at σ 2 0 74 σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the ivf presents a kind of aggregation effect probably driving the incoming flow close to the cavitation region besides the ivf near the te of the attached cavitation presents evident features at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the former can be summarized as the in out pattern and the latter can be concluded as the in out back pattern secondly the blade loading is significantly affected by the cavitation process and the c bl curves at four cavitation stages present the difference in energy conversion ability 4 the changing tendency of the incidence angle at four different cavitation numbers demonstrate that the cavitation process has influence on the upstream flow structures if set the direction of the relative velocity at σ 1 0 81 i e w 1 a as the reference direction the incidence angles can be arranged in order of size as i 1 d i 1 c i 1 a 0 i 1 b compare the four incidence angles with the pressure contours in fig 9 it is easy to find that the occurrence of low pressure area near the le relates to the incidence angle when the incidence angle is negative the low pressure region on ps disappears while for the positive incidence angle the low pressure region occurs on the ss credit authorship

21796,the objective of this paper is to apply experimental and numerical methods to investigate the cavitating flow characteristics in an axial flow waterjet pump in the experiments the hydraulic and cavitation performance of the waterjet pump model are tested under different operation conditions in the numerical simulations the zwart cavitation model and the sst k ω turbulence model are employed to simulate the cavitating flow the results show that the cavitation process affects the structures of the attached cavitation on suction side ss as the pressure decreases continuously the growth of the cavity on ss narrows the passage and changes the flow field from the comparison of the induced velocity field ivf in four different cavitation numbers i e σ 1 0 81 σ 2 0 74 σ 3 0 72 σ 4 0 70 the impact of the cavitation can be summarized as two patterns namely the in out pattern and in out back pattern the blade loading c bl which reflects the energy conversion ability is found to be related to the cavitation process the analysis of the upstream flow field near the leading edge le demonstrates that the cavitation evolution has an influence on the incidence angle which further interacts with the flow structures on ss keywords axial flow waterjet pump experimental research numerical analysis cavitating flow 1 introduction axial flow waterjet propulsion system which is widely used in many high speed patrol boats amphibious vehicles and silent submarines commonly consists of suction pipe axial waterjet pump and nozzle the axial flow waterjet pump is the core component of the axial flow waterjet propulsion system which absorbs the shaft power and provides the thrust by ejecting water out of the nozzle rapidly as we all know to drive the waterjet pump consumes a lot of non renewable fossil fuels such as diesel oil therefore for the purpose to reduce the potential environmental pollution and save resources it is necessary to improve the propulsion efficiency of the waterjet pump however the cavitation is an inevitable issue for the axial flow waterjet pump which can cause deleterious consequences such as noise vibration cavitation breakdown material damage and propulsion efficiency degradation a well designed axial flow waterjet pump is expected to maintain resistance to cavitation and avoid thrust breakdown within a wide range of working conditions hence to better improve the hydraulic design and enhance the cavitation resistance of the axial flow waterjet pump it is important to have an in depth understanding of the cavitating flow characteristics in different working conditions the basic concepts and mechanisms of cavitation in hydraulic machinery have been introduced in many literatures brennen 2011 franc and michel 2005 when the local pressure decreases to a certain value the phase change will lead to the formation of vapor bubbles as the vapor bubbles moves to the region with high pressure the cavitation collapse will occur and cause deleterious consequences in order to improve the understanding of the complex structures of cavitating flow and their effects on the characteristics of the hydraulic machinery various experimental studies have been conducted in recent years coutier delgosha et al employed high speed video with the light sheet illumination to investigate the le cavitation in a centrifugal pump at different flow rates coutier delgosha et al 2003 they found that both the unsteadiness of the closure region of the attached cavitation and the shedding of the vapor structures have effect on the le cavitation meanwhile they further indicated that when the net positive suction head npsh keeps decreasing the fluctuation and the extent of the cavitation shedding become larger as for the turbopump inducers the rotating cavitation is one of the typical cavitation structures kamijo et al applied the high speed camera to observe the rotating cavitating structures and analyzed the oscillation induced by the cavitation kamijo et al 1980 the results showed that the circumferentially non uniform inlet flow may affect the rotating cavitation moreover they concluded that when the suction performance has a negative slope the cavitation induced low cycle oscillation occurs with regard to the waterjet pump or the axial flow pump the cavitating flow structures become much complexity due to the tip leakage flow thus the tip leakage vortex tlv and the tip leakage cavity have attracted enormous attention of researchers laborde et al 1997 wu et al 2009 2011 tan et al 2015 miorini et al employed high resolution piv measurements to investigate the inner structures of the tip flow and the evolution of the tlv miorini et al 2010 they found that the instantaneous tlv structure is composed of unsteady vortex filaments besides the leakage flow can induce flow separation by entraining the casing boundary layer with its counter rotating vorticity they also discussed the unsteadiness associated with the vortical structures at different evolution stages and found that the interacting vortex filaments and the massive vortex breakup have an influence on the flow structures and turbulence meanwhile the application of cfd has brought great convenience to investigate the flow structures and the cavitation process in waterjet pump and other kinds of hydraulic machinery it is well known that the cavitating flow always involves complex flow structures and physical changes such as the turbulent flow structures and the phase change dynamics of the flowing media tseng and shyy 2010 huang et al 2013 to better model the cavitating flow and capture the complex flow structures different turbulence models and cavitation models have been presented in recent years and many of them have been implemented and verified in some industrial cases launder and spalding 1983 elghobashi and abou arab 1983 yakhot 1986 menter 1993 sauer and schnerr 2000 singhal et al 2003 zwart et al 2004 athavale et al applied a full cavitation model and standard k ε model with standard wall functions to simulate the waterjet pump at different cavitation conditions athavale et al 2002 they investigated the proper trends in cavity strength and sizes then further analyzed the flow field the results clearly show that the cavitation covers the whole ss of the blades at extreme condition and the pressure keeps nearly constant and positive in the cavitating area kang et al numerically investigated the rotating cavitation and cavitation instability in a rocket inducer kang et al 2009 by analyzing the difference of the velocity vector between the cavitation conditions and the non cavitation conditions they found that there exists a disturbance flow towards the trailing edge i e te of the tip cavity this disturbance flow can affect the incidence angle of the neighboring blade which further leads to the cavitation instability hah and katz performed the numerical research on a waterjet pump with both reynolds averaged navier stokes equations rans and large eddy simulation les hah and katz 2012 they presented that there exists the periodic tlv which cross the tip gap of the adjacent blade and the vortex ropes produced by these tlv lead to the pressure changes in the tip gap region cheng et al applied the schnerr sauer cavitation model and the les method to investigated the role of tip leakage cavitating flow in the vorticity and turbulence cheng et al 2020 they divided the spatial evolution of the tip leakage cavitating flow into three stages they also found that the tlv evolution is controlled by the stretching term while the dilatation term dominates the vorticity reduction inside the tlv cavity zhang et al simulated an axial flow pump focusing on the formation of 3 d tlv cavitation cloud and the breakdown of the suction side perpendicular cavitating vortices sspcv zhang et al 2015 the results show that the tlv cavitation cloud is mainly consist of tip clearance cavitation shear layer cavitation and the tlv cavitation the tail of the shedding cavitation cloud in the suction surface of the blade leads to the formation of sspcv which will gradually evolve under the influence of the tlv and the tip leakage flow the sspcv finally collapse accompanying the new born sspcv in the neighboring blade guo et al employed a modified zwart cavitation model to simulate the tlv cavitation in an axial flow rotor guo et al 2019 they found that the tlv cavitation can reduce the tip leakage flow rate and the relative motion in the tip region makes the major contribution to the vortex stretching term of the vorticity equation by considering the pressure pulsation they also found that the tlv moves to the downstream with the offset of the high pulse positions xu et al combined the numerical simulation with the high speed video to study the evolution of tip leakage cavitation and analyze the cavitation vortex interaction in the tip region xu et al 2019 their results shown that the cavitation has an effect on the turbulent kinetic energy in the vortex cavitation region and the downstream tlv cavitation region along the blade luo et al focused on the role of non uniform inflow in the performance and pressure fluctuations for a waterjet pump by using the numerical simulation luo et al 2020 they proposed that the non uniform inflow can cause energy loss which mainly includes the turbulent kinetic energy production and the diffusion of the reynolds stress they also found that the intake duct impeller and the diffuser inlet have the same frequency as the rotating frequency f n but the outlet of the diffuser is dominated by the frequency of 2f n in this work the test facility is presented firstly then followed by the briefly summary of the numerical setup including the waterjet pump model numerical models computational domains meshing and boundary conditions the transport equation based zwart cavitation model and the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model are summarized then the numerical results are compared with the experimental results including the performance curves and the cavitation characteristic curves for the convenience in flow analysis four typical cavitation conditions i e a σ 1 0 81 b σ 2 0 74 c σ 3 0 72 d σ 4 0 70 are selected and the corresponding cavitation structures are demonstrated in details to better understand the influence of cavitation process on the flow field in the blade passage the induced velocity field ivf is calculated and analyzed at the critical cavitation stage σ 2 0 74 the significant increase of the head rise from the numerical results is also investigated and attributed to the dramatically changing in blade loading the variation of the incidence angle near the le at four different cavitation numbers has also been discussed which demonstrates that the upstream flow structures can be affected by the cavitation in the blade passage 2 experimental setup 2 1 test facility the waterjet pump model is mounted in a closed test loop which is located in chinese national fluid machinery laboratory jiangsu university as shown in fig 1 the waterjet pump model is installed horizontally in the test section the major components of the closed test loop consist of a cavitation tank a vacuum pump a torque meter a booster pump a flow stabilized tank and an electromagnetic flowmeter the cavitation tank is located above the loop the lower half of which is filled with water and the rest is full of air it is huge enough to store plenty of water for experiment and ensure the circulating water to keep the constant temperature which is measured exactly no more than 0 5 c in 2 h the flow steadying grid is mounted at the middle section of the cavitation tank to reduce the swirl and scales of turbulence of the inflow of the pump the vacuum pump connected with the cavitation tank from the top is used to adjust the pressure of the inflow of the pump at different cavitation stages when the head rise of the pump decreases to a certain value the booster pump starts to work and maintains the circulation by increasing the flow rate with installing a honeycomb the flow stabilized tank can improve the uniformity of the flow in the test loop the motor which drives the waterjet pump model is precisely controlled by a frequency inverter and the shaft speed and power are measured by a torque meter the flow rate is measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter the pressure transducers are installed at both of the pump inlet and outlet where each of the cross sections has a total of four pressure measuring points in vertical and horizontal directions it should be noted that the pressure acquisition is the average value of the four measuring points on each cross section all the analog signals are converted to digital type and stored in the computer database the maximum head rise for the closed test loop is 100 m and the maximum volumetric flow rate is 0 694 m3 s the effective volume of the circulation system is more than 78 m3 the uncertainty of the electromagnetic flowmeter and the pressure transducer is less than 0 25 while the torque meter has an uncertainty of 0 2 the total permissible uncertainty of the efficiency for the closed test loop is less than 0 36 and the random uncertainty is less than 0 1 2 2 waterjet pump model the schematic diagram of the waterjet pump is shown in fig 2 a which only demonstrates the rotor stator and the casing not including the shaft and other complex components the real test section is shown in fig 2 b the parameters of the waterjet pump are listed in table 1 3 numerical setup 3 1 conservation of mass and momentum without considering the body forces and heat transfer of a multiphase newtonian fluid the incompressible and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans equations using einstein notation can be shown as follows in cartesian coordinates 1 ρ m t ρ m u j x j 0 2 ρ m u i t ρ m u i u j x j p x i x j μ m μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 u k x k δ i j 3 ρ l α l t ρ l α l u j x j m m 4 ρ m ρ l α l ρ v α v 5 μ m μ l α l μ v α v where u is the velocity p is the pressure ρ m is the mixture density ρ l is the liquid density ρ v is the vapor density μ m is the mixture laminar viscosity μ l and μ v are respectively the liquid and vapor dynamic viscosity μ t is the turbulent viscosity m and m are the source term and sink term which respectively represent the condensation rate and evaporation rate 3 2 turbulence model mentor menter 1993 firstly presents the shear stress transport model i e sst turbulence model which is called as a hybridized model by tabatabaian 2015 in other words the sst model which is a combination of k ε model and k ω model can produce the reasonable simulation results for the flow regions away from the wall or near the wall the sst k ω turbulence model being used to solve the urans equations in this study is shown as follows in einstein notation 6 ρ m k t ρ m u j k x j p k d k x j μ m μ t σ k k x j 7 ρ m ω t ρ m u j ω x j c ω p ω β ω ρ m ω 2 x j μ m μ t σ k ω x j 2 ρ m 1 f 1 σ ω 2 1 ω k x j ω x j the viscosity is defined as 8 v t ρ a 1 k max a 1 ω s f 2 where v t μ t ρ f 1 and f 2 are the blending functions s is an invariant measure of the strain rate 3 3 cavitation model the zwart cavitation model zwart et al 2004 being applied in this study can be derived from rayleigh plesset equation the cavitating flow is governed by the mass transfer equation i e equation 3 and the condensation rate m and the evaporation rate m are defined as follows 9 m c p r o d 3 α v ρ v r b 2 3 p p v ρ l 1 2 p p v 10 m c d e s t 3 α n u c 1 α v ρ v r b 2 3 p v p ρ l 1 2 p p v where p v is the saturated vapor pressure p is the local fluid pressure α nuc is the nuclei volume fraction r b is the bubble radius c dest is the constant generation rate of vapor when p p v the c prod is the constant rate for re conversion of the vapor back into liquid when p p v 3 4 computational domain meshing and boundary conditions generally speaking the axial flow waterjet propulsion system applied in high speed boat and amphibious vehicle is usually installed horizontally thus it is necessary to use a suction pipe to connect the water intake on the underdeck with the pump inlet usually the suction pipe is a bending elbow and a well designed suction pipe has good performance and can reduce the non uniform flow but due to the asymmetry of the suction pipe and the effect of gravity the non uniformity of the inflow can t be fully eliminated in the present study the authors have focused on the investigation of the flow characteristics in the runner passage under cavitation conditions thus the suction pipe is simplified into the straight pipe as shown in fig 3 the computational domain primarily consists of four parts the inlet pipe domain the rotor domain including the tip gap region the stator domain and the outlet domain the rotor domain is set as the rotating zone and the rest domains are considered as the stationary zone to balance the simulation accuracy and the computation speed the length of the inlet and outlet pipe are 2 8d 1 and 3d 1 all of the domains are structured in hexahedral mesh using the commercial code icem and turbogrid see fig 4 because of the tip clearance the leakage flow is an inevitable phenomenon to better capture the tip leakage flow the tip gap region is set at least 40 grid nodes the near wall regions are refined to ensure that the average value of y remains less than 30 three sets of mesh number which give a constant refinement ratio r n fine n course 2 are used for the grid convergence study where n is the number of grid nodes as shown in table 2 the basic procedure for the estimation of the discretization error is based on the richardson extrapolation and the recommendation by journal of fluids engineering richardson 1910 richardson and gaunt 1927 celik et al 2008 the head rise coefficient h is selected as the indicator of the convergency and can be defined as h p t o t a l 2 p t o t a l 1 p n 2 d 2 2 where p total 2 and p total 1 represent the total pressure in measuring points 2 and measuring points 1 as shown in figs 1 and 2 b then the extrapolated value hext 21 the approximate relative error ea 21 the extrapolated relative error eext 21 and the fine grid convergence index gcifine 21 are calculated and listed in table 2 as the gcifine 21 is less than 2 the mesh iii is considered as mesh independent and the subsequent simulation works are used the mesh iii scheme as a famous commercial software the cfx solver has been widely used in the numerical simulations therefore the present study uses the cfx solver to simulate the cavitating flow and the boundary conditions are defined by the experimental setup the inlet boundary condition is set as the pressure inlet type which brings convenience to the cavitation simulation by changing the pressure conditions the outlet boundary condition is defined as the mass flow outlet type which helps to simulate the performance characteristics in different flow rates the boundary of the solid walls is set as the no slip wall type the steady state simulation can reflect the average characteristics of the cavitating flow thus for the convenience of comparing and analyzing the flow structures in different cavitation stages the steady results of the numerical simulation have been used 4 results and discussion 4 1 validation of the numerical models to validate the numerical models fig 5 shows the predicted head rise h shaft power coefficient p and the pump efficient eff versus the relative flow rate q rel for the waterjet pump as well as the measured values in the experiment the relative flow rate is defined as q rel q q d where q is the flow rate and q d is the design flow rate the head rise coefficient h has been defined in section 3 4 and the shaft power coefficient p is defined as p p ρn 3 d2 5 as shown in fig 5 in general reasonable agreement is observed between the computations and the measurements except for the h and the p in the period of q rel 0 75 with the decreasing of the q rel both the eff and the p rise gradually to a peak and then slowly decrease the best efficiency is approximately 85 when q rel is 0 9 as for the h it rises quickly to a peak around q rel 0 75 and then slowly decreases when q rel 0 75 the deviation of the numerical and experimental results enlarges remarkably it seems that the numerical and experimental results have smaller errors when the flow rate remains in the variation range of the 20 of the designed flow rate however when the flow rate below 0 75q d the flow condition fundamentally changes and the flow structures become more complex accompanied by the flow separation and the energy loss gülich 2008 4 2 typical cavitating flow structures at different cavitation stages fig 6 shows the comparison of cavitation performance between the numerical and experimental results at the design point i e q rel is 1 0 the relative head rise h rel is defined as h h nc where h nc represents the head rise of σ 1 32 considered as the cavitation free condition here the cavitation number σ is defined as σ p in p v 0 5ρu 2 where p in represents the inlet static pressure p v represents the saturated vapor pressure ρ means the density of the fluid and u is the velocity of the inlet flow it shows that there is a general agreement between the numerical and experimental results to capture the changing process in h rel with decreasing σ some difference could be observed as σ decreases to 0 77 i e the critical cavitation point with the decreasing of pressure at cavitation breakdown the initial peak of h rel is gradually formed for the numerical results for the experimental results h rel drops precipitously at the same condition without any peaks being captured as for the axial flow waterjet pump the phenomenon that the head rise curve rises slightly before going down has been reported in the previous researches for example tan et al have investigated the large scale cavitation vertical structures and their experimental results manifested that head rise curve rises up before going down at the critical cavitation number tan et al 2015 it should be noted that the developing process of the cavitation is highly unsteady and the cavitation incipient stage is a kind of critical state which may be difficult to distinguish accurately in addition the cavitation will dwindle down the flow rate during the experiments while the numerical simulations still keep flow condition the same thus all these possible reasons may lead to the significant difference between the numerical and experimental results the cavitation patterns on ss are presented in fig 6 the bluish grey area represents the isosurface of vapor volume fraction when α v 0 6 at σ 1 0 81 the small cavity region occurs near the blade tip approximately locating at 75 of the chord length the head rise almost stays the same as the conditions with higher cavitation number which means the small cavitation region has limited impact on the performance of the waterjet pump at σ 2 0 74 the cavitation area increases and extends from tip to root of the blades the relative head rise reaches the maximum value of 1 01 due to the flow structures changed by the cavitation on the ss at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the cavitation region almost covers the whole ss lindau et al found that the te of the blade has the minimum flow area when cavitation choking occurs lindau et al 2012 thus when cavitation region extends to the te the head rise should decrease dramatically which is quite well validated from the cavitation performance curve in fig 6 the tip leakage flow is driven by the pressure difference between the pressure surface and the suction surface due to the impact of the main stream the tip leakage vortex tlv will form and extend to the downstream although the focus of the present study is the attached cavitation structures the role of the tip leakage flow and the tlv should also be considered it should be noted that the tip leakage cavitation can be clearly observed in the tip gap region the tip leakage cavitation is limited to a small region which is close to the casing wall with the decreasing cavitation number the tip leakage cavitation finally blends together with the attached cavitation from the present numerical results the attached cavitation seems to dominate the whole cavitation structures in the blade passage in order to further investigate the spatial distribution of the cavitation in the circumferential direction the distribution of the vapor volume fraction i e α v is plotted on the 50 spanwise surface as shown in fig 7 the 50 spanwise surface as shown in fig 11 has the constant relative radius at r r shroud 0 5d 2 r shroud 0 5 which represents the middle position of the blade passage at σ 1 0 81 no significant cavitation region around the blade can be observed at σ 2 0 74 the cavitation region can be seen at ss extending from 60 to 80 of the chord line and the cavitation flow separation can be recognized at the te of the blade at σ 3 0 72 the cavitation region becomes more significant almost occupying the latter part of the blade and dramatically decreasing the blade spacing at σ 4 0 70 the cavitation starts from the le and terminates at the back of the te decreasing the blade spacing further from the stretch out view the blade passage of σ 1 0 81 and σ 2 0 74 presents a diffuser effect but as the cavitation evolving at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the blade passage contracts gradually the narrow flow passage implies the decreasing effective flow area therefore according to the conservation of energy or bernoulli s equation at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the local flow has higher kinetic energy and lower static pressure which means more flow loss in the blade passage and high probability of cavitation although the homogeneous model has been applied in the numerical simulations in fact the velocity of the vapor phase is different from that of the liquid phase and this kind of inhomogeneity can cause flow separation and the jet wake even the secondary flow fig 8 illustrates the distribution of induced velocity field ivf which is calculated by subtracting the velocity vector of cavitation free flow σ 1 43 from that of a specified cavitation flow the vector subtraction reflects the changes due to the cavitation in the local velocity field thus after the subtraction the newly acquired vector filed i e ivf can be used to further analyzed the influence from the cavitation region it is noted that for demonstration purpose the majority of the blade passage which is blue in fig 7 and representing the area has no cavitation is converted into white in fig 8 except for the attached cavitation on ss the red arrowed lines indicate the approximate direction of the ivf at σ 1 0 81 the cavitation region is relatively small and the impact of ivf on the local flow is limited at σ 2 0 74 the ivf presents a kind of aggregation effect probably driving the incoming flow close to the cavitation region the more significant phenomenon also can be observed at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 besides the ivf near the te of the attached cavitation presents evident features at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 at σ 3 0 72 the features can be summarized as the in out pattern which consists of two processes firstly the ivf gathers together like a sink as shown in black dotted box secondly the ivf moves out of the cavitation region and towards the downstream like a source kang et al also observed the source like flow near the le of the cavitation region in an inducer kang et al 2009 however at σ 4 0 70 the ivf adds a new feature and can be concluded as the in out back pattern when the ivf moves out of the cavitation region the direction of the induced velocity vector deflects to the neighboring blade not towards the downstream this is the reason why the backflow exists at σ 4 0 70 it should be noted that the ivf just demonstrates the trend of the fluid motion but not the real flow path although this approach just demonstrates the average impact of the cavitation region the changing tendency of the velocity can be regarded as representative of the local flow field fig 9 shows the distribution of pressure coefficient on the 50 spanwise surface the normalized pressure coefficient c p can be defined as p p v 0 5ρu 2 where p represents the local static pressure as shown in fig 9 the distribution of c p illustrates that the pressure gradient field changes dramatically with the cavitation process with the decreasing σ the low pressure area i e the dark blue region near the ss constantly expands from the latter part of the blade to the whole blade surface at the same time the thickness of the low pressure area near the ss continuously increases and finally occupies almost half of the blade passage on the contrary the high pressure area i e the red region keeps decreasing and contracts towards the downstream i e the top direction of the four images therefore the evolving cavitating flow varies the local pressure gradient which destabilizes the flow in the blade passage 4 3 the analysis of the flow characteristics of the waterjet pump in different cavitation conditions fig 10 shows the normalized blade loading i e c bl distribution at 50 spanwise from inlet to outlet zangeneh et al zangeneh 1991 zangeneh et al 1998 1999 and goto et al 2016 using inverse design method have done amount of work in terms of turbomachinery one of the core concepts of inverse design method is the blade loading which can be defined as equation 11 and converted into dimensionless factor i e c bl as equation 12 11 v u r m z 2 π p p s p s s ρ v m 12 c b l 4 ω d 2 2 v u r m 2 z ω d 2 2 π p p s p s s ρ v m in equation 11 and equation 12 v u is the circumferential component of absolute velocity v u r is the velocity circulation m is the meridional distance along the blade and v u r m represents blade loading p ps is the pressure on ps and p ss is the pressure on ss v m is the pitchwise averaged meridional velocity z is blade number the c bl integral over m means the total velocity circulation from inlet to outlet which is a symbol of the capacity of energy conversion for a rotor blade as shown in fig 10 all of the four c bl curves can be summarized as the aft loaded type which means the major loading distributes on the latter part of the blade nevertheless at σ 2 0 74 with m changes from 0 to 1 the c bl increases gradually and reaches to the top m 0 8 then declines slightly before rising again it is easy to find that the c bl curve for σ 2 0 74 has the largest integral area which implies the blade is able to convert more mechanical energy to liquid energy and this is confirmed by the numerical results in fig 6 where the initial peak of the relative head rise occurs it should be noted that the integral area of σ 1 0 81 is larger than that of σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 and the integral area of σ 4 0 70 is the smallest therefore the head rise declines with the decreasing cavitation number among the remaining three i e σ 1 0 81 σ 3 0 72 σ 4 0 70 which also agrees with the numerical results in fig 6 the meridional velocity i e v m1 distribution at le is shown in fig 12 the values of v m1 corresponding to the four different cavitation numbers can be ranked in a descending order as shown in fig 12 it has been found that the v m1 of σ 1 0 81 comes close to that of σ 2 0 74 and surpasses that of σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 considerably although the changing tendency of v m1 for the four different cavitation numbers from inlet to outlet presents the similar trend the distinction in values of v m1 implies the flow structures near the le has been influenced by the cavitation significantly according to the classic design theory of pump gülich 2008 the inlet flow to the le of the blade is mostly axial which means the circumferential component of the absolute inflow velocity i e v u approximately equals to zero based on this assumption the velocity triangles of the four different cavitation numbers are plotted in fig 13 it is noticeable that the size of the flow angles i e β 1 a β 1 b β 1 c and β 1 d is corresponding to the size of the v m the difference between the blade angle i e β 1b and the flow angles can be defined as the incidence angle i e i 1 a i 1 b i 1 c and i 1 d it should be noted that i 1 a is almost zero which can be confirmed by the streamlines in the research area as shown in fig 14 a therefore the direction of the relative velocity at σ 1 0 81 i e w 1 a is set as the reference direction for the further analysis the i 1 b is a positive value when σ 2 0 74 which means the inflow has a slight negative incidence angle as shown in fig 14 b however further decreasing the pressure to σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 both of the two incidence angles are positive as shown in fig 14 c and 14 d if further analysis on fig 14 with fig 9 it can be found that the pressure field around the le of the blade is influenced by the inflow field in fig 9 a a low pressure region exists in the ps near the le of the blade when the σ decreasing to 0 74 the low pressure region disappears completely shown in fig 9 b the probably reason is that the negative incidence angle transports the fluid from inflow and results in the pressure recovery at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the positive incidence angle aggravated the flow separation in the ss near the le of the blade which decreases the local pressure and promotes the formation of cavitation in the ss shown in fig 9 c and 9 d 5 conclusions in the present paper the cavitating flow characteristics and the cavitating flow structures for an axial flow model pump were investigated by using both the experimental and the numerical methods four typical cavitation conditions σ 1 0 81 σ 2 0 74 σ 3 0 72 σ 4 0 70 were selected and the corresponding cavitation flow structures were demonstrated the relationship between the cavitation process and the variation of the flow field was discussed in detail the major results obtained in this paper can be summarized as follows 1 the numerical results including the head rise shaft power and the efficiency agree well with the experimental results it reflects that the sst k ω turbulence model and the zwart cavitation model are capable to describe the cavitation flow characteristic in the axial waterjet pump 2 as the inlet pressure decreases gradually the cavitation structures present different scales types and locations from the numerical results at σ 1 0 81 the small cavity region approximately locates at the 75 of the chord length and near the blade tip at σ 2 0 74 the cavitation area increases and extends from tip to root of the blades at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the cavitation region almost covers the whole ss and the thickness becomes more significant the tip leakage induced cavitation can be clearly observed in the tip gap region the growth of the cavitation on ss narrows the blade passage and changes the flow field which leads to nonuniform of the pressure and velocity 3 the cavitating flow characteristics present the dramatically relevance to the cavitation process firstly the ivf clearly demonstrates that the evolution of cavitation leads to the change in cavitating flow field at σ 1 0 81 the impact of ivf on the local flow is limited at σ 2 0 74 σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the ivf presents a kind of aggregation effect probably driving the incoming flow close to the cavitation region besides the ivf near the te of the attached cavitation presents evident features at σ 3 0 72 and σ 4 0 70 the former can be summarized as the in out pattern and the latter can be concluded as the in out back pattern secondly the blade loading is significantly affected by the cavitation process and the c bl curves at four cavitation stages present the difference in energy conversion ability 4 the changing tendency of the incidence angle at four different cavitation numbers demonstrate that the cavitation process has influence on the upstream flow structures if set the direction of the relative velocity at σ 1 0 81 i e w 1 a as the reference direction the incidence angles can be arranged in order of size as i 1 d i 1 c i 1 a 0 i 1 b compare the four incidence angles with the pressure contours in fig 9 it is easy to find that the occurrence of low pressure area near the le relates to the incidence angle when the incidence angle is negative the low pressure region on ps disappears while for the positive incidence angle the low pressure region occurs on the ss credit authorship

21797,this work mainly analyzes the variation laws of exciting force pulsating pressure velocity distribution and hydrodynamic parameters of pjp at different tip clearances δ 0 5 mm δ 1 mm δ 2 mm and different oblique flow angle 0 10 20 in this study the turbulence model sst k ω and reynolds stokes equations ranse method have been adopted the fully structured grid and full channel model have been adopted and the grid independence of three different tip clearances was verified in this study the variation laws of exciting force pressure coefficient and the hydrodynamic coefficients differences have been studied at the different tip clearances and different oblique flow angle and the time domain data of the pulsating pressure of pjp with cavitation conditions or without cavitation conditions was presented and then which was converted to frequency domain data by fast fourier transform fft the results show that the torque balance performance of the pjp is broken in oblique flow the tip clearances have a little effect than the oblique flow angle the maximum efficiency loss is 19 17 at high oblique angle the bearing force had a certain phase difference in different tip clearance the phase shift to the right as the tip clearances increases at the small advance j 1 18 the efficiency with cavitation is greater than non cavitation condition in oblique flow in addition the velocity distribution and the water vapor phase volume fraction of rotor outlet in different oblique flow angles and different tip clearances have been investigated keywords pump jet propulsor oblique flow tip clearances unsteady hydrodynamic parameters exciting force cavitation 1 introduction pump jet propulsor pjp is a new type propulsor which has been applied to underwater vehicles torpedoes and submarines etc pjp is different from duct propeller and traditional propeller whose stator blades participate in thrust production and the mechanical arrangement contains a duct propeller with either a pre swirl or a post swirl stator amin et al 2019 therefore the pjp has the advantages of high propulsion efficiency low radiation noise and high critical speed however ships or underwater vehicles can work in oblique flow conditions inevitably the oblique flow has a great influence on the performance of the propulsor which will cause the thrust and torque curves to shift relative to the open water state wang et al 2017 the hydrodynamic performance and cavitation performance of pjp will change greatly in oblique flow conditions therefore it is important to study the hydrodynamic performance and cavitation performance of pjp to improve the pjp propulsion performance pjp is mainly used for military purposes so there are few studies about the pjp in the oblique flow meanwhile the tip clearances had a tremendous impact on the hydrodynamic performance and cavitation performance of pjp so it was imperative to investigate and study the tip clearances when designing the pjp the research of the tip clearances cavitation and tip leakage had been carried out you et al 2004 peng et al 2013 nevertheless the main research focused on the turbine and propeller the influences of the tip clearances in oblique flow had not been involved at present the researches of pjp mainly concentrate on the experiment and numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic performance and cavitation in pure axial flow conditions mccormick and eisenhuth 1963 discussed the pjp design and studied cavitation performance with an experimental approach experimental evaluation on hydrodynamic performance of the pjp was carried out by suryanaryana et al 2010a 2010b 2010c amin et al 2019 investigated the numerical and experimental on a full scale pump jet thruster in a towing tank the result showed that the stator blades created additional thrust and the variations of the hydrodynamic coefficients were much smaller than traditional propeller yu et al 2019 and sun et al 2019 used sliding mesh technique and large eddy simulation les technology to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsion and their calculation results agreed with the experimental data well efforts were made to optimize the performance of the pump jet propulsor by ivanell 2001 and das et al 2006 lv et al 2014 presented the hydrodynamic performance of a type of distributed pump jet propulsion system dpjp for underwater vehicle based on the finite volume method sang and oh 2015 investigated the hydrodynamic characteristic of a pump jet with ring rotor using an unstructured mesh technique lu et al 2016 2017 pan and lu 2016 and qin et al 2018 analyzed the different tip clearances effect on the hydrodynamic performance of pjp the impact on the velocity flow and cavitation characteristic of the pjp for the different tip clearances has been presented wang et al 2019 predicted the hydrodynamic performance of the pjp by using panel method and a tip leakage vortex model qin et al 2019 predicted the underwater noise of the pump jet propulsor by using sawtooth duct based on detached eddy simulations des method and fw h equation oblique flow is a relatively simple non uniform flow the transverse velocity or turning speed of the underwater vehicle can cause the pjp to work in oblique flow meanwhile when the underwater vehicle retreats under a certain rudder angle it is affected by the rudder blade and the underwater vehicle will work in oblique flow when the pjp works in oblique flow the thrust and torque will be affected in a certain degree and which is not good for the operability and stability of underwater vehicles however most of the research in the oblique flow of the propulsor were mainly focused on traditional propeller at present there is almost no research on the operation of pjp in oblique flow ei moctar et al 2000 studied the forces of a four blades propeller at oblique angles up to 12 deg dubbioso et al 2013 2014 analyzed the wake dynamics and propeller loads of the cnr inseam e779a propeller in oblique angles 10 50 by using overlapping grids and des model mascio et al 2014 investigated the dynamic instabilities experienced by the wake of propeller in oblique flow using des model siamak et al 2016 studied the performance of the 841 b spp propeller in oblique flow conditions and different immersion ratios by using sliding mesh technique and volume of fluid vof method martio et al 2017 studied the duct propeller virtual mass and damping coefficients in oblique flow by using urans method felli and falchi 2018 studied the wake evolution mechanisms of a isolated propeller in oblique flow by particle image velocimetry piv experimental technique sun et al 2018 guilmineau et al 2018 and hou and hu 2019 made many efforts on the performance and theory of the traditional propeller in oblique flow conditions the tip clearances size and oblique flow angle have a greater impact on the performance of the pjp the above literature reviews show the performance of pjp in pure axial flow and the influence of oblique flow on the traditional propeller performance or duct propeller in this study the effect of the oblique flow on different hydrodynamic parameters at different tip clearances size has been studied the paper is organized as follows section 1 introduces the present research of the pjp and the propeller hydrodynamics performance in oblique flow section 2 introduces the numerical methods for the pjp the simulation methodology validation and cavitation methodology validation were carried out section 3 shows the geometry numerical set up and the grid independence validation section 4 analysis the variation laws of hydrodynamic coefficient difference exciting force cavitation performance and velocity

the closure of eq 2 2 2 cavitation model in this study the z g b zwart gerber belamri cavitation model has been adopted to analyze the cavitation performance of the pjp the z g b cavitation model had been used to discuss the cavitation performance of pjp by lu et al 2016 2017 it used the e779a propeller to numerical simulation the cavitation performance at different cavitation number and the numerical results are in good with the experimental results which shows that the z g b cavitation model is suitable for studying the cavitation performance of pjp the cavitation model considers the effect of gas core density on the vaporization of gaseous water vapor in liquid phase the mass fraction form of the evaporation and condensation term could be given as 3 m f e 3 r m u c 1 α v p v r b

cavitation performance of the pjp were simulated based on the shear stress transport sst k ω turbulence model its closed equations are shown in eq 7 the advantages of this turbulence model applied to propellers or pumps have been proven by many articles ji et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 lu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the three different typical turbulence model sst k ω standard k ε realizable k ε for the numerical simulation of the pjp were carried out by qin et al 2018 2019 it indicated that the errors of standard k ε and realizable k ε turbulence model are a little bigger than sst k ω turbulence model the pjp model in this paper is consistent with qin et al 2018 2019 so the sst k ω turbulence model is used for numerical simulation in this study 7 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j γ k k x j g k y k s k t

propellers a suitable research method is very important for pump jet propulsor at present there is very little literature about the research of pump jet propulsor most of them are based on cfd methods to study and there are few experimental data of the pjp for example the shear stress transport sst k omega turbulence model together with the sliding mesh technique was used to study the pjp unsteady flow by yu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 used sliding mesh technique and large eddy simulation les technology to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsion and their calculation results agreed with the experimental data well the realizable k ε turbulence model and mix plane method were adopted to study the full scale pump jet thruster by amin et al 2019 the result agreed with experimental data others such as pan et al 2016 li et al 2019 and qin et al 2019 they also used this method to analyzed the cavitation performance unsteady transient performance and noise analysis for pump jet proplsor for the simulation methodology validation the thrust and torque coefficient are dimensionless as shown in eq 8 9 8 k t i t i ρ n 2 d 4 9 k q i q i ρ n 2 d 5 where i x y z represent the cartesian coordinate components n is the propeller rotation speed d is the blade diameter ρ is the water density t i is the force and q i is the torque meanwhile the negative direction of the z axis is defined as the positive direction of the thrust coefficient values and the other axis is set the positive direction as the positive value the relative errors k t and k q were defined as morgut and nobile 2012 the equations that can be written as the 10 and 11 10 δ k t δ k t c f d δ k t e x p δ k t e x p 100 11 δ k q δ k q c f d δ k q e x p δ k q e x p 100 in this study the simulation validation is carried out with a ka4 70 duct propeller the same simulation methodology validation is carried out with a traditional duct propeller ka4 70 by qin et al 2019 and li et al 2019 the diameter of duct propeller is 200 mm and the tip clearance between blades and duct is 0 8 mm the fig 1 shows the full structure gird of the duct propeller the mesh of the hub blades root and tip clearance should be made local refinement to get more accurate results the first boundary layer height is 0 001 mm which ensure the y value of walls is less than 1 the numerical simulation of the ka4 70 propeller is carried out at different advance ratio j 0 1 0 3 0 5 the advance ratio j was defined as j u n d p where u denotes the flow velocity n is the blades rotating velocity d p is the propeller diameter and the inlet velocity is 2 57 m s in the duct propeller simulation in addition the turbulence model sst k ω has been adopted in this study the numerical simulation results and the experimental data oosterveld 1970 are shown in table 1 it can be seen from table 1 that the thrust errors k t is at most 1 83 at j 0 5 the torque errors k q is at most 1 62 it can be seen from table 1 that the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results in order to further improve the accuracy of numerical simulation method which used the pump jet propulsion model of liu et al 2010 to verify the pjp model have 9 rotor blades and 7 stator blades and the tip clearance between rotor blades and duct is 1 mm the diameter of pjp is 250 mm to improve the simulation accuracy of the pjp the fully structured mesh has been adopt in particular the mesh of the hub blades and tip clearance should be made local refinement to get more accurate results and the total number of mesh is 7 22 106 the computational domain is a cylinder of diameter 6d which extends 5d upstream and 8d downstream from the pjp central location as shown in fig 2 the numerical simulation data and the experimental data liu et al 2010 match very well the simulation results are slightly larger than the experimental results which may be caused by the ideal simulation conditions however the errors are all within 2 it can be seen from the above two simulation methodology validation that the simulation methodology in this study and the turbulence model sst k ω are applicable for the simulation of the pjp with different tip clearances in oblique flow 2 4 2 cavitation simulation methodology validation the validation of cavitation simulation methods is very important to improve the accuracy of cavitation analysis the cavitation simulation method in this study has been applied to most propeller the z g b cavitation model could well simulate the periodic shedding of hydrofoil cavitation ji et al 2010 and various cavitation patterns of the propeller pan and lu 2016 and shi et al 2015 have used this cavitation simulation method to study the cavitation performance of pjp in pure axial flow and feng and lu 2019 and xia et al 2016 have used this method to study the cavitation performance of traditional propeller and waterjet propulsor respectively at present there are few studies about the cavitation of pjp and there is no experimental data on pjp cavitation and as shown in fig 3 the traditional e779a propeller was used to verify the cavitation performance in this study the verification was performed in two different advance ratios j 0 71 j 0 83 and various cavitation numbers as shown in the fig 4 the simulation data were in good agreement with the experimental cavitation data francisco et al 2004 the differences of the propeller efficiency at different cavitation numbers were basically within 2 consequently it is concluded that the cavitation simulation method is reliable for the application considered in this study 3 numerical set ups 3 1 geometry model pjp mainly has two types which is front stator and rear stator in this study the rotor is in the front of the stator the pjp geometry model is shown in fig 5 which has 11 rotor blades and 9 stator blades in order to get more precise results two half ellipsoid type flow guide caps have been added in the front and rear of the propulsor model the flow between of rotor and the inner wall of the duct needs to be considered 1 mm is the design size of the tip clearance size of this type propulsor in this study the tip clearance size between the rotor blade and duct is 0 5 mm 1 mm 2 mm the parameters of pjp are shown in table 2 the maximum diameter of rotor is 250 mm and the diameter of the stator is 218 mm the origin o is located at the center of the pump jet propulsor and the positive direction of the z axis with the inflow direction in this paper the full channel pjp model has been adopted 3 2 computations domain and mesh in this study the computational domain and boundary conditions for pjp are shown in fig 6 based on the shape of the pjp the cylinder computational domain was selected extending from 4d max to 8d max in the streamwise direction the velocity inlet is located 4d max from the front face of the pjp and the pressure outlet is located 8d max from the end of the pjp the diameter of the cylindrical domain is 5d max where the d max is the maximum diameter of the rotor blades the pjp is located in the axis center of the cylinder domain as shown in fig 7 the computational domain is composed of three parts which are the rotor domain the stator domain and the external domain and the rotor domain is rotating domain the stator domain and the external domain are stationary domain the interfaces between those domains are used to exchange flow information firstly the multi reference frame mrf method is used for steady simulation to save costs and accelerate convergence then the sliding grid method is applied for unsteady simulation lastly the vof method is used for cavitation performance of the pjp the grid structure determines the calculation result accuracy and convergence speed the good mesh not only improves the accuracy of the results but also speeds up the convergence the structured grid based on the block grid generation technology has the advantages of high generation quality and low memory consumption and the structured grid can generate high quality mesh around the object surface which is beneficial for the boundary layer flow fig 10 shows the longitudinal section view of the pjp mesh the grids of the rotating domain and the stator domain are denser than other flow flied fig 8 shows the detailed full structure grid of the pjp an axial hc block type mesh and a circumferential o block mesh type grid are generated around the outer wall of the duct meanwhile the o block mesh type grids are generated around the rotor blades and stator blades surface fig 9 shows the detailed meshing diagram of the duct and rotor the meshes in the region of rotor tip are refined to get more accurate results and the meshes of the tip clearance are refined with double layers o topological mesh in the radial direction the node space distribution of the wall boundary layer and tip clearance domain which can be control appropriately by employing the structured mesh the numbers of grids in the whole domain are 1 09 107 including 6 17 106 rotor domain grids and 2 93 106 stator domain grids when δ 0 5 mm 3 3 boundary conditions the boundary conditions include 1 inlet velocity inlet set in 4d max upstream of the pjp u 15 72 m s 2 outlet pressure outlet with operating pressure 0 pa set in 8d max downstream of the pjp without cavitation conditions different cavitation numbers are achieved by adjusting the outlet pressure in this study 3 no slip wall the no slip wall conditions are imposed at rotor blades stator blades hub and duct 4 free slip wall the free slip wall is imposed at side surface of the cylindrical domain two methods can be used to simulate the oblique flow one is to adjust angle of the pjp model another one is to change coming flow velocity component wang et al 2017 in this paper the second method was adopted which can save a lot of workload fig 11 showed the velocity component of coming flow the oblique flow condition is achieved by varying the angle of attack in the horizontal plane x z where the u represents the inflow velocity β is the oblique angle v z represents the axial velocity component and v t is the tangential velocity component table 3 shows the calculation working conditions of pjp with different tip clearances in oblique flow the simulation calculation is carried out under the same advance ratio j 1 18 and the same rotational speed 3200 rpm in order to compare the hydrodynamic performance of the pjp with different tip clearances in oblique flow the performance of three tip clearances δ 0 5 mm δ 1 mm δ 2 mm and different oblique flow angles β 0 10 20 30 are analyzed without cavitation the hydrodynamic performance of the pjp in different cavitation number σ 1 4721 2 9551 4 4394 5 921 is also analyzed at the same time the difference in hydrodynamic performance of pjp with or without cavitation is calculated the denotes the with non cavitation conditions in the table 3 3 4 grid independence validation in order to discuss grid independence some non dimensional physical quantities are defined as shown in table 4 where the t s is stator blades and duct thrust the q s is the stator blades and duct torque and the q r is the rotor blades torque the t r denotes the rotor thrust n denotes the rotor speed d is the diameter of the pjp ρ is the fluid density u is the inlet velocity grid independence validation is important to the numerical calculation of pjp excessive number of grids can cause loss of computational cost too small number of grids will affect calculation accuracy in this paper it verifies grid independence by reducing the height size of the first layer of the wall the first layer mesh heights are 0 025 0 05 mm and 0 1 mm the grid independence has been studied at different advance ratio j fig 12 shows the variation of the stator thrust coefficient k ts stator torque coefficient k qs rotor torque coefficient k qr at different first boundary layer heights when the tip clearance is 0 5 mm fig 13 shows the variation at different first boundary layer heights when the tip clearance is 1 mm fig 14 shows the variation at different first boundary layer heights when the tip clearance is 2 mm when the tip clearance is 0 5 mm the minimum difference of the δ k q s δ k q r and δ k t s are 1 095 1 179 and 1 418 and when the tip clearance is 1 mm the minimum difference of the δ k q s δ k q r and δ k t s are 1 04 1 63 and 0 56 when the tip clearance is 2 mm the minimum difference of the δ k q s δ k q r and δ k t s are 1 06 1 09 and 1 1 it can be seen that the gap between different grid is small relatively considering the calculation efficiency and calculation accuracy the height is 0 05 mm of the first layer mesh is chosen to calculate meanwhile the grid independent analysis of different numbers of grids has a great impact on the calculation results li et al 2019 performed the grid independent analysis on three different numbers of grids fine mesh 16 68millions medium mesh 7 12m coarse mesh 3 07m at three different advance ratio when δ 0 5 mm the results shown that the medium mesh and fine mesh are more close to each other and it can get a better representation of the tip leakage flow field with the fine mesh and the pjp geometric model in this study is the same as that of li et al 2019 based on his results this study only analysis two different numbers grids by using different methods than li et al 2019 the two different mesh coarse and fine meshes fine mesh 20 26m coarse mesh 10 19m are generated based on the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 the grid convergence index gci based on the theory of richardson extrapolation roache 1997 is used to report grid

of roache 1997 f s 3 is used to this study in this study the hydrodynamic performances of three different advance ratio j 1 40 1 50 and 1 60 were used for the irrelevant verification of the different grids number the calculation results are shown in table 5 as shown in table 5 the calculation results shown that the results of the two kings of the girds are similar and the gci of the coarse mesh result is within 2 which meets the calculation requirements 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis the pjp hydrodynamic parameters in oblique flow 4 1 1 the calculation results of hydrodynamic performance without cavitation fig 15 shows that the total hydrodynamic coefficients and open water efficiency of the pjp with advance ratio j 1 18 n 3200rpm u 15 72 m s table 6 and table 7 show the hydrodynamic coefficients differences at different tip clearances and different oblique flow δ 0 5 1 represents the hydrodynamic coefficients differences between δ 0 5 mm and δ 1 mm δ 1 2 is the hydrodynamic coefficients differences between δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm δ 0 10 represents the hydrodynamic coefficients differences between β 0 and β 10 δ 0 20 is the hydrodynamic coefficients differences between β 0 and β 20 as shown in fig 15 in general the open water efficiency of the pjp decreases as the oblique flow angle increases compared to the pure uniform axial flow conditions the maximum efficiency loss is 10 74 occurring at the tip clearances δ 1 mm when the oblique angle β 10 however the maximum reduction of open water efficiency is 19 17 occurring at the tip clearances δ 2 mm when the oblique angle β 20 among the three different tip clearance size the highest efficiency occurs in δ 1 mm whether in pure axial flow or oblique flow the open water efficiency will decrease when the tip clearance size increases from 1 mm to 2 mm however it will increase when the tip clearance size increases from 0 5 mm to 1 mm the maximum efficiency difference is 2 34 occurring at the oblique flow β 20 between δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm the maximum efficiency difference is 3 97 occurring at the oblique flow β 20 between δ 0 5 mm and δ 1 mm it indicates that the change of the oblique angle has a great influence on the efficiency compared to the influence of the oblique flow angle the change of the tip clearance has little effect on the efficiency at the same time the change degree of the torque coefficients at different angle and different tip clearances is relatively small which indicates that the decrease of efficiency mainly due to the decrease of the thrust coefficient in fig 15 a b it can see that the thrust coefficient k t decreases with the oblique angle increases at three tip clearances however the torque coefficient k q can increase as the oblique flow angle increases when the tip clearance from δ 0 5 mm to δ 1 mm in contrast the torque coefficient k q can decrease as the oblique flow angle increases when the tip clearances from δ 1 mm to δ 2 mm the maximum thrust coefficient difference is 9 68 occurring at the δ 0 5 mm between β 0 and β 10 however the maximum thrust coefficient difference is 19 33 when the oblique flow angle β 20 compared the change ratio of the thrust coefficient the change ratio of the torque coefficient is relatively small at different oblique angle similarly the change ratio of the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient are relatively small at different tip clearances fig 16 shows the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of rotor and stator in different tip clearances and oblique flow angle as shown in fig 16 a the rotor thrust coefficient k tr decreases as the oblique flow angle increases at different tip clearances compared with the pure axial flow the rotor thrust coefficient greatly decreases when the oblique angle from β 10 to β 20 which indicates that the oblique flow has a greater influence on the rotor thrust coefficient k tr however the change degree of the thrust coefficient k tr is relatively small as the tip clearance changes especially between δ 0 5 mm and δ 1 mm when β 10 when the angle increases to 20 the rotor coefficient difference between δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm is relatively little it shows that the difference of rotor coefficient between large tip clearance sizes are sensitive at small oblique angle but the difference of rotor coefficient between small tip clearance sizes are sensitive at large oblique angle as shown in fig 16 b the rotor torque coefficient k qr could decreases with the oblique angle increase and the change ratio is relatively larger the difference of rotor torque coefficient is relatively small between δ 0 5 mm and δ 1 mm but it is large between δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm different from the change ratio of the rotor hydrodynamic parameters the stator torque coefficient k qs increases with the increase of the oblique angle from β 0 to β 10 then it will decreases with the increase of the oblique angle from β 10 to β 20 and the change degree of the stator torque coefficient is relatively small the stator thrust coefficient k ts will have a small increase in oblique flow and it is more sensitive to the oblique flow angle at δ 1 mm compared with the result of qin et al 2019 that the pjp has a good torque performance the torque performance is broken in oblique flow in this paper as the oblique flow angle increases the difference of rotor torque and stator torque can increase it indicates that high oblique flow angle is detrimental to the torque balance of the pjp at the same time the increase of the oblique flow angle is unfavorable to the vibration of the pjp 4 1 2 the calculation results of hydrodynamic performance with cavitation it can also be found from fig 17 that the variation laws of the hydrodynamic coefficient with cavitation or non cavitation conditions between δ 0 5 mm and δ 2 mm the table 8 shows the hydrodynamic coefficient differences with cavitation or non cavitation conditions as shown in fig 17 a and the table 8 in general the open water efficiency with cavitation conditions is greater than non cavitation conditions at different tip clearances and different oblique flow angle in this study the advance ratio j 1 18 and lu et al 2017 also obtained the similar results of the variation laws of the open water efficiency which is higher in cavitation conditions than the non cavitation at small advance ratio however it could appear the phenomenon that it is lower in cavitation than non cavitation condition at the small angle 0 2 5 at δ 0 5 mm the efficiency in cavitation condition is higher than that non cavitation condition whether it is pure axial flow or oblique flow at δ 2 mm and the open water efficiency is higher when the tip clearance δ 2 mm in different oblique angle the thrust coefficient with cavitation condition is also greater than non cavitation conditions expect the small oblique angle 0 5 at δ 0 5 mm and the change trend is consistent with the change trend of the efficiency as shown in fig 17 b it can see that the torque coefficient in cavitation conditions is greater than the non cavitation conditions at the both tip clearances the difference of torque coefficient in non cavitation will increases as the angle increases at 10 2 0 when 2 mm at oblique flow angle β 10 the maximum difference of efficiency is 8 85 occurring at 2 mm in cavitation conditions however the maximum efficient reduction is 10 19 occurring at δ 0 5 mm with non cavitation conditions as shown in table 8 at the oblique angle β 10 and β 20 the efficiency reduction difference at different tip clearances is more obvious than cavitation condition but the difference of efficiency reduction is smaller at non cavitation conditions when the angle β 20 the maximum efficiency loss up to 19 23 with non cavitation and the efficiency loss up to 19 12 at cavitation conditions it proves that the high oblique flow angle reduces the efficiency of the pjp significantly the main reason is that the high oblique flow reduces the axial momentum of the pjp and it can see that the maximum reduction of thrust coefficient is up to 17 81 in cavitation conditions and it is up to 18 83 in non cavitation conditions at the same time as the torque of the pjp increases the change degree is relatively small compared to the change degree of the thrust coefficient between different oblique angle and different tip clearances 4 1 3 the calculation results of pressure coefficients in order to analyze the variation laws of the stator and rotor pressure coefficients at different radius the pressure coefficients are dimensionless according to eq 15 15 c p p p 0 0 5 ρ u 2 where the p represents the local pressure value p 0 is the far field reference pressure value ρ is the water density u represents the inlet velocity in this paper the inlet velocity u 15 72 m s in order to analyze the variation laws of pressure coefficient in different tip clearances δ 0 5 mm δ 1 mm δ 2 mm of pjp in oblique flow β 0 10 20 the rotor blade pressure coefficient of r r 0 4 and r r 0 95 are studied in fig 18 a b where the r r represents the relative radius in the wingspan direction and the x l in fig 18 is the ratio of the distance x between the pressure point and the leading edge to the chord length l and the l stands for chord length x is the length from the position of pressure point to the leading edge as shown in fig 18 a at the same tip clearances size the pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side decreases as the oblique flow angle increases at the leading edge when tip clearance δ 1 mm then the pressure coefficients transition to the edge smoothly at all the tip clearances and oblique angle at the blade edge the oblique angle has less influence on the pressure transition region and the influence is larger at the large tip clearance δ 2 mm which delayed the pressure transition with different tip clearance when β 20 the pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side is largest at the leading edge when the tip clearance δ 1 mm it shows that the fluid load of the leading edge is largest at δ 1 mm when β 20 it will provide greater thrust compared to other tip clearances which is also the optimum tip clearance size for the pjp however the pressure difference is relatively small from δ 0 5 mm to δ 2 mm it may be that the tip clearance size at δ 2 mm is larger than others and the presence of the oblique flow the gap flow fluid is relatively uniform and the pressure fluctuation is relatively small in addition the influences of the fluid flow from the oblique flow to rotor domain is smaller due to the smaller tip clearance size when δ 0 5 mm resulting in a relatively less hydrodynamic loading as shown in fig 18 b the pressure gradient at the leading edge decreases as the oblique flow angle increases when the δ 1 mm at r r 0 95 which is the same as the position at r r 0 4 it shows that the hydrodynamic load caused by the oblique flow on the blades tip r r 0 95 is similar to that at the small radius r r 0 4 of the rotor blades the difference between fig 18 a and 18 b is that the pressure difference on the pressure side and suction decreases at the leading edge when the tip clearance δ 2 mm which is mainly due to that the main flow of the rotor domain is affected by the tip clearance flow at rotor blade tip which causes the loss of mainstream flow at the three kings of tip clearance size in oblique flow the pressure distribution of the rotor blades in most other areas expects the leading edge is gentle and the transition is uniform as shown in fig 18 a b the pressure difference between pressure side and suction side is relatively small at the blade edge when the tip clearance from δ 0 5 mm to δ 2 mm fig 18 c d shows that the stator blade pressure coefficient of r r 0 4 and r r 0 95 in general it can see from fig 18 c d that the pressure gradient at the stator leading edge in oblique flow is relatively small compared to the change range of the rotor leading edge and the tip clearance has less influence on the pressure difference at the stator leading edge this is mainly due to that the stator is not disturbed by the tip clearance and oblique flow which is affected by the hub and duct wall surfaces so the pressure gradient is relatively small at the stator blade leading edge it proved the blade load at the stator leading edge is smaller than the rotor leading edge load and the fluid becomes relatively smooth when passing through the rotor domain as shown in fig 18 b d compared with the pressure side of the rotor at the blade leading edge the oblique flow angle has less influence on the stator pressure side and the pressure gradient is relatively small at different flow angle at different tip clearance size the pressure gradient varies greatly when the tip clearance δ 2 mm compared to the rotor leading edge at the position r r 0 95 4 2 analysis the pjp exciting force in oblique flow 4 2 1 the calculation results of bearing force the variation laws of the single rotor bearing force in one cycle can be used to understand the instantaneous change laws of the rotor force in order to analyze the variation laws of bearing force in different tip clearances δ 0 5 mm δ 1 mm δ 2 mm of pjp in oblique flow β 0 10 20 the simulations of pjp with advance ratio j 1 18 n 3200rpm u 15 72 m s are carried out fig 19 shows bearing force variation laws of pjp single rotor blade in different angle and different tip clearance from fig 19 a it can see that transverse force k t x has a certain phase difference in different tip clearance and the phase shifts to the right as the tip clearance increases with the same tip clearance δ 1 mm the phase cannot shift in different oblique flow angle the peak of the single rotor bearing force decreases with the oblique flow angle increases the phase difference between the peak of the transverse force at tip clearance δ 0 5 mm and the peak of the transverse force at tip clearance δ 1 mm is 72 the phase difference between the peak of the transverse force at tip clearance δ 1 mm and the peak of the transverse force at tip clearance δ 2 mm is 30 compared with the pure axial flow condition the variation range of transverse force in different tip clearance decreases in oblique flow β 20 with the same oblique angle β 20 the variation range of transverse force is minimum when the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm however the variation range of transverse force of tip clearances δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm are relatively consistent within one cycle it indicates that the tip clearance is smaller and the oblique flow has less influence on the tip clearance when δ 0 5 mm the oblique flow develops more fully in the tip clearance when δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm fig 19 b shows vertical force k t y variation laws of pjp single rotor blade in different angle and different tip clearance in general the variation laws of vertical force at different tip clearance are similar to transverse force the difference is that the phase movement direction is inconsistent and the variation range of vertical force is consistent with the transverse force at the same oblique flow angle the variation ranges of vertical force decreases as the oblique flow angle increases fig 19 c shows axial force k t z variation laws of pjp single rotor blade it can see that there is also a phase difference in different tip clearance with the same oblique angle β 20 compared with the transverse force and the vertical force the phase difference of the axial force is smaller at the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm the peak value of the axial force is the largest the peak value of the axial force is the smallest when the δ 2 mm this phenomenon indicates that the axial force provided by the blade decreases as the tip clearance increases this is mainly due to that the interference from tip vortex to the main stream is not obvious at the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm the leakage strength and range of the tip vortex become large at the tip clearance δ 2 mm which causes mainstream flow losses in the rotor domain and reduces the axial force provided by the rotor blades greatly similarly the variation ranges of axial force decreases as the oblique flow angle increases compared to transverse force and vertical forces the variation range of axial force is bigger it shows that the energy of the axial flow is subject to a certain loss due to the existence of the oblique angle which can cause the efficiency of the pjp to decrease 4 2 2 the calculation results of pulsating pressure in order to analyze the axial and radial pressure variation laws of rotor domain and stator domain with or without cavitation conditions at different tip clearances the fluctuating pressure variation laws of the some monitoring points have been analyzed when the tip clearance size δ 1 mm at different oblique flow angle by qiu et al 2019 ten pressure monitoring points p1 p10 are set up in different positions as shown in fig 20 p1 p3 are arranged on the same radial straight line of the rotor domain and the distance between two points is 15 mm p1 p4 are located in the same axial straight line of the rotor domain the distance between each other is 75 mm similarly p5 p8 is arranged on the stator domain the radial distance between every two monitoring points is 15 mm p4 p9 and p10 are arranged on the same radial straight line of the back end of the rotor and the distance between two points is 15 mm all amplitudes of fluctuating pressure are dealt with dimensionless method in the following equation 16 16 k p p ρ n 2 d 2 where p is the maximum peak of the fluctuating pressure n is the rotation speed of pjp d is the pjp diameter and ρ is the fluid density in order to calculate the cavitation performance of the pjp the pressure control is performed by the cavitation number 17 σ p out p v 0 5 ρ u 2 where p out denotes the outlet pressure p v is the saturated vapor pressure the u is the inlet velocity the pjp is analyzed in the following conditions with the cavitation number σ 4 4381 and the oblique angle β 20 in figss 21 24 fig 21 a b show the time domain and frequency domain variation laws of the radial and axial pulsating pressure monitoring points of the rotor domain at the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm as shown in fig 21 a in the radial position of the rotor domain p1 p3 points the pulsating pressure variation laws are relatively consistent whether under cavitation or non cavitation conditions and the closer to the blades tip of the rotor the greater the value of the pulsating pressure this is mainly due to the stronger exchange of fluid mass near the rotor blades tip in addition the amplitude of pulsating pressure in cavitation conditions is greater than that in non cavitation conditions in the axial position of the rotor domain p1 p4 points the peak of pulsating pressure of p4 point is much larger than p1 point however the fluctuation of the pulsating pressure at point p4 is smaller than the point p1 it means that the closer to the rotor inlet the greater the pulsating pressure affected by the oblique flow as shown in fig 21 b compared to the non cavitation conditions when δ 0 5 mm the pulsating pressure in cavitation conditions fluctuates more strongly at the blade passing frequency bpf and the duple blade frequency 2bpf in the radial position p1 p3 points the relationship of different pressure fluctuation point at the rotor inlet is p3 p2 p1 and the closer the fluid is to the root of the blade the more fully developed due to the influence of the oblique flow and duct wall at the inlet of the rotor qiu et al 2019 also learned that the closer the monitoring point is to the blade root at the rotor inlet the pressure fluctuation is greater and the closer to the blade tip the pressure fluctuation is greater which is due to the influence of the duct however it is greatly affected by the oblique flow at the rotor inlet conversely the bpf of the pulsating pressure at p4 point is larger in non cavitation conditions compared to the cavitation conditions and the axial change amplitude of the rotor frequency domain is smaller than the radial variation fig 21 c d show the time domain and the frequency domain curve of p4 p9 p10 when δ 0 5 mm it can see that the closer to the blades tip of the rotor the greater the value of the pulsating pressure in the back end of the rotor and at the same time the closer to the rotor blades tip the greater the frequency domain fluctuation with cavitation or without cavitation conditions compared with the rotor inlet the fluctuation in the frequency domain are relatively small in the back end of the rotor as shown in fig 21 d fig 22 a b shows the time domain and frequency domain variation laws of the rotor domain at the tip clearance δ 2 mm as shown in fig 22 a b the basic laws are similar to the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm with cavitation conditions or with non cavitation conditions as shown in fig 22 a in the axial position in the rotor domain the p4 point maximum of the pulsating pressure at the tip clearance δ 2 mm is less than the maximum of the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm it indicates that the larger the tip clearance the pressure fluctuation of fluid developed more stable at the outlet of rotor domain and the influence of the oblique flow at the point p4 is smaller compared with the point p4 the pulsating pressure fluctuation is less affected by the tip clearance size at the point p1 p2 and p3 which is mainly affected by the oblique flow due to the influence of the oblique flow the maximum of the pulsating pressures at the three radial monitoring points p1 p3 are relatively consistent with δ 0 5 mm and the dynamic and static interference is stronger since the p1 p3 is close to the rotor domain the influence of the tip clearance size on the radial pressure is smaller than the axial pressure as shown in fig 21 b in general the bpf at the tip clearance δ 2 mm is smaller than the bpf at the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm it indicates that the rotor channel flow changes more intense at the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm than δ 2 mm and the difference of frequency fluctuation at different radial pressure monitoring when δ 2 mm are increased compared to the δ 0 5 mm by comparing to the figs 21 c and fig 22 c it can be found that the pulsating pressure is smaller when δ 2 mm at the back end of the rotor and the change laws of rotor blades radial position when the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm is similar to that the tip clearance δ 2 mm as shown in figs 21 d and fig 22 d in general the amplitude of the fluctuation in the frequency domain when δ 2 mm is more larger compared to the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm in frequency domain the difference of the pressure fluctuations at the three monitoring points p4 p9 p10 is more obvious when δ 2 mm as shown in fig 23 a b the time domain and frequency domain variation laws of radial and axial pulsating pressure monitoring points p5 p8 in the stator domain are studied at tip clearance δ 0 5 mm when β 20 in general the time domain amplitude of the pulsating pressure in the stator time domain is smaller than the rotor domain with or without cavitation condition at δ 0 5 mm it means that the fluid changes gently passing through the duct and rotor blades at δ 0 5 mm which is mainly due to the pre rotation of the rotor blades and the stable fluid action of duct as shown in fig 23 a the maximum variation point of pulsating pressure in the stator domain radial position is the p7 point and its pulsating pressure fluctuates smoothly at δ 0 5 mm compared with the rotor domain however compared with the rotor domain the pulsation pressure fluctuation of the p5 and p6 point are reduced but it is still large which is mainly affected by the gap flow it indicates that the pulsating pressure fluctuation in the stator domain is mainly affected by the gap flow and it is less affected by the oblique flow the p8 point in the axial position change is relatively stable when δ 0 5 mm it means that the closer the p8 is to the rotor domain the smaller the pressure fluctuations it can be seen from the frequency domain curve fig 23 b that the amplitude variation of the bpf and 2bpf are smaller than that of the rotor domain for all the point similarly the frequency fluctuations of cavitation conditions are greater than the non cavitation conditions at p5 and p6 point it indicates that the fluctuation of the flow field in the stator domain is enhanced in cavitation conditions which is unfavorable for the vibration of the pjp at the radial position of the stator inlet the closer the monitoring point is to the blade tip the stronger the fluctuation of the pulsating pressure however the fluctuations become very small at the leaf root p7 point compared the rotor domain fig 24 shows that the time domain and frequency domain curves of stator domain pressure monitoring points at δ 2 mm when β 20 in fig 24 a compared to the stator domain at tip clearance δ 0 5 mm the amplitude of the monitoring point p5 p8 pulsation pressure decrease a little when δ 2 mm as shown in fig 24 b the closer the monitoring point is to the stator blade tip the greater the frequency domain fluctuation of the pulsating pressure at the stator radial position p5 p7 it is obvious that the frequency domain fluctuation of the pulsating pressure with non cavitation condition is greater than with cavitation condition which phenomenon is the opposite of the δ 0 5 mm the 2bpf is significantly reduced compared the δ 0 5 mm the same as δ 0 5 mm is that the fluctuation of the frequency domain pulsating pressure is small at the stator outlet and near the stator blade roof 4 3 analysis of cavitation flow field in oblique flow 4 3 1 the calculation results of different cavitation number and angle shi et al 2015 analyzed the variation laws of different cavitation numbers for the same type of pjp in pure axial flow conditions in his study the conclusion were that the pjp efficiency was minimum when σ 1 4721 and the change trend of pjp efficiency in different cavitation numbers is relatively small when the cavitation number was greater than 2 9551 and the cavitation phenomenon of the pjp blades can basically disappear when the cavitation number is bigger than 5 921 therefore this study selects these four representative cavitation numbers for analysis table 9 shows that the hydrodynamic parameters when the tip clearances δ 2 mm at different cavitation number σ 1 4721 2 9551 4 4394 5 921 table 10 shows that the hydrodynamic parameters at the tip clearances δ 0 5 mm when β 20 it can see from tables 9 and 10 that the thrust coefficient k t increases as the cavitation number increases and the open water efficiency η decrease as the cavitation number decrease at δ 2 mm and δ 0 5 mm however the change of the cavitation number has less effect on the torque coefficient of the pjp which shows that the thruster has a good balance and it can see that the water vapor volume fraction decreases as the cavitation number increases at the same oblique flow angle from fig 25 d f e the reason for the above fact may be that the outlet pressure can increase as the cavitation number increase the pressure of the pump jet propulsor rotor domain and stator domain will also increase which will be difficult to occur the cavitation as the pressure difference between the local pressure and the saturated vapor pressure becomes more and more larger the cavitation area of the pjp blades also decreases due to the cavitation phenomenon the part of the pjp blades can work in gaseous environment it will cause the thrust and torque provided by the rotor and the stator blades to decrease and then which will lead the efficiency of the pjp to decrease as above mentioned the open water efficiency of pjp drops a lot when the lower cavitation number σ 1 4721 in oblique flow the reduction rate of efficiency is up to 18 30 when δ 2 mm and which is up to 18 48 when δ 0 5 mm and they directly led to the table 8 results that the open water efficiency of pjp rapid decline it means that the small cavitation number is not good for the performance of the pjp at higher cavitation numbers the change degree of hydrodynamic coefficients decreases compared to the lower cavitation number σ 1 4721 and the pressure of the pjp flow field is higher than the saturated vapor pressure when the cavitation number 5 921 which led to the cavitation phenomenon of the rotor blade and stator blade have basically disappeared and in fig 25 the water vapor phase mostly occupies in the rotor blade suction side causing the most of the blades area to work in gas when 1 4721 at the same time it can be seen from fig 25 the cavitation area of the stator blades increases as the cavitation number decreases which leads the thrust provided stator blades to decrease however compared with the cavitation area of the rotor blade the change level of the stator blade cavitation area is relatively small it may be due to the effect of reverse fluid flow stabilization of the stator blade and the change level in the low pressure area of the stator blade is relatively small at different cavitation number for the different oblique flow angle it can see from the table 9 that the hydrodynamic parameters decrease as the oblique flow angle increases at the two cavitation numbers σ 5 921 and σ 4 4381 however as shown in fig 25 a b c the water vapor volume fraction decreases as the oblique flow angle increases at the same cavitation number the efficiency of the pjp is determined by the comprehensive effects of rotating speed inlet velocity cavitation performance and so on through the study of pan and lu 2016 and the effect of cavitation on the pjp efficiency is that the efficiency will increase first and then decrease compared to the influences of cavitation oblique flow angle has a greater effect on hydrodynamic performance of pjp at the advance ratio j 1 18 in this study therefore in this study only the former is used to study the variation of the different oblique flow angle as shown in fig 26 in the rotor domain the suction surface of the rotor blades appears the low pressure vortex core region and which will decrease as the oblique flow angle increases it shows that the small oblique flow angle is prone to cavitation based on the result of qiu et al 2019 the velocity momentum of rotor disk and sttaor disk can increase which will be easier to cause a low pressure area at small oblique flow angle at different oblique flow angles the pressure surface of rotor is in the high pressure area and cavitation is difficult to occur and the conclusion proves that the cavitation area is more larger at small oblique flow angles as shown in fig 25 a b c between rotor and stator due to the short distance between the rotor and stator the area is affected by the high rotational instability of the rotor domain and the reverse speed gradient of the stator therefore the cavitation characteristic of the area is different from the rotor domain the area of the low pressure increases as the oblique angle increase at the rotor tip clearance it can see from the bottom of fig 26 that the low pressure area decreases as the oblique flow angle increases as shown in figs 26 and 27 the effect of the tip clearance flow on the cavitation performance of the pjp is also significant in fig 27 due to the high speed rotation of the rotor and the relative movement between the inner wall of fuct and the rotor blades which causes part of the fluid returns from the pressure surface to the suction surface at the same time the rotor is affected by the rotor rotation and the pressure difference between the pressure surface and the suction surface and the tip clearance flow will develop in the rotor channel which causes the local low pressure at small oblique angle the tip clearance flow develops more fully which makes it easier to create a low pressure region and it indicates that the cavitation area will increases as the oblique flow angle as shown in fig 25 similarly the cavitation area of the stator blade changes little as the oblique flow angle increase as previous study mentioned due to the effect of reverse fluid flow stabilization of the stator blade the influence of the oblique flow angle on the lower pressure area of the stator blade is slight compared to traditional propellers it shows that the existence of stator blades is advantageous for hydrodynamic performance of the pjp 4 3 2 the calculation result of velocity distribution due to the existence of the oblique flow the velocity field of the pjp can change which will can affect the efficiency of the pjp the fig 28 shows the velocity distribution of the x direction cut plane at different oblique flow angles and different tip clearances with cavitation condition the oblique flow angle has the greatest effect on axial velocity the axial velocity decreases as the oblique flow angle increases including rotor outlet stator outlet and wake field however the circumferential velocity will increases as the oblique flow angle increases and the change at the rotor outlet velocity is more obvious than other areas especially in pure axial flow the circumferential velocity and radial velocity are relatively consistent while the change degree of the circumferential velocity is more prominent in oblique flow at the two different tip clearances it has less influence on the axial velocity compared to the oblique flow angle similarly rotor outlet velocity is an important basis for pjp design it can be found form fig 29 the axial velocity distribution of the rotor outlet at the same tip clearance size the axial velocity of the rotor outlet gradually decreases as the oblique flow angle increases at the same oblique flow angle the axial velocity of the rotor outlet gradually increases as the oblique flow angle increases however it can see from fig 28 that the difference of the circumferential velocity and the radial velocity are relatively small at two tip clearances size δ 0 5 mm and δ 2 mm therefore the results of fig 17 are further explained 5 conclusions in this study the variation laws of bearing force pulsating pressure and hydrodynamic parameters differences of pjp at different tip clearances δ 0 5 mm δ 1 mm δ 2 mm and different oblique flow angle 0 10 20 was studied at the same time the hydrodynamic parameter difference under different cavitation numbers σ 1 4721 2 9551 4 4394 5 921 and velocity distribution are studied the turbulence model sst β and the z g b cavitation model have been adopted the grid independence of three different tip clearances was verified the numerical simulation method has been carried out with ka4 70 duct propeller and the pump jet propulsor the numerical calculation value is in good agreement with the experimental value the numerical results revealed that 1 with non cavitation condition the open water efficiency of the pjp decreases as the oblique flow angle increases compared to the three tip clearance sizes the efficiency is the highest in oblique flow when the tip clearance δ 1 mm at the high oblique flow angle the maximum efficiency loss is up to 19 17 the change of the tip clearance has little effect on the efficiency compared to the oblique flow the maximum difference of the efficiency is just 3 97 the torque balance performance is broken in oblique flow in oblique flow the transverse force k t x of the single rotor blade has a certain phase difference in different tip clearance and the phase shifts to the right as the tip clearance increases the phase cannot shift in different oblique flow angle and the variation range of vertical force k t y decreases as the oblique flow angle increases for the axial force the variation range of axial force is bigger than the transverse force and vertical force at three tip clearances size the fluid load of the rotor blades leading edge is largest at δ 1 mm when β 20 the pressure gradient at the leading edge decreases as the oblique flow angle increases and the pressure gradient at the stator leading edge in oblique flow is relatively small than the rotor blade 2 in general the open water efficiency under cavitation conditions is greater than non cavitation conditions at small advance ratio j 1 18 in oblique flow the largest reduction rate of the efficiency is up to 19 23 occurring at β 20 with non cavitation conditions the oblique flow has a greater influence on the pressure fluctuation of the rotor inlet than the rotor outlet the bpf and 2bpf of the rotor domain decreased as the tip clearance increases the pressure fluctuation of stator domain is more affected by the cavitation than the rotor domain under cavitation conditions 3 with cavitation condition the efficiency η increase as the cavitation number decrease at the different cavitation numbers the difference of hydrodynamic parameters between different tip clearances are relatively small and the water vapor volume fraction decreases as the oblique flow angle or the tip clearance increase for the velocity distribution the axial velocity decreases as the oblique flow angle increases and the axial velocity of

21797,this work mainly analyzes the variation laws of exciting force pulsating pressure velocity distribution and hydrodynamic parameters of pjp at different tip clearances δ 0 5 mm δ 1 mm δ 2 mm and different oblique flow angle 0 10 20 in this study the turbulence model sst k ω and reynolds stokes equations ranse method have been adopted the fully structured grid and full channel model have been adopted and the grid independence of three different tip clearances was verified in this study the variation laws of exciting force pressure coefficient and the hydrodynamic coefficients differences have been studied at the different tip clearances and different oblique flow angle and the time domain data of the pulsating pressure of pjp with cavitation conditions or without cavitation conditions was presented and then which was converted to frequency domain data by fast fourier transform fft the results show that the torque balance performance of the pjp is broken in oblique flow the tip clearances have a little effect than the oblique flow angle the maximum efficiency loss is 19 17 at high oblique angle the bearing force had a certain phase difference in different tip clearance the phase shift to the right as the tip clearances increases at the small advance j 1 18 the efficiency with cavitation is greater than non cavitation condition in oblique flow in addition the velocity distribution and the water vapor phase volume fraction of rotor outlet in different oblique flow angles and different tip clearances have been investigated keywords pump jet propulsor oblique flow tip clearances unsteady hydrodynamic parameters exciting force cavitation 1 introduction pump jet propulsor pjp is a new type propulsor which has been applied to underwater vehicles torpedoes and submarines etc pjp is different from duct propeller and traditional propeller whose stator blades participate in thrust production and the mechanical arrangement contains a duct propeller with either a pre swirl or a post swirl stator amin et al 2019 therefore the pjp has the advantages of high propulsion efficiency low radiation noise and high critical speed however ships or underwater vehicles can work in oblique flow conditions inevitably the oblique flow has a great influence on the performance of the propulsor which will cause the thrust and torque curves to shift relative to the open water state wang et al 2017 the hydrodynamic performance and cavitation performance of pjp will change greatly in oblique flow conditions therefore it is important to study the hydrodynamic performance and cavitation performance of pjp to improve the pjp propulsion performance pjp is mainly used for military purposes so there are few studies about the pjp in the oblique flow meanwhile the tip clearances had a tremendous impact on the hydrodynamic performance and cavitation performance of pjp so it was imperative to investigate and study the tip clearances when designing the pjp the research of the tip clearances cavitation and tip leakage had been carried out you et al 2004 peng et al 2013 nevertheless the main research focused on the turbine and propeller the influences of the tip clearances in oblique flow had not been involved at present the researches of pjp mainly concentrate on the experiment and numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic performance and cavitation in pure axial flow conditions mccormick and eisenhuth 1963 discussed the pjp design and studied cavitation performance with an experimental approach experimental evaluation on hydrodynamic performance of the pjp was carried out by suryanaryana et al 2010a 2010b 2010c amin et al 2019 investigated the numerical and experimental on a full scale pump jet thruster in a towing tank the result showed that the stator blades created additional thrust and the variations of the hydrodynamic coefficients were much smaller than traditional propeller yu et al 2019 and sun et al 2019 used sliding mesh technique and large eddy simulation les technology to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsion and their calculation results agreed with the experimental data well efforts were made to optimize the performance of the pump jet propulsor by ivanell 2001 and das et al 2006 lv et al 2014 presented the hydrodynamic performance of a type of distributed pump jet propulsion system dpjp for underwater vehicle based on the finite volume method sang and oh 2015 investigated the hydrodynamic characteristic of a pump jet with ring rotor using an unstructured mesh technique lu et al 2016 2017 pan and lu 2016 and qin et al 2018 analyzed the different tip clearances effect on the hydrodynamic performance of pjp the impact on the velocity flow and cavitation characteristic of the pjp for the different tip clearances has been presented wang et al 2019 predicted the hydrodynamic performance of the pjp by using panel method and a tip leakage vortex model qin et al 2019 predicted the underwater noise of the pump jet propulsor by using sawtooth duct based on detached eddy simulations des method and fw h equation oblique flow is a relatively simple non uniform flow the transverse velocity or turning speed of the underwater vehicle can cause the pjp to work in oblique flow meanwhile when the underwater vehicle retreats under a certain rudder angle it is affected by the rudder blade and the underwater vehicle will work in oblique flow when the pjp works in oblique flow the thrust and torque will be affected in a certain degree and which is not good for the operability and stability of underwater vehicles however most of the research in the oblique flow of the propulsor were mainly focused on traditional propeller at present there is almost no research on the operation of pjp in oblique flow ei moctar et al 2000 studied the forces of a four blades propeller at oblique angles up to 12 deg dubbioso et al 2013 2014 analyzed the wake dynamics and propeller loads of the cnr inseam e779a propeller in oblique angles 10 50 by using overlapping grids and des model mascio et al 2014 investigated the dynamic instabilities experienced by the wake of propeller in oblique flow using des model siamak et al 2016 studied the performance of the 841 b spp propeller in oblique flow conditions and different immersion ratios by using sliding mesh technique and volume of fluid vof method martio et al 2017 studied the duct propeller virtual mass and damping coefficients in oblique flow by using urans method felli and falchi 2018 studied the wake evolution mechanisms of a isolated propeller in oblique flow by particle image velocimetry piv experimental technique sun et al 2018 guilmineau et al 2018 and hou and hu 2019 made many efforts on the performance and theory of the traditional propeller in oblique flow conditions the tip clearances size and oblique flow angle have a greater impact on the performance of the pjp the above literature reviews show the performance of pjp in pure axial flow and the influence of oblique flow on the traditional propeller performance or duct propeller in this study the effect of the oblique flow on different hydrodynamic parameters at different tip clearances size has been studied the paper is organized as follows section 1 introduces the present research of the pjp and the propeller hydrodynamics performance in oblique flow section 2 introduces the numerical methods for the pjp the simulation methodology validation and cavitation methodology validation were carried out section 3

the closure of eq 2 2 2 cavitation model in this study the z g b zwart gerber belamri cavitation model has been adopted to analyze the cavitation performance of the pjp the z g b cavitation model had been used to discuss the cavitation performance of pjp by lu et al 2016 2017 it used the e779a propeller to numerical simulation the cavitation performance at different cavitation number and the numerical results are in good with the experimental results which shows that the z g b cavitation model is suitable for studying the cavitation performance of pjp the cavitation model considers the effect of gas core density on the vaporization of gaseous water vapor in liquid phase the mass fraction form of the evaporation and condensation term could be given as 3 m f e 3 r m u c 1 α v p v r b

propellers or pumps have been proven by many articles ji et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 lu et al 2016 wang et al 2019 the three different typical turbulence model sst k ω standard k ε realizable k ε for the numerical simulation of the pjp were carried out by qin et al 2018 2019 it indicated that the errors of standard k ε and realizable k ε turbulence model are a little bigger than sst k ω turbulence model the pjp model in this paper is consistent with qin et al 2018 2019 so the sst k ω turbulence model is used for numerical simulation in this study 7 t ρ k x i ρ k u i x j γ k k x j g k y k s k t

propellers a suitable research method is very important for pump jet propulsor at present there is very little literature about the research of pump jet propulsor most of them are based on cfd methods to study and there are few experimental data of the pjp for example the shear stress transport sst k omega turbulence model together with the sliding mesh technique was used to study the pjp unsteady flow by yu et al 2019 sun et al 2019 used sliding mesh technique and large eddy simulation les technology to predict the hydrodynamic performance of the pump jet propulsion and their calculation results agreed with the experimental data well the realizable k ε turbulence model and mix plane method were adopted to study the full scale pump jet thruster by amin et al 2019 the result agreed with experimental data others such as pan et al 2016 li et al 2019 and qin et al 2019 they also used this method to analyzed the cavitation performance unsteady transient performance and noise analysis for pump jet proplsor for the simulation methodology validation the thrust and torque coefficient are dimensionless as shown in eq 8 9 8 k t i t i ρ n 2 d 4 9 k q i q i ρ n 2 d 5 where i x y z represent the cartesian coordinate components n is the propeller rotation speed d is the blade diameter ρ is the water density t i is the force and q i is the torque meanwhile the negative direction of the z axis is defined as the positive direction of the thrust coefficient values and the other axis is set the positive direction as the positive value the relative errors k t and k q were defined as morgut and nobile 2012 the equations that can be written as the 10 and 11 10 δ k t δ k t c f d δ k t e x p δ k t e x p 100 11 δ k q δ k q c f d δ k q e x p δ k q e x p 100 in this study the simulation validation is carried out with a ka4 70 duct propeller the same simulation methodology validation is carried out with a traditional duct propeller ka4 70 by qin et al 2019 and li et al 2019 the diameter of duct propeller is 200 mm and the tip clearance between blades and duct is 0 8 mm the fig 1 shows the full structure gird of the duct propeller the mesh of the hub blades root and tip clearance should be made local refinement to get more accurate results the first boundary layer height is 0 001 mm which ensure the y value of walls is less than 1 the numerical simulation of the ka4 70 propeller is carried out at different advance ratio j 0 1 0 3 0 5 the advance ratio j was defined as j u n d p where u denotes the flow velocity n is the blades rotating velocity d p is the propeller diameter and the inlet velocity is 2 57 m s in the duct propeller simulation in addition the turbulence model sst k ω has been adopted in this study the numerical simulation results and the experimental data oosterveld 1970 are shown in table 1 it can be seen from table 1 that the thrust errors k t is at most 1 83 at j 0 5 the torque errors k q is at most 1 62 it can be seen from table 1 that the simulation results are in good agreement with the experimental results in order to further improve the accuracy of numerical simulation method which used the pump jet propulsion model of liu et al 2010 to verify the pjp model have 9 rotor blades and 7 stator blades and the tip clearance between rotor blades and duct is 1 mm the diameter of pjp is 250 mm to improve the simulation accuracy of the pjp the fully structured mesh has been adopt in particular the mesh of the hub blades and tip clearance should be made local refinement to get more accurate results and the total number of mesh is 7 22 106 the computational domain is a cylinder of diameter 6d which extends 5d upstream and 8d downstream from the pjp central location as shown in fig 2 the numerical simulation data and the experimental data liu et al 2010 match very well the simulation results are slightly larger than the experimental results which may be caused by the ideal simulation conditions however the errors are all within 2 it can be seen from the above two simulation methodology validation that the simulation methodology in this study and the turbulence model sst k ω are applicable for the simulation of the pjp with different tip clearances in oblique flow 2 4 2 cavitation simulation methodology validation the validation of cavitation simulation methods is very important to improve the accuracy of cavitation analysis the cavitation simulation method in this study has been applied to most propeller the z g b cavitation model could well simulate the periodic shedding of hydrofoil cavitation ji et al 2010 and various cavitation patterns of the propeller pan and lu 2016 and shi et al 2015 have used this cavitation simulation method to study the cavitation performance of pjp in pure axial flow and feng and lu 2019 and xia et al 2016 have used this method to study the cavitation performance of traditional propeller and waterjet propulsor respectively at present there are few studies about the cavitation of pjp and there is no experimental data on pjp cavitation and as shown in fig 3 the traditional e779a propeller was used to verify the cavitation performance in this study the verification was performed in two different advance ratios j 0 71 j 0 83 and various cavitation numbers as shown in the fig 4 the simulation data were in good agreement with the experimental cavitation data francisco et al 2004 the differences of the propeller efficiency at different cavitation numbers were basically within 2 consequently it is concluded that the cavitation simulation method is reliable for the application considered in this study 3 numerical set ups 3 1 geometry model pjp mainly has two types which is front stator and rear stator in this study the rotor is in the front of the stator the pjp geometry model is shown in fig 5 which has 11 rotor blades and 9 stator blades in order to get more precise results two half ellipsoid type flow guide caps have been added in the front and rear of the propulsor model the flow between of rotor and the inner wall of the duct needs to be considered 1 mm is the design size of the tip clearance size of this type propulsor in this study the tip clearance size between the rotor blade and duct is 0 5 mm 1 mm 2 mm the parameters of pjp are shown in table 2 the maximum diameter of rotor is 250 mm and the diameter of the stator is 218 mm the origin o is located at the center of the pump jet propulsor and the positive direction of the z axis with the inflow direction in this paper the full channel pjp model has been adopted 3 2 computations domain and mesh in this study the computational domain and boundary conditions for pjp are shown in fig 6 based on the shape of the pjp the cylinder computational domain was selected extending from 4d max to 8d max in the streamwise direction the velocity inlet is located 4d max from the front face of the pjp and the pressure outlet is located 8d max from the end of the pjp the diameter of the cylindrical domain is 5d max where the d max is the maximum diameter of the rotor blades the pjp is located in the axis center of the cylinder domain as shown in fig 7 the computational domain is composed of three parts which are the rotor domain the stator domain and the external domain and the rotor domain is rotating domain the stator domain and the external domain are stationary domain the interfaces between those domains are used to exchange flow information firstly the multi reference frame mrf method is used for steady simulation to save costs and accelerate convergence then the sliding grid method is applied for unsteady simulation lastly the vof method is used for cavitation performance of the pjp the grid structure determines the calculation result accuracy and convergence speed the good mesh not only improves the accuracy of the results but also speeds up the convergence the structured grid based on the block grid generation technology has the advantages of high generation quality and low memory consumption and the structured grid can generate high quality mesh around the object surface which is beneficial for the boundary layer flow fig 10 shows the longitudinal section view of the pjp mesh the grids of the rotating domain and the stator domain are denser than other flow flied fig 8 shows the detailed full structure grid of the pjp an axial hc block type mesh and a circumferential o block mesh type grid are generated around the outer wall of the duct meanwhile the o block mesh type grids are generated around the rotor blades and stator blades surface fig 9 shows the detailed meshing diagram of the duct and rotor the meshes in the region of rotor tip are refined to get more accurate results and the meshes of the tip clearance are refined with double layers o topological mesh in the radial direction the node space distribution of the wall boundary layer and tip clearance domain which can be control appropriately by employing the structured mesh the numbers of grids in the whole domain are 1 09 107 including 6 17 106 rotor domain grids and 2 93 106 stator domain grids when δ 0 5 mm 3 3 boundary conditions the boundary conditions include 1 inlet velocity inlet set in 4d max upstream of the pjp u 15 72 m s 2 outlet pressure outlet with operating pressure 0 pa set in 8d max downstream of the pjp without cavitation conditions different cavitation numbers are achieved by adjusting the outlet pressure in this study 3 no slip wall the no slip wall conditions are imposed at rotor blades stator blades hub and duct 4 free slip wall the free slip wall is imposed at side surface of the cylindrical domain two methods can be used to simulate the oblique flow one is to adjust angle of the pjp model another one is to change coming flow velocity component wang et al 2017 in this paper the second method was adopted which can save a lot of workload fig 11 showed the velocity component of coming flow the oblique flow condition is achieved by varying the angle of attack in the horizontal plane x z where the u represents the inflow velocity β is the oblique angle v z represents the axial velocity component and v t is the tangential velocity component table 3 shows the calculation working conditions of pjp with different tip clearances in oblique flow the simulation calculation is carried out under the same advance ratio j 1 18 and the same rotational speed 3200 rpm in order to compare the hydrodynamic performance of the pjp with different tip clearances in oblique flow the performance of three tip clearances δ 0 5 mm δ 1 mm δ 2 mm and different oblique flow angles β 0 10 20 30 are analyzed without cavitation the hydrodynamic performance of the pjp in different cavitation number σ 1 4721 2 9551 4 4394 5 921 is also analyzed at the same time the difference in hydrodynamic performance of pjp with or without cavitation is calculated the denotes the with non cavitation conditions in the table 3 3 4 grid independence validation in order to discuss grid independence some non dimensional physical quantities are defined as shown in table 4 where the t s is stator blades and duct thrust the q s is the stator blades and duct torque and the q r is the rotor blades torque the t r denotes the rotor thrust n denotes the rotor speed d is the diameter of the pjp ρ is the fluid density u is the inlet velocity grid independence validation is important to the numerical calculation of pjp excessive number of grids can cause loss of computational cost too small number of grids will affect calculation accuracy in this paper it verifies grid independence by reducing the height size of the first layer of the wall the first layer mesh heights are 0 025 0 05 mm and 0 1 mm the grid independence has been studied at different advance ratio j fig 12 shows the variation of the stator thrust coefficient k ts stator torque coefficient k qs rotor torque coefficient k qr at different first boundary layer heights when the tip clearance is 0 5 mm fig 13 shows the variation at different first boundary layer heights when the tip clearance is 1 mm fig 14 shows the variation at different first boundary layer heights when the tip clearance is 2 mm when the tip clearance is 0 5 mm the minimum difference of the δ k q s δ k q r and δ k t s are 1 095 1 179 and 1 418 and when the tip clearance is 1 mm the minimum difference of the δ k q s δ k q r and δ k t s are 1 04 1 63 and 0 56 when the tip clearance is 2 mm the minimum difference of the δ k q s δ k q r and δ k t s are 1 06 1 09 and 1 1 it can be seen that the gap between different grid is small relatively considering the calculation efficiency and calculation accuracy the height is 0 05 mm of the first layer mesh is chosen to calculate meanwhile the grid independent analysis of different numbers of grids has a great impact on the calculation results li et al 2019 performed the grid independent analysis on three different numbers of grids fine mesh 16 68millions medium mesh 7 12m coarse mesh 3 07m at three different advance ratio when δ 0 5 mm the results shown that the medium mesh and fine mesh are more close to each other and it can get a better representation of the tip leakage flow field with the fine mesh and the pjp geometric model in this study is the same as that of li et al 2019 based on his results this study only analysis two different numbers grids by using different methods than li et al 2019 the two different mesh coarse and fine meshes fine mesh 20 26m coarse mesh 10 19m are generated based on the two grid assessment procedure proposed by roache 1997 the grid convergence index gci based on the theory of richardson extrapolation roache 1997 is used to report grid convergence tests of different numbers of grids a coarse grid richardson error is defined as 12 e c o a r s e r p ε 1 r p 13 ε f 2 f 1 14 r n f i n e n c o a r s e 1 d here in this study f 1 and f 2 denote the torque and thrust coefficient of stator duct and rotor for coarse and fine meshes qin et al 2019 p is the formal order of accuracy of the algorithm p 2 r is the refinement factor between the coarse and fine grid d is the dimensionality of the simulation and the gci of coarse mesh is defined as 15 g c i c o a r s e f s e c o a r s e f s 1 is a safety factor based on the recommendation of roache 1997 f s 3 is used to this study in this study the hydrodynamic performances of three different advance ratio j 1 40 1 50 and 1 60 were used for the irrelevant verification of the different grids number the calculation results are shown in table 5 as shown in table 5 the calculation results shown that the results of the two kings of the girds are similar and the gci of the coarse mesh result is within 2 which meets the calculation requirements 4 results and discussion 4 1 analysis the pjp hydrodynamic parameters in oblique flow 4 1 1 the calculation results of hydrodynamic performance without cavitation fig 15 shows that the total hydrodynamic coefficients and open water efficiency of the pjp with advance ratio j 1 18 n 3200rpm u 15 72 m s table 6 and table 7 show the hydrodynamic coefficients differences at different tip clearances and different oblique flow δ 0 5 1 represents the hydrodynamic coefficients differences between δ 0 5 mm and δ 1 mm δ 1 2 is the hydrodynamic coefficients differences between δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm δ 0 10 represents the hydrodynamic coefficients differences between β 0 and β 10 δ 0 20 is the hydrodynamic coefficients differences between β 0 and β 20 as shown in fig 15 in general the open water efficiency of the pjp decreases as the oblique flow angle increases compared to the pure uniform axial flow conditions the maximum efficiency loss is 10 74 occurring at the tip clearances δ 1 mm when the oblique angle β 10 however the maximum reduction of open water efficiency is 19 17 occurring at the tip clearances δ 2 mm when the oblique angle β 20 among the three different tip clearance size the highest efficiency occurs in δ 1 mm whether in pure axial flow or oblique flow the open water efficiency will decrease when the tip clearance size increases from 1 mm to 2 mm however it will increase when the tip clearance size increases from 0 5 mm to 1 mm the maximum efficiency difference is 2 34 occurring at the oblique flow β 20 between δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm the maximum efficiency difference is 3 97 occurring at the oblique flow β 20 between δ 0 5 mm and δ 1 mm it indicates that the change of the oblique angle has a great influence on the efficiency compared to the influence of the oblique flow angle the change of the tip clearance has little effect on the efficiency at the same time the change degree of the torque coefficients at different angle and different tip clearances is relatively small which indicates that the decrease of efficiency mainly due to the decrease of the thrust coefficient in fig 15 a b it can see that the thrust coefficient k t decreases with the oblique angle increases at three tip clearances however the torque coefficient k q can increase as the oblique flow angle increases when the tip clearance from δ 0 5 mm to δ 1 mm in contrast the torque coefficient k q can decrease as the oblique flow angle increases when the tip clearances from δ 1 mm to δ 2 mm the maximum thrust coefficient difference is 9 68 occurring at the δ 0 5 mm between β 0 and β 10 however the maximum thrust coefficient difference is 19 33 when the oblique flow angle β 20 compared the change ratio of the thrust coefficient the change ratio of the torque coefficient is relatively small at different oblique angle similarly the change ratio of the thrust coefficient and the torque coefficient are relatively small at different tip clearances fig 16 shows the thrust coefficient and torque coefficient of rotor and stator in different tip clearances and oblique flow angle as shown in fig 16 a the rotor thrust coefficient k tr decreases as the oblique flow angle increases at different tip clearances compared with the pure axial flow the rotor thrust coefficient greatly decreases when the oblique angle from β 10 to β 20 which indicates that the oblique flow has a greater influence on the rotor thrust coefficient k tr however the change degree of the thrust coefficient k tr is relatively small as the tip clearance changes especially between δ 0 5 mm and δ 1 mm when β 10 when the angle increases to 20 the rotor coefficient difference between δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm is relatively little it shows that the difference of rotor coefficient between large tip clearance sizes are sensitive at small oblique angle but the difference of rotor coefficient between small tip clearance sizes are sensitive at large oblique angle as shown in fig 16 b the rotor torque coefficient k qr could decreases with the oblique angle increase and the change ratio is relatively larger the difference of rotor torque coefficient is relatively small between δ 0 5 mm and δ 1 mm but it is large between δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm different from the change ratio of the rotor hydrodynamic parameters the stator torque coefficient k qs increases with the increase of the oblique angle from β 0 to β 10 then it will decreases with the increase of the oblique angle from β 10 to β 20 and the change degree of the stator torque coefficient is relatively small the stator thrust coefficient k ts will have a small increase in oblique flow and it is more sensitive to the oblique flow angle at δ 1 mm compared with the result of qin et al 2019 that the pjp has a good torque performance the torque performance is broken in oblique flow in this paper as the oblique flow angle increases the difference of rotor torque and stator torque can increase it indicates that high oblique flow angle is detrimental to the torque balance of the pjp at the same time the increase of the oblique flow angle is unfavorable to the vibration of the pjp 4 1 2 the calculation results of hydrodynamic performance with cavitation it can also be found from fig 17 that the variation laws of the hydrodynamic coefficient with cavitation or non cavitation conditions between δ 0 5 mm and δ 2 mm the table 8 shows the hydrodynamic coefficient differences with cavitation or non cavitation conditions as shown in fig 17 a and the table 8 in general the open water efficiency with cavitation conditions is greater than non cavitation conditions at different tip clearances and different oblique flow angle in this study the advance ratio j 1 18 and lu et al 2017 also obtained the similar results of the variation laws of the open water efficiency which is higher in cavitation conditions than the non cavitation at small advance ratio however it could appear the phenomenon that it is lower in cavitation than non cavitation condition at the small angle 0 2 5 at δ 0 5 mm the efficiency in cavitation condition is higher than that non cavitation condition whether it is pure axial flow or oblique flow at δ 2 mm and the open water efficiency is higher when the tip clearance δ 2 mm in different oblique angle the thrust coefficient with cavitation condition is also greater than non cavitation conditions expect the small oblique angle 0 5 at δ 0 5 mm and the change trend is consistent with the change trend of the efficiency as shown in fig 17 b it can see that the torque coefficient in cavitation conditions is greater than the non cavitation conditions at the both tip clearances the difference of torque coefficient in non cavitation will increases as the angle increases at 10 2 0 when 2 mm at oblique flow angle β 10 the maximum difference of efficiency is 8 85 occurring at 2 mm in cavitation conditions however the maximum efficient reduction is 10 19 occurring at δ 0 5 mm with non cavitation conditions as shown in table 8 at the oblique angle β 10 and β 20 the efficiency reduction difference at different tip clearances is more obvious than cavitation condition but the difference of efficiency reduction is smaller at non cavitation conditions when the angle β 20 the maximum efficiency loss up to 19 23 with non cavitation and the efficiency loss up to 19 12 at cavitation conditions it proves that the high oblique flow angle reduces the efficiency of the pjp significantly the main reason is that the high oblique flow reduces the axial momentum of the pjp and it can see that the maximum reduction of thrust coefficient is up to 17 81 in cavitation conditions and it is up to 18 83 in non cavitation conditions at the same time as the torque of the pjp increases the change degree is relatively small compared to the change degree of the thrust coefficient between different oblique angle and different tip clearances 4 1 3 the calculation results of pressure coefficients in order to analyze the variation laws of the stator and rotor pressure coefficients at different radius the pressure coefficients are dimensionless according to eq 15 15 c p p p 0 0 5 ρ u 2 where the p represents the local pressure value p 0 is the far field reference pressure value ρ is the water density u represents the inlet velocity in this paper the inlet velocity u 15 72 m s in order to analyze the variation laws of pressure coefficient in different tip clearances δ 0 5 mm δ 1 mm δ 2 mm of pjp in oblique flow β 0 10 20 the rotor blade pressure coefficient of r r 0 4 and r r 0 95 are studied in fig 18 a b where the r r represents the relative radius in the wingspan direction and the x l in fig 18 is the ratio of the distance x between the pressure point and the leading edge to the chord length l and the l stands for chord length x is the length from the position of pressure point to the leading edge as shown in fig 18 a at the same tip clearances size the pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side decreases as the oblique flow angle increases at the leading edge when tip clearance δ 1 mm then the pressure coefficients transition to the edge smoothly at all the tip clearances and oblique angle at the blade edge the oblique angle has less influence on the pressure transition region and the influence is larger at the large tip clearance δ 2 mm which delayed the pressure transition with different tip clearance when β 20 the pressure difference between the pressure side and the suction side is largest at the leading edge when the tip clearance δ 1 mm it shows that the fluid load of the leading edge is largest at δ 1 mm when β 20 it will provide greater thrust compared to other tip clearances which is also the optimum tip clearance size for the pjp however the pressure difference is relatively small from δ 0 5 mm to δ 2 mm it may be that the tip clearance size at δ 2 mm is larger than others and the presence of the oblique flow the gap flow fluid is relatively uniform and the pressure fluctuation is relatively small in addition the influences of the fluid flow from the oblique flow to rotor domain is smaller due to the smaller tip clearance size when δ 0 5 mm resulting in a relatively less hydrodynamic loading as shown in fig 18 b the pressure gradient at the leading edge decreases as the oblique flow angle increases when the δ 1 mm at r r 0 95 which is the same as the position at r r 0 4 it shows that the hydrodynamic load caused by the oblique flow on the blades tip r r 0 95 is similar to that at the small radius r r 0 4 of the rotor blades the difference between fig 18 a and 18 b is that the pressure difference on the pressure side and suction decreases at the leading edge when the tip clearance δ 2 mm which is mainly due to that the main flow of the rotor domain is affected by the tip clearance flow at rotor blade tip which causes the loss of mainstream flow at the three kings of tip clearance size in oblique flow the pressure distribution of the rotor blades in most other areas expects the leading edge is gentle and the transition is uniform as shown in fig 18 a b the pressure difference between pressure side and suction side is relatively small at the blade edge when the tip clearance from δ 0 5 mm to δ 2 mm fig 18 c d shows that the stator blade pressure coefficient of r r 0 4 and r r 0 95 in general it can see from fig 18 c d that the pressure gradient at the stator leading edge in oblique flow is relatively small compared to the change range of the rotor leading edge and the tip clearance has less influence on the pressure difference at the stator leading edge this is mainly due to that the stator is not disturbed by the tip clearance and oblique flow which is affected by the hub and duct wall surfaces so the pressure gradient is relatively small at the stator blade leading edge it proved the blade load at the stator leading edge is smaller than the rotor leading edge load and the fluid becomes relatively smooth when passing through the rotor domain as shown in fig 18 b d compared with the pressure side of the rotor at the blade leading edge the oblique flow angle has less influence on the stator pressure side and the pressure gradient is relatively small at different flow angle at different tip clearance size the pressure gradient varies greatly when the tip clearance δ 2 mm compared to the rotor leading edge at the position r r 0 95 4 2 analysis the pjp exciting force in oblique flow 4 2 1 the calculation results of bearing force the variation laws of the single rotor bearing force in one cycle can be used to understand the instantaneous change laws of the rotor force in order to analyze the variation laws of bearing force in different tip clearances δ 0 5 mm δ 1 mm δ 2 mm of pjp in oblique flow β 0 10 20 the simulations of pjp with advance ratio j 1 18 n 3200rpm u 15 72 m s are carried out fig 19 shows bearing force variation laws of pjp single rotor blade in different angle and different tip clearance from fig 19 a it can see that transverse force k t x has a certain phase difference in different tip clearance and the phase shifts to the right as the tip clearance increases with the same tip clearance δ 1 mm the phase cannot shift in different oblique flow angle the peak of the single rotor bearing force decreases with the oblique flow angle increases the phase difference between the peak of the transverse force at tip clearance δ 0 5 mm and the peak of the transverse force at tip clearance δ 1 mm is 72 the phase difference between the peak of the transverse force at tip clearance δ 1 mm and the peak of the transverse force at tip clearance δ 2 mm is 30 compared with the pure axial flow condition the variation range of transverse force in different tip clearance decreases in oblique flow β 20 with the same oblique angle β 20 the variation range of transverse force is minimum when the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm however the variation range of transverse force of tip clearances δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm are relatively consistent within one cycle it indicates that the tip clearance is smaller and the oblique flow has less influence on the tip clearance when δ 0 5 mm the oblique flow develops more fully in the tip clearance when δ 1 mm and δ 2 mm fig 19 b shows vertical force k t y variation laws of pjp single rotor blade in different angle and different tip clearance in general the variation laws of vertical force at different tip clearance are similar to transverse force the difference is that the phase movement direction is inconsistent and the variation range of vertical force is consistent with the transverse force at the same oblique flow angle the variation ranges of vertical force decreases as the oblique flow angle increases fig 19 c shows axial force k t z variation laws of pjp single rotor blade it can see that there is also a phase difference in different tip clearance with the same oblique angle β 20 compared with the transverse force and the vertical force the phase difference of the axial force is smaller at the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm the peak value of the axial force is the largest the peak value of the axial force is the smallest when the δ 2 mm this phenomenon indicates that the axial force provided by the blade decreases as the tip clearance increases this is mainly due to that the interference from tip vortex to the main stream is not obvious at the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm the leakage strength and range of the tip vortex become large at the tip clearance δ 2 mm which causes mainstream flow losses in the rotor domain and reduces the axial force provided by the rotor blades greatly similarly the variation ranges of axial force decreases as the oblique flow angle increases compared to transverse force and vertical forces the variation range of axial force is bigger it shows that the energy of the axial flow is subject to a certain loss due to the existence of the oblique angle which can cause the efficiency of the pjp to decrease 4 2 2 the calculation results of pulsating pressure in order to analyze the axial and radial pressure variation laws of rotor domain and stator domain with or without cavitation conditions at different tip clearances the fluctuating pressure variation laws of the some monitoring points have been analyzed when the tip clearance size δ 1 mm at different oblique flow angle by qiu et al 2019 ten pressure monitoring points p1 p10 are set up in different positions as shown in fig 20 p1 p3 are arranged on the same radial straight line of the rotor domain and the distance between two points is 15 mm p1 p4 are located in the same axial straight line of the rotor domain the distance between each other is 75 mm similarly p5 p8 is arranged on the stator domain the radial distance between every two monitoring points is 15 mm p4 p9 and p10 are arranged on the same radial straight line of the back end of the rotor and the distance between two points is 15 mm all amplitudes of fluctuating pressure are dealt with dimensionless method in the following equation 16 16 k p p ρ n 2 d 2 where p is the maximum peak of the fluctuating pressure n is the rotation speed of pjp d is the pjp diameter and ρ is the fluid density in order to calculate the cavitation performance of the pjp the pressure control is performed by the cavitation number 17 σ p out p v 0 5 ρ u 2 where p out denotes the outlet pressure p v is the saturated vapor pressure the u is the inlet velocity the pjp is analyzed in the following conditions with the cavitation number σ 4 4381 and the oblique angle β 20 in figss 21 24 fig 21 a b show the time domain and frequency domain variation laws of the radial and axial pulsating pressure monitoring points of the rotor domain at the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm as shown in fig 21 a in the radial position of the rotor domain p1 p3 points the pulsating pressure variation laws are relatively consistent whether under cavitation or non cavitation conditions and the closer to the blades tip of the rotor the greater the value of the pulsating pressure this is mainly due to the stronger exchange of fluid mass near the rotor blades tip in addition the amplitude of pulsating pressure in cavitation conditions is greater than that in non cavitation conditions in the axial position of the rotor domain p1 p4 points the peak of pulsating pressure of p4 point is much larger than p1 point however the fluctuation of the pulsating pressure at point p4 is smaller than the point p1 it means that the closer to the rotor inlet the greater the pulsating pressure affected by the oblique flow as shown in fig 21 b compared to the non cavitation conditions when δ 0 5 mm the pulsating pressure in cavitation conditions fluctuates more strongly at the blade passing frequency bpf and the duple blade frequency 2bpf in the radial position p1 p3 points the relationship of different pressure fluctuation point at the rotor inlet is p3 p2 p1 and the closer the fluid is to the root of the blade the more fully developed due to the influence of the oblique flow and duct wall at the inlet of the rotor qiu et al 2019 also learned that the closer the monitoring point is to the blade root at the rotor inlet the pressure fluctuation is greater and the closer to the blade tip the pressure fluctuation is greater which is due to the influence of the duct however it is greatly affected by the oblique flow at the rotor inlet conversely the bpf of the pulsating pressure at p4 point is larger in non cavitation conditions compared to the cavitation conditions and the axial change amplitude of the rotor frequency domain is smaller than the radial variation fig 21 c d show the time domain and the frequency domain curve of p4 p9 p10 when δ 0 5 mm it can see that the closer to the blades tip of the rotor the greater the value of the pulsating pressure in the back end of the rotor and at the same time the closer to the rotor blades tip the greater the frequency domain fluctuation with cavitation or without cavitation conditions compared with the rotor inlet the fluctuation in the frequency domain are relatively small in the back end of the rotor as shown in fig 21 d fig 22 a b shows the time domain and frequency domain variation laws of the rotor domain at the tip clearance δ 2 mm as shown in fig 22 a b the basic laws are similar to the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm with cavitation conditions or with non cavitation conditions as shown in fig 22 a in the axial position in the rotor domain the p4 point maximum of the pulsating pressure at the tip clearance δ 2 mm is less than the maximum of the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm it indicates that the larger the tip clearance the pressure fluctuation of fluid developed more stable at the outlet of rotor domain and the influence of the oblique flow at the point p4 is smaller compared with the point p4 the pulsating pressure fluctuation is less affected by the tip clearance size at the point p1 p2 and p3 which is mainly affected by the oblique flow due to the influence of the oblique flow the maximum of the pulsating pressures at the three radial monitoring points p1 p3 are relatively consistent with δ 0 5 mm and the dynamic and static interference is stronger since the p1 p3 is close to the rotor domain the influence of the tip clearance size on the radial pressure is smaller than the axial pressure as shown in fig 21 b in general the bpf at the tip clearance δ 2 mm is smaller than the bpf at the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm it indicates that the rotor channel flow changes more intense at the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm than δ 2 mm and the difference of frequency fluctuation at different radial pressure monitoring when δ 2 mm are increased compared to the δ 0 5 mm by comparing to the figs 21 c and fig 22 c it can be found that the pulsating pressure is smaller when δ 2 mm at the back end of the rotor and the change laws of rotor blades radial position when the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm is similar to that the tip clearance δ 2 mm as shown in figs 21 d and fig 22 d in general the amplitude of the fluctuation in the frequency domain when δ 2 mm is more larger compared to the tip clearance δ 0 5 mm in frequency domain the difference of the pressure fluctuations at the three monitoring points p4 p9 p10 is more obvious when δ 2 mm as shown in fig 23 a b the time domain and frequency domain variation laws of radial and axial pulsating pressure monitoring points p5 p8 in the stator domain are studied at tip clearance δ 0 5 mm when β 20 in general the time domain amplitude of the pulsating pressure in the stator time domain is smaller than the rotor domain with or without cavitation condition at δ 0 5 mm it means that the fluid changes gently passing through the duct and rotor blades at δ 0 5 mm which is mainly due to the pre rotation of the rotor blades and the stable fluid action of duct as shown in fig 23 a the maximum variation point of pulsating pressure in the stator domain radial position is the p7 point and its pulsating pressure fluctuates smoothly at δ 0 5 mm compared with the rotor domain however compared with the rotor domain the pulsation pressure fluctuation of the p5 and p6 point are reduced but it is still large which is mainly affected by the gap flow it indicates that the pulsating pressure fluctuation in the stator domain is mainly affected by the gap flow and it is less affected by the oblique flow the p8 point in the axial position change is relatively stable when δ 0 5 mm it means that the closer the p8 is to the rotor domain the smaller the pressure fluctuations it can be seen from the frequency domain curve fig 23 b that the amplitude variation of the bpf and 2bpf are smaller than that of the rotor domain for all the point similarly the frequency fluctuations of cavitation conditions are greater than the non cavitation conditions at p5 and p6 point it indicates that the fluctuation of the flow field in the stator domain is enhanced in cavitation conditions which is unfavorable for the vibration of the pjp at the radial position of the stator inlet the closer the monitoring point is to the blade tip the stronger the fluctuation of the pulsating pressure however the fluctuations become very small at the leaf root p7 point compared the rotor domain fig 24 shows that the time domain and frequency domain curves of stator domain pressure monitoring points at δ 2 mm when β 20 in fig 24 a compared to the stator domain at tip clearance δ 0 5 mm the amplitude of the monitoring point p5 p8 pulsation pressure decrease a little when δ 2 mm as shown in fig 24 b the closer the monitoring point is to the stator blade tip the greater the frequency domain fluctuation of the pulsating pressure at the stator radial position p5 p7 it is obvious that the frequency domain fluctuation of the pulsating pressure with non cavitation condition is greater than with cavitation condition which phenomenon is the opposite of the δ 0 5 mm the 2bpf is significantly reduced compared the δ 0 5 mm the same as δ 0 5 mm is that the fluctuation of the frequency domain pulsating pressure is small at the stator outlet and near the stator blade roof 4 3 analysis of cavitation flow field in oblique flow 4 3 1 the calculation results of different cavitation number and angle shi et al 2015 analyzed the variation laws of different cavitation numbers for the same type of pjp in pure axial flow conditions in his study the conclusion were that the pjp efficiency was minimum when σ 1 4721 and the change trend of pjp efficiency in different cavitation numbers is relatively small when the cavitation number was greater than 2 9551 and the cavitation phenomenon of the pjp blades can basically disappear when the cavitation number is bigger than 5 921 therefore this study selects these four representative cavitation numbers for analysis table 9 shows that the hydrodynamic parameters when the tip clearances δ 2 mm at different cavitation number σ 1 4721 2 9551 4 4394 5 921 table 10 shows that the hydrodynamic parameters at the tip clearances δ 0 5 mm when β 20 it can see from tables 9 and 10 that the thrust coefficient k t increases as the cavitation number increases and the open water efficiency η decrease as the cavitation number decrease at δ 2 mm and δ 0 5 mm however the change of the cavitation number has less effect on the torque coefficient of the pjp which shows that the thruster has a good balance and it can see that the water vapor volume fraction decreases as the cavitation number increases at the same oblique flow angle from fig 25 d f e the reason for the above fact may be that the outlet pressure can increase as the cavitation number increase the pressure of the pump jet propulsor rotor domain and stator domain will also increase which will be difficult to occur the cavitation as the pressure difference between the local pressure and the saturated vapor pressure becomes more and more larger the cavitation area of the pjp blades also decreases due to the cavitation phenomenon the part of the pjp blades can work in gaseous environment it will cause the thrust and torque provided by the rotor and the stator blades to decrease and then which will lead the efficiency of the pjp to decrease as above mentioned the open water efficiency of pjp drops a lot when the lower cavitation number σ 1 4721 in oblique flow the reduction rate of efficiency is up to 18 30 when δ 2 mm and which is up to 18 48 when δ 0 5 mm and they directly led to the table 8 results that the open water efficiency of pjp rapid decline it means that the small cavitation number is not good for the performance of the pjp at higher cavitation numbers the change degree of hydrodynamic coefficients decreases compared to the lower cavitation number σ 1 4721 and the pressure of the pjp flow field is higher than the saturated vapor pressure when the cavitation number 5 921 which led to the cavitation phenomenon of the rotor blade and stator blade have basically disappeared and in fig 25 the water vapor phase mostly occupies in the rotor blade suction side causing the most of the blades area to work in gas when 1 4721 at the same time it can be seen from fig 25 the cavitation area of the stator blades increases as the cavitation number decreases which leads the thrust provided stator blades to decrease however compared with the cavitation area of the rotor blade the change level of the stator blade cavitation area is relatively small it may be due to the effect of reverse fluid flow stabilization of the stator blade and the change level in the low pressure area of the stator blade is relatively small at different cavitation number for the different oblique flow angle it can see from the table 9 that the hydrodynamic parameters decrease as the oblique flow angle increases at the two cavitation numbers σ 5 921 and σ 4 4381 however as shown in fig 25 a b c the water vapor volume fraction decreases as the oblique flow angle increases at the same cavitation number the efficiency of the pjp is determined by the comprehensive effects of rotating speed inlet velocity cavitation performance and so on through the study of pan and lu 2016 and the effect of cavitation on the pjp efficiency is that the efficiency will increase first and then decrease compared to the influences of cavitation oblique flow angle has a greater effect on hydrodynamic performance of pjp at the advance ratio j 1 18 in this study therefore in this study only the former is used to study the variation of the different oblique flow angle as shown in fig 26 in the rotor domain the suction surface of the rotor blades appears the low pressure vortex core region and which will decrease as the oblique flow angle increases it shows that the small oblique flow angle is prone to cavitation based on the result of qiu et al 2019 the velocity momentum of rotor disk and sttaor disk can increase which will be easier to cause a low pressure area at small oblique flow angle at different oblique flow angles the pressure surface of rotor is in the high pressure area and cavitation is difficult to occur and the conclusion proves that the cavitation area is more larger at small oblique flow angles as shown in fig 25 a b c between rotor and stator due to the short distance between the rotor and stator the area is affected by the high rotational instability of the rotor domain and the reverse speed gradient of the stator therefore the cavitation characteristic of the area is different from the rotor domain the area of the low pressure increases as the oblique angle increase at the rotor tip clearance it can see from the bottom of fig 26 that the low pressure area decreases as the oblique flow angle increases as shown in figs 26 and 27 the effect of the tip clearance flow on the cavitation performance of the pjp is also significant in fig 27 due to the high speed rotation of the rotor and the relative movement between the inner wall of fuct and the rotor blades which causes part of the fluid returns from the pressure surface to the suction surface at the same time the rotor is affected by the rotor rotation and the pressure difference between the pressure surface and the suction surface and the tip clearance flow will develop in the rotor channel which causes the local low pressure at small oblique angle the tip clearance flow develops more fully which makes it easier to create a low pressure region and it indicates that the cavitation area will increases as the oblique flow angle as shown in fig 25 similarly the cavitation area of the stator blade changes little as the oblique flow angle increase as previous study mentioned due to the effect of reverse fluid flow stabilization of the stator blade the influence of the oblique flow angle on the lower pressure area of the stator blade is slight compared to traditional propellers it shows that the existence of stator blades is advantageous for hydrodynamic performance of the pjp 4 3 2 the calculation result of velocity distribution due to the existence of the oblique flow the velocity field of the pjp can change which will can affect the efficiency of the pjp the fig 28 shows the velocity distribution of the x direction cut plane at different oblique flow angles and different tip clearances with cavitation condition the oblique flow angle has the greatest effect on axial velocity the axial velocity decreases as the oblique flow angle increases including rotor outlet stator outlet and wake field however the circumferential velocity will increases as the oblique flow angle increases and the change at the rotor outlet velocity is more obvious than other areas especially in pure axial flow the circumferential velocity and radial velocity are relatively consistent while the change degree of the circumferential velocity is more prominent in oblique flow at the two different tip clearances it has less influence on the axial velocity compared to the oblique flow angle similarly rotor outlet velocity is an important basis for pjp design it can be found form fig 29 the axial velocity distribution of the rotor outlet at the same tip clearance size the axial velocity of the rotor outlet gradually decreases as the oblique flow angle increases at the same oblique flow angle the axial velocity of the rotor outlet gradually increases as the oblique flow angle increases however it can see from fig 28 that the difference of the circumferential velocity and the radial velocity are relatively small at two tip clearances size δ 0 5 mm and δ 2 mm therefore the results of fig 17 are further explained 5 conclusions in this study the variation laws of bearing force pulsating pressure and hydrodynamic parameters differences of pjp at different tip clearances δ 0 5 mm δ 1 mm δ 2 mm and different oblique flow angle 0 10 20 was studied at the same time the hydrodynamic parameter difference under different cavitation numbers σ 1 4721 2 9551 4 4394 5 921 and velocity distribution are studied the turbulence model sst β and the z g b cavitation model have been adopted the grid independence of three different tip clearances was verified the numerical simulation method has been carried out with ka4 70 duct propeller and the pump jet propulsor the numerical calculation value is in good agreement with the experimental value the numerical results revealed that 1 with non cavitation condition the open water efficiency of the pjp decreases as the oblique flow angle increases compared to the three tip clearance sizes the efficiency is the highest in oblique flow when the tip clearance δ 1 mm at the high oblique flow angle the maximum efficiency loss is up to 19 17 the change of the tip clearance has little effect on the efficiency compared to the oblique flow the maximum difference of the efficiency is just 3 97 the torque balance performance is broken in oblique flow in oblique flow the transverse force k t x of the single rotor blade has a certain phase difference in different tip clearance and the phase shifts to the right as the tip clearance increases the phase cannot shift in different oblique flow angle and the variation range of vertical force k t y decreases as the oblique flow angle increases for the axial force the variation range of axial force is bigger than the transverse force and vertical force at three tip clearances size the fluid load of the rotor blades leading edge is largest at δ 1 mm when β 20 the pressure gradient at the leading edge decreases as the oblique flow angle increases and the pressure gradient at the stator leading edge in oblique flow is relatively small than the rotor blade 2 in general the open water efficiency under cavitation conditions is greater than non cavitation conditions at small advance ratio j 1 18 in oblique flow the largest reduction rate of the efficiency is up to 19 23 occurring at β 20 with non cavitation conditions the oblique flow has a greater influence on the pressure fluctuation of the rotor inlet than the rotor outlet the bpf and 2bpf of the rotor domain decreased as the tip clearance increases the pressure fluctuation of stator domain is more affected by the cavitation than the rotor domain under cavitation conditions 3 with cavitation condition the efficiency η increase as the cavitation number decrease at the different cavitation numbers the difference of hydrodynamic parameters between different tip clearances are relatively small and the water vapor volume fraction decreases as the oblique flow angle or the tip clearance increase for the velocity distribution the axial velocity decreases as the oblique flow angle increases and the axial velocity of

21798,since severe damage to the floating offshore structures due to the deterioration of their structural stability may lead to major disasters it is necessary to detect mooring line damage at an early stage however most of the existing damage detection approaches of mooring line have difficulties to provide constant monitoring or to detect local damages to line this study aims to develop a detection approach of a damaged mooring line in tension leg platform tlp based on deep neural networks dnn simulation data with charm3d was used for training and testing the dnn in the study because it is impractical to obtain actual data by intentionally damaging mooring lines that are in operation the accuracies of the dnn model were significantly high 94 6 99 3 with noise level differing from 0 to 20 the quite low false negative fn errors of 0 7 5 4 for noise levels of 1 20 shows the potential of dnn based structural health monitoring system to identify a damaged mooring line in tlp the results of the study indicate that dnn based damage detection approach with floater responses is applicable for even a local damage and thus can prevent further damage or accident by early stage detection keywords damage detection mooring line tension leg platform tendon deep neural networks 1 introduction in floating offshore structures there are several mooring lines steel pipes or chains wire ropes etc that connect the floater to the seabed and help maintain its position at sea mooring lines suffer physical damage due to repetitive environmental loads such as wave or wind and marine growth during their life cycles which reduces their structural stability since such structures are mainly for oil or natural gas exploitation severe damage to the structures due to the deterioration of their structural stability may lead to major disasters furthermore the damage of one mooring line can accelerate the damage to others it is necessary to detect mooring line damage at an early stage damage to mooring lines is detected mainly by visual inspection however it is difficult to identify the damage when image resolution is relatively low or image acquisition is impossible due to the underwater environment in addition there is a limit to continuous damage detection because real time operation of remotely operated underwater vehicle rov is economically impractical to overcome these limitations damage detection by mooring line monitoring methods based on sensors have been proposed in recent years in those methods damages are detected by analyzing the responses obtained through mooring line monitoring however when sensors are attached for mooring line monitoring the results may include noises from the underwater environment in addition in deep waters due to the long mooring line length the number of sensors required for monitoring increases which lowers the economic efficiency of the methods damage detection by floater monitoring instead of mooring lines have also been proposed since these methods require sensors installed in the floater only the monitoring results include less environmental noise and are more economical however as the floater response does not significantly change in proportion to the mooring lines damage and exhibits a very complicated trend due to the influence of the sea environment such as waves or winds local damage to the mooring lines is difficult to detect by floater monitoring deep learning is an excellent way to find specific patterns even for complex data that is difficult to identify if deep learning is used to analyze floater responses detecting differences caused by small damage of mooring line may become possible therefore this study proposes a dnn based detection approach of a damaged mooring line through pattern analysis of floater responses among various floating offshore structures tension leg platform tlp that is widely used as a floating foundation for offshore wind turbines was focused in this study response data of a tlp floater required for dnn is replaced by simulation data because it is impractical to collect actual data from the real world by intentionally damaging mooring lines that are in operation 2 related studies although there have been several studies on the fatigue damage evaluation of mooring lines e g wong and kim 2018 li and choung 2018 martinez 2020 their damage detection methods are limited to fatigue damage moreover their methods require reliable s n curves while not enabling to specifying a damaged mooring line whatever the cause of a damage it is still challenging to detect the damage of mooring lines that has occurred in practice damage detection of mooring lines is generally carried out through inspection recent studies developed detection methods enabling constant monitoring however those methods are still problematic due to the significant measurements noise or low economic efficiency some studies suggested other detection approaches by floater monitoring in order to address these limitations 2 1 damage detection by inspection for inspection based damage detection visual inspection with rov is most commonly used visual inspection has the advantage that it is possible to visually check the damage of mooring line through image or video with high definition hd sensors or 3d cameras high resolution images can be acquired improving the efficiency of damage detection using visual inspection hall and trower 2011 nevertheless when the turbidity is high due to precipitated suspended matter or securing the field of camera view becomes difficult due to marine growth it is demanding to check the damage by visual inspection brown et al 2005 results of related studies show that the problem of high turbidity can be solved by 3d mooring line modeling e g pederson et al 2013 mcleod et al 2013 pederson et al 2013 argued that even if the image resolution is low the 3d model reflecting the current state can be reconstructed by combining the measurement results of mooring line responses together they claim that it is possible to identify mooring line damages on the surface using 3d models mcleod et al 2013 proposed a 3d point cloud image generation method for underwater structures using 3d light detection and ranging lidar these studies show the possibility of damage detection through visual inspection even in turbid waters however there is a problem that inspection itself is impossible in deep waters due to rov operational limit depth bashir et al 2017 to solve this problem several studies investigated possibilities of using mooring chain climbing robots e g dissanayake et al 2018 hernandez et al 2018 kimball et al 2018 however because these studies are only at the level of robot design and movement control the inspection performance was not verified in addition since such robot is much slower in operation it is almost impossible to inspect the entire mooring line on real time basis while its economic efficiency is much lower as possible solution damage detection of mooring line by mooring line monitoring is proposed 2 2 damage detection by mooring line monitoring with monitoring based damage detection damages of mooring line are detected by analyzing the structural responses obtained through monitoring depending on the object it can be classified into monitoring mooring line or floater after it has been theoretically demonstrated that responses such as acoustic emission ae tension and strain of mooring lines are affected by their damage bae and lee 2016 angulo et al 2017 bashir et al 2017 some studies employing mooring line monitoring have been presented ae which is a transient elastic wave generated as the energy is released by the material keshtgar and modarres 2013 is characterized by the difference in the value related to material deformation and is widely used for non destructive testing ndt of various materials angulo et al 2017 theoretically proved through finite element analysis of the dynamic model of mooring line chain that the magnitude of damage and ae amplitude are proportional their study presents the possibility of damage detection of mooring line using ae in a follow up study angulo et al 2019 through in air experiments verified that damage initiation or growth can be detected using ae rivera et al 2018 tested the validity of damage growth detection through ae analysis for chains in water tanks these studies have focused on damage detection of chain parts consisting mainly of metal materials while bashir et al 2017 argued that ae based damage detection can also be applied to nonmetallic mooring lines using polyester rope these results illustrate the possibility of damage detection with ae monitoring however there is a disadvantage that many ae sensors are required for the overall mooring line in addition the measured ae contains unforeseeable measurement noise due to complex underwater environmental conditions and therefore requires a high accuracy preprocessing technique responses such as tension and strain may also be possible for the damage detection since the tension varies greatly depending on whether damage occurs in the mooring line the damage can be detected through tension monitoring however it seems to be difficult to distinguish the failure of the tensionmeter and mooring lines damage since tensionmeter is installed by connecting each chain among the mooring line in general furthermore high cost of the tensionmeter makes it uneconomical these problems may be solved by applying a method of inducing tension with an incline instead of a tensionmeter du et al 2013 since the measured incline however is likely to contain various environmental noises this method may need to be validated experimentally although relatively difficult to monitor it is likely that the strain can be used for damage detection based on relevant studies e g rebel et al 2000 smith and williams 2003 about strain monitoring however like tensionmeter the cost required by sensors such as fiber optic strain gauges and fiber bragg gratings fbg used in these studies are too high and thus may not be easy to apply in practice the problems of measurement noise or being non economic of damage detection by mooring line monitoring can be addressed by detection by floater monitoring 2 3 damage detection by floater monitoring unlike mooring lines floater is located above the water so decreasing the measurement noise in responses as well as installation and maintenance of sensors can be done easily and economically therefore using floater monitoring for damage detection can alleviate those problems by mooring line monitoring however since floater responses are very complicated due to environmental condition such as wave and wind detection of mooring line damage by floater monitoring has been challenging some studies analyzed these complex floater responses based on artificial intelligence ai methods jamalkia et al 2016 demonstrated that damages to mooring line could be detected by identifying damage patterns in floater responses though fuzzy logic their method can detect not only damaged mooring lines but also the degree of damage slight moderate severe using pattern analysis fuzzy logic and floater responses sidarta et al 2018 claimed that the damage of mooring line can be detected by training floater responses through artificial neural networks ann those studies show that there could be patterns in floater responses depending on the damage of mooring line whose detection is possible by analyzing such patterns however those studies only consider cases of failure or damage throughout the mooring line so it may be difficult to apply them when there is a slight change in floater responses due to local damage deep neural networks dnn is one of the most effective in finding patterns even among small differences therefore this study proposes a dnn based detection approach of a mooring line with local damage through pattern analysis of floater responses 3 simulation of tlp the floating offshore structure that this study focuses on is tension leg platform tlp that is widely used as a floating foundation for offshore wind turbines in tlp tendons are used as mooring lines to connect a floater in this study simulation data was used because it is impractical to obtain actual data by intentionally damaging mooring lines that are in operation for simulation the analytical models for an undamaged case and several single damaged cases where there is only one part damaged across the entire mooring lines were created based on tlp model of yang 2009 respectively to consider the effect of offshore environment various environmental conditions were generated based on 10 year return period environmental conditions of the gulf of mexico central gom central the responses of the floater with each damaged case were simulated under environmental conditions by using the fully coupled nonlinear hull mooring riser program charm3d from texas a m university ran and kim 1997 ran et al 1999 tahar and kim 2003 yang and kim 2010 2011 kim and kim 2015 3 1 modelling of tlp for the simulation of floater responses yang s tlp model which is widely used in the studies of floating offshore structures was employed in this study the tlp model was divided into floater mooring lines tendons and risers however as floater and mooring lines were only interesting structural elements in this study risers were not considered floater of the tlp model consists of a square deck of 73 15 m wide 13 72 m high four pontoons of 8 23 m wide 7 31 m high and four circular columns with 16 46 m outer diameter refer to fig 1 in fig 1 t1 to t8 on each circular column refers each of mooring lines that is a total of eight mooring lines each of which has length of 899 16 m 2950 ft are connected to the floater in this study only cases of single damaged were considered to reflect the cases on the analytical model the candidate elements on which damage will be applied were defined for each mooring line the damaged parts of the line were classified into upper middle and lower part corresponding with types of damaged part the tlp model was created to have the eight mooring lines with candidate elements placed in one of the upper middle or lower part the damage was assumed to be the loss of the cross section 20 less than the undamaged cross section refer to table 1 for the cases of single damaged only one candidate element of damaged mooring line was reduced in its cross section in each case for example to reflect the upper part damage of the t1 mooring line on the analytical model 0 61 m 2 ft of candidate element is placed at 89 86 m 294 8 ft from sea level for every mooring line t1 to t8 and the cross section of only one candidate element in t1 mooring line is reduced refer to fig 2 a the remaining parts except the candidate element are consisted of 10 elements with the same length of 89 86 m 294 8 ft and the same method was applied to all mooring lines considering computational speed in the numerical analysis the length of the candidate element was set short to show local damage while the lengths of the other elements were long a 0 61 m 2 ft of candidate element in the model of middle and lower part damaged mooring line was placed at 359 42 m 1179 2 ft and 628 99 m 2063 6 ft from sea level for each mooring line respectively in the same manner as the upper part damaged mooring line refer to fig 2b and c likewise only the candidate element of the damaged mooring line is damaged while remaining parts except the candidate element were composed of 10 elements of the same length of 89 86 m 294 8 ft for each mooring line as since the tlp model used in this study has eight mooring lines with three single damaged cases damage of upper middle or lower part there were totally 24 different cases generated therefore together with the undamaged case a total of 25 different cases were used in simulation 3 2 environmental conditions the time series environmental data required for the floater response simulation was generated using the environmental condition of gom central referring to the findings that the average period of damage to mooring line is nine years jamalkia et al 2016 various environmental conditions were set based on the environmental condition of a 10 year return period while setting the environmental conditions we referred to the 10 year return period s independent extreme values significant wave height 1 h mean wind speed and current speed at surface of gom central presented in interim guidance on hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico american petroleum institute api 2007 a total of 25 different combinations of environmental conditions were set by dividing each of the 10 year significant wave height 10 m and 1 h mean wind speed 33 m s into five and later by combining each other table 2 the velocity of current was set equal for all environmental conditions the combinations were used as the base conditions to produce time series environmental data for time series environmental data the 0 05 s intervals of wave and wind data were generated by applying significant wave height to joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectrum and 1 h mean wind speed to api spectrum respectively for example time series wave and wind data of environmental condition no 1 in table 2 was generated by applying significant wave height of 2 m to jonswap spectrum and 1 h mean wind speed of 6 6 m s to api spectrum the mutual influence between wave and wind was not considered and they were assumed to be only in one direction x axis the current speed at sea level was assumed as 1 6 m s and it decreased exponentially with increase in the depth of the sea likewise a total of 25 time series environmental datasets that were obtained based on the same method were used for the simulation 3 3 generation of floater responses data through simulation to obtain the floater responses required for constructing the dnn model the responses were simulated for each damage case and undamaged case respectively using tlp models under all the environmental conditions described above the combination of the 25 damage cases refer to section 3 1 and 25 environmental conditions produced a total of 625 damage environmental scenarios the floater response data six degrees of freedom surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw during each damage environmental scenario was simulated by using charm3d as the simulation program at intervals of 0 05 s fig 3 besides environmental loadings static forces such as weight and buoyancy were applied to the floater and mooring lines all the structural responses were obtained in time domain for conducting time domain analysis using charm3d the floater was modeled by considering it as a rigid body while the mooring lines were modeled by beam elements for the rigid body model of the floater in charm3d the added mass radiation damping and wave forces of the floater were evaluated in frequency domain by diffraction radiation panel analysis of a submerged part of the floater using ansys aqwa v18 0 ansys inc 2017 using charm3d the coupled floater mooring lines model was constructed by applying the pre evaluated hydrodynamic coefficients as the input data for the floater the floater model and mooring lines were connected at porches as depicted in figs 1 and 2 in addition all the mooring lines were anchored to the seabed in this study a simple pin connection was assumed for both the floater mooring lines connection and the connection between mooring lines and seabed as mentioned in section 3 1 each mooring line was modeled by using 10 beam elements and an additional 0 61 m long beam element was used for the damaged lines during time domain simulation using charm3d wind wave and current forces were calculated and applied to the floater whereas wave and current forces were applied to the mooring lines during each time step later the structural responses including time series floater motion and mooring tension could be obtained as described in section 3 1 there is only one undamaged case whereas there are three cases of single damaged upper middle lower for each mooring line damage thus data amount of floater responses for an undamaged case was unequal to that of damaged cases here to use the same number of data during dnn training the analysis time of the tlp model responses simulation in the undamaged case was set to three times that of single damage of each mooring line the response simulations were performed for 15 000 s for those undamaged and 5000 s for each of those damaged except 400 s which is a ramping time to prevent transient response of floater regarding computational speed the analysis interval time was set to 0 05 s through these simulations the response data of the floater in undamaged state and each damaged state were obtained 4 dnn model the aim of this study is to develop a detection approach to identify a mooring line with local damage using time series data of environment and floater responses however it is very difficult to detect a mooring line with even local damage by analyzing floater responses because their variation with respect to environment and damage of mooring line is very diverse and small to solve this dnn that is useful for identifying minute differences between complex patterns was used therefore dnn model is developed with time series data of environment and floater responses as input and the class of damaged mooring line as output refer to fig 4 here class indicates which mooring line is damaged and is classified as the same class regardless of the damaged part upper middle or lower part of the mooring line by this definition when any local damage occurs the dnn is designed to detect which mooring line is damaged since tlp model specifications and current speed at sea level were set identical in all cases they were excluded from the development of dnn prior to dnn development each data environment and floater responses was preprocessed in addition the training validation and test dataset were configured separately for the entire data and dnn was developed with these datasets 4 1 data preprocessing environmental data wave and wind and floater responses data six degree of freedom surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw vary substantially in scale which can result in data loss or local minima during dnn training for the typical dnn training to classify images the input value from each pixel of images is usually normalized by dividing by the maximum value that the pixel can have however for environmental data and floater responses data it is necessary to consider the influence of the direction hence normalization was performed using eq 1 therefore the normalized value of each data is in the range between 1 and 1 eq 1 x x x m a x where x normalized value of a variable x raw value of a variable and x m a x maximum absolute value of a variable since the behavior change due to the floater weight is not immediate it is difficult to find the pattern of floater responses according to mooring line damage which trains dnn with data section 3 3 of 0 05 s intervals therefore data were preprocessed to representative values such as mean and standard deviation that can show its trend or pattern more clearly and it would be reasonable to use these values for longer time period than at least the natural periods of the floater table 3 shows natural period of the responses of floater thus 250 s was set as the unit time and the corresponding mean and standard deviation were defined as the representative values for floater responses in the unit time for example as shown in fig 5 the time series data is divided into unit time of 250 s intervals and their mean and standard deviation are defined as the representative values for the unit time in this way the data were preprocessed with representative values of time series data of environment wave wind and floater responses surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw at each unit time as shown in fig 5 data from one simulation are divided into 20 unit times for cases of single damaged because the tlp model was performed for 5000 s split into 250 s durations depending on the damaged part there are three cases of single damaged refer to section 3 1 and 25 environmental condition refer to section 3 2 thus the data of cases with single damaged are 1500 20 3 25 and since there exist eight mooring lines the total data of cases of single damaged are 12 000 in contrast in the case of undamaged the tlp model simulation was performed for a total of 15 000 s and when separated by 250 s it has 60 unit times meanwhile there exists only one undamaged case refer to section 3 1 and 25 environmental condition likewise cases of single damaged resulting in a total of 1500 60 1 25 data therefore the total data are 13 500 while data per each case are 1500 4 2 dataset configuration dnn is a supervised learning method and has been applied to the classification problem in this study as described above our goal was to detect which mooring line is damaged irrespective of the damaged part upper middle or lower part therefore this study classified data according to the damaged mooring line and assigned explicit label accordingly for example whether the upper or lower part of the t2 mooring line was damaged they were classified as t2 mooring line damaged class in this way the data were classified as undamaged and damaged to each mooring line and were correspondingly labelled into nine classes here each label is expressed as a one hot vector through the one hot encoding method which expresses n labels as a vector of n dimension so that labels from undamaged to t8 mooring line damaged are 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 to 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 in general when developing the dnn the entire data is divided into training validation and test dataset training dataset is used for training the model validation dataset is used to examine whether the trained model demonstrates overfitting characteristics and test dataset is used to check the overall model performance in this study a total of 13 500 data were divided into training validation and test dataset using a ratio of 6 2 2 8 100 2 700 and 2700 moreover to consider the measurement noise that may occur in the actual field test datasets including random noise were additionally configured and used together to verify the performance of the dnn model thus in this study random noises were added to the wave wind surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw data respectively they were generated using six gaussian distributions representing different noise levels the mean of all gaussian distributions was set to 0 while the standard deviations were set as 1 5 10 20 30 and 40 respectively the noise level in this study represents the standard deviation of a gaussian as a result totally seven test datasets were generated according to the noise level including the absence of noise refer to table 4 while the performance of the dnn model was verified for each test dataset 4 3 dnn architecture the dnn architecture is consisted of totally five hidden layers refer to fig 6 the number of nodes configured by input hidden and output layers are shown in table 5 and each node is connected by parameters or weights in the input layer the data mean and standard deviation between unit time of environmental data and floater responses data described in section 4 1 served as the input this data reaches the output layer via hidden layers the values that reach the nodes of the output layer are calculated by the classifier to predict the data class generally in classification the dimension of the output layer is equal to the number of defined classes briefly the value of each node represents the probability of the corresponding class for example if the value of the fourth node is the largest the dnn model predicts the data as class 4 t4 mooring line damaged in this study the value of each node of the output layer and the label of the corresponding data can be represented by the same dimension and the loss between the values at the corresponding positions is calculated by loss function the loss is back propagated to the parameters by the optimizer and the parameters are updated to find the lowest value of the loss in this study each layer was set to be fully connected and drop out was not applied considering the input data size relu function was applied as activation function of each hidden layer while softmax function is applied as classifier of output layer cross entropy was used as loss function and batch size was set to 512 parameters and bias values were initialized using xavier initialization adam optimizer was used as the optimizer and the learning rate was set to 0 001 in the course of learning the design and learning of the dnn architecture was based on python using the tensorflow library provided by google 4 4 training and test the dnn the dnn architecture designed in the previous section was developed with each of the training validation and test datasets refer to fig 7 during the training the dataset was divided into different slices of batch data each sliced batch data was provided as the input to the dnn architecture one at a time as described in section 4 3 the input batch data reaches the output node through weights and biases by connecting each layer s node and this process is called feed forwarding average accuracy and loss for training dataset were obtained after the feed forwarding process of all batch data the loss obtained was used to update all weights and biases and as the weight and bias were updated a dnn model suitable for the training dataset was created the validation and the test the dnn were performed in the same way except for updating the weights and biases during the training process the designed dnn architecture are trained with training dataset and overfitting was checked with validation dataset as shown in fig 8 a and b the loss and accuracy for the training dataset have already converged at about 2000 epochs but the dnn trained up to 10 000 epochs to confirm overfitting as learning progresses if overfitting occurs in the training dataset the accuracy of the validation dataset is reduced in this study overfitting problem for training dataset was not present as shown in fig 8b this is mostly due to the distinctive patterns of data used the model corresponding to the 9616 epochs with the highest accuracy of the validation dataset was selected as the optimal dnn model the test results of the selected dnn model along with the test datasets of different noise level are listed in table 6 the accuracies in table 6 represent the ratio of the total number of correct predictions to the total number of the test datasets a very high accuracy of 99 3 was obtained for test datasets without noise while a high accuracy of more than 94 6 was still obtained for noise levels of 1 20 when the noise level was 30 and 40 the accuracy dropped to 79 8 87 5 regardless of noise level the accuracy to identify the class of undamaged was 100 thus providing a false positive fp error of 0 from the point of structural health monitoring a false negative fn error that mistakenly predicts actual damage as no damage is very dangerous the quite low fn errors of 0 7 5 4 for noise levels of 1 20 indicates the potential of dnn based structural health monitoring system to identify a damaged mooring line in tlp the accuracies were confirmed for even very severe noise levels of 30 and 40 for those noise levels the dnn model did not provide quite satisfactory fn errors of 12 5 20 2 the results show that the dnn may not work appropriately to identify a damage line when noise levels are quite severe however it is very unlikely that such extreme noise levels will occur referring to the abou galala et al 2018 global positioning system gps accuracy can achieve up to 0 01 m of high horizontal accuracy with precise point positioning ppp when more than 24 h of gps data collected therefore the proposed dnn method can be applied to detect the damaged mooring line with high performance 5 conclusions the purpose of this study was to develop a dnn based damage detection approach with floater responses for mooring lines with even local damage in tlp developing the dnn requires data from before and after the damage of an actual tlp however it is impractical to intentionally cause damage to a tlp in service because it poses a safety problem therefore simulation data with charm3d was used for training validation and test the dnn for this approach responses data surge sway heave yaw roll pitch of a floater were generated through simulation and used for the input and output layers of the dnn random measurement errors were also deliberately applied to the acceleration data to make them more realistic the accuracies of optimal dnn model were significantly high 94 6 99 3 with noise level differing from 0 to 20 the quite low fn error of 0 7 5 4 for noise levels of 1 20 is very promising for structural health monitoring system however as the noise level increased to 30 40 the accuracy dropped to 79 8 87 5 and the fn errors of 12 5 20 2 were not quite satisfactory nonetheless recent gps technologies can help to eliminate significant noises so extreme noise level generation such as 30 40 is impractical the result of this study showed the possibility of real time damage detection of mooring lines by using floater monitoring which could be performed constantly because the dnn based damage detection approach developed in this study requires only sensors that installed on floaters it is expected to be more economical than previous approaches that were based on the inspection or monitoring of mooring lines in addition this approach can also be applied to a locally damaged mooring line which does not have an overall damage or complete failure for the effective detection of small and local early stage damages thus preventing further damages or accidents meanwhile the dnn model of this study was not verified with the actual data in practice although several significant environmental conditions and noises were considered while developing the dnn model other environmental conditions such as temperature and viscosity that did not reflect in the simulation program was ruled out however these environmental conditions could be considered while developing a dnn model with the actual data based on the proposed approach damage detection for other types of mooring lines such as combination of chain and wire ropes can be developed since lightweight mooring lines which are frequently used recently are more flexible than tendons the floater responses are also different from that of tlp connected by tendons it is possible to develop damage detection dnn model for lightweight mooring lines with the proposed approach using the responses data of the floater that connects with lightweight mooring lines funding this work was supported by national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea government msit grant number 2017r1a2b4011753 declaration

21798,since severe damage to the floating offshore structures due to the deterioration of their structural stability may lead to major disasters it is necessary to detect mooring line damage at an early stage however most of the existing damage detection approaches of mooring line have difficulties to provide constant monitoring or to detect local damages to line this study aims to develop a detection approach of a damaged mooring line in tension leg platform tlp based on deep neural networks dnn simulation data with charm3d was used for training and testing the dnn in the study because it is impractical to obtain actual data by intentionally damaging mooring lines that are in operation the accuracies of the dnn model were significantly high 94 6 99 3 with noise level differing from 0 to 20 the quite low false negative fn errors of 0 7 5 4 for noise levels of 1 20 shows the potential of dnn based structural health monitoring system to identify a damaged mooring line in tlp the results of the study indicate that dnn based damage detection approach with floater responses is applicable for even a local damage and thus can prevent further damage or accident by early stage detection keywords damage detection mooring line tension leg platform tendon deep neural networks 1 introduction in floating offshore structures there are several mooring lines steel pipes or chains wire ropes etc that connect the floater to the seabed and help maintain its position at sea mooring lines suffer physical damage due to repetitive environmental loads such as wave or wind and marine growth during their life cycles which reduces their structural stability since such structures are mainly for oil or natural gas exploitation severe damage to the structures due to the deterioration of their structural stability may lead to major disasters furthermore the damage of one mooring line can accelerate the damage to others it is necessary to detect mooring line damage at an early stage damage to mooring lines is detected mainly by visual inspection however it is difficult to identify the damage when image resolution is relatively low or image acquisition is impossible due to the underwater environment in addition there is a limit to continuous damage detection because real time operation of remotely operated underwater vehicle rov is economically impractical to overcome these limitations damage detection by mooring line monitoring methods based on sensors have been proposed in recent years in those methods damages are detected by analyzing the responses obtained through mooring line monitoring however when sensors are attached for mooring line monitoring the results may include noises from the underwater environment in addition in deep waters due to the long mooring line length the number of sensors required for monitoring increases which lowers the economic efficiency of the methods damage detection by floater monitoring instead of mooring lines have also been proposed since these methods require sensors installed in the floater only the monitoring results include less environmental noise and are more economical however as the floater response does not significantly change in proportion to the mooring lines damage and exhibits a very complicated trend due to the influence of the sea environment such as waves or winds local damage to the mooring lines is difficult to detect by floater monitoring deep learning is an excellent way to find specific patterns even for complex data that is difficult to identify if deep learning is used to analyze floater responses detecting differences caused by small damage of mooring line may become possible therefore this study proposes a dnn based detection approach of a damaged mooring line through pattern analysis of floater responses among various floating offshore structures tension leg platform tlp that is widely used as a floating foundation for offshore wind turbines was focused in this study response data of a tlp floater required for dnn is replaced by simulation data because it is impractical to collect actual data from the real world by intentionally damaging mooring lines that are in operation 2 related studies although there have been several studies on the fatigue damage evaluation of mooring lines e g wong and kim 2018 li and choung 2018 martinez 2020 their damage detection methods are limited to fatigue damage moreover their methods require reliable s n curves while not enabling to specifying a damaged mooring line whatever the cause of a damage it is still challenging to detect the damage of mooring lines that has occurred in practice damage detection of mooring lines is generally carried out through inspection recent studies developed detection methods enabling constant monitoring however those methods are still problematic due to the significant measurements noise or low economic efficiency some studies suggested other detection approaches by floater monitoring in order to address these limitations 2 1 damage detection by inspection for inspection based damage detection visual inspection with rov is most commonly used visual inspection has the advantage that it is possible to visually check the damage of mooring line through image or video with high definition hd sensors or 3d cameras high resolution images can be acquired improving the efficiency of damage detection using visual inspection hall and trower 2011 nevertheless when the turbidity is high due to precipitated suspended matter or securing the field of camera view becomes difficult due to marine growth it is demanding to check the damage by visual inspection brown et al 2005 results of related studies show that the problem of high turbidity can be solved by 3d mooring line modeling e g pederson et al 2013 mcleod et al 2013 pederson et al 2013 argued that even if the image resolution is low the 3d model reflecting the current state can be reconstructed by combining the measurement results of mooring line responses together they claim that it is possible to identify mooring line damages on the surface using 3d models mcleod et al 2013 proposed a 3d point cloud image generation method for underwater structures using 3d light detection and ranging lidar these studies show the possibility of damage detection through visual inspection even in turbid waters however there is a problem that inspection itself is impossible in deep waters due to rov operational limit depth bashir et al 2017 to solve this problem several studies investigated possibilities of using mooring chain climbing robots e g dissanayake et al 2018 hernandez et al 2018 kimball et al 2018 however because these studies are only at the level of robot design and movement control the inspection performance was not verified in addition since such robot is much slower in operation it is almost impossible to inspect the entire mooring line on real time basis while its economic efficiency is much lower as possible solution damage detection of mooring line by mooring line monitoring is proposed 2 2 damage detection by mooring line monitoring with monitoring based damage detection damages of mooring line are detected by analyzing the structural responses obtained through monitoring depending on the object it can be classified into monitoring mooring line or floater after it has been theoretically demonstrated that responses such as acoustic emission ae tension and strain of mooring lines are affected by their damage bae and lee 2016 angulo et al 2017 bashir et al 2017 some studies employing mooring line monitoring have been presented ae which is a transient elastic wave generated as the energy is released by the material keshtgar and modarres 2013 is characterized by the difference in the value related to material deformation and is widely used for non destructive testing ndt of various materials angulo et al 2017 theoretically proved through finite element analysis of the dynamic model of mooring line chain that the magnitude of damage and ae amplitude are proportional their study presents the possibility of damage detection of mooring line using ae in a follow up study angulo et al 2019 through in air experiments verified that damage initiation or growth can be detected using ae rivera et al 2018 tested the validity of damage growth detection through ae analysis for chains in water tanks these studies have focused on damage detection of chain parts consisting mainly of metal materials while bashir et al 2017 argued that ae based damage detection can also be applied to nonmetallic mooring lines using polyester rope these results illustrate the possibility of damage detection with ae monitoring however there is a disadvantage that many ae sensors are required for the overall mooring line in addition the measured ae contains unforeseeable measurement noise due to complex underwater environmental conditions and therefore requires a high accuracy preprocessing technique responses such as tension and strain may also be possible for the damage detection since the tension varies greatly depending on whether damage occurs in the mooring line the damage can be detected through tension monitoring however it seems to be difficult to distinguish the failure of the tensionmeter and mooring lines damage since tensionmeter is installed by connecting each chain among the mooring line in general furthermore high cost of the tensionmeter makes it uneconomical these problems may be solved by applying a method of inducing tension with an incline instead of a tensionmeter du et al 2013 since the measured incline however is likely to contain various environmental noises this method may need to be validated experimentally although relatively difficult to monitor it is likely that the strain can be used for damage detection based on relevant studies e g rebel et al 2000 smith and williams 2003 about strain monitoring however like tensionmeter the cost required by sensors such as fiber optic strain gauges and fiber bragg gratings fbg used in these studies are too high and thus may not be easy to apply in practice the problems of measurement noise or being non economic of damage detection by mooring line monitoring can be addressed by detection by floater monitoring 2 3 damage detection by floater monitoring unlike mooring lines floater is located above the water so decreasing the measurement noise in responses as well as installation and maintenance of sensors can be done easily and economically therefore using floater monitoring for damage detection can alleviate those problems by mooring line monitoring however since floater responses are very complicated due to environmental condition such as wave and wind detection of mooring line damage by floater monitoring has been challenging some studies analyzed these complex floater responses based on artificial intelligence ai methods jamalkia et al 2016 demonstrated that damages to mooring line could be detected by identifying damage patterns in floater responses though fuzzy logic their method can detect not only damaged mooring lines but also the degree of damage slight moderate severe using pattern analysis fuzzy logic and floater responses sidarta et al 2018 claimed that the damage of mooring line can be detected by training floater responses through artificial neural networks ann those studies show that there could be patterns in floater responses depending on the damage of mooring line whose detection is possible by analyzing such patterns however those studies only consider cases of failure or damage throughout the mooring line so it may be difficult to apply them when there is a slight change in floater responses due to local damage deep neural networks dnn is one of the most effective in finding patterns even among small differences therefore this study proposes a dnn based detection approach of a mooring line with local damage through pattern analysis of floater responses 3 simulation of tlp the floating offshore structure that this study focuses on is tension leg platform tlp that is widely used as a floating foundation for offshore wind turbines in tlp tendons are used as mooring lines to connect a floater in this study simulation data was used because it is impractical to obtain actual data by intentionally damaging mooring lines that are in operation for simulation the analytical models for an undamaged case and several single damaged cases where there is only one part damaged across the entire mooring lines were created based on tlp model of yang 2009 respectively to consider the effect of offshore environment various environmental conditions were generated based on 10 year return period environmental conditions of the gulf of mexico central gom central the responses of the floater with each damaged case were simulated under environmental conditions by using the fully coupled nonlinear hull mooring riser program charm3d from texas a m university ran and kim 1997 ran et al 1999 tahar and kim 2003 yang and kim 2010 2011 kim and kim 2015 3 1 modelling of tlp for the simulation of floater responses yang s tlp model which is widely used in the studies of floating offshore structures was employed in this study the tlp model was divided into floater mooring lines tendons and risers however as floater and mooring lines were only interesting structural elements in this study risers were not considered floater of the tlp model consists of a square deck of 73 15 m wide 13 72 m high four pontoons of 8 23 m wide 7 31 m high and four circular columns with 16 46 m outer diameter refer to fig 1 in fig 1 t1 to t8 on each circular column refers each of mooring lines that is a total of eight mooring lines each of which has length of 899 16 m 2950 ft are connected to the floater in this study only cases of single damaged were considered to reflect the cases on the analytical model the candidate elements on which damage will be applied were defined for each mooring line the damaged parts of the line were classified into upper middle and lower part corresponding with types of damaged part the tlp model was created to have the eight mooring lines with candidate elements placed in one of the upper middle or lower part the damage was assumed to be the loss of the cross section 20 less than the undamaged cross section refer to table 1 for the cases of single damaged only one candidate element of damaged mooring line was reduced in its cross section in each case for example to reflect the upper part damage of the t1 mooring line on the analytical model 0 61 m 2 ft of candidate element is placed at 89 86 m 294 8 ft from sea level for every mooring line t1 to t8 and the cross section of only one candidate element in t1 mooring line is reduced refer to fig 2 a the remaining parts except the candidate element are consisted of 10 elements with the same length of 89 86 m 294 8 ft and the same method was applied to all mooring lines considering computational speed in the numerical analysis the length of the candidate element was set short to show local damage while the lengths of the other elements were long a 0 61 m 2 ft of candidate element in the model of middle and lower part damaged mooring line was placed at 359 42 m 1179 2 ft and 628 99 m 2063 6 ft from sea level for each mooring line respectively in the same manner as the upper part damaged mooring line refer to fig 2b and c likewise only the candidate element of the damaged mooring line is damaged while remaining parts except the candidate element were composed of 10 elements of the same length of 89 86 m 294 8 ft for each mooring line as since the tlp model used in this study has eight mooring lines with three single damaged cases damage of upper middle or lower part there were totally 24 different cases generated therefore together with the undamaged case a total of 25 different cases were used in simulation 3 2 environmental conditions the time series environmental data required for the floater response simulation was generated using the environmental condition of gom central referring to the findings that the average period of damage to mooring line is nine years jamalkia et al 2016 various environmental conditions were set based on the environmental condition of a 10 year return period while setting the environmental conditions we referred to the 10 year return period s independent extreme values significant wave height 1 h mean wind speed and current speed at surface of gom central presented in interim guidance on hurricane conditions in the gulf of mexico american petroleum institute api 2007 a total of 25 different combinations of environmental conditions were set by dividing each of the 10 year significant wave height 10 m and 1 h mean wind speed 33 m s into five and later by combining each other table 2 the velocity of current was set equal for all environmental conditions the combinations were used as the base conditions to produce time series environmental data for time series environmental data the 0 05 s intervals of wave and wind data were generated by applying significant wave height to joint north sea wave observation project jonswap spectrum and 1 h mean wind speed to api spectrum respectively for example time series wave and wind data of environmental condition no 1 in table 2 was generated by applying significant wave height of 2 m to jonswap spectrum and 1 h mean wind speed of 6 6 m s to api spectrum the mutual influence between wave and wind was not considered and they were assumed to be only in one direction x axis the current speed at sea level was assumed as 1 6 m s and it decreased exponentially with increase in the depth of the sea likewise a total of 25 time series environmental datasets that were obtained based on the same method were used for the simulation 3 3 generation of floater responses data through simulation to obtain the floater responses required for constructing the dnn model the responses were simulated for each damage case and undamaged case respectively using tlp models under all the environmental conditions described above the combination of the 25 damage cases refer to section 3 1 and 25 environmental conditions produced a total of 625 damage environmental scenarios the floater response data six degrees of freedom surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw during each damage environmental scenario was simulated by using charm3d as the simulation program at intervals of 0 05 s fig 3 besides environmental loadings static forces such as weight and buoyancy were applied to the floater and mooring lines all the structural responses were obtained in time domain for conducting time domain analysis using charm3d the floater was modeled by considering it as a rigid body while the mooring lines were modeled by beam elements for the rigid body model of the floater in charm3d the added mass radiation damping and wave forces of the floater were evaluated in frequency domain by diffraction radiation panel analysis of a submerged part of the floater using ansys aqwa v18 0 ansys inc 2017 using charm3d the coupled floater mooring lines model was constructed by applying the pre evaluated hydrodynamic coefficients as the input data for the floater the floater model and mooring lines were connected at porches as depicted in figs 1 and 2 in addition all the mooring lines were anchored to the seabed in this study a simple pin connection was assumed for both the floater mooring lines connection and the connection between mooring lines and seabed as mentioned in section 3 1 each mooring line was modeled by using 10 beam elements and an additional 0 61 m long beam element was used for the damaged lines during time domain simulation using charm3d wind wave and current forces were calculated and applied to the floater whereas wave and current forces were applied to the mooring lines during each time step later the structural responses including time series floater motion and mooring tension could be obtained as described in section 3 1 there is only one undamaged case whereas there are three cases of single damaged upper middle lower for each mooring line damage thus data amount of floater responses for an undamaged case was unequal to that of damaged cases here to use the same number of data during dnn training the analysis time of the tlp model responses simulation in the undamaged case was set to three times that of single damage of each mooring line the response simulations were performed for 15 000 s for those undamaged and 5000 s for each of those damaged except 400 s which is a ramping time to prevent transient response of floater regarding computational speed the analysis interval time was set to 0 05 s through these simulations the response data of the floater in undamaged state and each damaged state were obtained 4 dnn model the aim of this study is to develop a detection approach to identify a mooring line with local damage using time series data of environment and floater responses however it is very difficult to detect a mooring line with even local damage by analyzing floater responses because their variation with respect to environment and damage of mooring line is very diverse and small to solve this dnn that is useful for identifying minute differences between complex patterns was used therefore dnn model is developed with time series data of environment and floater responses as input and the class of damaged mooring line as output refer to fig 4 here class indicates which mooring line is damaged and is classified as the same class regardless of the damaged part upper middle or lower part of the mooring line by this definition when any local damage occurs the dnn is designed to detect which mooring line is damaged since tlp model specifications and current speed at sea level were set identical in all cases they were excluded from the development of dnn prior to dnn development each data environment and floater responses was preprocessed in addition the training validation and test dataset were configured separately for the entire data and dnn was developed with these datasets 4 1 data preprocessing environmental data wave and wind and floater responses data six degree of freedom surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw vary substantially in scale which can result in data loss or local minima during dnn training for the typical dnn training to classify images the input value from each pixel of images is usually normalized by dividing by the maximum value that the pixel can have however for environmental data and floater responses data it is necessary to consider the influence of the direction hence normalization was performed using eq 1 therefore the normalized value of each data is in the range between 1 and 1 eq 1 x x x m a x where x normalized value of a variable x raw value of a variable and x m a x maximum absolute value of a variable since the behavior change due to the floater weight is not immediate it is difficult to find the pattern of floater responses according to mooring line damage which trains dnn with data section 3 3 of 0 05 s intervals therefore data were preprocessed to representative values such as mean and standard deviation that can show its trend or pattern more clearly and it would be reasonable to use these values for longer time period than at least the natural periods of the floater table 3 shows natural period of the responses of floater thus 250 s was set as the unit time and the corresponding mean and standard deviation were defined as the representative values for floater responses in the unit time for example as shown in fig 5 the time series data is divided into unit time of 250 s intervals and their mean and standard deviation are defined as the representative values for the unit time in this way the data were preprocessed with representative values of time series data of environment wave wind and floater responses surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw at each unit time as shown in fig 5 data from one simulation are divided into 20 unit times for cases of single damaged because the tlp model was performed for 5000 s split into 250 s durations depending on the damaged part there are three cases of single damaged refer to section 3 1 and 25 environmental condition refer to section 3 2 thus the data of cases with single damaged are 1500 20 3 25 and since there exist eight mooring lines the total data of cases of single damaged are 12 000 in contrast in the case of undamaged the tlp model simulation was performed for a total of 15 000 s and when separated by 250 s it has 60 unit times meanwhile there exists only one undamaged case refer to section 3 1 and 25 environmental condition likewise cases of single damaged resulting in a total of 1500 60 1 25 data therefore the total data are 13 500 while data per each case are 1500 4 2 dataset configuration dnn is a supervised learning method and has been applied to the classification problem in this study as described above our goal was to detect which mooring line is damaged irrespective of the damaged part upper middle or lower part therefore this study classified data according to the damaged mooring line and assigned explicit label accordingly for example whether the upper or lower part of the t2 mooring line was damaged they were classified as t2 mooring line damaged class in this way the data were classified as undamaged and damaged to each mooring line and were correspondingly labelled into nine classes here each label is expressed as a one hot vector through the one hot encoding method which expresses n labels as a vector of n dimension so that labels from undamaged to t8 mooring line damaged are 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 to 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 in general when developing the dnn the entire data is divided into training validation and test dataset training dataset is used for training the model validation dataset is used to examine whether the trained model demonstrates overfitting characteristics and test dataset is used to check the overall model performance in this study a total of 13 500 data were divided into training validation and test dataset using a ratio of 6 2 2 8 100 2 700 and 2700 moreover to consider the measurement noise that may occur in the actual field test datasets including random noise were additionally configured and used together to verify the performance of the dnn model thus in this study random noises were added to the wave wind surge sway heave roll pitch and yaw data respectively they were generated using six gaussian distributions representing different noise levels the mean of all gaussian distributions was set to 0 while the standard deviations were set as 1 5 10 20 30 and 40 respectively the noise level in this study represents the standard deviation of a gaussian as a result totally seven test datasets were generated according to the noise level including the absence of noise refer to table 4 while the performance of the dnn model was verified for each test dataset 4 3 dnn architecture the dnn architecture is consisted of totally five hidden layers refer to fig 6 the number of nodes configured by input hidden and output layers are shown in table 5 and each node is connected by parameters or weights in the input layer the data mean and standard deviation between unit time of environmental data and floater responses data described in section 4 1 served as the input this data reaches the output layer via hidden layers the values that reach the nodes of the output layer are calculated by the classifier to predict the data class generally in classification the dimension of the output layer is equal to the number of defined classes briefly the value of each node represents the probability of the corresponding class for example if the value of the fourth node is the largest the dnn model predicts the data as class 4 t4 mooring line damaged in this study the value of each node of the output layer and the label of the corresponding data can be represented by the same dimension and the loss between the values at the corresponding positions is calculated by loss function the loss is back propagated to the parameters by the optimizer and the parameters are updated to find the lowest value of the loss in this study each layer was set to be fully connected and drop out was not applied considering the input data size relu function was applied as activation function of each hidden layer while softmax function is applied as classifier of output layer cross entropy was used as loss function and batch size was set to 512 parameters and bias values were initialized using xavier initialization adam optimizer was used as the optimizer and the learning rate was set to 0 001 in the course of learning the design and learning of the dnn architecture was based on python using the tensorflow library provided by google 4 4 training and test the dnn the dnn architecture designed in the previous section was developed with each of the training validation and test datasets refer to fig 7 during the training the dataset was divided into different slices of batch data each sliced batch data was provided as the input to the dnn architecture one at a time as described in section 4 3 the input batch data reaches the output node through weights and biases by connecting each layer s node and this process is called feed forwarding average accuracy and loss for training dataset were obtained after the feed forwarding process of all batch data the loss obtained was used to update all weights and biases and as the weight and bias were updated a dnn model suitable for the training dataset was created the validation and the test the dnn were performed in the same way except for updating the weights and biases during the training process the designed dnn architecture are trained with training dataset and overfitting was checked with validation dataset as shown in fig 8 a and b the loss and accuracy for the training dataset have already converged at about 2000 epochs but the dnn trained up to 10 000 epochs to confirm overfitting as learning progresses if overfitting occurs in the training dataset the accuracy of the validation dataset is reduced in this study overfitting problem for training dataset was not present as shown in fig 8b this is mostly due to the distinctive patterns of data used the model corresponding to the 9616 epochs with the highest accuracy of the validation dataset was selected as the optimal dnn model the test results of the selected dnn model along with the test datasets of different noise level are listed in table 6 the accuracies in table 6 represent the ratio of the total number of correct predictions to the total number of the test datasets a very high accuracy of 99 3 was obtained for test datasets without noise while a high accuracy of more than 94 6 was still obtained for noise levels of 1 20 when the noise level was 30 and 40 the accuracy dropped to 79 8 87 5 regardless of noise level the accuracy to identify the class of undamaged was 100 thus providing a false positive fp error of 0 from the point of structural health monitoring a false negative fn error that mistakenly predicts actual damage as no damage is very dangerous the quite low fn errors of 0 7 5 4 for noise levels of 1 20 indicates the potential of dnn based structural health monitoring system to identify a damaged mooring line in tlp the accuracies were confirmed for even very severe noise levels of 30 and 40 for those noise levels the dnn model did not provide quite satisfactory fn errors of 12 5 20 2 the results show that the dnn may not work appropriately to identify a damage line when noise levels are quite severe however it is very unlikely that such extreme noise levels will occur referring to the abou galala et al 2018 global positioning system gps accuracy can achieve up to 0 01 m of high horizontal accuracy with precise point positioning ppp when more than 24 h of gps data collected therefore the proposed dnn method can be applied to detect the damaged mooring line with high performance 5 conclusions the purpose of this study was to develop a dnn based damage detection approach with floater responses for mooring lines with even local damage in tlp developing the dnn requires data from before and after the damage of an actual tlp however it is impractical to intentionally cause damage to a tlp in service because it poses a safety problem therefore simulation data with charm3d was used for training validation and test the dnn for this approach responses data surge sway heave yaw roll pitch of a floater were generated through simulation and used for the input and output layers of the dnn random measurement errors were also deliberately applied to the acceleration data to make them more realistic the accuracies of optimal dnn model were significantly high 94 6 99 3 with noise level differing from 0 to 20 the quite low fn error of 0 7 5 4 for noise levels of 1 20 is very promising for structural health monitoring system however as the noise level increased to 30 40 the accuracy dropped to 79 8 87 5 and the fn errors of 12 5 20 2 were not quite satisfactory nonetheless recent gps technologies can help to eliminate significant noises so extreme noise level generation such as 30 40 is impractical the result of this study showed the possibility of real time damage detection of mooring lines by using floater monitoring which could be performed constantly because the dnn based damage detection approach developed in this study requires only sensors that installed on floaters it is expected to be more economical than previous approaches that were based on the inspection or monitoring of mooring lines in addition this approach can also be applied to a locally damaged mooring line which does not have an overall damage or complete failure for the effective detection of small and local early stage damages thus preventing further damages or accidents meanwhile the dnn model of this study was not verified with the actual data in practice although several significant environmental conditions and noises were considered while developing the dnn model other environmental conditions such as temperature and viscosity that did not reflect in the simulation program was ruled out however these environmental conditions could be considered while developing a dnn model with the actual data based on the proposed approach damage detection for other types of mooring lines such as combination of chain and wire ropes can be developed since lightweight mooring lines which are frequently used recently are more flexible than tendons the floater responses are also different from that of tlp connected by tendons it is possible to develop damage detection dnn model for lightweight mooring lines with the proposed approach using the responses data of the floater that connects with lightweight mooring lines funding this work was supported by national research foundation of korea nrf grant funded by the korea government msit grant number 2017r1a2b4011753 declaration

21799,this study presents a comparison between nonlinear finite element analysis fea and the smith method of fujikubo et al 2012 the objective was to compare the accuracy and computation effort of the two methods for a double hull tanker under biaxial bending and various ship conditions intact hull structure collision damaged hull structure newly built condition and ship hull aged due to corrosion the results for the non corroded and intact ship hull structures showed good agreement between fea the smith method and iacs csr h for vertical bending loading conditions for all other bending load combinations fea always gave lower ultimate bending moments than the smith method the differences between the two methods were larger for the corroded and damaged ship hull structure than for other conditions results from ultimate strength analyses of the collision damaged hull structures showed that both methods captured the expected asymmetric ultimate strength response due to asymmetric damage a residual strength index calculation showed that the reduction was larger for the fea than for the smith method a procedure is proposed that combines results of a few feas with the advantages of the smith method to generate accurate biaxial bending load interaction curves for different ship conditions keywords biaxial bending corrosion finite element analysis residual strength index progressive collapse ship collision smith method ultimate state ultimate strength 1 introduction after several ship accidents following the loss of the ship prestige the concept of an ultimate residual strength of the hull girder was introduced to the imo goal based ship construction standards imo gbs as a new solas convention at the 87th session of the maritime safety committee in imo imo 2010 yamada and ogawa 2011 the imo gbs is currently applied to all tankers and bulk carriers 150 m in length or longer it is also required for large container ships and for other ships residual strength is a functional requirement included in tier ii of imo gbs and is defined in imo 2010 as follows ii 5 residual strength ships shall be designed to have sufficient strength to withstand the wave and internal loads in specified damaged conditions such as collision grounding or flooding residual strength calculations shall take into account the ultimate reserve capacity of the hull girder including permanent deformation and post buckling behaviour actual foreseeable scenarios shall be investigated in this regard as far as is reasonably practicable the ultimate limit state uls of a ship structure is the instant of the peak design load at which the ship structure collapses due to loss of its structural stiffness and strength paik 2018 this point is defined as the ultimate strength and it is of paramount importance for safe ship design to know the uls with regard to all loads and the loading conditions a ship will be subjected to during its operational life ultimate and residual strength calculations of ship structures can be carried out using several methods finite element analysis fea is becoming more and more common procedure even though it requires significant modelling and computation efforts the simplified method proposed by smith 1977 and further developed by many researchers such as fujikubo et al 2012 has been approved by classification societies and is one of the accepted simplified numerical procedures in the harmonised common structural rules for oil tankers and bulk carriers csr h iacs 2019 czujko et al 2018 discussed pros and cons of other well known methods for ultimate and residual strength calculations such as the panel ultimate limit state puls method the intelligent supersize fe method isfem and the idealised structural unit method isum uls analysis of ship structures can be categorised into studies or combinations of studies of intact or damaged ship structures that have different physical conditions due to corrosion or fatigue cracks in this work damaged and intact hulls refer to hulls with and without structural damage due to accidents such as collision and grounding respectively finite element models for ultimate and ship collision analyses can be made highly detailed and realistic for the scenarios they are designed to simulate although this enables the thorough analyses of specific cases with regards to structural integrity and failures the computational cost and effort for each case are high from a modelling and computational effort perspective the smith method for example requires significantly less computational time than fea the smith method is accepted by classification societies for ultimate and residual strength assessments since it in contrast to fea yields results relatively fast and with an accepted accuracy at a low computational cost however fea and the smith method should be complementary to ensure that model assumptions and simplifications are made correctly with regards to the predicted uls level location and sequence of structural failures preceding the ultimate state for pure vertical and horizontal bending conditions recent studies e g parunov et al 2018 show that there is often good agreement between the results of fea and the smith method for ships that have no structural damage in the side shell or the bottom caused by collision or grounding respectively however there are studies that have shown that the agreement between fea and the smith method is not as good under biaxial bending load conditions czujko et al 2018 parunov et al 2018 even though the ultimate strength of an intact ship structure is often the lowest in pure hogging or sagging conditions it is important to have knowledge about the ship s uls characteristics for biaxial bending conditions if the ship has side shell hull damage from a collision accident this justifies the need for methods and model developments offering faster and more accurate numerical procedures for the calculation of biaxial bending load interaction diagrams that present the uls of intact and damaged ship structures as well as for different physical conditions related to ship age intuitively a ship structure damaged due to collision will suffer from a reduction in its ultimate and residual strengths this type of damage is asymmetric with regard to the cross section of the vessel the damage is defined by the shape and size of the material rupture and large plastic deformations of the surrounding structural details to reliably estimate a ship s reserve strength a uls analysis of a damaged ship requires descriptions of several issues e g i the collision location ii the shape and size of the damage iii the severity of the large plastic deformation of the damaged surrounding material and iv the ship s physical condition due to corrosion considerable research efforts have been spent on the structural response during collision and on the residual ultimate strength of struck ships examples of such investigations with the representation of materials and their characteristics can be found in abubakar and dow 2013 ehlers 2010 ehlers and østby 2012 hogström and ringsberg 2012 hogström et al 2009 hussein and soares 2009 marinatos and samuelides 2015 samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015 yamada 2014 yamada and ogawa 2011 zhang and pedersen 2017 and faisal et al 2016 simplified shapes of the structural damages were mainly used in the studies a ship s physical condition which is affected by factors such as corrosion has a significant impact on the ultimate and residual strength of the ship under both intact and collision damaged conditions the iacs regulation of csr h requires 50 corrosion reduction according to the rules when evaluating the ultimate and residual strength campanile et al 2015 present a study on the same topic and type of damage for bulk carriers this study includes the effect of corrosion using a corrosion model proposed by paik et al 2003b the results show how the influence of corrosion of the material leads to a significant decrease in the residual ultimate strength index rsi there are several investigations on the buckling ultimate strength that support this finding for intact structures suffering from either minor or major corrosion wastage see e g paik et al 2008a and saad eldeen et al 2011 however there are few studies in the literature that systematically present the consequences of corrosion on the collision resistance and the ultimate strength together the influence of corrosion is typically simplified by removing the extra corrosion margin in damage assessments see ringsberg et al 2017 and parunov et al 2018 1 1 objective of the study this investigation presents a comparison of methods i e advanced nonlinear feas and the smith method modified by fujikubo et al 2012 in the calculation of the ultimate and residual strengths of a double hull tanker the objective is to compare the two analysis methods during biaxial bending conditions with regard to their accuracy and computation effort for various ship conditions such as an intact hull structure a collision damaged hull structure the newly built condition and a physical condition in which the ship hull is aged due to corrosion a sensitivity study is presented on how the modelling of the damage shape and size plastic deformation due to collision and simplified material properties affects the ultimate strength calculation using fea and the smith method a method is proposed that shows how the smith method after calibration using results from a few feas is conducted can be employed as a reliable and accurate method to compute the uls of a ship structure during biaxial bending load conditions for intact or damaged ship hull structures including the ship s physical condition 1 2 case study vessel and analyses the case study vessel is a coastal oil tanker with a deadweight of 11 500 t and draft of 7 4 m the tanker has a longitudinally stiffened double bottom and weather deck while the double side shell structure is transversely stiffened see fig 1 for the mid ship section of the vessel the tanker has been used as a case study vessel in previous research by the authors and readers are referred to ringsberg et al 2018a 2018b for a more detailed description of the vessel ships of this type and size are common along the west coast of sweden where ship traffic density is high and there are crossing ship traffic and fairways between denmark and sweden concerns of negative environmental consequences in the case of ship collision accidents and the risk of ship loss have been raised hence the ultimate and residual strengths of this type of ship are relevant for studying both intact and collision damaged conditions the strength capacity of the ship structure must also be known for biaxial bending conditions to account for arbitrary wave encounter loading conditions especially for damaged ship structures the sensitivity of the calculated ultimate strength capacity of the ship due to its physical condition is also an important factor that can be investigated by comparing the properties of newly built ships and ships aged due to corrosion table 1 presents an overview of combinations of analyses presented in the study for the simulation cases in which the tanker ship is intact i e free from hull damage from a collision the fe model in subsection 2 1 is used only in the biaxial ultimate strength simulations outlined in subsection 2 2 however for the simulation cases in which the tanker ship has damage due to collision the damage is first introduced to the ship and then the biaxial bending moment load is simulated according to subsections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively the smith method used for progressive collapse analyses and the models are presented in section 3 the results of the simulations and analyses are presented in section 4 finally in section 5 the conclusions and recommendations for future research are presented 2 finite element models and analyses this section presents the fe models and analyses for the ship collision and ultimate strength analyses the fe models and analyses were carried out using abaqus explicit version 6 13 3 dassault systèmes 2020 a thorough description of the design of the fe models for collision simulation material characteristics and damage modelling can be found in previous work by the authors see hogström and ringsberg 2012 2013 and ringsberg et al 2017 2018a hence only a brief summary of these concepts with all necessary information for the reproduction of the collision simulations is presented in subsection 2 1 subsection 2 2 presents the fe model of the case study ship subjected to biaxial bending and the related modelling details 2 1 ship collision simulations the collision scenario was a collision between two similar sized vessels the struck ship was the case study coastal oil tanker shown in fig 1 and the striking ship was a coastal product chemical tanker with a total displacement of 10 800 t henceforth referred to as the striking tanker fig 2 presents the geometry of the inner structure of the bulbous bow section of the striking tanker and the geometry of the struck coastal oil tanker the fe model of the struck ship was made sufficiently large to avoid influence from the boundary conditions the collision impact was amidships and between bulkheads and web frames see fig 3 a the bow section of the striking tanker was modelled as deformable and restricted to only move in a prescribed right angle collision direction other collision angles have already been investigated by ringsberg et al 2017 the striking ship was given different initial forward velocities corresponding to different kinetic energies see section 4 the velocity of the striking bow gradually decreased to zero knots during the collision event as energy was dissipated through deformations fractures and friction in the structures all nodes at the fore and aft faces of the struck ship hull were connected to control points cp through a multipoint constraint with a rigid beam connection this configuration of boundary conditions allowed us to constrain the displacements and rotations in each slave node to the displacements and rotations of the cp the cps were placed on the intersection of the centre plane and on the initial elastic neutral axis and they were fixed in all degrees of freedom during the collision simulations see fig 3b the fe meshes were made of four node shell elements with reduced integration s4r and some three node s3r in abaqus explicit and five section points through the thickness a mesh convergence analysis of the struck tanker resulted in an element size of 60 mm the element length thickness ratio was 5 in the part of the model with the largest sheet thickness time step in the explicit analysis was determined automatically the general contact condition in abaqus explicit was used in conjunction with a friction coefficient of 0 3 non corroded surface or 0 5 corroded surface see section 4 to model the contacts between surfaces in the collision in addition to the net cross section area loss two factors that have a large impact on strength reduction are according to garbatov et al 2016 the change in material parameters caused by corrosion and the stress concentration due to local corrosion pits several investigations in the literature have studied how the strength of corroded metal structures depends on factors such as the degree of degradation geometric modelling of pit density and initial imperfections in simulation models used in nonlinear fe analysis see e g paik et al 2008b and paik and melchers 2008 in the current study an approach presented in ringsberg et al 2018a was adopted three different representations of nva shipbuilding mild steel were used depending on the grade of corrosion ship age and severity of corrosion nva virgin non corroded nva minorly corroded and nva severely corroded a detailed description of the material models used in this study is presented in ringsberg et al 2018a and only a brief summary is given below the material parameters for the three materials are summarised in table 2 the nva virgin material was represented by a nonlinear elastic plastic power law constitutive material model with isotropic hardening the influence from the strain rate was considered using the cowper symonds relationship including the two constants c and p degradation leading to failure was modelled using one model for onset of failure based on the shear criterion in abaqus explicit damage initiation di and one model for material degradation damage evolution de in the de model the length dependence between element size and fracture strain was accounted for through barba s law see hogström et al 2009 for details for the corroded ship structure the degree of corrosion was considered by simply varying the parameters in the stress strain law the structural thickness and the coefficient of friction a process that can easily be implemented in the fea see ringsberg et al 2018a the corroded material was represented by a bilinear elastic plastic constitutive material model with linear isotropic hardening between the yield and ultimate tensile stresses as found in garbatov et al 2014 a corroded material is less ductile than a non corroded material and the necking point is not easily observed during tensile tests hence the damage model of the corroded materials was represented solely by the shear failure di criterion without any de law due to the lack of material data for the corroded materials a sensitivity study was carried out in ringsberg et al 2017 the influence of considering a cowper symonds model and a simplified de model activated after reaching the fracture strain was investigated the results showed that both issues had only a minor influence on the size of the damage opening in the corroded ship structure compared to analyses including no strain rate dependence or de model hence no cowper symonds or de models were included in the fea with corroded material properties see ringsberg et al 2018a the corrosion margins of the struck coastal oil tanker estimated from the common structural rules for bulk carriers and oil tankers csr bc ot iacs 2019 are shown in fig 4 a full reduction of a corrosion margin could represent 25 years of operation for a vessel and a 50 reduction in the corrosion margin after approximately 16 years of operation paik et al 2003a the relationship between intervals of the remaining corrosion margin and their correlation with the material model used in fe analyses was established in kuznecovs and shafieisabet 2017 for plates with 0 reduction of as built thickness the nva virgin non corroded material was recommended for a 0 20 reduction the minorly corroded material was recommended and for a 20 40 reduction the severely corroded material was recommended these intervals are relevant for coastal oil tankers with different structural parts that have various percentages of loss of material due to corrosion fig 4b presents where in the ships cross section different material properties were used in the simulation models it was assumed that the physical condition of the corroded case study ship represented 25 years of aging and corrosion 2 2 biaxial bending loading simulations the main loading conditions experienced by a ship structure are bending induced by still water conditions including cargo weight distribution and from the waves if the ship is sailing in head or following seas the hull girder is normally subjected to vertical bending moment resulting in pure hogging or sagging moments however in case of oblique waves or a heeling angle resulting from partial flooding or parametric rolling the loading conditions give rise to biaxial bending moment where the ship is subjected to combined loading of both vertical and horizontal bending moments the fe model presented in subsection 2 1 was used to estimate the ultimate strength capacity of the case study vessel during biaxial loading conditions to estimate the ultimate strength due to bending moment s the fe model was bent in a prescribed direction beyond its ultimate state condition the applied loading continued beyond the uls to simulate the progressive collapse of different parts and structural elements due to buckling and plastic deformation the bending was applied to the fe model through displacement control following a procedure proposed by parunov et al 2018 and tekgoz et al 2018 the bending curvature was increased gradually linearly by the rotation of the end planes through controlled rotations of the cps see fig 5 for a schematic and subsection 2 1 for a detailed description of how the cps were defined to preserve pure bending one of the cps was pinned and restricted from translation in three directions while the other cp was allowed to move in the longitudinal x direction by controlling the ratio between the horizontal and vertical rotations the desired biaxial bending condition was achieved the applied curvature components were then χ h 2 φ z l and χ v 2 φ y l where φ z and φ y are the applied rotation angles around the z and y axes respectively and l is the distance between the cps the reaction moment at the cps was recorded for every curvature increment during bending the maximum point on the obtained total bending moment total curvature curve defined the ultimate strength as its uls bending moment and corresponding curvature it was shown in yamada 2014 2019 that the time duration of loading in explicit fea can have a significant influence on the ultimate bending moment fig 6 shows a convergence analysis conducted in this study with the intact non corroded fe model and presents the vertical bending moment vs applied curvature in hogging for three different loading times the shortest loading time t 0 05 s resulted in structural vibrations due to the sudden loading which led to an overestimation of the ultimate bending moment the longer loading time showed a decrease in this artificial dynamic response the convergence analysis showed that a loading time of 1 00 s was sufficient for the fe model used in the current investigation initial deformations and imperfections which occur during the manufacturing process of a ship affect its uls the presence of initial imperfections will reduce the ultimate strength of a hull due to decreased critical buckling stress of its components for the double bottom tanker the effect of initial imperfections is more critical in sagging due to the lower buckling strength of the weather deck as compared to the double bottom despite this the majority of studies in the literature that have analysed the uls using full ship fe models disregard the influence of these mainly due to the complexity of setting up the simulation model with e g initial imperfections this study did not include initial deformations and imperfections in the fe model for the same reason which was also supported by the argument that such imperfections were not and are normally not incorporated in the fe model used in the ship collision simulations thus ultimate strength predictions obtained from intact fe models used in this study may be slightly overestimated compared to fe models with initial imperfections notably the introduction of hull damage in an fe ship model used for uls analysis can be conducted in different ways ringsberg et al 2018a proposed first simulating the ship collision event and then continuing with the same fe model in the ultimate strength simulation analysis parunov et al 2018 proposed simplifying the shape and size of the damage opening and removing the corresponding elements in the fe model prior to the uls analysis with this simplification the shape and size of the damage may not be correct and the plastic deformation and failures of structural elements are disregarded with the smith method see section 3 similar assumptions and simplifications must be made and the material must also be elastic perfectly plastic thus section 4 presents the results from a sensitivity study on how these different damage modelling perspectives differ and affect the uls as well as a discussion on which alternative is the most suitable for the design of safe ships 3 smith method and models in numerical simulations using the fe method a substantial amount of time and effort is required to prepare the model and to conduct the simulation for example the computation time required to obtain one value of the ultimate bending moment using the undamaged fe model presented in section 2 is approximately 60 cpu hours on a desktop computer with four core processors working at a base frequency of 3 5 ghz and 32 gb ram the computational time and cost are high but the detailed results and the possibility of investigating different failure modes and post collapse characteristics justify it for a few feas for the same type of analysis simplified analysis procedures such as the smith method smith 1977 are less computationally demanding and much faster than the fe method requiring less than 1 min per loading case but have limitations in the type of results that can ultimately be provided for the purpose of uls analysis of the tanker ship in this study both analysis methods were tested one of the major advantages of the smith method is that it provides fast analyses this option can be beneficial for the rapid assessment of impacts on structural integrity such as after a collision or grounding accident or for parametric studies it also can be implemented as a code in more complex prediction tools to check for the effect of structural ageing or in real time reliability assessments of ship structure in this study the smith method further developed by fujikubo et al 2012 was implemented in the in house code used for uls analyses and was verified against other studies in the literature by kuznecovs and shafieisabet 2017 the method was used due its ability to consider the instant translation and rotation of the neutral axis na during bending the importance of including the na s two dimensional movement for correct estimation of the uls in the case of asymmetric geometry material distributions or load applications has been studied and discussed by several authors such as choung et al 2012 makouei et al 2015 smith and pegg 2003 and tekgoz et al 2018 the reader is referred to the work by fujikubo et al 2012 for a detailed description of the methodology in the following only the basics and some minor modifications to the method introduced by the authors are presented the smith method as proposed by fujikubo et al 2012 is a pure incremental seminumerical method for simplified uls analysis of ships during biaxial bending loading without torsion the cross section of the hull is divided into three types of structural elements stiffened plates stiffeners and hard corners in the current work the longitudinal girders with openings are modelled as two independent stiffened plate elements with a distance between them corresponding to the opening breadth the average stress responses in the hull s longitudinal direction for every element in the cross section due to imposed loading are described by load shortening elongation lse curves these curves can give the material and structure different stiffness properties and characteristics the lse curves in the present study were defined by the seminumerical expressions in the csr h rules in iacs 2019 as defined in the csr h rules the material in this simplified analysis in contrast to the more advanced and realistic material models used in an fe model was modelled as elastic perfectly plastic this assumption implies limitations on the post ultimate behaviour of the ship structure while holding reasonably well in the pre ultimate and ultimate regions see further discussion in section 4 the effect of initial imperfections and residual stresses e g due to welding were implicitly included in the smith method through the equations that define the lse curves according to the csr h rules in iacs 2019 hull damage caused by a collision event was modelled as a damage opening by removing and adjusting the geometry of the structural elements corresponding to the ruptured and severely plastically deformed elements in the ship s cross section lse curves of the modified elements were adjusted accordingly the longitudinal location of the representative cross section was chosen from the fea of the collision event by identification of the cross section that had the most extensive damage furthermore the influence of corrosion was determined following the method presented in subsection 2 2 the reduction in the thickness of structural elements and adjustment of the material properties were made according to table 2 note that only the elastic modulus and the yield stress were changed because the material curve of the smith method ship model must be represented by an elastic perfectly plastic curve in the smith method used in this study the changes in the global reaction forces and moments during bending at every curvature increment were found by integration of the tangential axial stiffness around the instant na throughout the whole cross section if the bending load was applied gradually and the curvature increments were sufficiently small no iterative procedure was required smith 1977 the change in the global structural response during biaxial bending under the prescribed moment ratio was found by incrementally solving a system of nonlinear equations 1 α δ m v δ m v d h h d h v d v h d v v δ χ h δ χ v d δ χ h δ χ v where the factor α δ m h δ m v is the ratio between the horizontal m h and vertical m v moment components d is the tangential stiffness matrix and δ χ h and δ χ v are the curvatures in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively from this definition it follows that pure horizontal and vertical bending is achieved when α and α 0 respectively to solve the equation system one of the curvature step components δ χ h or δ χ v should be prescribed for better numerical convergence δ χ v was prescribed when α 1 i e when the contribution from vertical bending prevailed while δ χ h was prescribed when α 1 the components of the tangential stiffness matrix d of the cross section of the ship model for a specified curvature were defined as 2 d v v i 1 n d i z i z g 2 a i 3 d h h i 1 n d i y i y g 2 a i 4 d h v d v h i 1 n d i y i y g z i z g a i where a i is the cross sectional area of an element y i and z i are the coordinates of an element s centre of mass and y g and z g are the centroid coordinates of the cross section see fig 7 the tangential stiffness d i of every i th element in the cross section subjected to bending at curvature step j was defined by the slope of the corresponding lse curve at instant strain for every curvature increment the centroid g of the instant na was found by equation 5 5 y g i 1 n d i a i y i i 1 n d i a i z g i 1 n d i a i z i i 1 n d i a i the obtained increments of the bending moment and the curvature were added to their cumulative values by plotting the total bending moment versus the total curvature the uls could be identified and defined as the maximum bending moment for the specific loading condition this was repeated for many combinations of horizontal and vertical bending moments by plotting their maxima in a biaxial plot an interaction curve describing the ship s ultimate strength for its specific bending and structural condition was produced for all possible biaxial bending moment combinations the bending moment load ratios are presented in polar diagrams which show the bending moment loading ratios in degrees and the uls values in the radial direction see fig 8 here for example 90 and 270 α 0 correspond to hogging and sagging respectively pure horizontal bending with the port side in tension occurs at 0 and compression occurs at 180 α 4 results and discussion this section presents the results from the simulations and analyses in four sections subsection 4 1 presents the fea of ship collision events in which the speed of the striking ship varied the outcome of these analyses was the target speed of the striking vessel which served as a representative candidate for the hull damage calculation due to collision used in the uls analyses in subsection 4 2 this section also presents a comparison of different alternatives for modelling hull damage and how these affect the uls predicted by fea or the smith method subsection 4 3 presents the results from the biaxial bending moment load analyses in which both the ultimate and residual strengths were assessed and compared between fea and the smith method finally in subsection 4 4 a method is proposed that shows how the smith method after calibration using results from a few feas becomes a more accurate and reliable method to assess a ship for these conditions 4 1 fea of ship collision shape and size of damage and structural deformation the damage caused to two ships involved in a collision depends on several factors such as their relative displacements the ship speeds the collision location the collision angle and the strength of their structures the schematic in fig 9 shows the different principal categories of damage to a struck ship and their dependence on the relative stiffnesses of the striking and struck ships norsok 2004 subsection 2 1 describes the two ships that were used to simulate the collision event in the current study the velocity of the struck ship was zero knots while the velocity of the striking ship was derived from analyses of several ship collision simulations to provide a realistic velocity for the uls analyses the initial velocity of the striking ship varied from 2 knots to 8 knots with an increment of 1 knot this was carried out for both the non corroded struck ship referred to as t1 and the corroded struck ship referred to as t5 note that the striking ship was always represented by a non corroded ship model the results are presented in fig 10 as the relative energies shared between frictional dissipation internal energy in the striking ship bow and the struck ship hull for the non corroded t1 cases the strength of the struck ship was large enough to deform the bow of the striking ship at low collision speeds more internal energy was dissipated in the struck ship because the penetration depth of the struck ship hardly reached the inner structure the share of the internal energies was more equal at high collision speeds because of the large penetration depth which resulted in large contact between the bow and side shell structure it also forced the forecastle to have a large amount of plastic deformation for the t5 cases the struck ship took the most internal energy because the strength of the structure was weakened due to the loss of corrosion margin and change in material properties the bow was still deformed at the highest collision speeds while it remained almost undeformed at the lowest collision speeds frictional dissipation was larger for t5 than for t1 due to the higher friction coefficient in the contact between surfaces the results in fig 10 show that the structural deformation and energy dissipation according to fig 9 probably corresponded to the shared energy design for t1 and ductile design for t5 by calculating the relative internal energy share ratio for the struck ship r ie struck according to equation 6 it was confirmed in fig 11 a that this was true for t1 and for t5 except for when the ship speed was 5 knots in this case the results were more or less on the border line between the shared energy and ductile designs fig 11b presents the projected damaged areas of the inner and outer side shells the results show that for t5 at 5 knots there was a drastic increase in the damage opening area because of these results 5 knots was chosen as the reference collision velocity for the striking ship in the collision scenario and is also a speed often used in similar types of ship collision studies 6 r i e s t r u c k i e s t r u c k i e s t r i k i n g i e s t r u c k 100 4 2 comparison of fea and smith method selected cases 4 2 1 intact ship structure the results from the fea of the intact ship structure with new non corroded material were compared against analyses using a smith method model for the bending moment load directions 0 60 90 and 270 which corresponded to horizontal bending biaxial bending hogging and sagging conditions respectively fig 12 presents the bending moment curvature diagrams and the longitudinal stress distributions at the maximum bending moment from fea and the smith method the difference between the methods in the predicted ultimate bending moment values was between 5 and 18 which is reasonably good however the predicted post collapse behaviour varied to a larger degree it was also found that the uls was reached at a larger bending curvature and a higher bending moment in three of the four cases with the smith model than with fea these differences may be explained by the definition of the lse curves in the smith method model which were defined according to iacs 2019 where nonlinear behaviour of the structure elements was defined using the ramberg osgood formula with a correction for plasticity since the elastic stiffness seemed to be less for the smith model than for the fe model the value of the curvature at the uls should be higher for the former than for the latter initial imperfections were implicitly incorporated in the formulae of lse curves while no geometrical distortions were introduced in the fe model this should presumably lead to lower strength estimates which is supported by the benchmark studies from czujko et al 2018 and soares et al 2008 nevertheless the smith method applied in the current study generally overestimates ultimate strength compared to fea similar trends were found in works by parunov et al 2018 and tekgoz et al 2018 the selected approach for modelling a cross section could be the source of variance in the results for example if elements at the intersection of plates are modelled as stiffened plates their behaviour in compression will be affected by buckling this will decrease the element s critical stress and the global strength of the hull in contrast if elements are assumed to act as hard corners instead i e elastic perfectly plastic buckling will not be considered in this case the elastic limit will be reached at increased curvature values the stiffness of the cross section in the plastic region will increase and the uls will thus be affected different sequences of failure modes predicted by the smith method are another possible reason for the overestimation of bending strength for example the examination of the fea results for hogging 90 loading direction showed that bottom buckling is triggered first according to the discussion above and the characteristics of the cross section studied double bottom and side plating consists of many hard corner elements due to the high stiffness of bottom plating failure of the weather deck in yielding occurs prior to buckling of the double bottom the yielding of elements in the upper part of the cross section will force the na to move downwards resulting in a redistribution of the loads and postponing the occurrence of instability in the plating at the keel level the inclusion of hard corner elements is prescribed by crs h rules in addition interconnected plates fail mainly due to yielding in compression iacs 2019 since their stiffness is radically higher than the stiffness of an assembly of independent stiffened plate elements thus despite the observed trends it is believed that hard corners should be included in modelling for a realistic representation of a cross section the longitudinal stress distributions in the cross sections at uls showed good agreement between fea and the smith method the structural responses for both symmetric and asymmetric bending conditions agreed well a comparison between the failure modes of the structures showed good agreement with the way distorted elements and their collapse modes occurred the smith method results showed the movement and rotation of the na passing through the points in the cross section with zero stresses in conclusion this initial comparison between the two methods showed that the fe model and smith method model seemed to agree reasonably well 4 2 2 collision damaged ship structure the ship collision event was simulated according to subsection 2 1 using the ship speed of 5 knots for the striking ship according to subsection 4 1 after the striking ship penetrated the mid ship section of the struck vessel and reached zero knots the bow of the striking ship was removed the names of the fea ship collision simulations are t1d for the non corroded ship and t5d for the corroded ship t5d these simulations gave realistic shapes and sizes of the damage openings as well as plastic deformations and failures of several structural elements fig 13 presents the damage openings and equivalent plastic strains for t1d and t5d in both cases there was penetration through both of the side shells and large plastic deformations of the structures the structural damage was larger for t5d than for t1d because of the corroded material and reduced corrosion margins the damage opening area was almost two times larger see fig 11b and the damage in the upper part near the weather deck was more prominent for t1d than for t5d the outer plating was ruptured where the striking bow s forecastle impacted the struck ship the internal longitudinals transverse stiffeners and bulkheads between plating were more severely distorted using fea it was possible to continue with the ultimate strength analysis simulation according to the procedure presented in subsection 2 2 however it was not possible with the smith method to represent damage openings distorted structural elements or the plastic strain field in the same way a study was therefore carried out to investigate how different degrees of simplification of collision damaged structure modelling affect the uls see fig 14 the analyses were limited to hogging and sagging conditions five cases were defined for comparison case a full fea where the uls fea was carried out by restarting the ship collision fea after the struck vessel was removed case b fea where the fe model used in the uls analysis had a damage opening shape and size corresponding to the projected damage area from the ship collision fea note only the shape and size of the damage opening were included no other structural distortions failures or plastic deformations were considered case c fea where the fe model used in the uls analysis had a damage opening as defined in the smith method model see section 3 case d fea with the same fe model as in case c except that the material model was changed to the elastic perfectly plastic material model used in the smith method model case e uls analysis using the smith method model fig 15 presents the results from the t1d and t5d uls analyses for hogging and sagging conditions for hogging there was a large difference between cases a and e i e the fea and smith method there were minor differences between cases b c and d which were between cases a and e the results for hogging for both t1d and t5d showed the importance of not simplifying the material and damage modelling with regards to 3 issues i the damage opening area should not be simplified ii a realistic representation of the material s characteristics should be used and iii deformed structures and plastic strains should not be disregarded the sagging results showed the same trend for cases a b and e as for hogging however cases c and d showed larger ultimate bending moments than all the other cases an analysis of the deformation of the fe ship model for these cases revealed that the simplified damage opening was the reason for these case results the shape of the simplified damage opening delayed the failure modes of neighbouring structural elements and led to a higher ultimate bending moment compared in cases c and d than in cases a and b which had a more realistic damage opening shape thus these cases confirmed that simplified modelling of collision induced damage openings should be avoided in fe analysis fig 16 presents the results after the ultimate bending moments have been normalised by the corresponding case a ultimate bending moment the figure shows that all cases gave a high ultimate bending moment compared to the full fea solution case a which was recommended in this study in the remaining part of the study the case a method was compared with the case e method i e full fea and the smith method respectively the results in fig 16 indicate that the smith method overestimated the ultimate bending moments compared to fea for hogging and sagging the sizes of this overestimation under biaxial bending moment loading conditions are presented in subsection 4 3 4 3 comparison of fea and smith method biaxial bending moment loading conditions 4 3 1 ultimate strength analyses the smith method according to iacs 2019 is only applicable for pure vertical bending of undamaged ship structures it does not consider rotation of the na and thus the smith method is not able to capture nonlinear structural collapse correctly for a ship structure subjected to biaxial bending fig 17 presents the interaction curves of the ultimate bending moments during biaxial loading conditions from fea and the smith method proposed in this investigation the smith method in iacs 2019 is included for comparison but only for the t1i case in hogging and sagging conditions the results for the t1i case in fig 17a show that the tanker had a higher strength in the hogging condition than in the sagging condition because of the double bottom structure which made a greater contribution than the single upper deck to the strength the highest ultimate strength was found for pure horizontal bending since the side shell structures had a large distance to the centroid on the centerline resulting in a high contribution to the moment of inertia the results for the ultimate strength in vertical bending were identical for the smith and csr h methods with differences of less than 1 the discrepancies between the smith method and fea were 8 and 5 for hogging and sagging respectively thus the agreement between the three methods was considered to be good for pure vertical bending conditions for all other loading combinations the smith method showed a larger ultimate strength than the fea the causes and reasoning in subsection 4 2 1 also affected the other bending moment load combinations but the shortcomings of the smith method resulted in a larger difference between the two methods in addition for the corroded ship structure case t5i shown in fig 17b the trend was the same the smith method gave a slightly larger ultimate strength than the fea notably there was also a significant reduction in the ultimate strength capacity between t1i and t5i due to corrosion the sagging condition was affected more than the hogging condition due to the large loss in hull strength in the upper deck see fig 4b for the corrosion conditions fig 17c and d presents the results from the damaged ship structures with the damage opening on the port side of the ship the largest reduction in ultimate strength for case t1d occurred in the second and third quadrants when the damaged side of the ship was in compression see fig 8 the asymmetry was captured by both fea and the smith method there was also a minor effect in the first and fourth quadrants compared to the t1i case where the modelling of the damage opening showed a larger effect for fea than for the smith method model as discussed in subsection 4 2 for the corroded ship case t5d there was a significant reduction in ultimate strength compared to t1d where as in the t5i case there was a larger reduction in the sagging condition than in the hogging condition again both methods captured the asymmetry due to the single side damage opening in contrast with the t1d case the fea results for t5d showed a large reduction in the first quadrant when the damaged side of the ship was in tension an analysis of all feas showed that this can be explained by the damage and plastic deformations caused by the forecastle which led to a large reduction in strength especially for these combinations of horizontal end bending moment loading conditions 4 3 2 residual strength index rsi calculation the reserve strength of the case study ship was calculated in a residual strength analysis by the calculation of the rsi proposed by fang and das 2004 this was carried out for the three cases t1d t5i and t5d for fea and the smith method where t1i was the reference for both methods see fig 18 the fea results show a larger decrease than the smith method results in rsi for the t1d case the difference can be explained by the simplification of the damage modelling in the smith method see subsection 4 2 which can also be seen clearly in the asymmetric rsi results which were better captured by fea for the corroded ship cases there was a larger reduction in the rsi for fea than for the smith method this can be explained by joint effects of too simplified damage and corrosion modelling in the smith method as found and discussed in the previous sections of this study 4 4 calibration method fea and smith method the results in the previous sections show that the fea predicted lower uls values for the biaxial bending moment loading conditions than the smith method however each point on the fea interaction curve took approximately 60 cpu hours to compute see section 3 while the entire interaction curve consisting of 35 points for the smith method took 5 cpu minutes to calculate on the same computer one of the advantages of using the fe method is the possibility of performing a detailed and accurate analysis of each specific load combination and simulation scenario however if a high resolution of data points in the uls interaction curve must be obtained these analyses will be too demanding since the results in the previous sections showed that mostly the peak values of the uls differed between the fea and smith methods a calibration method using a curve fitting procedure was developed that makes use of as few feas as possible to generate correction factors for the main results of the smith method a uls interaction curve for an intact and non corroded ship can be approximated by equation 7 gordo and soares 1997 where m y and m z are coordinates on the fitted curve m u h and m u v are the ultimate horizontal and vertical bending moments respectively and β is a shape factor with β 2 corresponding to an ellipse and β 1 giving a shape similar to an ellipse 7 m y m u v β m z m u h β 1 for the damaged ship cases with asymmetric hull damage the results in subsection 4 3 showed that the uls interaction curve was different in all quadrants especially when ship corrosion was also included thus to generalise the calibration procedure curve fitting was unique to each quadrant it is recommended that at least four feas should be used for curve fitting in each quadrant to determine the shape factors thus in total only 12 feas are needed since pure vertical and horizontal bending can be shared points between quadrants note that for an intact structure 7 points are sufficient due to symmetry around the vertical axis curve fitting was carried out by finding the solution with the lowest rmse value between equation 7 and the points obtained by fea based on the curves fitted using equation 7 in each quadrant both for fea and the smith method calibration factors c f were calculated as the ratio between the two methods fitted parameters the c f s for pure horizontal and vertical ultimate bending moments were defined as c f h m u h f e a m u h s m i t h and c f v m u v f e a m u v s m i t h respectively the c f for the shape factor was defined as c f β β f e a β s m i t h the new formulation of a calibrated interaction curve using the smith method can then be described by equation 8 8 m y m u v s m i t h c f v β s m i t h c f β m z m u h s m i t h c f h β s m i t h c f β 1 fig 19 presents the results where calibration was performed for cases t1i t5i t1d and t5d the results showed good agreement between the fea and the smith method with calibrated values according to equation 8 table 3 presents a summary of all curve fitted parameters needed to plot the interaction curves using equation 8 with the proposed procedure which requires only a few fea results together with the smith method a high resolution interaction curve can be obtained with high confidence and rapidness compared to the time it takes to run many feas to obtain the same interaction curve resolution 5 conclusions this study presented ultimate and residual strength analyses of a double hull tanker ship during biaxial bending moment conditions two methods were compared advanced nonlinear fe analyses and the smith method according to fujikubo et al 2012 the case study vessel was analysed from the perspective of an intact hull and a hull damaged due to ship collision under two physical conditions newly built non corroded and aged due to corrosion the results for the non corroded and intact ship hull structures showed good agreement between the fea the smith method and iacs csr h for vertical bending loading conditions for all other load combinations the ultimate bending moments were always lower for the fea than for the smith method it was found that this discrepancy was related to how the material modelling in the smith method was proposed in the iacs 2019 procedures for corroded and intact ship hull structures the difference was larger which was also found to be due to the simplified material modelling in the smith method model prior to uls analyses of the collision damaged hull structures a sensitivity study on the ultimate strength in hogging and sagging conditions due to various accepted simplifications during the modelling of hull damage was performed it was found that the smith method because of restrictions and the possibility to model hull damage overestimated the uls compared to fea which was considered more trustworthy and realistic hence the smith method resulted in unconservative results for safe ship design with respect to ultimate strength the cause of this result was found to be related to three issues which resulted in three recommendations i the shape and size of the damage opening should not be simplified to simplistic shapes ii a representative constitutive material model for the material s true characteristics should be used and iii deformed structures and plastic strains should not be disregarded the results from ultimate strength analyses of the collision damaged ship structures showed that both fea and the smith method captured the expected asymmetric response in ultimate strength due to asymmetric damage the rsi calculation showed that the reduction was larger for fea than for the smith method and was often the largest for biaxial bending moment loadings than for pure vertical bending moment conditions this showed the importance of calibrating the smith method for uls analyses for biaxial bending moment conditions a procedure for such a calibration combining the results from a few feas and the advantages of the smith method was proposed with this procedure the advantages of detailed fea for damaged ship structure and corrosion are improvements compared to the simplifications made using the smith method alone the proposal also gives a safe ship design procedure with ultimate strength bending moments that are not overestimated due to model simplifications or

21799,this study presents a comparison between nonlinear finite element analysis fea and the smith method of fujikubo et al 2012 the objective was to compare the accuracy and computation effort of the two methods for a double hull tanker under biaxial bending and various ship conditions intact hull structure collision damaged hull structure newly built condition and ship hull aged due to corrosion the results for the non corroded and intact ship hull structures showed good agreement between fea the smith method and iacs csr h for vertical bending loading conditions for all other bending load combinations fea always gave lower ultimate bending moments than the smith method the differences between the two methods were larger for the corroded and damaged ship hull structure than for other conditions results from ultimate strength analyses of the collision damaged hull structures showed that both methods captured the expected asymmetric ultimate strength response due to asymmetric damage a residual strength index calculation showed that the reduction was larger for the fea than for the smith method a procedure is proposed that combines results of a few feas with the advantages of the smith method to generate accurate biaxial bending load interaction curves for different ship conditions keywords biaxial bending corrosion finite element analysis residual strength index progressive collapse ship collision smith method ultimate state ultimate strength 1 introduction after several ship accidents following the loss of the ship prestige the concept of an ultimate residual strength of the hull girder was introduced to the imo goal based ship construction standards imo gbs as a new solas convention at the 87th session of the maritime safety committee in imo imo 2010 yamada and ogawa 2011 the imo gbs is currently applied to all tankers and bulk carriers 150 m in length or longer it is also required for large container ships and for other ships residual strength is a functional requirement included in tier ii of imo gbs and is defined in imo 2010 as follows ii 5 residual strength ships shall be designed to have sufficient strength to withstand the wave and internal loads in specified damaged conditions such as collision grounding or flooding residual strength calculations shall take into account the ultimate reserve capacity of the hull girder including permanent deformation and post buckling behaviour actual foreseeable scenarios shall be investigated in this regard as far as is reasonably practicable the ultimate limit state uls of a ship structure is the instant of the peak design load at which the ship structure collapses due to loss of its structural stiffness and strength paik 2018 this point is defined as the ultimate strength and it is of paramount importance for safe ship design to know the uls with regard to all loads and the loading conditions a ship will be subjected to during its operational life ultimate and residual strength calculations of ship structures can be carried out using several methods finite element analysis fea is becoming more and more common procedure even though it requires significant modelling and computation efforts the simplified method proposed by smith 1977 and further developed by many researchers such as fujikubo et al 2012 has been approved by classification societies and is one of the accepted simplified numerical procedures in the harmonised common structural rules for oil tankers and bulk carriers csr h iacs 2019 czujko et al 2018 discussed pros and cons of other well known methods for ultimate and residual strength calculations such as the panel ultimate limit state puls method the intelligent supersize fe method isfem and the idealised structural unit method isum uls analysis of ship structures can be categorised into studies or combinations of studies of intact or damaged ship structures that have different physical conditions due to corrosion or fatigue cracks in this work damaged and intact hulls refer to hulls with and without structural damage due to accidents such as collision and grounding respectively finite element models for ultimate and ship collision analyses can be made highly detailed and realistic for the scenarios they are designed to simulate although this enables the thorough analyses of specific cases with regards to structural integrity and failures the computational cost and effort for each case are high from a modelling and computational effort perspective the smith method for example requires significantly less computational time than fea the smith method is accepted by classification societies for ultimate and residual strength assessments since it in contrast to fea yields results relatively fast and with an accepted accuracy at a low computational cost however fea and the smith method should be complementary to ensure that model assumptions and simplifications are made correctly with regards to the predicted uls level location and sequence of structural failures preceding the ultimate state for pure vertical and horizontal bending conditions recent studies e g parunov et al 2018 show that there is often good agreement between the results of fea and the smith method for ships that have no structural damage in the side shell or the bottom caused by collision or grounding respectively however there are studies that have shown that the agreement between fea and the smith method is not as good under biaxial bending load conditions czujko et al 2018 parunov et al 2018 even though the ultimate strength of an intact ship structure is often the lowest in pure hogging or sagging conditions it is important to have knowledge about the ship s uls characteristics for biaxial bending conditions if the ship has side shell hull damage from a collision accident this justifies the need for methods and model developments offering faster and more accurate numerical procedures for the calculation of biaxial bending load interaction diagrams that present the uls of intact and damaged ship structures as well as for different physical conditions related to ship age intuitively a ship structure damaged due to collision will suffer from a reduction in its ultimate and residual strengths this type of damage is asymmetric with regard to the cross section of the vessel the damage is defined by the shape and size of the material rupture and large plastic deformations of the surrounding structural details to reliably estimate a ship s reserve strength a uls analysis of a damaged ship requires descriptions of several issues e g i the collision location ii the shape and size of the damage iii the severity of the large plastic deformation of the damaged surrounding material and iv the ship s physical condition due to corrosion considerable research efforts have been spent on the structural response during collision and on the residual ultimate strength of struck ships examples of such investigations with the representation of materials and their characteristics can be found in abubakar and dow 2013 ehlers 2010 ehlers and østby 2012 hogström and ringsberg 2012 hogström et al 2009 hussein and soares 2009 marinatos and samuelides 2015 samuelides 2015 storheim et al 2015 yamada 2014 yamada and ogawa 2011 zhang and pedersen 2017 and faisal et al 2016 simplified shapes of the structural damages were mainly used in the studies a ship s physical condition which is affected by factors such as corrosion has a significant impact on the ultimate and residual strength of the ship under both intact and collision damaged conditions the iacs regulation of csr h requires 50 corrosion reduction according to the rules when evaluating the ultimate and residual strength campanile et al 2015 present a study on the same topic and type of damage for bulk carriers this study includes the effect of corrosion using a corrosion model proposed by paik et al 2003b the results show how the influence of corrosion of the material leads to a significant decrease in the residual ultimate strength index rsi there are several investigations on the buckling ultimate strength that support this finding for intact structures suffering from either minor or major corrosion wastage see e g paik et al 2008a and saad eldeen et al 2011 however there are few studies in the literature that systematically present the consequences of corrosion on the collision resistance and the ultimate strength together the influence of corrosion is typically simplified by removing the extra corrosion margin in damage assessments see ringsberg et al 2017 and parunov et al 2018 1 1 objective of the study this investigation presents a comparison of methods i e advanced nonlinear feas and the smith method modified by fujikubo et al 2012 in the calculation of the ultimate and residual strengths of a double hull tanker the objective is to compare the two analysis methods during biaxial bending conditions with regard to their accuracy and computation effort for various ship conditions such as an intact hull structure a collision damaged hull structure the newly built condition and a physical condition in which the ship hull is aged due to corrosion a sensitivity study is presented on how the modelling of the damage shape and size plastic deformation due to collision and simplified material properties affects the ultimate strength calculation using fea and the smith method a method is proposed that shows how the smith method after calibration using results from a few feas is conducted can be employed as a reliable and accurate method to compute the uls of a ship structure during biaxial bending load conditions for intact or damaged ship hull structures including the ship s physical condition 1 2 case study vessel and analyses the case study vessel is a coastal oil tanker with a deadweight of 11 500 t and draft of 7 4 m the tanker has a longitudinally stiffened double bottom and weather deck while the double side shell structure is transversely stiffened see fig 1 for the mid ship section of the vessel the tanker has been used as a case study vessel in previous research by the authors and readers are referred to ringsberg et al 2018a 2018b for a more detailed description of the vessel ships of this type and size are common along the west coast of sweden where ship traffic density is high and there are crossing ship traffic and fairways between denmark and sweden concerns of negative environmental consequences in the case of ship collision accidents and the risk of ship loss have been raised hence the ultimate and residual strengths of this type of ship are relevant for studying both intact and collision damaged conditions the strength capacity of the ship structure must also be known for biaxial bending conditions to account for arbitrary wave encounter loading conditions especially for damaged ship structures the sensitivity of the calculated ultimate strength capacity of the ship due to its physical condition is also an important factor that can be investigated by comparing the properties of newly built ships and ships aged due to corrosion table 1 presents an overview of combinations of analyses presented in the study for the simulation cases in which the tanker ship is intact i e free from hull damage from a collision the fe model in subsection 2 1 is used only in the biaxial ultimate strength simulations outlined in subsection 2 2 however for the simulation cases in which the tanker ship has damage due to collision the damage is first introduced to the ship and then the biaxial bending moment load is simulated according to subsections 2 1 and 2 2 respectively the smith method used for progressive collapse analyses and the models are presented in section 3 the results of the simulations and analyses are presented in section 4 finally in section 5 the conclusions and recommendations for future research are presented 2 finite element models and analyses this section presents the fe models and analyses for the ship collision and ultimate strength analyses the fe models and analyses were carried out using abaqus explicit version 6 13 3 dassault systèmes 2020 a thorough description of the design of the fe models for collision simulation material characteristics and damage modelling can be found in previous work by the authors see hogström and ringsberg 2012 2013 and ringsberg et al 2017 2018a hence only a brief summary of these concepts with all necessary information for the reproduction of the collision simulations is presented in subsection 2 1 subsection 2 2 presents the fe model of the case study ship subjected to biaxial bending and the related modelling details 2 1 ship collision simulations the collision scenario was a collision between two similar sized vessels the struck ship was the case study coastal oil tanker shown in fig 1 and the striking ship was a coastal product chemical tanker with a total displacement of 10 800 t henceforth referred to as the striking tanker fig 2 presents the geometry of the inner structure of the bulbous bow section of the striking tanker and the geometry of the struck coastal oil tanker the fe model of the struck ship was made sufficiently large to avoid influence from the boundary conditions the collision impact was amidships and between bulkheads and web frames see fig 3 a the bow section of the striking tanker was modelled as deformable and restricted to only move in a prescribed right angle collision direction other collision angles have already been investigated by ringsberg et al 2017 the striking ship was given different initial forward velocities corresponding to different kinetic energies see section 4 the velocity of the striking bow gradually decreased to zero knots during the collision event as energy was dissipated through deformations fractures and friction in the structures all nodes at the fore and aft faces of the struck ship hull were connected to control points cp through a multipoint constraint with a rigid beam connection this configuration of boundary conditions allowed us to constrain the displacements and rotations in each slave node to the displacements and rotations of the cp the cps were placed on the intersection of the centre plane and on the initial elastic neutral axis and they were fixed in all degrees of freedom during the collision simulations see fig 3b the fe meshes were made of four node shell elements with reduced integration s4r and some three node s3r in abaqus explicit and five section points through the thickness a mesh convergence analysis of the struck tanker resulted in an element size of 60 mm the element length thickness ratio was 5 in the part of the model with the largest sheet thickness time step in the explicit analysis was determined automatically the general contact condition in abaqus explicit was used in conjunction with a friction coefficient of 0 3 non corroded surface or 0 5 corroded surface see section 4 to model the contacts between surfaces in the collision in addition to the net cross section area loss two factors that have a large impact on strength reduction are according to garbatov et al 2016 the change in material parameters caused by corrosion and the stress concentration due to local corrosion pits several investigations in the literature have studied how the strength of corroded metal structures depends on factors such as the degree of degradation geometric modelling of pit density and initial imperfections in simulation models used in nonlinear fe analysis see e g paik et al 2008b and paik and melchers 2008 in the current study an approach presented in ringsberg et al 2018a was adopted three different representations of nva shipbuilding mild steel were used depending on the grade of corrosion ship age and severity of corrosion nva virgin non corroded nva minorly corroded and nva severely corroded a detailed description of the material models used in this study is presented in ringsberg et al 2018a and only a brief summary is given below the material parameters for the three materials are summarised in table 2 the nva virgin material was represented by a nonlinear elastic plastic power law constitutive material model with isotropic hardening the influence from the strain rate was considered using the cowper symonds relationship including the two constants c and p degradation leading to failure was modelled using one model for onset of failure based on the shear criterion in abaqus explicit damage initiation di and one model for material degradation damage evolution de in the de model the length dependence between element size and fracture strain was accounted for through barba s law see hogström et al 2009 for details for the corroded ship structure the degree of corrosion was considered by simply varying the parameters in the stress strain law the structural thickness and the coefficient of friction a process that can easily be implemented in the fea see ringsberg et al 2018a the corroded material was represented by a bilinear elastic plastic constitutive material model with linear isotropic hardening between the yield and ultimate tensile stresses as found in garbatov et al 2014 a corroded material is less ductile than a non corroded material and the necking point is not easily observed during tensile tests hence the damage model of the corroded materials was represented solely by the shear failure di criterion without any de law due to the lack of material data for the corroded materials a sensitivity study was carried out in ringsberg et al 2017 the influence of considering a cowper symonds model and a simplified de model activated after reaching the fracture strain was investigated the results showed that both issues had only a minor influence on the size of the damage opening in the corroded ship structure compared to analyses including no strain rate dependence or de model hence no cowper symonds or de models were included in the fea with corroded material properties see ringsberg et al 2018a the corrosion margins of the struck coastal oil tanker estimated from the common structural rules for bulk carriers and oil tankers csr bc ot iacs 2019 are shown in fig 4 a full reduction of a corrosion margin could represent 25 years of operation for a vessel and a 50 reduction in the corrosion margin after approximately 16 years of operation paik et al 2003a the relationship between intervals of the remaining corrosion margin and their correlation with the material model used in fe analyses was established in kuznecovs and shafieisabet 2017 for plates with 0 reduction of as built thickness the nva virgin non corroded material was recommended for a 0 20 reduction the minorly corroded material was recommended and for a 20 40 reduction the severely corroded material was recommended these intervals are relevant for coastal oil tankers with different structural parts that have various percentages of loss of material due to corrosion fig 4b presents where in the ships cross section different material properties were used in the simulation models it was assumed that the physical condition of the corroded case study ship represented 25 years of aging and corrosion 2 2 biaxial bending loading simulations the main loading conditions experienced by a ship structure are bending induced by still water conditions including cargo weight distribution and from the waves if the ship is sailing in head or following seas the hull girder is normally subjected to vertical bending moment resulting in pure hogging or sagging moments however in case of oblique waves or a heeling angle resulting from partial flooding or parametric rolling the loading conditions give rise to biaxial bending moment where the ship is subjected to combined loading of both vertical and horizontal bending moments the fe model presented in subsection 2 1 was used to estimate the ultimate strength capacity of the case study vessel during biaxial loading conditions to estimate the ultimate strength due to bending moment s the fe model was bent in a prescribed direction beyond its ultimate state condition the applied loading continued beyond the uls to simulate the progressive collapse of different parts and structural elements due to buckling and plastic deformation the bending was applied to the fe model through displacement control following a procedure proposed by parunov et al 2018 and tekgoz et al 2018 the bending curvature was increased gradually linearly by the rotation of the end planes through controlled rotations of the cps see fig 5 for a schematic and subsection 2 1 for a detailed description of how the cps were defined to preserve pure bending one of the cps was pinned and restricted from translation in three directions while the other cp was allowed to move in the longitudinal x direction by controlling the ratio between the horizontal and vertical rotations the desired biaxial bending condition was achieved the applied curvature components were then χ h 2 φ z l and χ v 2 φ y l where φ z and φ y are the applied rotation angles around the z and y axes respectively and l is the distance between the cps the reaction moment at the cps was recorded for every curvature increment during bending the maximum point on the obtained total bending moment total curvature curve defined the ultimate strength as its uls bending moment and corresponding curvature it was shown in yamada 2014 2019 that the time duration of loading in explicit fea can have a significant influence on the ultimate bending moment fig 6 shows a convergence analysis conducted in this study with the intact non corroded fe model and presents the vertical bending moment vs applied curvature in hogging for three different loading times the shortest loading time t 0 05 s resulted in structural vibrations due to the sudden loading which led to an overestimation of the ultimate bending moment the longer loading time showed a decrease in this artificial dynamic response the convergence analysis showed that a loading time of 1 00 s was sufficient for the fe model used in the current investigation initial deformations and imperfections which occur during the manufacturing process of a ship affect its uls the presence of initial imperfections will reduce the ultimate strength of a hull due to decreased critical buckling stress of its components for the double bottom tanker the effect of initial imperfections is more critical in sagging due to the lower buckling strength of the weather deck as compared to the double bottom despite this the majority of studies in the literature that have analysed the uls using full ship fe models disregard the influence of these mainly due to the complexity of setting up the simulation model with e g initial imperfections this study did not include initial deformations and imperfections in the fe model for the same reason which was also supported by the argument that such imperfections were not and are normally not incorporated in the fe model used in the ship collision simulations thus ultimate strength predictions obtained from intact fe models used in this study may be slightly overestimated compared to fe models with initial imperfections notably the introduction of hull damage in an fe ship model used for uls analysis can be conducted in different ways ringsberg et al 2018a proposed first simulating the ship collision event and then continuing with the same fe model in the ultimate strength simulation analysis parunov et al 2018 proposed simplifying the shape and size of the damage opening and removing the corresponding elements in the fe model prior to the uls analysis with this simplification the shape and size of the damage may not be correct and the plastic deformation and failures of structural elements are disregarded with the smith method see section 3 similar assumptions and simplifications must be made and the material must also be elastic perfectly plastic thus section 4 presents the results from a sensitivity study on how these different damage modelling perspectives differ and affect the uls as well as a discussion on which alternative is the most suitable for the design of safe ships 3 smith method and models in numerical simulations using the fe method a substantial amount of time and effort is required to prepare the model and to conduct the simulation for example the computation time required to obtain one value of the ultimate bending moment using the undamaged fe model presented in section 2 is approximately 60 cpu hours on a desktop computer with four core processors working at a base frequency of 3 5 ghz and 32 gb ram the computational time and cost are high but the detailed results and the possibility of investigating different failure modes and post collapse characteristics justify it for a few feas for the same type of analysis simplified analysis procedures such as the smith method smith 1977 are less computationally demanding and much faster than the fe method requiring less than 1 min per loading case but have limitations in the type of results that can ultimately be provided for the purpose of uls analysis of the tanker ship in this study both analysis methods were tested one of the major advantages of the smith method is that it provides fast analyses this option can be beneficial for the rapid assessment of impacts on structural integrity such as after a collision or grounding accident or for parametric studies it also can be implemented as a code in more complex prediction tools to check for the effect of structural ageing or in real time reliability assessments of ship structure in this study the smith method further developed by fujikubo et al 2012 was implemented in the in house code used for uls analyses and was verified against other studies in the literature by kuznecovs and shafieisabet 2017 the method was used due its ability to consider the instant translation and rotation of the neutral axis na during bending the importance of including the na s two dimensional movement for correct estimation of the uls in the case of asymmetric geometry material distributions or load applications has been studied and discussed by several authors such as choung et al 2012 makouei et al 2015 smith and pegg 2003 and tekgoz et al 2018 the reader is referred to the work by fujikubo et al 2012 for a detailed description of the methodology in the following only the basics and some minor modifications to the method introduced by the authors are presented the smith method as proposed by fujikubo et al 2012 is a pure incremental seminumerical method for simplified uls analysis of ships during biaxial bending loading without torsion the cross section of the hull is divided into three types of structural elements stiffened plates stiffeners and hard corners in the current work the longitudinal girders with openings are modelled as two independent stiffened plate elements with a distance between them corresponding to the opening breadth the average stress responses in the hull s longitudinal direction for every element in the cross section due to imposed loading are described by load shortening elongation lse curves these curves can give the material and structure different stiffness properties and characteristics the lse curves in the present study were defined by the seminumerical expressions in the csr h rules in iacs 2019 as defined in the csr h rules the material in this simplified analysis in contrast to the more advanced and realistic material models used in an fe model was modelled as elastic perfectly plastic this assumption implies limitations on the post ultimate behaviour of the ship structure while holding reasonably well in the pre ultimate and ultimate regions see further discussion in section 4 the effect of initial imperfections and residual stresses e g due to welding were implicitly included in the smith method through the equations that define the lse curves according to the csr h rules in iacs 2019 hull damage caused by a collision event was modelled as a damage opening by removing and adjusting the geometry of the structural elements corresponding to the ruptured and severely plastically deformed elements in the ship s cross section lse curves of the modified elements were adjusted accordingly the longitudinal location of the representative cross section was chosen from the fea of the collision event by identification of the cross section that had the most extensive damage furthermore the influence of corrosion was determined following the method presented in subsection 2 2 the reduction in the thickness of structural elements and adjustment of the material properties were made according to table 2 note that only the elastic modulus and the yield stress were changed because the material curve of the smith method ship model must be represented by an elastic perfectly plastic curve in the smith method used in this study the changes in the global reaction forces and moments during bending at every curvature increment were found by integration of the tangential axial stiffness around the instant na throughout the whole cross section if the bending load was applied gradually and the curvature increments were sufficiently small no iterative procedure was required smith 1977 the change in the global structural response during biaxial bending under the prescribed moment ratio was found by incrementally solving a system of nonlinear equations 1 α δ m v δ m v d h h d h v d v h d v v δ χ h δ χ v d δ χ h δ χ v where the factor α δ m h δ m v is the ratio between the horizontal m h and vertical m v moment components d is the tangential stiffness matrix and δ χ h and δ χ v are the curvatures in the horizontal and vertical directions respectively from this definition it follows that pure horizontal and vertical bending is achieved when α and α 0 respectively to solve the equation system one of the curvature step components δ χ h or δ χ v should be prescribed for better numerical convergence δ χ v was prescribed when α 1 i e when the contribution from vertical bending prevailed while δ χ h was prescribed when α 1 the components of the tangential stiffness matrix d of the cross section of the ship model for a specified curvature were defined as 2 d v v i 1 n d i z i z g 2 a i 3 d h h i 1 n d i y i y g 2 a i 4 d h v d v h i 1 n d i y i y g z i z g a i where a i is the cross sectional area of an element y i and z i are the coordinates of an element s centre of mass and y g and z g are the centroid coordinates of the cross section see fig 7 the tangential stiffness d i of every i th element in the cross section subjected to bending at curvature step j was defined by the slope of the corresponding lse curve at instant strain for every curvature increment the centroid g of the instant na was found by equation 5 5 y g i 1 n d i a i y i i 1 n d i a i z g i 1 n d i a i z i i 1 n d i a i the obtained increments of the bending moment and the curvature were added to their cumulative values by plotting the total bending moment versus the total curvature the uls could be identified and defined as the maximum bending moment for the specific loading condition this was repeated for many combinations of horizontal and vertical bending moments by plotting their maxima in a biaxial plot an interaction curve describing the ship s ultimate strength for its specific bending and structural condition was produced for all possible biaxial bending moment combinations the bending moment load ratios are presented in polar diagrams which show the bending moment loading ratios in degrees and the uls values in the radial direction see fig 8 here for example 90 and 270 α 0 correspond to hogging and sagging respectively pure horizontal bending with the port side in tension occurs at 0 and compression occurs at 180 α 4 results and discussion this section presents the results from the simulations and analyses in four sections subsection 4 1 presents the fea of ship collision events in which the speed of the striking ship varied the outcome of these analyses was the target speed of the striking vessel which served as a representative candidate for the hull damage calculation due to collision used in the uls analyses in subsection 4 2 this section also presents a comparison of different alternatives for modelling hull damage and how these affect the uls predicted by fea or the smith method subsection 4 3 presents the results from the biaxial bending moment load analyses in which both the ultimate and residual strengths were assessed and compared between fea and the smith method finally in subsection 4 4 a method is proposed that shows how the smith method after calibration using results from a few feas becomes a more accurate and reliable method to assess a ship for these conditions 4 1 fea of ship collision shape and size of damage and structural deformation the damage caused to two ships involved in a collision depends on several factors such as their relative displacements the ship speeds the collision location the collision angle and the strength of their structures the schematic in fig 9 shows the different principal categories of damage to a struck ship and their dependence on the relative stiffnesses of the striking and struck ships norsok 2004 subsection 2 1 describes the two ships that were used to simulate the collision event in the current study the velocity of the struck ship was zero knots while the velocity of the striking ship was derived from analyses of several ship collision simulations to provide a realistic velocity for the uls analyses the initial velocity of the striking ship varied from 2 knots to 8 knots with an increment of 1 knot this was carried out for both the non corroded struck ship referred to as t1 and the corroded struck ship referred to as t5 note that the striking ship was always represented by a non corroded ship model the results are presented in fig 10 as the relative energies shared between frictional dissipation internal energy in the striking ship bow and the struck ship hull for the non corroded t1 cases the strength of the struck ship was large enough to deform the bow of the striking ship at low collision speeds more internal energy was dissipated in the struck ship because the penetration depth of the struck ship hardly reached the inner structure the share of the internal energies was more equal at high collision speeds because of the large penetration depth which resulted in large contact between the bow and side shell structure it also forced the forecastle to have a large amount of plastic deformation for the t5 cases the struck ship took the most internal energy because the strength of the structure was weakened due to the loss of corrosion margin and change in material properties the bow was still deformed at the highest collision speeds while it remained almost undeformed at the lowest collision speeds frictional dissipation was larger for t5 than for t1 due to the higher friction coefficient in the contact between surfaces the results in fig 10 show that the structural deformation and energy dissipation according to fig 9 probably corresponded to the shared energy design for t1 and ductile design for t5 by calculating the relative internal energy share ratio for the struck ship r ie struck according to equation 6 it was confirmed in fig 11 a that this was true for t1 and for t5 except for when the ship speed was 5 knots in this case the results were more or less on the border line between the shared energy and ductile designs fig 11b presents the projected damaged areas of the inner and outer side shells the results show that for t5 at 5 knots there was a drastic increase in the damage opening area because of these results 5 knots was chosen as the reference collision velocity for the striking ship in the collision scenario and is also a speed often used in similar types of ship collision studies 6 r i e s t r u c k i e s t r u c k i e s t r i k i n g i e s t r u c k 100 4 2 comparison of fea and smith method selected cases 4 2 1 intact ship structure the results from the fea of the intact ship structure with new non corroded material were compared against analyses using a smith method model for the bending moment load directions 0 60 90 and 270 which corresponded to horizontal bending biaxial bending hogging and sagging conditions respectively fig 12 presents the bending moment curvature diagrams and the longitudinal stress distributions at the maximum bending moment from fea and the smith method the difference between the methods in the predicted ultimate bending moment values was between 5 and 18 which is reasonably good however the predicted post collapse behaviour varied to a larger degree it was also found that the uls was reached at a larger bending curvature and a higher bending moment in three of the four cases with the smith model than with fea these differences may be explained by the definition of the lse curves in the smith method model which were defined according to iacs 2019 where nonlinear behaviour of the structure elements was defined using the ramberg osgood formula with a correction for plasticity since the elastic stiffness seemed to be less for the smith model than for the fe model the value of the curvature at the uls should be higher for the former than for the latter initial imperfections were implicitly incorporated in the formulae of lse curves while no geometrical distortions were introduced in the fe model this should presumably lead to lower strength estimates which is supported by the benchmark studies from czujko et al 2018 and soares et al 2008 nevertheless the smith method applied in the current study generally overestimates ultimate strength compared to fea similar trends were found in works by parunov et al 2018 and tekgoz et al 2018 the selected approach for modelling a cross section could be the source of variance in the results for example if elements at the intersection of plates are modelled as stiffened plates their behaviour in compression will be affected by buckling this will decrease the element s critical stress and the global strength of the hull in contrast if elements are assumed to act as hard corners instead i e elastic perfectly plastic buckling will not be considered in this case the elastic limit will be reached at increased curvature values the stiffness of the cross section in the plastic region will increase and the uls will thus be affected different sequences of failure modes predicted by the smith method are another possible reason for the overestimation of bending strength for example the examination of the fea results for hogging 90 loading direction showed that bottom buckling is triggered first according to the discussion above and the characteristics of the cross section studied double bottom and side plating consists of many hard corner elements due to the high stiffness of bottom plating failure of the weather deck in yielding occurs prior to buckling of the double bottom the yielding of elements in the upper part of the cross section will force the na to move downwards resulting in a redistribution of the loads and postponing the occurrence of instability in the plating at the keel level the inclusion of hard corner elements is prescribed by crs h rules in addition interconnected plates fail mainly due to yielding in compression iacs 2019 since their stiffness is radically higher than the stiffness of an assembly of independent stiffened plate elements thus despite the observed trends it is believed that hard corners should be included in modelling for a realistic representation of a cross section the longitudinal stress distributions in the cross sections at uls showed good agreement between fea and the smith method the structural responses for both symmetric and asymmetric bending conditions agreed well a comparison between the failure modes of the structures showed good agreement with the way distorted elements and their collapse modes occurred the smith method results showed the movement and rotation of the na passing through the points in the cross section with zero stresses in conclusion this initial comparison between the two methods showed that the fe model and smith method model seemed to agree reasonably well 4 2 2 collision damaged ship structure the ship collision event was simulated according to subsection 2 1 using the ship speed of 5 knots for the striking ship according to subsection 4 1 after the striking ship penetrated the mid ship section of the struck vessel and reached zero knots the bow of the striking ship was removed the names of the fea ship collision simulations are t1d for the non corroded ship and t5d for the corroded ship t5d these simulations gave realistic shapes and sizes of the damage openings as well as plastic deformations and failures of several structural elements fig 13 presents the damage openings and equivalent plastic strains for t1d and t5d in both cases there was penetration through both of the side shells and large plastic deformations of the structures the structural damage was larger for t5d than for t1d because of the corroded material and reduced corrosion margins the damage opening area was almost two times larger see fig 11b and the damage in the upper part near the weather deck was more prominent for t1d than for t5d the outer plating was ruptured where the striking bow s forecastle impacted the struck ship the internal longitudinals transverse stiffeners and bulkheads between plating were more severely distorted using fea it was possible to continue with the ultimate strength analysis simulation according to the procedure presented in subsection 2 2 however it was not possible with the smith method to represent damage openings distorted structural elements or the plastic strain field in the same way a study was therefore carried out to investigate how different degrees of simplification of collision damaged structure modelling affect the uls see fig 14 the analyses were limited to hogging and sagging conditions five cases were defined for comparison case a full fea where the uls fea was carried out by restarting the ship collision fea after the struck vessel was removed case b fea where the fe model used in the uls analysis had a damage opening shape and size corresponding to the projected damage area from the ship collision fea note only the shape and size of the damage opening were included no other structural distortions failures or plastic deformations were considered case c fea where the fe model used in the uls analysis had a damage opening as defined in the smith method model see section 3 case d fea with the same fe model as in case c except that the material model was changed to the elastic perfectly plastic material model used in the smith method model case e uls analysis using the smith method model fig 15 presents the results from the t1d and t5d uls analyses for hogging and sagging conditions for hogging there was a large difference between cases a and e i e the fea and smith method there were minor differences between cases b c and d which were between cases a and e the results for hogging for both t1d and t5d showed the importance of not simplifying the material and damage modelling with regards to 3 issues i the damage opening area should not be simplified ii a realistic representation of the material s characteristics should be used and iii deformed structures and plastic strains should not be disregarded the sagging results showed the same trend for cases a b and e as for hogging however cases c and d showed larger ultimate bending moments than all the other cases an analysis of the deformation of the fe ship model for these cases revealed that the simplified damage opening was the reason for these case results the shape of the simplified damage opening delayed the failure modes of neighbouring structural elements and led to a higher ultimate bending moment compared in cases c and d than in cases a and b which had a more realistic damage opening shape thus these cases confirmed that simplified modelling of collision induced damage openings should be avoided in fe analysis fig 16 presents the results after the ultimate bending moments have been normalised by the corresponding case a ultimate bending moment the figure shows that all cases gave a high ultimate bending moment compared to the full fea solution case a which was recommended in this study in the remaining part of the study the case a method was compared with the case e method i e full fea and the smith method respectively the results in fig 16 indicate that the smith method overestimated the ultimate bending moments compared to fea for hogging and sagging the sizes of this overestimation under biaxial bending moment loading conditions are presented in subsection 4 3 4 3 comparison of fea and smith method biaxial bending moment loading conditions 4 3 1 ultimate strength analyses the smith method according to iacs 2019 is only applicable for pure vertical bending of undamaged ship structures it does not consider rotation of the na and thus the smith method is not able to capture nonlinear structural collapse correctly for a ship structure subjected to biaxial bending fig 17 presents the interaction curves of the ultimate bending moments during biaxial loading conditions from fea and the smith method proposed in this investigation the smith method in iacs 2019 is included for comparison but only for the t1i case in hogging and sagging conditions the results for the t1i case in fig 17a show that the tanker had a higher strength in the hogging condition than in the sagging condition because of the double bottom structure which made a greater contribution than the single upper deck to the strength the highest ultimate strength was found for pure horizontal bending since the side shell structures had a large distance to the centroid on the centerline resulting in a high contribution to the moment of inertia the results for the ultimate strength in vertical bending were identical for the smith and csr h methods with differences of less than 1 the discrepancies between the smith method and fea were 8 and 5 for hogging and sagging respectively thus the agreement between the three methods was considered to be good for pure vertical bending conditions for all other loading combinations the smith method showed a larger ultimate strength than the fea the causes and reasoning in subsection 4 2 1 also affected the other bending moment load combinations but the shortcomings of the smith method resulted in a larger difference between the two methods in addition for the corroded ship structure case t5i shown in fig 17b the trend was the same the smith method gave a slightly larger ultimate strength than the fea notably there was also a significant reduction in the ultimate strength capacity between t1i and t5i due to corrosion the sagging condition was affected more than the hogging condition due to the large loss in hull strength in the upper deck see fig 4b for the corrosion conditions fig 17c and d presents the results from the damaged ship structures with the damage opening on the port side of the ship the largest reduction in ultimate strength for case t1d occurred in the second and third quadrants when the damaged side of the ship was in compression see fig 8 the asymmetry was captured by both fea and the smith method there was also a minor effect in the first and fourth quadrants compared to the t1i case where the modelling of the damage opening showed a larger effect for fea than for the smith method model as discussed in subsection 4 2 for the corroded ship case t5d there was a significant reduction in ultimate strength compared to t1d where as in the t5i case there was a larger reduction in the sagging condition than in the hogging condition again both methods captured the asymmetry due to the single side damage opening in contrast with the t1d case the fea results for t5d showed a large reduction in the first quadrant when the damaged side of the ship was in tension an analysis of all feas showed that this can be explained by the damage and plastic deformations caused by the forecastle which led to a large reduction in strength especially for these combinations of horizontal end bending moment loading conditions 4 3 2 residual strength index rsi calculation the reserve strength of the case study ship was calculated in a residual strength analysis by the calculation of the rsi proposed by fang and das 2004 this was carried out for the three cases t1d t5i and t5d for fea and the smith method where t1i was the reference for both methods see fig 18 the fea results show a larger decrease than the smith method results in rsi for the t1d case the difference can be explained by the simplification of the damage modelling in the smith method see subsection 4 2 which can also be seen clearly in the asymmetric rsi results which were better captured by fea for the corroded ship cases there was a larger reduction in the rsi for fea than for the smith method this can be explained by joint effects of too simplified damage and corrosion modelling in the smith method as found and discussed in the previous sections of this study 4 4 calibration method fea and smith method the results in the previous sections show that the fea predicted lower uls values for the biaxial bending moment loading conditions than the smith method however each point on the fea interaction curve took approximately 60 cpu hours to compute see section 3 while the entire interaction curve consisting of 35 points for the smith method took 5 cpu minutes to calculate on the same computer one of the advantages of using the fe method is the possibility of performing a detailed and accurate analysis of each specific load combination and simulation scenario however if a high resolution of data points in the uls interaction curve must be obtained these analyses will be too demanding since the results in the previous sections showed that mostly the peak values of the uls differed between the fea and smith methods a calibration method using a curve fitting procedure was developed that makes use of as few feas as possible to generate correction factors for the main results of the smith method a uls interaction curve for an intact and non corroded ship can be approximated by equation 7 gordo and soares 1997 where m y and m z are coordinates on the fitted curve m u h and m u v are the ultimate horizontal and vertical bending moments respectively and β is a shape factor with β 2 corresponding to an ellipse and β 1 giving a shape similar to an ellipse 7 m y m u v β m z m u h β 1 for the damaged ship cases with asymmetric hull damage the results in subsection 4 3 showed that the uls interaction curve was different in all quadrants especially when ship corrosion was also included thus to generalise the calibration procedure curve fitting was unique to each quadrant it is recommended that at least four feas should be used for curve fitting in each quadrant to determine the shape factors thus in total only 12 feas are needed since pure vertical and horizontal bending can be shared points between quadrants note that for an intact structure 7 points are sufficient due to symmetry around the vertical axis curve fitting was carried out by finding the solution with the lowest rmse value between equation 7 and the points obtained by fea based on the curves fitted using equation 7 in each quadrant both for fea and the smith method calibration factors c f were calculated as the ratio between the two methods fitted parameters the c f s for pure horizontal and vertical ultimate bending moments were defined as c f h m u h f e a m u h s m i t h and c f v m u v f e a m u v s m i t h respectively the c f for the shape factor was defined as c f β β f e a β s m i t h the new formulation of a calibrated interaction curve using the smith method can then be described by equation 8 8 m y m u v s m i t h c f v β s m i t h c f β m z m u h s m i t h c f h β s m i t h c f β 1 fig 19 presents the results where calibration was performed for cases t1i t5i t1d and t5d the results showed good agreement between the fea and the smith method with calibrated values according to equation 8 table 3 presents a summary of all curve fitted parameters needed to plot the interaction curves using equation 8 with the proposed procedure which requires only a few fea results together with the smith method a high resolution interaction curve can be obtained with high confidence and rapidness compared to the time it takes to run many feas to obtain the same interaction curve resolution 5 conclusions this study presented ultimate and residual strength analyses of a double hull tanker ship during biaxial bending moment conditions two methods were compared advanced nonlinear fe analyses and the smith method according to fujikubo et al 2012 the case study vessel was analysed from the perspective of an intact hull and a hull damaged due to ship collision under two physical conditions newly built non corroded and aged due to corrosion the results for the non corroded and intact ship hull structures showed good agreement between the fea the smith method and iacs csr h for vertical bending loading conditions for all other load combinations the ultimate bending moments were always lower for the fea than for the smith method it was found that this discrepancy was related to how the material modelling in the smith method was proposed in the iacs 2019 procedures for corroded and intact ship hull structures the difference was larger which was also found to be due to the simplified material modelling in the smith method model prior to uls analyses of the collision damaged hull structures a sensitivity study on the ultimate strength in hogging and sagging conditions due to various accepted simplifications during the modelling of hull damage was performed it was found that the smith method because of restrictions and the possibility to model hull damage overestimated the uls compared to fea which was considered more trustworthy and realistic hence the smith method resulted in unconservative results for safe ship design with respect to ultimate strength the cause of this result was found to be related to three issues which resulted in three recommendations i the shape and size of the damage opening should not be simplified to simplistic shapes ii a representative constitutive material model for the material s true characteristics should be used and iii deformed structures and plastic strains should not be disregarded the results from ultimate strength analyses of the collision damaged ship structures showed that both fea and the smith method captured the expected asymmetric response in ultimate strength due to asymmetric damage the rsi calculation showed that the reduction was larger for fea than for the smith method and was often the largest for biaxial bending moment loadings than for pure vertical bending moment conditions this showed the importance of calibrating the smith method for uls analyses for biaxial bending moment conditions a procedure for such a calibration combining the results from a few feas and the advantages of the smith method was proposed with this procedure the advantages of detailed fea for damaged ship structure and corrosion are improvements compared to the simplifications made using the smith method alone the proposal also gives a safe ship design procedure with ultimate strength bending moments that are not overestimated due to model simplifications or
