22835,developing design tools to make more information available sooner is desirable because decisions of the greatest impact are made in early stages of ship design moreover there is still room for improvement in the optimisation of energy system selection considering an integrated approach therefore the present work aims to provide a comprehensive early stage approach to optimise the design synthesis and operation of a marine energy system for liquified gas carriers considering their economic and technical aspects and also weather along the route constraints are used to avoid propellers that could present issues concerning strength cavitation and vibration various propellers engines and operational profiles can be assessed with this approach a differential evolution optimisation algorithm that maximises the net present value is applied this part of the study details the approach that we have developed while the case study results and discussion and the main conclusions are given in part b different parameters can be set up in each route track which enables various operational profiles and sea conditions to be considered to seek the highest net present value the proposed approach is expected to be able to automatically search a broad range of possible alternatives and then make small refinements to achieve the optimal arrangement keywords optimisation propulsion dual fuel diesel engine fixed pitch propeller net present value 1 introduction liquefied natural gas carriers lngcs are specialised ships that are designed to transport liquefied natural gas lng they are fitted with insulated double hulled tanks that are designed to contain the cargo slightly above atmospheric pressure at a cryogenic temperature without means of external refrigeration typically the design pressure and temperature are around 0 7 bar g and 169 c respectively the lng density lies between 430 and 470 kg m3 depending on its composition and state the composition is predominantly methane ch4 with smaller fractions of ethane c2h6 propane c3h8 butane c4h10 and nitrogen n2 mokhatab et al 2014 despite the high level of insulation that is used in the cargo tanks some vaporisation occurs because it is impossible to avoid heat transfer from the surroundings to the cargo this evaporated lng which is also called boil off gas bog induces a pressure increase and thereby a certain amount of the vapour phase should be taken out of the tank to avoid dangerous overpressure usually this outlet gas flow is used as fuel by the marine energy system of the ship to reduce its main fuel consumption miana et al 2010 for many years steam propulsion plants were an exclusive option for lngcs due to their ability to burn the unavoidable bog directly in the power boiler however as environmental economic and technical expectations have increased the drawbacks of the steam turbine power plant have made it a less attractive option these drawbacks include the comparatively low efficiency of the plant its high fuel consumption high exhaust emissions and large engine room space requirement moreover advances in the design of dual fuel diesel engines shipboard bog re liquefaction plants and marine gas turbines have provided meaningful alternatives to the traditional steam power plant moreover propulsion systems based on slow speed two stroke diesel engines driving fixed pitch propellers with inboard re liquefaction system have been successfully used in large lngcs whenever conventional fuel prices are higher than lng price the operational expenditure opex of propulsion systems unable to use bog as fuel is increased mokhatab et al 2014 thus dual fuel diesel engines offer an option to overcome this drawback these are compression ignition engines that are able to work in two operational modes diesel mode and gas mode woodyard 2009 in the former mode the engine works as a conventional diesel engine whilst in the latter mode only a small fraction of liquid fuel is used as a pilot to start the combustion moreover conventional fuels are not as clean as the bog because natural gas is considered environmentally friendly for various reasons natural gas combustion can lead to approximately 20 lower carbon dioxide co2 emissions compared to diesel oil combustion schlick 2014 in four stroke lean burn marine engines this reduction can reach up to 30 levander 2011 the co2 emission reduction can be assigned to the lower carbon to hydrogen mass ratio of natural gas compared to diesel oil levander 2011 haraldson 2011 moreover can be achieved a decrement of about 79 in nitrogen oxides 100 in sulphur oxides and 92 in particulate matter given in parts per billion of energy unit kumar et al 2011 on the other hand there is a concern on methane slip because it will always be present with dual fuel technologies methane slip will be included in the greenhouse gases picture and thereby lead to a high penalty on future taxations mcgill et al 2013 more detailed information on advantages and disadvantages of natural gas as marine fuel can be found in papagiannakis et al 2018 given that the prime mover is usually operated until the end of the ship s lifetime its selection is one of the major elements in merchant shipbuilding projects although a complete criteria list for choosing main machinery is given in watson 2002 and many considerations are presented in lamb 2003 bulut et al 2015 defined six major selection criteria based on interviews with a group of technical experts and managers of selected shipping companies the following elements were highlighted power acquisition cost fuel consumption maintenance majority in existing merchant fleet and damage history of the model power is on the top of the list because the engine needs to be able to provide enough power to satisfy the ship s operational profile acquisition cost is a major indicator of the project s financial feasibility because it represents about 10 of the total cost of a new building project another significant indicator of financial feasibility is fuel consumption maintenance attributes can be divided into two considerations the ease of maintenance and the cost of maintenance the most popular engines used in the existing merchant fleet or common practice is an important aspect because if a specific model and brand of diesel engine is frequently preferred then this may denote its superiority in overall circumstances a similar indicator is the damage history of the model or reliability which illustrates the engine s structural and mechanical hardness in practical life these two criteria illustrate why the design of a new machinery system is typically based on traditional concepts solem et al 2015 for ships navigating across large oceans considerations about the weather conditions are essential for the ship s safe and efficient operation the environment exposes the ship to loads from wind waves and currents which all change the operating point of the ship s energy system skoglund et al 2014 to ensure safe passage arrival on time minimised operational costs and minimal environmental impact it is important that the weather that is expected to be found throughout the route is taken into account during the early stages of the project another of the challenges of ship design is that the decisions of the greatest impact are made in the early stages of design when the least information and greatest uncertainty are present chalfant 2015 hence developing ship design tools to make more information available sooner and pushing decision points for later examination is advisable in this sense simulations of the overall ship energy system and optimisation studies are of great interest 1 1 state of the art benvenuto et al 1994 presented a computer simulation model that is able to predict the dynamic behaviour of a whole marine propulsion system and to evaluate the influence of its three main elements ship propeller and prime mover kyrtatos et al 1999 carried out a propulsion plant simulation of a container ship to assess the engine performance in different operating conditions michalski michalski 2478 conceived an algorithmic method for preliminary selection of parameters of a ship propulsion system fitted with fixed pitch propeller and diesel engine chen and shih 2007 addressed a two objective parametric optimisation problem regarding wageningen b screw series propeller design dimopoulos et al 2008 performed a study focused on the optimisation of synthesis design and operation of a marine energy system for a cruise liner fitted with a combined gas turbine electric and steam system coges similar works about lngcs fitted with coges which did not model either the propeller or the ship movement can be found in dimopoulos and frangopoulos 2008a and dimopoulos and frangopoulos 2008b theotokatos 2008 investigated the transient response of the overall ship propulsion plant for a merchant ship under various operating conditions aldous and smith 2012 described a service speed optimisation model for lngcs considering ship geometric parameters propeller characteristics and engine specifications theotokatos and tzelepis 2013 mapped the performance and emission parameters for a merchant vessel propulsion system over the ship s operating envelop dimopoulos et al 2014 presented the dnv cossmos modelling framework for integrated marine machinery systems man man 2014 presented an overview about lngcs fitted with slow speed dual fuel diesel engines using high pressure and a gas supply system cichowicz et al 2015 introduced a methodology to assess the dynamic energy performance of a ship at a global level for any given period of time lu et al 2015 developed an accurate and practical ship operational performance prediction model that can be used to select the optimal routes for minimum fuel consumption taking into consideration average ship speed encountering sea states and voyage time tillig et al 2016 presented a generic holistic model for simulating ship energy systems so that the ship s energy consumption could be predicted for different operating conditions since the shipping industry has been facing great pressure to become more sustainable a number of studies aiming to improve the performance of ship energy systems were developed in the last year mizythras et al 2018 developed an integrated simulation model considering engine propeller and hull hydrodynamics to predict a ship s propulsion system performance during acceleration manoeuvres tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 stated a fully dynamic optimisation problem for the integrated energy system of a ship and solved it by a single level algorithm using appropriate dynamic optimisation procedures the single level optimisation for the synthesis design and operation of ship energy systems was also addressed by sakalis and frangopoulos 2018 who proposed a general inter temporal method to tackle this issue trivyza et al 2018 presented a method to optimise the synthesis of ship energy systems considering environmental and economic objectives as well as operational and regulatory requirements during the ship lifetime 1 2 research gap to the best of authors knowledge this is the first comprehensive study to focus on the optimisation of energy system selection for lngcs fitted with dual fuel low speed diesel engines considering engine propeller and weather conditions within an integrated approach similar comprehensive approaches to simulate and optimise ship energy systems are also found in tillig et al 2016 tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 sakalis and frangopoulos 2018 trivyza et al 2018 the low occurrence of studies found about the optimisation of diesel engine selection might arise from the shortage of suitable engine models for optimisation problems according to schulten 2005 five main sorts of engine models can be recognised computational fluid dynamics cfd models phenomenological multi dimensional models crank angle models mean value models and transfer function models within cfd engine models which are the most complex the volume studied is divided into thousands of volumes or elements and the basic conservation equations are solved for each volume meanwhile if the cylinder is divided into a smaller number of volumes tens and additionally to the basic conservation equations phenomenological equations are solved a phenomenological multi dimensional model is obtained however these approaches are unsuitable for optimisation problems considering the overall energy system of a ship due to the high computational time that is required crank angle models are also called zero dimensional engine models 0 dems because they do not have a strict mathematical dependence on any of the dimensions these models treat each one of the various engine elements as a control volume and they then solve the differential equations with a time step equivalent to one degree of the crankshaft s rotation nevertheless whether an engine model is inserted into a propulsion system the variations that occur for each crankshaft angle of rotation are generally not of primary interest in this case overall engine operating parameters are the focus and they can be obtained by using a mean value engine model mvem this model has basically the same origin of the 0 dem but as its time step in the order of one crankshaft rotation while the variation of each parameter within the cylinder is replaced by a mean value some references about 0 dems can be found in kyrtatos et al 1999 medica et al 2009 payri et al 2011 guan et al 2015 mavrelos and theotokatos 2018 whereas mvems were addressed in theotokatos 2008 2010 theotokatos and tzelepis 2013 cichowicz et al 2015 malkhede et al 2005 guan et al 2014 in addition a combination of mvem and 0 dem for a large marine four stroke and two stroke diesel engine was presented in baldi et al 2015 and theotokatos et al 2018 respectively when there is no interest in the engine s internal processes the engine can be merely represented by functions that relate for instance load and speed to specific fuel consumption this is the so called transfer function engine model tfem which is the simplest and fastest method consequently this sort of modelling is the most suitable for the design optimisation of the ship s overall energy system some references in this field can be found in benvenuto et al 1994 tillig et al 2016 tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 sakalis and frangopoulos 2018 trivyza et al 2018 stefanopoulou and smith 2000 benvenuto and campora 2005 altosole and figari 2011 martelli 2014 marques et al 2017 however models appropriate for iterative procedures that do not require calibration for every single engine were developed in tillig et al 2016 tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 sakalis and frangopoulos 2018 marques et al 2017 all based on regression analyses being the last one used in the present work because addressing dual fuel low speed diesel engines 1 3 proposal the present work proposes a comprehensive early stage approach to optimise the design synthesis and operation of lngc energy systems considering economic and technical aspects including weather conditions this approach must assess various configurations of propellers and prime movers to find the best matching and it also considers a different number of propulsion chains the need for a re liquefaction plant must also be assessed constraints must be incorporated to avoid propellers that can present issues regarding strength cavitation and vibration this approach must assess different operational profiles regarding service speeds and fuel to maximise the net present value npv this measure of merit considers opex income and capital expenditures capex the proposed approach is expected to be able to automatically search a broad range of possible alternatives and then make small refinements to achieve the optimal arrangement although this can be seen as an extension of what one could theoretically accomplish manually the labour involved would be prohibitive the next sections will present the methodology in detail and they will draw a preliminary conclusion the case study results and discussion and the main conclusions will be presented in part b of this work marques et al 2019 2 methodology to set up a comprehensive approach to be used for shipowners and marine engineers the proposed approach includes technical and economic aspects and also considers the weather along the route given that the npv is a common economic measure of merit our method consists of an optimisation process whose objective function to be maximised is the npv and whose design variables are propulsion parameters and service speeds thus the purpose is to find the synthesis of components their design characteristics and the operational profile that maximise the npv of an lngc herein the synthesis of components refers to the condition of the propulsion system to hold one or two main engines each one driving a propeller and the existence of shipboard re liquefaction the component design characteristics refer to the propeller and engine specification the operational profile refers to the service speed and the fuel to be burnt in each part of the journey namely the fuel profile once a computational environment becomes necessary all of the computations were performed in matlab the proposed approach will be explained hereinafter by means of flowcharts and an overview of each model will then be given fig 1 illustrates the proposed approach towards the optimisation of synthesis design and operation for an lngc energy system this figure shows the different computations that were followed in addition to their input and output data first of all a number n of way points nodes must be placed over the route dividing it into n 1 route tracks stages such as a one dimensional grid given a guess of optimisation design variables that is propulsion parameters and service speed the first step is to estimate the brake power and shaft speed in service for each route track in laden and ballast conditions as detailed in fig 2 the next steps are to compute the specified maximum continuous rating smcr and then determine the suitable engines still considering the initial guess of design variables the fourth step is to assess the npv for each suitable engine by considering the different fuel profiles as detailed in fig 3 having accomplished this a simple search is performed for the matching of engine and fuel profile that holds the maximum npv which is the optimum for that guess of design variables all these steps are executed iteratively by the optimisation algorithm and convergence is verified at the end of each run if the algorithm converged then the optimum engine propeller matching was reached otherwise a new guess of propulsion parameters is taken by the optimisation algorithm as detailed in fig 4 similarly if there is no suitable engine among the available options during a run then that initial guess of design variables is considered to be infeasible and the optimisation algorithm interrupts the run to guess new design variables and returns to the first step the proposed procedure to estimate the brake power and shaft speed in service for each route track is shown in fig 2 the procedure starts by computing the total hydrodynamic resistance concerning specified weather conditions and then computing the total resistance in service conditions next comes the computation of propulsion factors followed by calculation of propeller performance having accomplished this the technical constraints related to strength cavitation and vibration are verified if any of these criteria are not met then the design variables are considered infeasible and the run is interrupted otherwise the run proceeds to the computation of brake power in service the npv estimation for each matching of engine and fuel profile is achieved by following the procedure illustrated in fig 3 which shows the computations and their input and output data this consists of computing capital expenditures capex operational expenditures opex and then the npv fig 4 shows the iterative procedure of the differential evolution optimisation algorithm applied it is an evolutionary and stochastic algorithm in other words it attempts to mimic nature and does not make use of the gradient of the objective function as a direction of optimisation colaço et al 2006 one individual design is first randomly created by the uniform distribution continuous approach mathworks 2016 and its objective function is assessed if design variables are infeasible then that individual is rejected and another is created to replace it otherwise this individual is kept in the population this is done until a full population is created such that there are only capable individuals feasible design variables in the initial population then an offspring member is generated from the initial population and its objective function is assessed if the offspring is better than its main progenitor then it replaces its main progenitor in the population otherwise the offspring is rejected this proceeds until every member of the initial population has been the main progenitor of an offspring that is until a generation has elapsed the best member of the population after a predetermined number of generations is considered to be the optimum design some of the variables involved in this optimisation are time dependent such as unit costs journey charges weather and consequently propulsion load if those time dependencies were introduced the problem could be characterized as a dynamic optimisation problem dop and thereby its complexity would increase dramatically tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 the goal of methods dealing with dops is no longer to locate a stationary optimal solution but to track its movement through the solution and time spaces as close as possible evolutionary techniques and their variants have been the most widely used methods to solve dops but other approaches are gaining ever more attention in the past years cruz et al 2011 on the other hand the problem could be studied as stationary and its time dependencies approached by uncertainties on the variables in general the literature presents two optimisation approaches to deal with data uncertainty robust and stochastic the stochastic optimisation assumes that the true probability distribution of uncertain data is known or estimated the robust optimisation assumes that the uncertain data resides in the so called uncertainty set being popular because of its computational tractability for many classes of uncertainty sets and problem types gorissen et al 2015 for the sake of simplicity only mean values of the variables were used and the uncertainties were neglected in the present study 2 1 computation of resistance for specified weather conditions according to carlton 2012 many approaches can be used to compute total ship resistance in still water and also to estimate added resistance due to rough weather regarding still water the usual approach whenever algebraic models are required is the well known holtrop mennen model holtrop and mennen 1982 holtrop 1984 which is a statistical power prediction method based on a regression analysis of random model experiments and full scale test data based on geometric parameters and speed this model provides an approximated value of the total propulsion resistance in still water r t s w rough weather during voyages changes the resistance and affects the behaviour of the vessel to predict the added resistance semi empirical approaches are more suitable than other more complex cases where a high computational time is required lu et al 2015 kwon s model kwon 2008 is an approximate method for predicting speed loss of a displacement type ship due to added resistance in weather conditions irregular waves and wind the advantage of this method is that it is easy and practical to use it is based on eq 1 where v r w is service speed in rough weather v s w is service speed in still water c β is a direction reduction coefficient c u is a speed reduction coefficient and c f o r m is a ship form coefficient 1 v r w v s w 1 c β c u c f o r m 100 because v r w is a design variable in the present work v s w was calculated by eq 1 and then the corresponding r t s w was obtained by eq 2 in this equation r f is frictional resistance 1 k 1 is the form factor of the hull r a p p is appendage resistance r w is wave resistance r b is additional pressure resistance of bulbous bow near the water surface r t r is additional pressure resistance due to transom immersion and r a is the model ship correlation resistance 2 r t s w r f 1 k 1 r a p p r w r b r t r r a therefore we consider that the ship is sailing at v r w which is generally lower than the corresponding v s w but the resistance is that one related to the corresponding v s w to calculate these coefficients it is necessary to know some parameters related to weather such as weather direction angle with respect to the ship s bow and beaufort number bn in addition ship parameters and service speed weather direction is assumed to be the same as wind surface waves while the beaufort number is a number used to represent a range of wave heights and sea conditions which can be taken as a function of the wind speed in m s at a height of 10 m above sea level v 10 such as illustrated in eq 3 schneekluth and bertram 1998 as the route is not being optimised it is reasonable to assume that extreme weather conditions occurring occasionally would not be influential on the system synthesis design and overall operation although the system behaves differently under adverse weather if an extreme condition was used as the design condition the system would be oversized most of the time therefore the monthly means of daily means for zonal and meridional wind components 10 m u wind component and 10 m v wind component in addition to the absolute wind speed 10 m wind speed provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts for medium range we 2016 was used it should however be noted that the measured data supported by this server includes interpolated data depending on the wished grid 3 b n v 10 0 836 1 5 2 2 computation of total resistance in service a well chosen design condition must be realistic and representative for the service conditions that the ship will encounter during its operational life therefore the total resistance in service r t s e r is related to the trial total resistance r t t r i by the service margin sm as shown in eq 4 the service margin can be built as a product of factors including effects of fouling s m f hull form s m h displacement s m d weather s m w and water depth s m w d as illustrated in eq 5 woud and stapersma 2013 4 r t s e r s m r t t r i 5 s m s m f s m h s m d s m w s m w d herein the effects regarding hull form displacement and weather have already been taken into account by the previous computation and it is also assumed that the ship sails in deep waters most of the time hence the only factor with a different value is fouling s m f which is recommended to be taken as a 3 increase in resistance per year woud and stapersma 2013 2 3 computation of propulsion factors only a part of the thrust produced by the propellers is used to overcome the pure towing resistance of a ship the remaining part has to overcome the added resistance created by the presence of the propellers themselves furthermore the propellers are located within a region where the water velocity is affected by the hull s presence i e the ship s propeller wake thus the thrust deduction factor t must be considered when calculating the thrust t h and the wake factor w must be considered when calculating the advance velocity of the propeller v a these calculations are shown respectively in eq 6 where z p is the number of propellers and eq 7 6 t h r t s e r z p 1 t 7 v a 1 w v r w the equations given by holtrop and mennen holtrop and mennen 1982 holtrop 1984 which are based on ship and propeller parameters and also on service speed were applied to obtain these propulsion factors and also the relative rotative efficiency η r the latter is used subsequently to calculate brake power in service 2 4 computation of propeller performance over the years a considerable number of standard series propellers have been tested in many establishments around the world and those most commonly used by propeller designers and analysts are referenced in carlton 2012 the wageningen b screw series also known as troost series is perhaps the most extensive and widely used propeller series and therefore it was applied in this present study the thrust and torque coefficients k t and k q of the screws are expressed as polynomials in the advance ratio j the pitch ratio p d the blade area ratio a e a o and the number of blades z in addition the effect of the reynolds number r n is taken into account in the polynomials oosterveld and ossannen 1975 thus the relationships shown in eqs 8 and 9 were used to calculate the non dimensional thrust and torque provided by the propeller 8 k t f 1 j p d a e a o z r n 9 k q f 2 j p d a e a o z r n meanwhile by using open water diagram the non dimensional thrust required by the ship k t s 1 1 subscript s stands for ship was calculated by eq 10 once k t must equal k t s the issue is to find the value of j which was made by solving an equation system then shaft speed n and torque q were calculated by eq 11 and eq 12 respectively where ρ is the water density 10 k t s t h ρ v a 2 d 2 j 2 11 n v a j d 12 q k q ρ n 2 d 5 lastly open water power p o and efficiency η o were obtained respectively from eq 13 and eq 14 13 p o 2 π q n 14 η o 1 2 π j k t k q 2 5 constraints the propulsion design variables were only considered to be feasible if approved for all criteria namely propeller blade resistance cavitation propeller peripheral velocity and resonance each criterion was tested in that order and more details about them are given below 2 5 1 propeller blade strength the inequality given in eq 15 was used to constrain propellers with unsatisfactory strength properties the blade thickness at 75 of the propeller radius t 0 75 r must not be less than the minimum thickness required t 0 75 r m i n approaches for t 0 75 r and t 0 75 r m i n given by oosterveld and ossannen 1975 were used as written in eqs 16 and 17 respectively this latter equation is not dimensionally homogeneous and hence d is propeller diameter in ft p s is the power delivered by each blade in hp s c is the maximum allowable stress of the propeller material in psi and n is propeller speed in rpm 15 t 0 75 r t 0 75 r m i n 16 t 0 75 r 0 0185 0 00125 z d 17 t 0 75 r m i n 0 0028 d 0 21 d 2375 1125 p d p s 4 123 n d 3 s c d 2 n 2 12 788 3 2 5 2 cavitation cavitation on the back of propeller blades was constrained according to the burrill cavitation diagram for uniform flow carlton 2012 by the inequality given in eq 18 the thrust loading coefficient τ c 0 7 r must be at most equal to the maximum thrust loading coefficient τ c 0 7 r m a x depending on the maximum cavitation level adopted the definition of thrust loading coefficient is given in eq 19 while by assuming 5 cavitation as the maximum allowable the exponential curve shown in eq 20 was approximated for the maximum thrust loading coefficient in these equations a p is the projected area of the propeller and σ 0 7 r is the mean cavitation number which is defined in eq 21 in this equation p 0 is the static pressure at the shaft centre line and p v is the water vapour pressure 18 τ c 0 7 r τ c 0 7 r m a x 19 τ c 0 7 r t h 1 2 ρ a p v a 2 0 7 π n d 2 20 τ c 0 7 r m

to reduce noise and vibrations thus v t i p must be at most equal to the maximum allowable blade tip peripheral velocity v t i p m a x as shown in eq 22 the recommended upper level v t i p m a x is 39 m s holden et al 1980 and the definition of v t i p is given in eq 23 22 v t i p v t i p m a x 23 v t i p π d n 2 5 4 resonance the coincidence of the natural frequency identified with some natural mode and the exciting frequency of some excitation component corresponds to a condition of resonance intending to reach ships with consistently acceptable vibration characteristics it is essential to avoid resonances involving the active participation of major subsystems in frequency ranges where the dominant excitations are strongest vorus and paulling 2010 consequently attention was given to the hull girder vertical vibration excited by the propeller equation 24 which is simplified and suitable for initial design stage of ships yin et al 2014 was applied to calculate the first four orders vertical vibration natural frequencies in this equation b is the moulded breadth d m is the moulded depth δ v is the displacement including the virtual added mass of water l p p is the length between perpendiculars and c n is a coefficient dependent on vibration order and ship type this coefficient was approximated as if the ship were a bulk carrier for the three first orders and an extrapolation was carried out to obtain it for the fourth order the values used for c n are listed in table 1 24 f n c n b d m 2 δ v l p p 2 meanwhile the excitation frequencies due to the propeller f were calculated by eq 25 in which n h is an integer related to the harmonics 1 for the first harmonic and so on 25 f n h z n to meet this criterion every propeller must hold excitation frequencies lower or higher than a difference in relation to the hull girder vertical natural frequencies given that a typical value of damping factor is 0 05 by the vibration response characteristics for a one mass system it is noticed that a difference of 10 is reasonable vorus and paulling 2010 thus the excitation frequencies must be such as shown in eq 26 26 f 0 9 f n f 1 1 f n 2 6 computation of brake power in service calculating brake power p b considers losses to approximate the required power in the engine shaft based on the open water power p o as shown in eq 27 in practice when a propeller is behind a ship the power actually delivered to the propeller is generally different from p o as a result of the non uniform velocity field in front of the propeller this is offset by the relative rotative efficiency η r while mechanical losses over the propulsion chain are expressed by shaft efficiency η s and gearbox efficiency η g b 27 p b p o η r η s η g b 2 7 computation of smcr the operating point with the maximum brake power required throughout the journey is taken as the maximum continuous rating mcr point to try to make sure the ship will be able to keep its service speed and the engine will not be fully loaded even in the hardest condition margins are considered on the mcr power p m c r once the service margin sm has already been applied the engine margin em which often lies between 0 8 and 0 9 woud and stapersma 2013 is used to obtain the smcr power p s m c r as shown in eq 28 meanwhile the shaft speed at smcr n s m c r can be approximated from the shaft speed at mcr n m c r by assuming the propeller law as shown in eq 29 28 p s m c r p m c r e m 29 n s m c r n m c r p s m c r p m c r 3 2 8 determination of suitable engines to determine the suitable engines the standard selection of slow speed diesel engines as described in marques and belchior 2017 was followed the first step is to place the smcr point on the engine layout diagram programme to know which engines are able to supply the required power and speed the next step is to determine how many cylinders are necessary thus a function was implemented to search the suitable engines regarding a given smcr this function tests every single engine for speed and those matching the speed are tested for power to predict the required number of cylinders therefore a list of suitable engines and their needed number of cylinders to meet the smcr is provided only engines covered by the computerised engine application system engine room dimensioning ceas erd man 2015 were applied herein this application considers 16 engines cylinder diameters from 400 to 950 mm with a number of cylinders varying between 5 and 12 this represents a total of 83 because some engines hold fewer cylinders all engines are electronically controlled me c engine concept and they are not equipped with exhaust gas after treatment 2 9 computation of capex among capital expenditures the acquisition costs of the main engine propeller shaft and re liquefaction plant are of primary interest for the present study nevertheless obtaining cost and related data is not easy because engine manufacturers consider this information confidential hence watson 2002 decided to use weight as the estimating parameter once it has the advantage of applying to almost all components of a ship s cost this author also reached a curve of machinery weight related cost w r c m in american dollars us per tonne t versus machinery weight w m including materials labour and overheads this curve could be approximated by eq 30 where w m must include the total machinery weight which is the sum due to the main engine propeller and shaft meanwhile the re liquefaction plant was taken as a cargo related outfit whose weight related cost w r c r

g fuel cost related to propulsion c f p r o fuel cost related to other consumers on board c f o t h fuel cost related to bog re liquefaction c f r e l and maintenance cost c m hence the total opex in a round trip of the vessel is given by eq 36 36 o p e x c j o u c l n g c f p r o c f o t h c f r e l c m journey cost c j o u includes port fees and tolls the purchase cost of the lng cargo c l n g was calculated by eq 37 in which f o b l n g is the free on board lng price ρ l n g is the lng density and v p l n g is the cargo volume of lng purchased at loading terminal the latter was calculated by eq 38 where v t l n g is the ship s total cargo capacity in volume n r t b is the number of route tracks in ballast v b o g is the total volume of lng becoming bog including naturally and forced generated amounts v r e l is the volume of lng coming from bog re liquefaction i is an index that refers to each route track in ballast and v h is the heel volume 37 c l n g f o b l n g v p l n g ρ l

gaseous fuel c f g as in eq 39 the former regards dual fuel engines when operating in diesel mode while the two latter occur for gas mode because the gaseous fuel comes from cargo bog its cost is included in c l n g and therefore c f g was neglected 39 c f c f o c f p o c f g regarding fuel cost related to propulsion c f p r o eq 40 could be applied to calculate both fuel oil and pilot oil

index i refers to each route track 40 c f p l c l f i 1 n r t s f c p b z p δ t i given that there must be a compression system to increase bog pressure to feed prime mover the electricity to power this system other consumers and the re liquefaction plant is supplied by dual fuel generation sets hence the cost of liquid fuels to feed other consumers could be calculated by eq 41 where s f c g e is the specific fuel consumption of the generation engine η g is the generator s efficiency and p o t h is the electric power required by other consumers man 2014 41 c f o l c l f i 1 n r t s f c g e η g p o t h δ t i eq 42 was used to calculate the liquid fuel cost for re liquefying bog in this equation s p b o g is the power required to re liquefy a mass flow unit of bog which is a measure of the specific power requirement of the re liquefaction plant because bog may be burnt in both prime mover and generation sets only the surplus is re liquefied therefore the mass flow of bog to be re liquefied m b o g r in each route track was calculated by eq 43 the flow of naturally generated bog m b o g g and of total consumed bog m b o g c are given by eqs 44 and 45 respectively in these equations v l n g is the volume of lng in the tanks for each route track bor is the boil off rate and p c o m is the electric power required by the bog compression system these equations were solved iteratively because the bog consumed to re liquefy the surplus of bog also reduces the amount of bog to be re liquefied 42 c f r l c l f i 1 n r t s f c g e η g s p b o g m b o g r δ t i 43 m b o g r

specific fuel consumption of the prime mover and generation sets the engine model developed in marques et al 2017 is used to assess the specific fuel consumption of the dual fuel low speed diesel engines the total maintenance cost c m includes propeller and prime mover however as the maintenance cost of a propeller is significantly lower than that of an engine only the engine maintenance cost

the projected cash flow including the investments it requires an estimate of future revenues and it assigns an interest rate for discounting future usually after tax cash flows lamb 2003 thus npv was calculated by eq 47 where n y is the period of economic analysis in years the ship s lifetime f y is the annual net cash flow r d is the discount rate and i is an index that refers to each year of

differential evolution optimisation algorithm in this algorithm the generation of an offspring member p i j 1 is given by eq 50 where p i j is the i t h individual of the j t h generation of the

considering uniformly distributed random numbers mathworks 2016 3 conclusion given that an early stage design optimisation approach must be fast only simpler models have been used however simpler models are more limited each of the models has its own limitations which in turn become limitations of the overall approach therefore the main limitations of the approach are as follows the approach is inappropriate for shallow water appendages were neglected in the resistance calculation that only considers form parameters and not the hull design itself neither a waste heat recovery system nor a gas after treatment equipment was incorporated in the approach likewise a re liquefaction plant was not modelled and therefore the bog s properties and its evaporation rate were considered constant noxious emissions were considered neither to constrain the service speed nor to include additional fees similarly no design index were considered neither as a constraint nor as an additional objective function a constant weather condition along the ship s life cycle is a simplifying hypothesis severe sea conditions might cause overload on the engine and propeller affecting the propulsion system s behaviour kwon s model does not consider wave amplitude length or period nor sea currents meanwhile the main strengths of this approach are as follows the approach is fast enough for an early stage optimisation as demonstrated in part b of this study technical constraints were taken into account to avoid propeller configurations that might present problems related to strength cavitation vibration and noise this approach searches for the best engine propeller matching within a broad range of technical possibilities different sea conditions can be considered for each route track and the only weather conditions required by the kwon s added resistance method are the beaufort number and encounter angle different parameters can be set up in each route track and this enables various operational profiles to be considered to seek the highest net present value the proposed approach is expected to be able to automatically search a broad range of possible alternatives and then make small refinements to achieve the optimal arrangement the richer the engine database the higher the probability to find a better solution although this can be seen as an extension of what could theoretically be accomplished manually the labour involved would be prohibitive thus the main contribution of the present work is its comprehensive and integrated approach to optimise the energy system of lngcs furthermore with some adjustments the methodology developed herein can be applied to any ship acknowledgements this work was conducted at federal university of rio de janeiro during

22835,developing design tools to make more information available sooner is desirable because decisions of the greatest impact are made in early stages of ship design moreover there is still room for improvement in the optimisation of energy system selection considering an integrated approach therefore the present work aims to provide a comprehensive early stage approach to optimise the design synthesis and operation of a marine energy system for liquified gas carriers considering their economic and technical aspects and also weather along the route constraints are used to avoid propellers that could present issues concerning strength cavitation and vibration various propellers engines and operational profiles can be assessed with this approach a differential evolution optimisation algorithm that maximises the net present value is applied this part of the study details the approach that we have developed while the case study results and discussion and the main conclusions are given in part b different parameters can be set up in each route track which enables various operational profiles and sea conditions to be considered to seek the highest net present value the proposed approach is expected to be able to automatically search a broad range of possible alternatives and then make small refinements to achieve the optimal arrangement keywords optimisation propulsion dual fuel diesel engine fixed pitch propeller net present value 1 introduction liquefied natural gas carriers lngcs are specialised ships that are designed to transport liquefied natural gas lng they are fitted with insulated double hulled tanks that are designed to contain the cargo slightly above atmospheric pressure at a cryogenic temperature without means of external refrigeration typically the design pressure and temperature are around 0 7 bar g and 169 c respectively the lng density lies between 430 and 470 kg m3 depending on its composition and state the composition is predominantly methane ch4 with smaller fractions of ethane c2h6 propane c3h8 butane c4h10 and nitrogen n2 mokhatab et al 2014 despite the high level of insulation that is used in the cargo tanks some vaporisation occurs because it is impossible to avoid heat transfer from the surroundings to the cargo this evaporated lng which is also called boil off gas bog induces a pressure increase and thereby a certain amount of the vapour phase should be taken out of the tank to avoid dangerous overpressure usually this outlet gas flow is used as fuel by the marine energy system of the ship to reduce its main fuel consumption miana et al 2010 for many years steam propulsion plants were an exclusive option for lngcs due to their ability to burn the unavoidable bog directly in the power boiler however as environmental economic and technical expectations have increased the drawbacks of the steam turbine power plant have made it a less attractive option these drawbacks include the comparatively low efficiency of the plant its high fuel consumption high exhaust emissions and large engine room space requirement moreover advances in the design of dual fuel diesel engines shipboard bog re liquefaction plants and marine gas turbines have provided meaningful alternatives to the traditional steam power plant moreover propulsion systems based on slow speed two stroke diesel engines driving fixed pitch propellers with inboard re liquefaction system have been successfully used in large lngcs whenever conventional fuel prices are higher than lng price the operational expenditure opex of propulsion systems unable to use bog as fuel is increased mokhatab et al 2014 thus dual fuel diesel engines offer an option to overcome this drawback these are compression ignition engines that are able to work in two operational modes diesel mode and gas mode woodyard 2009 in the former mode the engine works as a conventional diesel engine whilst in the latter mode only a small fraction of liquid fuel is used as a pilot to start the combustion moreover conventional fuels are not as clean as the bog because natural gas is considered environmentally friendly for various reasons natural gas combustion can lead to approximately 20 lower carbon dioxide co2 emissions compared to diesel oil combustion schlick 2014 in four stroke lean burn marine engines this reduction can reach up to 30 levander 2011 the co2 emission reduction can be assigned to the lower carbon to hydrogen mass ratio of natural gas compared to diesel oil levander 2011 haraldson 2011 moreover can be achieved a decrement of about 79 in nitrogen oxides 100 in sulphur oxides and 92 in particulate matter given in parts per billion of energy unit kumar et al 2011 on the other hand there is a concern on methane slip because it will always be present with dual fuel technologies methane slip will be included in the greenhouse gases picture and thereby lead to a high penalty on future taxations mcgill et al 2013 more detailed information on advantages and disadvantages of natural gas as marine fuel can be found in papagiannakis et al 2018 given that the prime mover is usually operated until the end of the ship s lifetime its selection is one of the major elements in merchant shipbuilding projects although a complete criteria list for choosing main machinery is given in watson 2002 and many considerations are presented in lamb 2003 bulut et al 2015 defined six major selection criteria based on interviews with a group of technical experts and managers of selected shipping companies the following elements were highlighted power acquisition cost fuel consumption maintenance majority in existing merchant fleet and damage history of the model power is on the top of the list because the engine needs to be able to provide enough power to satisfy the ship s operational profile acquisition cost is a major indicator of the project s financial feasibility because it represents about 10 of the total cost of a new building project another significant indicator of financial feasibility is fuel consumption maintenance attributes can be divided into two considerations the ease of maintenance and the cost of maintenance the most popular engines used in the existing merchant fleet or common practice is an important aspect because if a specific model and brand of diesel engine is frequently preferred then this may denote its superiority in overall circumstances a similar indicator is the damage history of the model or reliability which illustrates the engine s structural and mechanical hardness in practical life these two criteria illustrate why the design of a new machinery system is typically based on traditional concepts solem et al 2015 for ships navigating across large oceans considerations about the weather conditions are essential for the ship s safe and efficient operation the environment exposes the ship to loads from wind waves and currents which all change the operating point of the ship s energy system skoglund et al 2014 to ensure safe passage arrival on time minimised operational costs and minimal environmental impact it is important that the weather that is expected to be found throughout the route is taken into account during the early stages of the project another of the challenges of ship design is that the decisions of the greatest impact are made in the early stages of design when the least information and greatest uncertainty are present chalfant 2015 hence developing ship design tools to make more information available sooner and pushing decision points for later examination is advisable in this sense simulations of the overall ship energy system and optimisation studies are of great interest 1 1 state of the art benvenuto et al 1994 presented a computer simulation model that is able to predict the dynamic behaviour of a whole marine propulsion system and to evaluate the influence of its three main elements ship propeller and prime mover kyrtatos et al 1999 carried out a propulsion plant simulation of a container ship to assess the engine performance in different operating conditions michalski michalski 2478 conceived an algorithmic method for preliminary selection of parameters of a ship propulsion system fitted with fixed pitch propeller and diesel engine chen and shih 2007 addressed a two objective parametric optimisation problem regarding wageningen b screw series propeller design dimopoulos et al 2008 performed a study focused on the optimisation of synthesis design and operation of a marine energy system for a cruise liner fitted with a combined gas turbine electric and steam system coges similar works about lngcs fitted with coges which did not model either the propeller or the ship movement can be found in dimopoulos and frangopoulos 2008a and dimopoulos and frangopoulos 2008b theotokatos 2008 investigated the transient response of the overall ship propulsion plant for a merchant ship under various operating conditions aldous and smith 2012 described a service speed optimisation model for lngcs considering ship geometric parameters propeller characteristics and engine specifications theotokatos and tzelepis 2013 mapped the performance and emission parameters for a merchant vessel propulsion system over the ship s operating envelop dimopoulos et al 2014 presented the dnv cossmos modelling framework for integrated marine machinery systems man man 2014 presented an overview about lngcs fitted with slow speed dual fuel diesel engines using high pressure and a gas supply system cichowicz et al 2015 introduced a methodology to assess the dynamic energy performance of a ship at a global level for any given period of time lu et al 2015 developed an accurate and practical ship operational performance prediction model that can be used to select the optimal routes for minimum fuel consumption taking into consideration average ship speed encountering sea states and voyage time tillig et al 2016 presented a generic holistic model for simulating ship energy systems so that the ship s energy consumption could be predicted for different operating conditions since the shipping industry has been facing great pressure to become more sustainable a number of studies aiming to improve the performance of ship energy systems were developed in the last year mizythras et al 2018 developed an integrated simulation model considering engine propeller and hull hydrodynamics to predict a ship s propulsion system performance during acceleration manoeuvres tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 stated a fully dynamic optimisation problem for the integrated energy system of a ship and solved it by a single level algorithm using appropriate dynamic optimisation procedures the single level optimisation for the synthesis design and operation of ship energy systems was also addressed by sakalis and frangopoulos 2018 who proposed a general inter temporal method to tackle this issue trivyza et al 2018 presented a method to optimise the synthesis of ship energy systems considering environmental and economic objectives as well as operational and regulatory requirements during the ship lifetime 1 2 research gap to the best of authors knowledge this is the first comprehensive study to focus on the optimisation of energy system selection for lngcs fitted with dual fuel low speed diesel engines considering engine propeller and weather conditions within an integrated approach similar comprehensive approaches to simulate and optimise ship energy systems are also found in tillig et al 2016 tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 sakalis and frangopoulos 2018 trivyza et al 2018 the low occurrence of studies found about the optimisation of diesel engine selection might arise from the shortage of suitable engine models for optimisation problems according to schulten 2005 five main sorts of engine models can be recognised computational fluid dynamics cfd models phenomenological multi dimensional models crank angle models mean value models and transfer function models within cfd engine models which are the most complex the volume studied is divided into thousands of volumes or elements and the basic conservation equations are solved for each volume meanwhile if the cylinder is divided into a smaller number of volumes tens and additionally to the basic conservation equations phenomenological equations are solved a phenomenological multi dimensional model is obtained however these approaches are unsuitable for optimisation problems considering the overall energy system of a ship due to the high computational time that is required crank angle models are also called zero dimensional engine models 0 dems because they do not have a strict mathematical dependence on any of the dimensions these models treat each one of the various engine elements as a control volume and they then solve the differential equations with a time step equivalent to one degree of the crankshaft s rotation nevertheless whether an engine model is inserted into a propulsion system the variations that occur for each crankshaft angle of rotation are generally not of primary interest in this case overall engine operating parameters are the focus and they can be obtained by using a mean value engine model mvem this model has basically the same origin of the 0 dem but as its time step in the order of one crankshaft rotation while the variation of each parameter within the cylinder is replaced by a mean value some references about 0 dems can be found in kyrtatos et al 1999 medica et al 2009 payri et al 2011 guan et al 2015 mavrelos and theotokatos 2018 whereas mvems were addressed in theotokatos 2008 2010 theotokatos and tzelepis 2013 cichowicz et al 2015 malkhede et al 2005 guan et al 2014 in addition a combination of mvem and 0 dem for a large marine four stroke and two stroke diesel engine was presented in baldi et al 2015 and theotokatos et al 2018 respectively when there is no interest in the engine s internal processes the engine can be merely represented by functions that relate for instance load and speed to specific fuel consumption this is the so called transfer function engine model tfem which is the simplest and fastest method consequently this sort of modelling is the most suitable for the design optimisation of the ship s overall energy system some references in this field can be found in benvenuto et al 1994 tillig et al 2016 tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 sakalis and frangopoulos 2018 trivyza et al 2018 stefanopoulou and smith 2000 benvenuto and campora 2005 altosole and figari 2011 martelli 2014 marques et al 2017 however models appropriate for iterative procedures that do not require calibration for every single engine were developed in tillig et al 2016 tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 sakalis and frangopoulos 2018 marques et al 2017 all based on regression analyses being the last one used in the present work because addressing dual fuel low speed diesel engines 1 3 proposal the present work proposes a comprehensive early stage approach to optimise the design synthesis and operation of lngc energy systems considering economic and technical aspects including weather conditions this approach must assess various configurations of propellers and prime movers to find the best matching and it also considers a different number of propulsion chains the need for a re liquefaction plant must also be assessed constraints must be incorporated to avoid propellers that can present issues regarding strength cavitation and vibration this approach must assess different operational profiles regarding service speeds and fuel to maximise the net present value npv this measure of merit considers opex income and capital expenditures capex the proposed approach is expected to be able to automatically search a broad range of possible alternatives and then make small refinements to achieve the optimal arrangement although this can be seen as an extension of what one could theoretically accomplish manually the labour involved would be prohibitive the next sections will present the methodology in detail and they will draw a preliminary conclusion the case study results and discussion and the main conclusions will be presented in part b of this work marques et al 2019 2 methodology to set up a comprehensive approach to be used for shipowners and marine engineers the proposed approach includes technical and economic aspects and also considers the weather along the route given that the npv is a common economic measure of merit our method consists of an optimisation process whose objective function to be maximised is the npv and whose design variables are propulsion parameters and service speeds thus the purpose is to find the synthesis of components their design characteristics and the operational profile that maximise the npv of an lngc herein the synthesis of components refers to the condition of the propulsion system to hold one or two main engines each one driving a propeller and the existence of shipboard re liquefaction the component design characteristics refer to the propeller and engine specification the operational profile refers to the service speed and the fuel to be burnt in each part of the journey namely the fuel profile once a computational environment becomes necessary all of the computations were performed in matlab the proposed approach will be explained hereinafter by means of flowcharts and an overview of each model will then be given fig 1 illustrates the proposed approach towards the optimisation of synthesis design and operation for an lngc energy system this figure shows the different computations that were followed in addition to their input and output data first of all a number n of way points nodes must be placed over the route dividing it into n 1 route tracks stages such as a one dimensional grid given a guess of optimisation design variables that is propulsion parameters and service speed the first step is to estimate the brake power and shaft speed in service for each route track in laden and ballast conditions as detailed in fig 2 the next steps are to compute the specified maximum continuous rating smcr and then determine the suitable engines still considering the initial guess of design variables the fourth step is to assess the npv for each suitable engine by considering the different fuel profiles as detailed in fig 3 having accomplished this a simple search is performed for the matching of engine and fuel profile that holds the maximum npv which is the optimum for that guess of design variables all these steps are executed iteratively by the optimisation algorithm and convergence is verified at the end of each run if the algorithm converged then the optimum engine propeller matching was reached otherwise a new guess of propulsion parameters is taken by the optimisation algorithm as detailed in fig 4 similarly if there is no suitable engine among the available options during a run then that initial guess of design variables is considered to be infeasible and the optimisation algorithm interrupts the run to guess new design variables and returns to the first step the proposed procedure to estimate the brake power and shaft speed in service for each route track is shown in fig 2 the procedure starts by computing the total hydrodynamic resistance concerning specified weather conditions and then computing the total resistance in service conditions next comes the computation of propulsion factors followed by calculation of propeller performance having accomplished this the technical constraints related to strength cavitation and vibration are verified if any of these criteria are not met then the design variables are considered infeasible and the run is interrupted otherwise the run proceeds to the computation of brake power in service the npv estimation for each matching of engine and fuel profile is achieved by following the procedure illustrated in fig 3 which shows the computations and their input and output data this consists of computing capital expenditures capex operational expenditures opex and then the npv fig 4 shows the iterative procedure of the differential evolution optimisation algorithm applied it is an evolutionary and stochastic algorithm in other words it attempts to mimic nature and does not make use of the gradient of the objective function as a direction of optimisation colaço et al 2006 one individual design is first randomly created by the uniform distribution continuous approach mathworks 2016 and its objective function is assessed if design variables are infeasible then that individual is rejected and another is created to replace it otherwise this individual is kept in the population this is done until a full population is created such that there are only capable individuals feasible design variables in the initial population then an offspring member is generated from the initial population and its objective function is assessed if the offspring is better than its main progenitor then it replaces its main progenitor in the population otherwise the offspring is rejected this proceeds until every member of the initial population has been the main progenitor of an offspring that is until a generation has elapsed the best member of the population after a predetermined number of generations is considered to be the optimum design some of the variables involved in this optimisation are time dependent such as unit costs journey charges weather and consequently propulsion load if those time dependencies were introduced the problem could be characterized as a dynamic optimisation problem dop and thereby its complexity would increase dramatically tzortzis and frangopoulos 2018 the goal of methods dealing with dops is no longer to locate a stationary optimal solution but to track its movement through the solution and time spaces as close as possible evolutionary techniques and their variants have been the most widely used methods to solve dops but other approaches are gaining ever more attention in the past years cruz et al 2011 on the other hand the problem could be studied as stationary and its time dependencies approached by uncertainties on the variables in general the literature presents two optimisation approaches to deal with data uncertainty robust and stochastic the stochastic optimisation assumes that the true probability distribution of uncertain data is known or estimated the robust optimisation assumes that the uncertain data resides in the so called uncertainty set being popular because of its computational tractability for many classes of uncertainty sets and problem types gorissen et al 2015 for the sake of simplicity only mean values of the variables were used and the uncertainties were neglected in the present study 2 1 computation of resistance for specified weather conditions according to carlton 2012 many approaches can be used to compute total ship resistance in still water and also to estimate added resistance due to rough weather regarding still water the usual approach whenever algebraic models are required is the well known holtrop mennen model holtrop and mennen 1982 holtrop 1984 which is a statistical power prediction method based on a regression analysis of random model experiments and full scale test data based on geometric parameters and speed this model provides an approximated value of the total propulsion resistance in still water r t s w rough weather during voyages changes the resistance and affects the behaviour of the vessel to predict the added resistance semi empirical approaches are more suitable than other more complex cases where a high computational time is required lu et al 2015 kwon s model kwon 2008 is an approximate method for predicting speed loss of a displacement type ship due to added resistance in weather conditions irregular waves and wind the advantage of this method is that it is easy and practical to use it is based on eq 1 where v r w is service speed in rough weather v s w is service speed in still water c β is a direction reduction coefficient c u is a speed reduction coefficient and c f o r m is a ship form coefficient 1 v r w v s w 1 c β c u c f o r m 100 because v r w is a design variable in the present work v s w was calculated by eq 1 and then the corresponding r t s w was obtained by eq 2 in this equation r f is frictional resistance 1 k 1 is the form factor of the hull r a p p is appendage resistance r w is wave resistance r b is additional pressure resistance of bulbous bow near the water surface r t r is additional pressure resistance due to transom immersion and r a is the model ship correlation resistance 2 r t s w r f 1 k 1 r a p p r w r b r t r r a therefore we consider that the ship is sailing at v r w which is generally lower than the corresponding v s w but the resistance is that one related to the corresponding v s w to calculate these coefficients it is necessary to know some parameters related to weather such as weather direction angle with respect to the ship s bow and beaufort number bn in addition ship parameters and service speed weather direction is assumed to be the same as wind surface waves while the beaufort number is a number used to represent a range of wave heights and sea conditions which can be taken as a function of the wind speed in m s at a height of 10 m above sea level v 10 such as illustrated in eq 3 schneekluth and bertram 1998 as the route is not being optimised it is reasonable to assume that extreme weather conditions occurring occasionally would not be influential on the system synthesis design and overall operation although the system behaves differently under adverse weather if an extreme condition was used as the design condition the system would be oversized most of the time therefore the monthly means of daily means for zonal and meridional wind components 10 m u wind component and 10 m v wind component in addition to the absolute wind speed 10 m wind speed provided by the european centre for medium range weather forecasts for medium range we 2016 was used it should however be noted that the measured data supported by this server includes interpolated data depending on the wished grid 3 b n v 10 0 836 1 5 2 2 computation of total resistance in service a well chosen design condition must be realistic and representative for the service conditions that the ship will encounter during its operational life therefore the total resistance in service r t s e r is related to the trial total resistance r t t r i by the service margin sm as shown in eq 4 the service margin can be built as a product of factors including effects of fouling s m f hull form s m h displacement s m d weather s m w and water depth s m w d as illustrated in eq 5 woud and stapersma 2013 4 r t s e r s m r t t r i 5 s m s m f s m h s m d s m w s m w d herein the effects regarding hull form displacement and weather have already been taken into account by the previous computation and it is also assumed that the ship sails in deep waters most of the time hence the only factor with a different value is fouling s m f which is recommended to be taken as a 3 increase in resistance per year woud and stapersma 2013 2 3 computation of propulsion factors only a part of the thrust produced by the propellers is used to overcome the pure towing resistance of a ship the remaining part has to overcome the added resistance created by the presence of the propellers themselves furthermore the propellers are located within a region where the water velocity is affected by the hull s presence i e the ship s propeller wake thus the thrust deduction factor t must be considered when calculating the thrust t h and the wake factor w must be considered when calculating the advance velocity of the propeller v a these calculations are shown respectively in eq 6 where z p is the number of propellers and eq 7 6 t h r t s e r z p 1 t 7 v a 1 w v r w the equations given by holtrop and mennen holtrop and mennen 1982 holtrop 1984 which are based on ship and propeller parameters and also on service speed were applied to obtain these propulsion factors and also the relative rotative efficiency η r the latter is used subsequently to calculate brake power in service 2 4 computation of propeller performance over the years a considerable number of standard series propellers have been tested in many establishments around the world and those most commonly used by propeller designers and analysts are referenced in carlton 2012 the wageningen b screw series also known as troost series is perhaps the most extensive and widely used propeller series and therefore it was applied in this present study the thrust and torque coefficients k t and k q of the screws are expressed as polynomials in the advance ratio j the pitch ratio p d the blade area ratio a e a o and the number of blades z in addition the effect of the reynolds number r n is taken into account in the polynomials oosterveld and ossannen 1975 thus the relationships shown in eqs 8 and 9 were used to calculate the non dimensional thrust and torque provided by the propeller 8 k t f 1 j p d a e a o z r n 9 k q f 2 j p d a e a o z r n meanwhile by using open water diagram the non dimensional thrust required by the ship k t s 1 1 subscript s stands for ship was calculated by eq 10 once k t must equal k t s the issue is to find the value of j which was made by solving an equation system then shaft speed n and torque q were calculated by eq 11 and eq 12 respectively where ρ is the water density 10 k t s t h ρ v a 2 d 2 j 2 11 n v a j d 12 q k q ρ n 2 d 5 lastly open water power p o and efficiency η o were obtained respectively from eq 13 and eq 14 13 p o 2 π q n 14 η o 1 2 π j k t k q 2 5 constraints the propulsion design variables were only considered to be feasible if approved for all criteria namely propeller blade resistance cavitation propeller peripheral velocity and resonance each criterion was tested in that order and more details about them are given below 2 5 1 propeller blade strength the inequality given in eq 15 was used to constrain propellers with unsatisfactory strength properties the blade thickness at 75 of the propeller radius t 0 75 r must not be less than the minimum thickness required t 0 75 r m i n approaches for t 0 75 r and t 0 75 r m i n given by oosterveld and ossannen 1975 were used as written in eqs 16 and 17 respectively this latter equation is not dimensionally homogeneous and hence d is propeller diameter in ft p s is the power delivered by each blade in hp s c is the maximum allowable stress of the propeller material in psi and n is propeller speed in rpm 15 t 0 75 r t 0 75 r m i n 16 t 0 75

burrill cavitation diagram for uniform flow carlton 2012 by the inequality given in eq 18 the thrust loading coefficient τ c 0 7 r must be at most equal to the maximum thrust loading coefficient τ c 0 7 r m a x depending on the maximum cavitation level adopted the definition of thrust loading coefficient is given in eq 19 while by assuming 5 cavitation as the maximum allowable the exponential curve shown in eq 20 was approximated for the maximum thrust loading coefficient in these equations a p is the projected area of the propeller and σ 0 7 r is the mean cavitation number which is defined in eq 21 in this equation p 0 is the static pressure at the shaft centre line and p v is the water vapour pressure 18 τ c 0 7 r τ c 0 7 r m a x 19 τ c 0 7 r t h 1 2 ρ a p v a 2 0 7 π n d 2 20 τ c 0 7 r m

to reduce noise and vibrations thus v t i p must be at most equal to the maximum allowable blade tip peripheral velocity v t i p m a x as shown in eq 22 the recommended upper level v t i p m a x is 39 m s holden et al 1980 and the definition of v t i p is given in eq 23 22 v t i p v t i p m a x 23 v t i p π d n 2 5 4 resonance the coincidence of the natural frequency identified with some natural mode and the exciting frequency of some excitation component corresponds to a condition of resonance intending to reach ships with consistently acceptable vibration characteristics it is essential to avoid resonances involving the active participation of major subsystems in frequency ranges where the dominant excitations are strongest vorus and paulling 2010 consequently attention was given to the hull girder vertical vibration excited by the propeller equation 24 which is simplified and suitable for initial design stage of ships yin et al 2014 was applied to calculate the first four orders vertical vibration natural frequencies in this equation b is the moulded breadth d m is the moulded depth δ v is the displacement including the virtual added mass of water l p p is the length between perpendiculars and c n is a coefficient dependent on vibration order and ship type this coefficient was approximated as if the ship were a bulk carrier for the three first orders and an extrapolation was carried out to obtain it for the fourth order the values used for c n are listed in table 1 24 f n c n b d m 2 δ v l p p 2 meanwhile the excitation frequencies due to the propeller f were calculated by eq 25 in which n h is an integer related to the harmonics 1 for the first harmonic and so on 25 f n h z n to meet this criterion every propeller must hold excitation frequencies lower or higher than a difference in relation to the hull girder vertical natural frequencies given that a typical value of damping factor is 0 05 by the vibration response characteristics for a one mass system it is noticed that a difference of 10 is reasonable vorus and paulling 2010 thus the excitation frequencies must be such as shown in eq 26 26 f 0 9 f n f 1 1 f n 2 6 computation of brake power in service calculating brake power p b considers losses to approximate the required power in the engine shaft based on the open water power p o as shown in eq 27 in practice when a propeller is behind a ship the power actually delivered to the propeller is generally different from p o as a result of the non uniform velocity field in front of the propeller this is offset by the relative rotative efficiency η r while mechanical losses over the propulsion chain are expressed by shaft efficiency η s and gearbox efficiency η g b 27 p b p o η r η s η g b 2 7 computation of smcr the operating point with the maximum brake power required throughout the journey is taken as the maximum continuous rating mcr point to try to make sure the ship will be able to keep its service speed and the engine will not be fully loaded even in the hardest condition margins are considered on the mcr power p m c r once the service margin sm has already been applied the engine margin em which often lies between 0 8 and 0 9 woud and stapersma 2013 is used to obtain the smcr power p s m c r as shown in eq 28 meanwhile the shaft speed at smcr n s m c r can be approximated from the shaft speed at mcr n m c r by assuming the propeller law as shown in eq 29 28 p s m c r p m c r e m 29 n s m c r n m c r p s m c r p m c r 3 2 8 determination of suitable engines to determine the suitable engines the standard selection of slow speed diesel engines as described in marques and belchior 2017 was followed the first step is to place the smcr point on the engine layout diagram programme to know which engines are able to supply the required power and speed the next step is to determine how many cylinders are necessary thus a function was implemented to search the suitable engines regarding a given smcr this function tests every single engine for speed and those matching the speed are tested for power to predict the required number of cylinders therefore a list of suitable engines and their needed number of cylinders to meet the smcr is provided only engines covered by the computerised engine application system engine room dimensioning ceas erd man 2015 were applied herein this application considers 16 engines cylinder diameters from 400 to 950 mm with a number of cylinders varying between 5 and 12 this represents a total of 83 because some engines hold fewer cylinders all engines are electronically controlled me c engine concept and they are not equipped with exhaust gas after treatment 2 9 computation of capex among capital expenditures the acquisition costs of the main engine propeller shaft and re liquefaction plant are of primary interest for the present study nevertheless obtaining cost and related data is not easy because engine manufacturers consider this information confidential hence watson 2002 decided to use weight as the estimating parameter once it has the advantage of applying to almost all components of a ship s cost this author also reached a curve of machinery weight related cost w r c m in american dollars us per tonne t versus machinery weight w m including materials labour and overheads this curve could be approximated by eq 30 where w m must include the total machinery weight which is the sum due to the main engine propeller and shaft meanwhile the re liquefaction plant was taken as a cargo related outfit whose weight related cost w r c r p is given as being 28500 us t therefore machinery capex c a p e x m and re liquefaction plant capex c a p e x r p were calculated respectively by eqs 31 and 32 where w r p is the re liquefaction plant weight 30 w r c m 9850 e 0 001457 w m 10 226 e 0 00007049 w m 31 c a p e x m w r c m w m 32 c a p e x r p w r c r p w r p once the costs given in watson 2002 are on a 1993 basis a correction concerning inflation became necessary in this sense with respect to oil and gas field machinery and equipment manufacturing the producer price index industry data was applied b of labor statistics 2016 thus to bring the total capex from a 1993 to a 2015 basis eq 33 was applied where z p is the number of propulsion chains ppi stands for producer price index and f i n s is an installation cost factor 33 c a p e x c a p e x m z p c a p e x r p p p i 2015 p p i 1993 f i n s main engine weight was achieved with ceas erd whilst propeller weight w p and shaft weight w s were respectively approximated by eqs 34 and 35 in which d is propeller diameter in m l s is shaft length in m p n m c r is power at nmcr in kw and n n m c r is shaft speed at nmcr in rpm schneekluth and bertram 1998 meanwhile the re liquefaction plant weight w r p was assumed as 240 t which is a figure respective to an lng re liquefaction system mark iii by wartsila 2013 34 w p d 3 0 18 a e a o z 2 100 35 w s 0 081 l s p n m c r n n m c r 2 3 2 10 computation of opex the most representative measures of operational expenditures for the present work are journey cost c j o u purchase cost of the lng cargo c l n g fuel cost related to propulsion c f p r o fuel cost related to other consumers on board c f o t h fuel cost related to bog re liquefaction c f r e l and maintenance cost c m hence the total opex in a round trip of the vessel is given by eq 36 36 o p e x c j o u c l n g c f p r o c f o t h c f r e l c m journey cost c j o u includes port fees and tolls the purchase cost of the lng cargo c l n g was calculated by eq 37 in which f o b l n g is the free on board lng price ρ l n g is the lng density and v p l n g is the cargo volume of lng purchased at loading terminal the latter was calculated by eq 38 where v t l n g is the ship s total cargo capacity in volume n r t b is the number of route tracks in ballast v b o g is the total volume of lng becoming bog including naturally and forced generated amounts v r e l is the volume of lng coming from bog re liquefaction i is an index that refers to each route track in ballast and v h is the heel volume 37 c l n g f o b l n g v p l n g ρ l n g 38 v p l n g v t l n g v h i 1 n r t b v b o g v r e l i the total fuel costs either c f p r o c f o t h or c f r e l must consider the portions referring to fuel oil c f o pilot oil c f p o and gaseous fuel c f g as in eq 39 the former regards dual fuel engines when operating in diesel mode while the two latter occur for gas mode because the gaseous fuel comes from cargo bog its cost is included in c l n g and therefore c f g was neglected 39 c f c f o c f p o c f g regarding fuel cost related to propulsion c f p r o eq 40 could be applied to calculate both fuel oil and pilot oil cost in this equation c f p l stands for the total liquid fuel cost c l f is liquid fuel unit cost sfc is the specific fuel consumption of the prime mover δ t is the duration of the condition and the index i refers to each route track 40 c f p l c l f i 1 n r t s f c p b z p δ t i given that there must be a compression system to increase bog pressure to feed prime mover the electricity to power this system other consumers and the re liquefaction plant is supplied by dual fuel generation sets hence the cost of liquid fuels to feed other consumers could be calculated by eq 41 where s f c g e is the specific fuel consumption of the generation engine η g is the generator s efficiency and p o t h is the electric power required by other consumers man 2014 41 c f o l c l f i 1 n r t s f c g e η g p o t h δ t i eq 42 was used to calculate the liquid fuel cost for re liquefying bog in this equation s p b o g is the power required to re liquefy a mass flow unit of bog which is a measure of the specific power requirement of the re liquefaction plant because bog may be burnt in both prime mover and generation sets only the surplus is re liquefied therefore the mass flow of bog to be re liquefied m b o g r in each route track was calculated by eq 43 the flow of naturally generated bog m b o g g and of total consumed bog m b o g c are given by eqs 44 and 45 respectively in these equations v l n g is the volume of lng in the tanks for each route track bor is the boil off rate and p c o m is the electric power required by the bog compression system these equations were solved iteratively because the bog consumed to re liquefy the surplus of bog also reduces the amount of bog to be re liquefied 42 c f r l c l f i 1 n r t s f c g e η g s p b o g m b o g r δ t i 43 m b o g r

specific fuel consumption of the prime mover and generation sets the engine model developed in marques et al 2017 is used to assess the specific fuel consumption of the dual fuel low speed diesel engines the total maintenance cost c m includes propeller and prime mover however as the maintenance cost of a propeller is significantly lower than that of an engine only the engine maintenance cost c m e was taken into account eq 46 was used to calculate this figure 46 c m c m e c m i 1 n r t p n m c r z p δ t i 2 11 computation of npv as implied by its name npv is simply the present value of the projected cash flow including the investments it requires an estimate of future revenues and it assigns an interest rate for discounting future usually after tax cash flows lamb 2003 thus npv was calculated by eq 47 where n y is the period of economic analysis in years the ship s lifetime f y is the annual net cash flow r d is the discount rate and i is an index that refers to each year of economic analysis 47 n p v i 1 n y f y 1 r d i c a p e x i the annual net cash flow f y is given by the difference between income and opex as calculated by eq 48 in which n r n d is the number of

differential evolution optimisation algorithm in this algorithm the generation of an offspring member p i j 1 is given by eq 50 where p i j is the i t h individual of the j t h generation of the population π α β and γ are three randomly chosen members of the population π f is a weight constant which defines the mutation 0 5 f 1 0 δ 1 and δ 2 are two functions related to crossover depending on the value of a random number r between 0 and 1 and of the crossover factor c r 0 5 c r 1 0 δ 1 and δ 2 take different values such as shown in eq 51 50 p i j 1 δ 1 p i j δ 2 p α j f p β j p γ j 51 if r

considering uniformly distributed random numbers mathworks 2016 3 conclusion given that an early stage design optimisation approach must be fast only simpler models have been used however simpler models are more limited each of the models has its own limitations which in turn become limitations of the overall approach therefore the main limitations of the approach are as follows the approach is inappropriate for shallow water appendages were neglected in the resistance calculation that only considers form parameters and not the hull design itself neither a waste heat recovery system nor a gas after treatment equipment was incorporated in the approach likewise a re liquefaction plant was not modelled and therefore the bog s properties and its evaporation rate were considered constant noxious emissions were considered neither to constrain the service speed nor to include additional fees similarly no design index were considered neither as a constraint nor as an additional objective function a constant weather condition along the ship s life cycle is a simplifying hypothesis severe sea conditions might cause overload on the engine and propeller affecting the propulsion system s behaviour kwon s model does not consider wave amplitude length or period nor sea currents meanwhile the main strengths of this approach are as follows the approach is fast enough for an early stage optimisation as demonstrated in part b of this study technical constraints were taken into account to avoid propeller configurations that might present problems related to strength cavitation vibration and noise this approach searches for the best engine propeller matching within a broad range of technical possibilities different sea conditions can be considered for each route track and the only weather conditions required by the kwon s added resistance method are the beaufort number and encounter angle different parameters can be set up in each route track and this enables various operational profiles to be considered to seek the highest net present value the proposed approach is expected to be able to automatically search a broad range of possible alternatives and then make small refinements to achieve the optimal arrangement the richer the engine database the higher the probability to find a better solution although this can be seen as an extension of what could theoretically be accomplished manually the labour involved would be prohibitive thus the main contribution of the present work is its comprehensive and integrated approach to optimise the energy system of lngcs furthermore with some adjustments the methodology developed herein can be applied to any ship acknowledgements this work was conducted at federal university of rio de janeiro during

22836,this paper proposes an efficient simulation driven method for the preliminary design of a double hull oil tanker where the oil outflow risk due to ship ship collisions are considered alongside other conventional ship design merits the simulation procedure was established by integrating a probabilistic oil outflow model with common ship design software to evaluate various aspects of performance the procedure was implemented in a parametric way such that by systematically varying the parameters that define the design large amount of design variants can be evaluated the comparisons of several ship design merits including safety across the variants are discussed through a case study with a suezmax tanker to get an insight into the trade offs which is crucial for modern ship design decision in regard to choosing the optimal designs depends on the intended purposes and service profile of the vessel when equal weights and thus no preferences were given to the design merits the most favorable designs are concentrated in the smaller size segments whereas in environmentally sensitive areas when more preferences should be given to the designs with relatively low oil outflow risk some larger vessels can become competitive too finally the sensitivity of the preference factors is discussed keywords safety ship ship collisions accidental oil outflow risk based ship design

accidents impact design and operation catastrophic accidents such as the collision between the atlantic empress and aegean captain hooke 1997 the grounding accident of the amoco cadiz noaa 1978 and the loss of structural integrity of the prestige commission of the european communities 2003 have raised major concerns over the safety of seaborne transport of oil and have thus forced the industry and regulatory authorities to ever re think and improve the design and operation of the ship and its sub systems for example the u s introduced the oil pollution act of 1990 opa90 as a result of the grounding of the oil tanker exxon valdez in 1989 which included provisions for the double hulling of oil tankers eu banned single hull tankers following the prestige tanker disaster in 2002 the grounding event of the amoco cadiz resulted in the requirement of redundancy in power units and the recent collision between the mt sanchi and the mv cf crystal has brought attention again to human errors admittedly accidents have provided valuable rare cases from which knowledge and better understanding can be learnt however this paradigm of reactive rule development following major accidents is being questioned in that it is a passive way of dealing with uncertainties and that it is not clear whether or how well do present design practice reflect reality which should include both the past and the future 1 1 2 how proper design and operation help reduce accidents according to unctad seaborne trade of crude oil will continue growing at a rate of 1 2 from 2017 to 2022 unctad 2017 although the frequency of having an accident or incident derived from historical accident records may seem low the consequences of such events can be devastating nrc 1991 it is then incumbent upon the designers and operators to manage the risks in seaborne transport of oil by first looking at the potential accidental events and then investigating their causes and effects and finally think of implementation of reduction measures imo 2008 for instance marpol convention 13f requires double hull for all oil tankers greater than 5000 dwt which significantly reduced the number of accidents in order to manage risks through proper ship design the risks have to be measureable in the first place and made explicit to the designer during the design process which makes the traditional design procedure the design spiral less advantageous since it does not consider risks explicitly and how the trade offs if any are made is not quantifiable either in the light of this the international maritime organization imo introduced the formal safety analysis fsa imo 2015 incorporating risk analysis and eventually risk management into the rule making process moreover imo s experiences with incorporation of fsa into rule making process can also be used as reference for specific as opposed to high level ship design cases in a heuristic way when trying to make progress in the direction of paradigm shift from rule based design to pro active goal e g risk based design papanikolaou 2009 this is also the motivation of the present study 1 2 hazard identification normally as the preparation step for the fsa a hazard identification hazid study is conducted first the purpose of such studies is to identify evaluate and rank the most relevant hazards that may lead to accidents but have not necessarily been experiences so far and may be expected in the future so as to bring the most relevant hazardous events into the focus of the next fsa steps for detailed study imo 2015 ultimately the consequences arising from accidental events can be categorized into three types loss or injury of human life non occupational environmental impact and economic loss due to damage or loss of the facility and or loss of business in the shipping industry unlike in the offshore industry where the responsibility of demonstrating compliance with required safety level is on the operator it is the imo and the classification societies that take actions to ensure the safety and environmental protection by incorporating risk assessment to rule making process moan et al 2002 therefore the last type of risk economic loss in the imo fsa study is not included in the risk analysis step but implicitly considered in the subsequent cost benefit study konovessis 2012 the general procedure and methods in conducting a hazid study is the following based on the knowledge and understanding of the system or operation under consideration historical accident data is reviewed and analyzed failure modes effect and criticality analysis fmeca is performed in expert sessions to detect and rank hazards dnv 2002 finally insights gained from accident data i e after the event analysis are combined with findings of a pro active hazard identification to give a general picture of the hazardous events loer and hamann 2007 conducted a hazid study for tanker ships within the safedor project in their study six accident categories were identified by thoroughly reviewing the lloyd s register fairplay lrfp data and they are ship ship collision contact grounding non accidental structural damage fire and explosion the study also concluded that the most frequent accident categories are collision non accidental structural failure and grounding and the most severe outcomes with respect to human safety are the result of fire explosion contact grounding and collision in their recent report itopf 2018 itopf revealed that the most frequent causes of oil spills above 7 tons are collisions and groundings what s more while groundings have been declining over the period from 1970s to 2010s the percentage of allisions collisions have been increasing steadily itopf 2018 also revealed that 50 of large oil spills above 700 tons occurred when the vessels are underway in open sea and groundings and collisions account for 59 of these spills and the number is as high as 99 when the ship is underway in inland or restricted waters therefore in general collisions and groundings have made a large contribution to large spills in different water conditions and thus should be given priority when conducting detailed risk assessment therefore the focus of the present study was placed toward ship ship collisions and thus collision risks 1 3 ship ship collisions the probabilistic approach ship ship collision is a result of a chain of failures in a sequence of complicated physical processes where uncertainties are present at every single stages of the interaction between the two ships pedersen 1995 goerlandt and montewka 2015 sormunen et al 2014 the onset of a collision starts as early as when the two ships are on courses that can lead to contact if no evasive maneuver is done properly i e the encounter situation commonly adopted method for the frequency of encounter geometric probability is given by fujii and shiobare 1971 given an encounter collision can still be avoided if the evasive maneuver is successful and the failure probability for this stage is often termed as the causation probability given failure in evasive maneuver the oil tanker can either be striking or struck depending on the relative speed and collision location which are also random variables and finally if the tanker is the struck vessel a failure in the structure of the cargo tanks eventually lead to an oil outflow since the work by minorsky 1959 the mechanical problem of ship ship collision has commonly been simplified by being divided into external dynamics and internal mechanics coupled by the collision energy e g pederson and zhang 1998 zhang 1999 lützen 2001 brown and chen 2002 hong 2009 tabri et al 2009 even though the nature of each of the phases may well and reasonably be considered deterministic so that in theory if all the fundamental physics and initial conditions are known and can be modeled precisely the solution can be sought such a strategy is usually beyond any practical meaning næss and moan 2012 thus a probabilistic approach is considered appropriate in order to obtain a statistically sound damage outflow distribution extensive amount of collision cases have to be evaluated for a specific ship hull design since even the preliminary design optimization can easily involve hundreds of hull variants methods such as performing integrated dynamic simulations with the finite element method and rigid body dynamics to collect the damage data to establish the damage distributions directly are considered unsuitable for the purpose of risk based ship design and optimization friis hansen and simonsen 2002 proposed a numerical software for risk analysis of two ships colliding in a given sea area and the use of super elements has well balanced computational efficiency and accuracy however parametric ship modeling does not seem to be straightforward although historical accident statistics are harvested from the real world it reflects only fragments of reality relying solely on accident statistics may lead to biases either because they cannot reflect the future or because they do not take into consideration of specific conditions e g ship structural design for different cases brown et al 2000 dnv 2003 this is also part of the reason for the criticism of the imo oil outflow calculation method youssef et al 2014 conducted a quantitative risk assessment qra for double hull oil tanker collisions in their study fem method was adopted due to the fact that a small sample volume 30 containing different combinations of the collision scenario variables were considered to be representative of the entire design space the study was conducted for one ship hull form and only risks to assets and environment are considered no other traditional ship design merits were evaluated based on the above analysis the authors believe that the ideal way of modeling ship ship collision risk for the purpose of risk based design and optimization is to incorporate an efficient deterministic numerical model e g the one proposed by van de wiel and van dorp 2011 into a monte carlo simulation procedure to propagate the uncertainties of the input parameters through the simulations to eventually get the output uncertainties i e the risks this is the strategy adopted in the present study the details are given in the subsequent sections through a case study 1 4 risk control options rcos much of studies on rcos has been done in the maritime navigation area for example dnv 2005 investigated the cost effectiveness of the electronic chart display and information system ecdis for navigation banda et al 2016 proposed a model to assess and manage the risk of winter navigation operations and the model suggests navigational training as the most efficient risk control option however relatively less has been done in the ship structural hull design area except the double hulling and smaller tanks papanikolaou et al 2011 exploited a holistic ship hull design approach including risks as obtained from the imo oil outflow index in their study the rcos are essentially the various ship hull geometric parameters a similar strategy is adopted in the present study however since imo oil outflow index or historical data based methods cannot account for effects of rcos as details of ship structural configurations are not input the present paper adopted an alternative method of calculating the oil outflow risk 1 5 overview of the present work the present study is aimed at establishing an efficient set based design procedure that accounts for oil outflow risk explicitly and evaluates risk simultaneously with other traditional ship design merits in the preliminary design phase of an oil tanker although some statistical data were inevitably used first principle based rational analysis methods were employed wherever possible a space of design variants with different ship main dimensions including the double skin side thickness and double bottom height were generated by systematically varying the relevant design parameters for each design variant four design merits i e the oil outflow risk the steel weight the tank capacity and the calm water resistance were calculated the derived database of the various designs together with their four design merits were then analyzed to evaluate the trade offs in order to achieve an overall optimum design the calculation of the oil outflow risks is based on an existing model due to van de wiel and van dorp 2011 the model was developed especially for risk analysis of tanker ship collision accidents the calculation of the other three merits were conducted by using napa the novelty of the present paper is as follows first the efficiency of the proposed procedure is high with the employment of a probabilistic collision risk model as well as several other analytical models for calculating the rest design merits the procedure is able to evaluate the various aspects of performance for a large amount of design variants which is suitable for the preliminary stage of set based simulation driven design philosophy second the efficiency of the procedure is also evident when supporting decision making sometimes during the ship design process as more information is available the criteria for defining optimum designs can vary as a result the study showed that once the database is obtained by assigning different weighting factors designs with overall optimum performance under the new criteria can be identified quickly last because of the adopted probabilistic collision model the proposed procedure is to the authors best knowledge the first to discuss collision risk based ship design by accounting for the relevant structural details the marpol oil outflow calculation method seems to be able to accomplish a similar task as well however its validity for double hull designs is questionable due to the fact that it is based on limited historical accident data and the data was for single hulls moreover it is not able to account for structural details which is crucial when comparing large amounts of design variants with different design parameters in the following sections first an introduction to the methodology is given which is followed by a case study and eventually an analysis of the design space 2 methodology 2 1 overview of the method the procedure is a synthesis of existing analytical and statistical models for ship collisions and common ship design software the basic idea is to establish a procedure that has high computational efficiency and at the same time can still take into consideration of details such as ship s main particulars and randomly distributed collision scenario variables parametric ship hull model was setup using the common ship design software napa traditional ship performance aspects such as the intact and damage stability calm water resistance cargo capacity and steel weight were calculated using napa too in parallel monte carlo simulations were conducted to obtain the probabilistic oil outflow for each design variant the main particulars and inner tank arrangement parameters were fed to the probabilistic oil outflow model together with the randomly generated collision scenario variables a schematic illustration of the procedure is given in fig 1 especially the procedure presented in this paper integrates a model for simulating probabilistic oil outflow given the tanker being struck the advantages of the model can be summarized as follows variables that describe the collision energy the damage location and extents are explicit inputs based on respective probabilistic distributions which means collision cases can be generated by sampling the random variables and aleatory uncertainties in the collision scenario variables can propagate to the damage main particulars and tank configurations for the struck vessel are input variables too ensuring the influence from ship hull design variables being accounted for correlations between damage extents are accounted for efficient and thus suitable for risk modeling scope and assumptions only environmental risks oil outflow are considered no risk to human life considered only accidental cargo oil outflow due to ship ship collisions are considered operational discharge or bunker oil outflow are not the focus this paper all oil in the breached tank s are considered spilt which may lead to a conservative result double hull concept with 6 by 2 tank arrangement 2 2 parametric hull model a parametric ship hull model fig 2 and fig 3 of the double hull concept was built in napa by modifying a generic tanker geometry provided by napa by parameterizing the hull geometry various design variants can be generated by systematically varying the ship s main particulars and inner tank arrangement parameters hereinafter referred to as the design variables hence the automation of the evaluation of the various design merits 2 3 conventional ship design merits in the present stage of the study simple empirical methods were adopted to calculate ship weight and resistance the weight components accounted for are the hull steel outfit and machinery weights watson and gilfillan 1977 the calm water resistance was calculated using holtrop and mennen s 1982 formulae the cargo volume of each tank is calculated based on the geometric model of napa 2 4 oil outflow risk model 2 4 1 risk metric risk is usually expressed in the maritime industry as well as in many other industries as the product of the probability of having some adverse event and the corresponding consequence see e g iso 2009 vinnem 2014 in terms of accidental oil spills it can be translated into the expected amount of oil outflow 1 r i p i c i where c is the numerical measurement of the consequence i e the spillage in tons i is the consequence index which differentiates the different amounts of oil spillage p is the probability of having a certain amount of oil spillage this expression is essentially the discrete version of the expectation of the probabilistic distribution of oil spillage 2 4 2 annual frequency tanker being struck as introduced in section 1 3 the annual frequency of the tanker being struck can be described by the product of the frequency of encounter geometric probability n the causation probability p c and the probability that the tanker is the struck vessel given collision 2 f struck n p c f struck collision f collision f struck collision 2 4 3 consequence model the environmental consequences from tanker collisions can be represented by the amount of oil spilt the probabilistic ship ship collision damage model given by van de wiel and van dorp 2011 was adopted and implemented numerically in the present study to quantify the probabilistic collision damage and subsequent oil outflow a brief description of the model is given as follows the model given by van de wiel and van dorp 2011 is a regression model obtained by using several statistical data analysis techniques to process the input and output of 40 000 collision simulations for four different tanker designs the collision simulations were conducted by using a deterministic numerical procedure of ship ship collisions developed by brown 2001 brown 2001 s mechanical model is not suitable for conducting directly risk analysis where large number of calculations scenarios are to be assessed as a results a more efficient model based on data analytic is developed by van de wiel and van dorp 2011 for a particular vessel that is potentially going to be struck the random input and output variables of the collisions are listed in table 1 currently no dependencies among the input variables are introduced this is mainly because of the lack of relevant study and data evasive maneuvering is a complicated process involves human intervention the difficulty is that accounting quantitatively for the human factor might resort to surveys or other methods the input variables as listed in table 1 influence the final design in such a way that they first influence the impact energy and then the damage extent and then the potential oil outflow and finally the risk of a particular design the calculated risk will when evaluated together with other merits in turn give an indication of whether the design is an optimum one as compared with other designs the relationship with the impact energy is obviously seen in variables like ship speeds mass collision angle the location variable l is a variable related to the crash worthiness of the ship section the striking vessel type determines the half entrance angle of the striking ship so all variables in the table influence the outflow risk for a particular design parametric distributions that are based on fitting to historical accident data were used by van de wiel and van dorp 2011 to describe the randomness of each of the random input variables the respective distributions are also given in table 1 the realizations of these input variables together with the struck vessel design variables as listed in table 3 define the collision scenarios monte carlo simulations for 10 000 collision scenarios were generated for each design which gives a total of 40 000 collision scenarios for the four different tanker designs the 40 000 input and output variable values then formed a large database to which several data analytics techniques e g polynomial linear regression binary logistic regression were applied to obtain a regression relationship between the input and output variables to facilitate building the regression model the original input variables were first transformed into the predictor variables that have more direct physical relationship with collision and then into the transformed predictor variables expressed by the respective cdfs 3 x x i j i j 1 5 where x 1 f e k p e k p x 2 f e k t e k t x 3 f l l x 4 f h η x 5 f d d and e k p and e k t are perpendicular and tangential kinetic energy at the moment of collision l is the collision location relative to midship η is the bow half entrance angle of the striking vessel d is an indicator variable that can represent either the length of width of the vessel depending on which damage output is being looked at and f is the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of each of the variables the normalization are done for two major reasons 1 to increase numerical stability because different input variables can have very different orders of magnitude in their values normalizing the numbers can increase the significance of small numbers to be comparable to that of the large numbers 2 non dimensionallized parameters can give output variables with uniform dimensions once the input variables have been transformed into a more suitable format as given by eq 3 for regression analysis the output variables of the regression model are assumed to be the sum of an expected value h l and h t and a random variable representing the variation r l and r t 4 y l h l x β l r l 5 y t h t x β t r t polynomial linear regression analysis is then conducted to derive the regression coefficients β l and β t by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals in regard to the random component r l and r t it was found that generalized trapezoidal distribution is best fit to the dataset the advantages of adopting the model can be summarized as follows the model accounts for the effect of double skin thickness whereas the imo marpol method is based on historical accident data from mainly single hulls damage extents length and depth i e penetration are dependent random variables whereas the marpol method uses independent pdf s for the damage extents damage extent pdf s are derived considering the structural features and scantlings whereas the imo marpol calculation method uses normalized pdf s with respect to ship s main dimensions computation wise the computation power needed consists of the following contributions napa calculation for 10 000 different designs for which the damage stability tank capacity and resistance and hull steel weight based on analytical formulae incorporated into napa macro are calculated all this takes around 24 h 10 000 collisions for each design using monte carlo simulation and this part takes about 1 h for the 10 000 designs considered 3 case study a case study was conducted to examine the application of the procedure in the preliminary design of a suezmax tanker ship considering oil outflow risk alongside other conventional ship design merits main particulars and parameters that control the inner tank arrangement were varied systematically so that the design space was explored efficiently and effectively for each feasible design variant the expected oil outflow volume was calculated using the probabilistic collision damage model introduced in section 2 4 intact and damage stability steel weight and calm water resistance were calculated in napa 3 1 reference ship a representative double hull suezmax tanker given by imo 2008 was chosen as the reference ship to which the design variants are compared the main particulars of the ship are given in table 2 3 2 design space filling design constraints a space constituted by the various design variants each defined by the potential possible combination of the design variables is constructed by telling the procedure the range of variations for each of the design variables table 3 in order to explore the design space effectively and efficiently low variance sequence was used to fill the design space the following design constraints were applied to either setting the bounding limits of the design variables in table 3 or filtering out the designs that do not fulfill the general requirement of ship design e g stability to ensure a design space of feasible designs these constrains are listed below suezmax are the maximum marine vessels that meet the restrictions of the suez canal the maximum permissible draught of suezmax is 20 1 m to pass the canal from 2010 the wetted surface cross sectional area of the ship is limited by 1006 m2 which means 20 1 m of draught for ships with the beam no wider than 50 0 m or 12 2 m of draught for ships with maximum allowed beam of 77 5 m wikipedia suezmax the ratios l b b d and b t are limited to between 5 5 and 6 0 1 9 and 2 1 and 2 25 and 3 75 respectively lamb 2003 damage stability of each design is checked against imo s damage stability code imo 1974 in addition the examination is restricted to the feasible designs that have a displacement falls in the range of 10 the displacement of the reference design so that the variants are relatively comparable in terms of ship size in the present study originally 10 000 designs were generated of which 8752 are feasible ones that fulfill the constraints listed above the scatter plots of the generated ship design variables for feasible designs are presented in fig 4 3 3 oil outflow risk modeling 3 3 1 frequency of ship ship collisions since hull design does not show effect on the collision frequency sames and hamann 2009 a constant value for the collision frequency denoted as f collision involving oil tankers as given by the safedor project was adopted for all design variants which is 9 35e 3 per ship year imo 2008 considering tankers have relatively low operational speed experts of the safedor project suggested that given collision the probability of the tanker ship being struck denoted as f struck collision being 0 8 imo 2008 thus the frequency of the tanker being struck according to eq 2 is 7 48e 3 per ship year it should be noted that the value for f collision adopted in the present study is an overall value for all types of oil tankers the particular value for suezmax tankers may be somewhat different since the attempt of the present study is to demonstrate the implementation of the risk based ship design procedure the adopted values is considered sufficient to serve that purpose a refined study on the collision frequency can be conducted by studying the causation probability and the number of collision candidate pedersen 1995 dnv 2003 montewka et al 2012 the product of which yields the collision frequency 3 3 2 consequence model and simulation results in the present study 10 000 collision cases for which the tanker being studied is the struck vessel were generated based on each input collision scenario variable s probabilistic distribution and the random combinations of values of the collision scenario variables it is assumed that these 10 000 collision cases constitute a sample space that is large enough to represent all the possible collision scenarios the same 10 000 collision cases were applied to each design variant and monte carlo simulations were conducted by knowing the damage properties and the inner tank arrangement the breached tanks can then be identified and oil outflow volume calculated accordingly by assuming a density of 900 kg m3 the spillage in tons can thus be obtained it is assumed that the ship is fully loaded during half of the journey per year and the other half fully empty and this too is made a random variable in the calculations fig 5 shows an example of the simulated distributions of the damage length and depth for the reference ship it is clearly seen that the damage length and depth are positively correlated in fig 6 the frequency distribution of the possible oil outflow amounts for the reference ship is presented the distribution is discrete because of the simplifying assumption in the current work that once a tank is breached all oil in that tank is assumed to flow out so the amount of outflow in the simulated cases can only be combinations of tank volumes this is because the lack of supporting data or study on the distribution of percentage of outflow and this is also an assumption in the imo outflow calculation method the frequencies were obtained by multiplying the frequency for the tanker being struck f struck by the relative frequencies of each of the individual outflow amounts given that the tanker is the struck vessel the expected outflow per year for this particular case is 13 tons it is interesting to note that fig 6 also reveals that collisions that do not lead to oil spill i e zero spillage constitute a large portion of the possible collision cases this is the case especially for double hull tankers where the double side structure absorbs more collision kinetic energy and thus reduces the failure probability of the inner hull the rationale of using the expected value as risk representation can be explained by eq 1 that is in fig 6 each discrete outflow volume represents a consequence metric for the corresponding collision scenario the expected value is then also the sum risk of all possible scenarios fig 7 shows the simulated expected oil spillage per year for each of the feasible designs contained in the design space with the maximum being 30 tons and the minimum 7 tons the average of the expected values over all the feasible designs is 17 tons eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2007 conducted a comprehensive study on the analysis of the recorded accidents involving oil tankers three ad hoc accident databases for their study were developed their study shows that for suezmax tankers the average spill rate due to collision accidents for the period from 1990 to 2003 is 20 tons per ship year which agrees with the simulated 17 tons very well a direct comparison between the simulated expected spillage as plotted in fig 7 and the figures given by eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2007 indicates that the design variants are scattered around the average value in terms of spill rate with more designs falling into the safer than average side this seems well reasonable considering the fact that eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2007 s figure is an average over different sizes of suzemax tankers in the fleet at risk and the fleet at risk may include single hull vessels which have larger potential for oil spills in accidents fig 8 shows the relationship between the width of the double skin sides and the probability of having zero outflow again it reveals that double hulling and increasing the width of the double skin sides is an effective risk control option from a ship hull design perspective and this is more obvious when the width of the double sides is greater than 2 5 m 4 design space exploration 4 1 method introduction the relationships between the steel weight calm water resistance cargo capacity and mean oil outflow for all the feasible designs as obtained from the simulations are summarized and presented in the form of scatter plots and shown as examples in fig 9 through fig 16 the difference between the figures presented are only the different identified optimal designs given different preferences i e weighting factors or settings the scatter plots indicate the trade offs between each pair of conflicting objectives the goal is to identify the optimal designs which give the maximum cargo capacity while at the same time keep the steel weight resistance and mean oil outflow at a minimum since the four conflicting goals for the space of the design variants form a 4 d hyperspace naturally the first thing one may want to look at is the search for the pareto front which is a subset of the design space that contains designs for which no possible improvement can be made on any design merits without compromising the rest the designs fall outside of the pareto front are therefore dominated and thus can be left out of further examination the designs fall on the pareto front are the non dominated set which means that the answer to which are better remains open until a specific setting or preference is introduced how a favored design is subsequently to be chosen depends on the specific settings of the intended service profile of the ship which may include e g the sailing area design life span etc for the 4 d space studied in the present study it was found that the pareto front which should be a 3 d sub set is scarce for example it was found that within the examined design space there did not exist a design that is better than the reference design in terms of all the design merits this is as expected since the reference design is believed to be a somewhat optimized one at least for the three conventional merits that do not include oil outflow risk this can be confirmed by fig 14 where the weighting factors are back calculated from the setting that gives the best achievable rank for the reference ship nevertheless depending on the operational profile of the vessel relatively better designs can still be pursued by putting more weights on the dominant factor s and evaluating the overall performance to this end a technique similar to the simplest type of utility function was introduced in the present study to represent the overall utility of each design variant by accounting for the four design merits and the various predefined weighting factors the advantage of such a method is that the various design merits that are different in nature and in turn have different units of measurement can be standardized summed and compared directly each design merit for all the design variants were first sorted ascending and then the value for each design variant was normalized according to its rank in the sorted sequence the outcome is that for each design variant the values of all its design merits are mapped onto the unit interval 0 1 and these mapped values are what is called utility values in the present study to represent its performance relative to other designs then the total utility of the design which is the sum of the four merits considered is expressed as 6 u tot j i 1 4 w i u i j where i is the index for the design merits in the order of steel weight resistance mean outflow and cargo capacity j is the index for the design variant u i j is the utility value of design merit i for the design variant j u tot j is the total utility for design variant j w i is the weighting factor for design merit i since the goal is to maximize the cargo capacity and at the same time minimize the other three the utility value for cargo capacity is made negative so that the problem is converted into a single objective one that is to minimize the total utility obviously the total utility is influenced by w i as well as u i j this means that decision in regard to choosing the optimal designs depends on the specific settings of the intended service profile of the ship which may include e g the sailing area design life span etc and these preference factors are reflected by the weighting factors by using this technique in figs 9 16 the five most favorable designs are highlighted in terms of utility level which reflects the overall performance considering all the four merits with serval different settings of predefined weighing factors 4 2 model verification in order to verify the model and the methods used first some extreme settings figs 9 12 with all weights put on a single design merit are examined for example in fig 9 when all that matters is the steel weight the highest ranked designs are as expected the ones with the smallest steel weight as shown in sub plot 1 whereas sub plots 2 and 3shows these optimal designs perform not as well for resistance and cargo capacity similar observations can be made on figs 10 12 then in fig 13 another special case where equal weights i e no preference were given to the four design merits is shown the five most favorable designs given by ranking the utility levels of all the designs are in general concentrated in the smaller size segments this is reasonable because all of the four merits but the cargo capacity favor a smaller ship in general as mentioned above fig 14 gives a setting where the values of the weighting factors are back calculated from the case of best achievable rank of the reference design it can be seen that more weights are given to all but oil outflow risk it is reasonable that the weighing factor for the oil outflow in this case is not zero this is because some considerations must have been imposed implicitly by following the design rules e g the 2 5 m double skin side the figure also shows that no matter how the weighting factors vary the reference ship is not able to become top ranked indicating potential for improvement 4 3 sensitivity analysis in environmentally sensitive areas more preferences should be given to the designs with relatively low oil outflow level with some sacrifice of economic aspects in order to avoid or mitigate the devastating consequences from oil spill in contrast to the scenario in fig 13 when more weights are given to e g oil outflow and cargo capacity as shown in figs 15 and 16 for instance some larger vessels can become competitive too table 4 gives the top five designs in terms of overall utility level for different predefined sets of weighting factors settings 1 3 5 7 9 and 11 correspond to the examples given in figs 9 12 and 15 and 16 in addition to settings 1 3 5 7 9 their respective pair s with some variation in the weighting factors are given in settings 2 4 6 8 and 10 12 the different top ranked designs identified thus shows the sensitivity of the results to the predefined weighting factors it can be seen that in all of the setting groups i e 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 when the weighting factors are slightly varied some recurring designs e g highlighted in bold text are identified this suggests the robustness of the method in capturing the most desirable designs in terms of overall performance when given various settings the design variables and the design merits for the repeatedly emerging designs for the last setting group are given in table 5 5 conclusion and future work a procedure for the preliminary design of oil tanker considering oil outflow risk from ship ship collisions was introduced the procedure is a synthesis of statistical and analytical models and common ship design software the application of the procedure was examined by conducting a case study with a representative suezmax tanker risk as measured by the expected oil outflow is considered together with other conventional ship design merits the utility levels for each of the design variants were compared for different weighing factors it was seen that different weighing factors can point to designs with different features the procedure can facilitate making decisions under various or changing scenarios for example in environmentally fragile sea areas more attention is naturally given to oil outflow risk at the same time without compromising profitability too much in this case similarly high weights can be assigned to these two merits like designs highlighted in table 5 to achieve a better overall performance it can also be seen from the study that although there does not exist a design in the explored design space which is superior to the reference ship in regard to all of the four merits when given a specific scenario an even better design can be pursued to that direction for instance designs in table 5 rank higher than the reference design in terms of overall utility level under the given preference since the present work is carried out with focus on the preliminary design where design space exploration is aimed for to see how risk plays a role in this the presented criteria and method have served this purpose well on the other hand further investigations where monetary values and criteria cats are more relevant should be conducted in a context of formal optimization study where a proper optimization engine should be employed by using algorithms like ann to drive design using the optimal designs identified in the current study as start point considering the amount of work required by that this paper just focuses on the design space exploration part future work needs to be carried out to evaluate the gains and losses among the various designs by e g converting the respective performance aspect into a monetary value and by considering the overall cost benefit of the vessel during her design life span in addition more design merits that are relevant can be introduced also a number of additional issues have to be studied for a fully probabilistic oil outflow to be arrived at namely encounter number geometric probability in the area that the ship under design is intended to sail and the causation probability for collision due to failure of evasive maneuver given encounter e g by using fault trees or bayesian networks in addition in the present study it is assumed that all oil is spilt if the inner tank wall is breached as does the imo oil outflow method this may be conservative as at the moment no information on the probabilistic distribution of percentage of outflow from a tank is available and such studies are desirable acknowledgements this research is funded by singapore maritime institute under the

22836,this paper proposes an efficient simulation driven method for the preliminary design of a double hull oil tanker where the oil outflow risk due to ship ship collisions are considered alongside other conventional ship design merits the simulation procedure was established by integrating a probabilistic oil outflow model with common ship design software to evaluate various aspects of performance the procedure was implemented in a parametric way such that by systematically varying the parameters that define the design large amount of design variants can be evaluated the comparisons of several ship design merits including safety across the variants are discussed through a case study with a suezmax tanker to get an insight into the trade offs which is crucial for modern ship design decision in regard to choosing the optimal designs depends on the intended purposes and service profile of the vessel when equal weights and thus no preferences were given to the design merits the most favorable designs are concentrated in the smaller size segments whereas in environmentally sensitive areas when more preferences should be given to the designs with relatively low oil outflow risk some larger vessels can become competitive too finally the sensitivity of the preference factors is discussed keywords safety ship ship collisions accidental oil outflow risk based ship design

accidents impact design and operation catastrophic accidents such as the collision between the atlantic empress and aegean captain hooke 1997 the grounding accident of the amoco cadiz noaa 1978 and the loss of structural integrity of the prestige commission of the european communities 2003 have raised major concerns over the safety of seaborne transport of oil and have thus forced the industry and regulatory authorities to ever re think and improve the design and operation of the ship and its sub systems for example the u s introduced the oil pollution act of 1990 opa90 as a result of the grounding of the oil tanker exxon valdez in 1989 which included provisions for the double hulling of oil tankers eu banned single hull tankers following the prestige tanker disaster in 2002 the grounding event of the amoco cadiz resulted in the requirement of redundancy in power units and the recent collision between the mt sanchi and the mv cf crystal has brought attention again to human errors admittedly accidents have provided valuable rare cases from which knowledge and better understanding can be learnt however this paradigm of reactive rule development following major accidents is being questioned in that it is a passive way of dealing with uncertainties and that it is not clear whether or how well do present design practice reflect reality which should include both the past and the future 1 1 2 how proper design and operation help reduce accidents according to unctad seaborne trade of crude oil will continue growing at a rate of 1 2 from 2017 to 2022 unctad 2017 although the frequency of having an accident or incident derived from historical accident records may seem low the consequences of such events can be devastating nrc 1991 it is then incumbent upon the designers and operators to manage the risks in seaborne transport of oil by first looking at the potential accidental events and then investigating their causes and effects and finally think of implementation of reduction measures imo 2008 for instance marpol convention 13f requires double hull for all oil tankers greater than 5000 dwt which significantly reduced the number of accidents in order to manage risks through proper ship design the risks have to be measureable in the first place and made explicit to the designer during the design process which makes the traditional design procedure the design spiral less advantageous since it does not consider risks explicitly and how the trade offs if any are made is not quantifiable either in the light of this the international maritime organization imo introduced the formal safety analysis fsa imo 2015 incorporating risk analysis and eventually risk management into the rule making process moreover imo s experiences with incorporation of fsa into rule making process can also be used as reference for specific as opposed to high level ship design cases in a heuristic way when trying to make progress in the direction of paradigm shift from rule based design to pro active goal e g risk based design papanikolaou 2009 this is also the motivation of the present study 1 2 hazard identification normally as the preparation step for the fsa a hazard identification hazid study is conducted first the purpose of such studies is to identify evaluate and rank the most relevant hazards that may lead to accidents but have not necessarily been experiences so far and may be expected in the future so as to bring the most relevant hazardous events into the focus of the next fsa steps for detailed study imo 2015 ultimately the consequences arising from accidental events can be categorized into three types loss or injury of human life non occupational environmental impact and economic loss due to damage or loss of the facility and or loss of business in the shipping industry unlike in the offshore industry where the responsibility of demonstrating compliance with required safety level is on the operator it is the imo and the classification societies that take actions to ensure the safety and environmental protection by incorporating risk assessment to rule making process moan et al 2002 therefore the last type of risk economic loss in the imo fsa study is not included in the risk analysis step but implicitly considered in the subsequent cost benefit study konovessis 2012 the general procedure and methods in conducting a hazid study is the following based on the knowledge and understanding of the system or operation under consideration historical accident data is reviewed and analyzed failure modes effect and criticality analysis fmeca is performed in expert sessions to detect and rank hazards dnv 2002 finally insights gained from accident data i e after the event analysis are combined with findings of a pro active hazard identification to give a general picture of the hazardous events loer and hamann 2007 conducted a hazid study for tanker ships within the safedor project in their study six accident categories were identified by thoroughly reviewing the lloyd s register fairplay lrfp data and they are ship ship collision contact grounding non accidental structural damage fire and explosion the study also concluded that the most frequent accident categories are collision non accidental structural failure and grounding and the most severe outcomes with respect to human safety are the result of fire explosion contact grounding and collision in their recent report itopf 2018 itopf revealed that the most frequent causes of oil spills above 7 tons are collisions and groundings what s more while groundings have been declining over the period from 1970s to 2010s the percentage of allisions collisions have been increasing steadily itopf 2018 also revealed that 50 of large oil spills above 700 tons occurred when the vessels are underway in open sea and groundings and collisions account for 59 of these spills and the number is as high as 99 when the ship is underway in inland or restricted waters therefore in general collisions and groundings have made a large contribution to large spills in different water conditions and thus should be given priority when conducting detailed risk assessment therefore the focus of the present study was placed toward ship ship collisions and thus collision risks 1 3 ship ship collisions the probabilistic approach ship ship collision is a result of a chain of failures in a sequence of complicated physical processes where uncertainties are present at every single stages of the interaction between the two ships pedersen 1995 goerlandt and montewka 2015 sormunen et al 2014 the onset of a collision starts as early as when the two ships are on courses that can lead to contact if no evasive maneuver is done properly i e the encounter situation commonly adopted method for the frequency of encounter geometric probability is given by fujii and shiobare 1971 given an encounter collision can still be avoided if the evasive maneuver is successful and the failure probability for this stage is often termed as the causation probability given failure in evasive maneuver the oil tanker can either be striking or struck depending on the relative speed and collision location which are also random variables and finally if the tanker is the struck vessel a failure in the structure of the cargo tanks eventually lead to an oil outflow since the work by minorsky 1959 the mechanical problem of ship ship collision has commonly been simplified by being divided into external dynamics and internal mechanics coupled by the collision energy e g pederson and zhang 1998 zhang 1999 lützen 2001 brown and chen 2002 hong 2009 tabri et al 2009 even though the nature of each of the phases may well and reasonably be considered deterministic so that in theory if all the fundamental physics and initial conditions are known and can be modeled precisely the solution can be sought such a strategy is usually beyond any practical meaning næss and moan 2012 thus a probabilistic approach is considered appropriate in order to obtain a statistically sound damage outflow distribution extensive amount of collision cases have to be evaluated for a specific ship hull design since even the preliminary design optimization can easily involve hundreds of hull variants methods such as performing integrated dynamic simulations with the finite element method and rigid body dynamics to collect the damage data to establish the damage distributions directly are considered unsuitable for the purpose of risk based ship design and optimization friis hansen and simonsen 2002 proposed a numerical software for risk analysis of two ships colliding in a given sea area and the use of super elements has well balanced computational efficiency and accuracy however parametric ship modeling does not seem to be straightforward although historical accident statistics are harvested from the real world it reflects only fragments of reality relying solely on accident statistics may lead to biases either because they cannot reflect the future or because they do not take into consideration of specific conditions e g ship structural design for different cases brown et al 2000 dnv 2003 this is also part of the reason for the criticism of the imo oil outflow calculation method youssef et al 2014 conducted a quantitative risk assessment qra for double hull oil tanker collisions in their study fem method was adopted due to the fact that a small sample volume 30 containing different combinations of the collision scenario variables were considered to be representative of the entire design space the study was conducted for one ship hull form and only risks to assets and environment are considered no other traditional ship design merits were evaluated based on the above analysis the authors believe that the ideal way of modeling ship ship collision risk for the purpose of risk based design and optimization is to incorporate an efficient deterministic numerical model e g the one proposed by van de wiel and van dorp 2011 into a monte carlo simulation procedure to propagate the uncertainties of the input parameters through the simulations to eventually get the output uncertainties i e the risks this is the strategy adopted in the present study the details are given in the subsequent sections through a case study 1 4 risk control options rcos much of studies on rcos has been done in the maritime navigation area for example dnv 2005 investigated the cost effectiveness of the electronic chart display and information system ecdis for navigation banda et al 2016 proposed a model to assess and manage the risk of winter navigation operations and the model suggests navigational training as the most efficient risk control option however relatively less has been done in the ship structural hull design area except the double hulling and smaller tanks papanikolaou et al 2011 exploited a holistic ship hull design approach including risks as obtained from the imo oil outflow index in their study the rcos are essentially the various ship hull geometric parameters a similar strategy is adopted in the present study however since imo oil outflow index or historical data based methods cannot account for effects of rcos as details of ship structural configurations are not input the present paper adopted an alternative method of calculating the oil outflow risk 1 5 overview of the present work the present study is aimed at establishing an efficient set based design procedure that accounts for oil outflow risk explicitly and evaluates risk simultaneously with other traditional ship design merits in the preliminary design phase of an oil tanker although some statistical data were inevitably used first principle based rational analysis methods were employed wherever possible a space of design variants with different ship main dimensions including the double skin side thickness and double bottom height were generated by systematically varying the relevant design parameters for each design variant four design merits i e the oil outflow risk the steel weight the tank capacity and the calm water resistance were calculated the derived database of the various designs together with their four design merits were then analyzed to evaluate the trade offs in order to achieve an overall optimum design the calculation of the oil outflow risks is based on an existing model due to van de wiel and van dorp 2011 the model was developed especially for risk analysis of tanker ship collision accidents the calculation of the other three merits were conducted by using napa the novelty of the present paper is as follows first the efficiency of the proposed procedure is high with the employment of a probabilistic collision risk model as well as several other analytical models for calculating the rest design merits the procedure is able to evaluate the various aspects of performance for a large amount of design variants which is suitable for the preliminary stage of set based simulation driven design philosophy second the efficiency of the procedure is also evident when supporting decision making sometimes during the ship design process as more information is available the criteria for defining optimum designs can vary as a result the study showed that once the database is obtained by assigning different weighting factors designs with overall optimum performance under the new criteria can be identified quickly last because of the adopted probabilistic collision model the proposed procedure is to the authors best knowledge the first to discuss collision risk based ship design by accounting for the relevant structural details the marpol oil outflow calculation method seems to be able to accomplish a similar task as well however its validity for double hull designs is questionable due to the fact that it is based on limited historical accident data and the data was for single hulls moreover it is not able to account for structural details which is crucial when comparing large amounts of design variants with different design parameters in the following sections first an introduction to the methodology is given which is followed by a case study and eventually an analysis of the design space 2 methodology 2 1 overview of the method the procedure is a synthesis of existing analytical and statistical models for ship collisions and common ship design software the basic idea is to establish a procedure that has high computational efficiency and at the same time can still take into consideration of details such as ship s main particulars and randomly distributed collision scenario variables parametric ship hull model was setup using the common ship design software napa traditional ship performance aspects such as the intact and damage stability calm water resistance cargo capacity and steel weight were calculated using napa too in parallel monte carlo simulations were conducted to obtain the probabilistic oil outflow for each design variant the main particulars and inner tank arrangement parameters were fed to the probabilistic oil outflow model together with the randomly generated collision scenario variables a schematic illustration of the procedure is given in fig 1 especially the procedure presented in this paper integrates a model for simulating probabilistic oil outflow given the tanker being struck the advantages of the model can be summarized as follows variables that describe the collision energy the damage location and extents are explicit inputs based on respective probabilistic distributions which means collision cases can be generated by sampling the random variables and aleatory uncertainties in the collision scenario variables can propagate to the damage main particulars and tank configurations for the struck vessel are input variables too ensuring the influence from ship hull design variables being accounted for correlations between damage extents are accounted for efficient and thus suitable for risk modeling scope and assumptions only environmental risks oil outflow are considered no risk to human life considered only accidental cargo oil outflow due to ship ship collisions are considered operational discharge or bunker oil outflow are not the focus this paper all oil in the breached tank s are considered spilt which may lead to a conservative result double hull concept with 6 by 2 tank arrangement 2 2 parametric hull model a parametric ship hull model fig 2 and fig 3 of the double hull concept was built in napa by modifying a generic tanker geometry provided by napa by parameterizing the hull geometry various design variants can be generated by systematically varying the ship s main particulars and inner tank arrangement parameters hereinafter referred to as the design variables hence the automation of the evaluation of the various design merits 2 3 conventional ship design merits in the present stage of the study simple empirical methods were adopted to calculate ship weight and resistance the weight components accounted for are the hull steel outfit and machinery weights watson and gilfillan 1977 the calm water resistance was calculated using holtrop and mennen s 1982 formulae the cargo volume of each tank is calculated based on the geometric model of napa 2 4 oil outflow risk model 2 4 1 risk metric risk is usually expressed in the maritime industry as well as in many other industries as the product of the probability of having some adverse event and the corresponding consequence see e g iso 2009 vinnem 2014 in terms of accidental oil spills it can be translated into the expected amount of oil outflow 1 r i p i c i where c is the numerical measurement of the consequence i e the spillage in tons i is the consequence index which differentiates the different amounts of oil spillage p is the probability of having a certain amount of oil spillage this expression is essentially the discrete version of the expectation of the probabilistic distribution of oil spillage 2 4 2 annual frequency tanker being struck as introduced in section 1 3 the annual frequency of the tanker being struck can be described by the product of the frequency of encounter geometric probability n the causation probability p c and the probability that the tanker is the struck vessel given collision 2 f struck n p c f struck collision f collision f struck collision 2 4 3 consequence model the environmental consequences from tanker collisions can be represented by the amount of oil spilt the probabilistic ship ship collision damage model given by van de wiel and van dorp 2011 was adopted and implemented numerically in the present study to quantify the probabilistic collision damage and subsequent oil outflow a brief description of the model is given as follows the model given by van de wiel and van dorp 2011 is a regression model obtained by using several statistical data analysis techniques to process the input and output of 40 000 collision simulations for four different tanker designs the collision simulations were conducted by using a deterministic numerical procedure of ship ship collisions developed by brown 2001 brown 2001 s mechanical model is not suitable for conducting directly risk analysis where large number of calculations scenarios are to be assessed as a results a more efficient model based on data analytic is developed by van de wiel and van dorp 2011 for a particular vessel that is potentially going to be struck the random input and output variables of the collisions are listed in table 1 currently no dependencies among the input variables are introduced this is mainly because of the lack of relevant study and data evasive maneuvering is a complicated process involves human intervention the difficulty is that accounting quantitatively for the human factor might resort to surveys or other methods the input variables as listed in table 1 influence the final design in such a way that they first influence the impact energy and then the damage extent and then the potential oil outflow and finally the risk of a particular design the calculated risk will when evaluated together with other merits in turn give an indication of whether the design is an optimum one as compared with other designs the relationship with the impact energy is obviously seen in variables like ship speeds mass collision angle the location variable l is a variable related to the crash worthiness of the ship section the striking vessel type determines the half entrance angle of the striking ship so all variables in the table influence the outflow risk for a particular design parametric distributions that are based on fitting to historical accident data were used by van de wiel and van dorp 2011 to describe the randomness of each of the random input variables the respective distributions are also given in table 1 the realizations of these input variables together with the struck vessel design variables as listed in table 3 define the collision scenarios monte carlo simulations for 10 000 collision scenarios were generated for each design which gives a total of 40 000 collision scenarios for the four different tanker designs the 40 000 input and output variable values then formed a large database to which several data analytics techniques e g polynomial linear regression binary logistic regression were applied to obtain a regression relationship between the input and output variables to facilitate building the regression model the original input variables were first transformed into the predictor variables that have more direct physical relationship with collision and then into the transformed predictor variables expressed by the respective cdfs 3 x x i j i j 1 5 where x 1 f e k p e k p x 2 f e k t e k t x 3 f l l x 4 f h η x 5 f d d and e k p and e k t are perpendicular and tangential kinetic energy at the moment of collision l is the collision location relative to midship η is the bow half entrance angle of the striking vessel d is an indicator variable that can represent either the length of width of the vessel depending on which damage output is being looked at and f is the cumulative distribution functions cdfs of each of the variables the normalization are done for two major reasons 1 to increase numerical stability because different input variables can have very different orders of magnitude in their values normalizing the numbers can increase the significance of small numbers to be comparable to that of the large numbers 2 non dimensionallized parameters can give output variables with uniform dimensions once the input variables have been transformed into a more suitable format as given by eq 3 for regression analysis the output variables of the regression model are assumed to be the sum of an expected value h l and h t and a random variable representing the variation r l and r t 4 y l h l x β l r l 5 y t h t x β t r t polynomial linear regression analysis is then conducted to derive the regression coefficients β l and β t by minimizing the sum of the squared residuals in regard to the random component r l and r t it was found that generalized trapezoidal distribution is best fit to the dataset the advantages of adopting the model can be summarized as follows the model accounts for the effect of double skin thickness whereas the imo marpol method is based on historical accident data from mainly single hulls damage extents length and depth i e penetration are dependent random variables whereas the marpol method uses independent pdf s for the damage extents damage extent pdf s are derived considering the structural features and scantlings whereas the imo marpol calculation method uses normalized pdf s with respect to ship s main dimensions computation wise the computation power needed consists of the following contributions napa calculation for 10 000 different designs for which the damage stability tank capacity and resistance and hull steel weight based on analytical formulae incorporated into napa macro are calculated all this takes around 24 h 10 000 collisions for each design using monte carlo simulation and this part takes about 1 h for the 10 000 designs considered 3 case study a case study was conducted to examine the application of the procedure in the preliminary design of a suezmax tanker ship considering oil outflow risk alongside other conventional ship design merits main particulars and parameters that control the inner tank arrangement were varied systematically so that the design space was explored efficiently and effectively for each feasible design variant the expected oil outflow volume was calculated using the probabilistic collision damage model introduced in section 2 4 intact and damage stability steel weight and calm water resistance were calculated in napa 3 1 reference ship a representative double hull suezmax tanker given by imo 2008 was chosen as the reference ship to which the design variants are compared the main particulars of the ship are given in table 2 3 2 design space filling design constraints a space constituted by the various design variants each defined by the potential possible combination of the design variables is constructed by telling the procedure the range of variations for each of the design variables table 3 in order to explore the design space effectively and efficiently low variance sequence was used to fill the design space the following design constraints were applied to either setting the bounding limits of the design variables in table 3 or filtering out the designs that do not fulfill the general requirement of ship design e g stability to ensure a design space of feasible designs these constrains are listed below suezmax are the maximum marine vessels that meet the restrictions of the suez canal the maximum permissible draught of suezmax is 20 1 m to pass the canal from 2010 the wetted surface cross sectional area of the ship is limited by 1006 m2 which means 20 1 m of draught for ships with the beam no wider than 50 0 m or 12 2 m of draught for ships with maximum allowed beam of 77 5 m wikipedia suezmax the ratios l b b d and b t are limited to between 5 5 and 6 0 1 9 and 2 1 and 2 25 and 3 75 respectively lamb 2003 damage stability of each design is checked against imo s damage stability code imo 1974 in addition the examination is restricted to the feasible designs that have a displacement falls in the range of 10 the displacement of the reference design so that the variants are relatively comparable in terms of ship size in the present study originally 10 000 designs were generated of which 8752 are feasible ones that fulfill the constraints listed above the scatter plots of the generated ship design variables for feasible designs are presented in fig 4 3 3 oil outflow risk modeling 3 3 1 frequency of ship ship collisions since hull design does not show effect on the collision frequency sames and hamann 2009 a constant value for the collision frequency denoted as f collision involving oil tankers as given by the safedor project was adopted for all design variants which is 9 35e 3 per ship year imo 2008 considering tankers have relatively low operational speed experts of the safedor project suggested that given collision the probability of the tanker ship being struck denoted as f struck collision being 0 8 imo 2008 thus the frequency of the tanker being struck according to eq 2 is 7 48e 3 per ship year it should be noted that the value for f collision adopted in the present study is an overall value for all types of oil tankers the particular value for suezmax tankers may be somewhat different since the attempt of the present study is to demonstrate the implementation of the risk based ship design procedure the adopted values is considered sufficient to serve that purpose a refined study on the collision frequency can be conducted by studying the causation probability and the number of collision candidate pedersen 1995 dnv 2003 montewka et al 2012 the product of which yields the collision frequency 3 3 2 consequence model and simulation results in the present study 10 000 collision cases for which the tanker being studied is the struck vessel were generated based on each input collision scenario variable s probabilistic distribution and the random combinations of values of the collision scenario variables it is assumed that these 10 000 collision cases constitute a sample space that is large enough to represent all the possible collision scenarios the same 10 000 collision cases were applied to each design variant and monte carlo simulations were conducted by knowing the damage properties and the inner tank arrangement the breached tanks can then be identified and oil outflow volume calculated accordingly by assuming a density of 900 kg m3 the spillage in tons can thus be obtained it is assumed that the ship is fully loaded during half of the journey per year and the other half fully empty and this too is made a random variable in the calculations fig 5 shows an example of the simulated distributions of the damage length and depth for the reference ship it is clearly seen that the damage length and depth are positively correlated in fig 6 the frequency distribution of the possible oil outflow amounts for the reference ship is presented the distribution is discrete because of the simplifying assumption in the current work that once a tank is breached all oil in that tank is assumed to flow out so the amount of outflow in the simulated cases can only be combinations of tank volumes this is because the lack of supporting data or study on the distribution of percentage of outflow and this is also an assumption in the imo outflow calculation method the frequencies were obtained by multiplying the frequency for the tanker being struck f struck by the relative frequencies of each of the individual outflow amounts given that the tanker is the struck vessel the expected outflow per year for this particular case is 13 tons it is interesting to note that fig 6 also reveals that collisions that do not lead to oil spill i e zero spillage constitute a large portion of the possible collision cases this is the case especially for double hull tankers where the double side structure absorbs more collision kinetic energy and thus reduces the failure probability of the inner hull the rationale of using the expected value as risk representation can be explained by eq 1 that is in fig 6 each discrete outflow volume represents a consequence metric for the corresponding collision scenario the expected value is then also the sum risk of all possible scenarios fig 7 shows the simulated expected oil spillage per year for each of the feasible designs contained in the design space with the maximum being 30 tons and the minimum 7 tons the average of the expected values over all the feasible designs is 17 tons eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2007 conducted a comprehensive study on the analysis of the recorded accidents involving oil tankers three ad hoc accident databases for their study were developed their study shows that for suezmax tankers the average spill rate due to collision accidents for the period from 1990 to 2003 is 20 tons per ship year which agrees with the simulated 17 tons very well a direct comparison between the simulated expected spillage as plotted in fig 7 and the figures given by eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2007 indicates that the design variants are scattered around the average value in terms of spill rate with more designs falling into the safer than average side this seems well reasonable considering the fact that eliopoulou and papanikolaou 2007 s figure is an average over different sizes of suzemax tankers in the fleet at risk and the fleet at risk may include single hull vessels which have larger potential for oil spills in accidents fig 8 shows the relationship between the width of the double skin sides and the probability of having zero outflow again it reveals that double hulling and increasing the width of the double skin sides is an effective risk control option from a ship hull design perspective and this is more obvious when the width of the double sides is greater than 2 5 m 4 design space exploration 4 1 method introduction the relationships between the steel weight calm water resistance cargo capacity and mean oil outflow for all the feasible designs as obtained from the simulations are summarized and presented in the form of scatter plots and shown as examples in fig 9 through fig 16 the difference between the figures presented are only the different identified optimal designs given different preferences i e weighting factors or settings the scatter plots indicate the trade offs between each pair of conflicting objectives the goal is to identify the optimal designs which give the maximum cargo capacity while at the same time keep the steel weight resistance and mean oil outflow at a minimum since the four conflicting goals for the space of the design variants form a 4 d hyperspace naturally the first thing one may want to look at is the search for the pareto front which is a subset of the design space that contains designs for which no possible improvement can be made on any design merits without compromising the rest the designs fall outside of the pareto front are therefore dominated and thus can be left out of further examination the designs fall on the pareto front are the non dominated set which means that the answer to which are better remains open until a specific setting or preference is introduced how a favored design is subsequently to be chosen depends on the specific settings of the intended service profile of the ship which may include e g the sailing area design life span etc for the 4 d space studied in the present study it was found that the pareto front which should be a 3 d sub set is scarce for example it was found that within the examined design space there did not exist a design that is better than the reference design in terms of all the design merits this is as expected since the reference design is believed to be a somewhat optimized one at least for the three conventional merits that do not include oil outflow risk this can be confirmed by fig 14 where the weighting factors are back calculated from the setting that gives the best achievable rank for the reference ship nevertheless depending on the operational profile of the vessel relatively better designs can still be pursued by putting more weights on the dominant factor s and evaluating the overall performance to this end a technique similar to the simplest type of utility function was introduced in the present study to represent the overall utility of each design variant by accounting for the four design merits and the various predefined weighting factors the advantage of such a method is that the various design merits that are different in nature and in turn have different units of measurement can be standardized summed and compared directly each design merit for all the design variants were first sorted ascending and then the value for each design variant was normalized according to its rank in the sorted sequence the outcome is that for each design variant the values of all its design merits are mapped onto the unit interval 0 1 and these mapped values are what is called utility values in the present study to represent its performance relative to other designs then the total utility of the design which is the sum of the four merits considered is expressed as 6 u tot j i 1 4 w i u i j where i is the index for the design merits in the order of steel weight resistance mean outflow and cargo capacity j is the index for the design variant u i j is the utility value of design merit i for the design variant j u tot j is the total utility for design variant j w i is the weighting factor for design merit i since the goal is to maximize the cargo capacity and at the same time minimize the other three the utility value for cargo capacity is made negative so that the problem is converted into a single objective one that is to minimize the total utility obviously the total utility is influenced by w i as well as u i j this means that decision in regard to choosing the optimal designs depends on the specific settings of the intended service profile of the ship which may include e g the sailing area design life span etc and these preference factors are reflected by the weighting factors by using this technique in figs 9 16 the five most favorable designs are highlighted in terms of utility level which reflects the overall performance considering all the four merits with serval different settings of predefined weighing factors 4 2 model verification in order to verify the model and the methods used first some extreme settings figs 9 12 with all weights put on a single design merit are examined for example in fig 9 when all that matters is the steel weight the highest ranked designs are as expected the ones with the smallest steel weight as shown in sub plot 1 whereas sub plots 2 and 3shows these optimal designs perform not as well for resistance and cargo capacity similar observations can be made on figs 10 12 then in fig 13 another special case where equal weights i e no preference were given to the four design merits is shown the five most favorable designs given by ranking the utility levels of all the designs are in general concentrated in the smaller size segments this is reasonable because all of the four merits but the cargo capacity favor a smaller ship in general as mentioned above fig 14 gives a setting where the values of the weighting factors are back calculated from the case of best achievable rank of the reference design it can be seen that more weights are given to all but oil outflow risk it is reasonable that the weighing factor for the oil outflow in this case is not zero this is because some considerations must have been imposed implicitly by following the design rules e g the 2 5 m double skin side the figure also shows that no matter how the weighting factors vary the reference ship is not able to become top ranked indicating potential for improvement 4 3 sensitivity analysis in environmentally sensitive areas more preferences should be given to the designs with relatively low oil outflow level with some sacrifice of economic aspects in order to avoid or mitigate the devastating consequences from oil spill in contrast to the scenario in fig 13 when more weights are given to e g oil outflow and cargo capacity as shown in figs 15 and 16 for instance some larger vessels can become competitive too table 4 gives the top five designs in terms of overall utility level for different predefined sets of weighting factors settings 1 3 5 7 9 and 11 correspond to the examples given in figs 9 12 and 15 and 16 in addition to settings 1 3 5 7 9 their respective pair s with some variation in the weighting factors are given in settings 2 4 6 8 and 10 12 the different top ranked designs identified thus shows the sensitivity of the results to the predefined weighting factors it can be seen that in all of the setting groups i e 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 when the weighting factors are slightly varied some recurring designs e g highlighted in bold text are identified this suggests the robustness of the method in capturing the most desirable designs in terms of overall performance when given various settings the design variables and the design merits for the repeatedly emerging designs for the last setting group are given in table 5 5 conclusion and future work a procedure for the preliminary design of oil tanker considering oil outflow risk from ship ship collisions was introduced the procedure is a synthesis of statistical and analytical models and common ship design software the application of the procedure was examined by conducting a case study with a representative suezmax tanker risk as measured by the expected oil outflow is considered together with other conventional ship design merits the utility levels for each of the design variants were compared for different weighing factors it was seen that different weighing factors can point to designs with different features the procedure can facilitate making decisions under various or changing scenarios for example in environmentally fragile sea areas more attention is naturally given to oil outflow risk at the same time without compromising profitability too much in this case similarly high weights can be assigned to these two merits like designs highlighted in table 5 to achieve a better overall performance it can also be seen from the study that although there does not exist a design in the explored design space which is superior to the reference ship in regard to all of the four merits when given a specific scenario an even better design can be pursued to that direction for instance designs in table 5 rank higher than the reference design in terms of overall utility level under the given preference since the present work is carried out with focus on the preliminary design where design space exploration is aimed for to see how risk plays a role in this the presented criteria and method have served this purpose well on the other hand further investigations where monetary values and criteria cats are more relevant should be conducted in a context of formal optimization study where a proper optimization engine should be employed by using algorithms like ann to drive design using the optimal designs identified in the current study as start point considering the amount of work required by that this paper just focuses on the design space exploration part future work needs to be carried out to evaluate the gains and losses among the various designs by e g converting the respective performance aspect into a monetary value and by considering the overall cost benefit of the vessel during her design life span in addition more design merits that are relevant can be introduced also a number of additional issues have to be studied for a fully probabilistic oil outflow to be arrived at namely encounter number geometric probability in the area that the ship under design is intended to sail and the causation probability for collision due to failure of evasive maneuver given encounter e g by using fault trees or bayesian networks in addition in the present study it is assumed that all oil is spilt if the inner tank wall is breached as does the imo oil outflow method this may be conservative as at the moment no information on the probabilistic distribution of percentage of outflow from a tank is available and such studies are desirable acknowledgements this research is funded by singapore maritime institute under the

22837,this study presents the development of an approximate analytical model for the investigation of the hydrodynamic interactions between a solitary wave and a partially submerged thin porous wall analytical solutions of the velocity potentials are derived according to the fourier integral and solution superposition procedure along with satisfying the formed boundary and matching conditions the free surface elevations are also formulated the hydrodynamic forces are computed by integrating the pressure distributions along the structural surfaces laboratory experiments were carried out to measure the free surface elevations at locations upstream and downstream of the porous walls tested for the verification of the derived analytical solutions it is demonstrated through result comparisons that the present analytical model can provide nicely matched predictions on the time varying transmitted waves including wave peak but slightly overestimated reflected wave heights the horizontal hydrodynamic forces from the present analytical solutions are also in good agreement with other published experimental data when a special case of non porous wall is considered the variations of wave run up overall transmission coefficient and maximum horizontal force under different conditions are presented and discussed to evaluate the performance of a partially submerged thin porous wall subject to an encountering solitary wave keywords solitary waves partially submerged structures porous wall wave reflection and transmission hydrodynamic forces 1 introduction solitary waves are one of the most common forms which transmit energy from the ocean into shorelines or costal offshore structures and this process significantly influences the coastal and offshore protections and associated structural designs as the energy transmitted by those waves can potentially cause severe damage to the areas without proper wave attenuators studying the interactions between solitary waves and protective structures and the feasibility and effectiveness of the methods for reducing the impacts of the approaching waves have become important aspects of the coastal and offshore engineering after studying the design data and cost of the floating breakwater mccartney 1985 presented that floating breakwaters can be used to protect small boat harbors applying a partially submerged porous breakwater may become a practical way to effectively reduce the impact of the incoming waves in the past decades a significant amount of research has been conducted to study the wave structure interaction maccamy and fuchs 1954 presented one of the first analytical studies on wave diffraction on a cylinder for floating bodies mei and black 1969 developed a numerical model to determine the wave transformation and forces related to waves interacting with rectangular structures mccartney 1985 studied the performances of various types of floating breakwaters used in floating breakwater design later drimer et al 1992 williams et al 2000 and zheng et al 2004 developed analytical models for linear waves propagating through different types of floating bodies others such as murali and mani 1997 koutandos et al 2005 and dong et al 2008 conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the reflection and transmission characteristics and the performance of different types of partially submerged breakwaters similarly for a completely submerged structure ursell 1947 analyzed a fixed vertical barrier on surface waves whereas experimentally the measurements for a solid or a permeable submerged breakwater were conducted by dick and brebner 1968 later through analytical approaches abul azm 1993 xie et al 2011 liu and li 2012 and liu et al 2013 examined the performance of submerged breakwaters in reducing the transmitted wave energy beji and battjes 1993 and stephan et al 1994 also conducted laboratory experiments to measure the reflected and transmitted waves most of the aforementioned studies considered linear or sinusoidal waves and limited attention is set on nonlinear waves e g solitary waves and their interactions with structures for solitary waves goring 1978 investigated the propagation of a tsunami that can be considered as an extreme case of a solitary wave on solitary waves interacting with structures isaacson 1983 developed a combined fourier integral and linear diffraction approach to simplify the solution procedure of solving the nonlinear diffraction problems between a solitary wave and a vertical cylinder in order to improve the results on the nonlinear effects such as wave scattering wang et al 1992 proposed a generalized boussinesq gb model to study the behavior of a solitary wave encountering a vertical cylinder to improve the accuracy to fully nonlinear shallow water waves an established numerical model was developed by zhong and wang 2009 the analytical investigations of solitary waves interacting with either a partially submerged or a completely submerged structure have been very limit recently jaf and wang 2015 by combining isaacson s 1983 and zhong and wang s 2006 approaches obtained an analytical solution in terms of reflection and transmission related coefficients to describe the hydrodynamic interactions between a solitary wave and a completely submerged impermeable barrier researchers have also observed that the energy can be dissipated when a water wave passes through a porous structure chwang 1983 proposed a simplified porous wall boundary condition to examine theoretically the effect of a porous structure on generated waves other studies using the similar porous wall condition but limited to sinusoidal waves include the investigations of wave trapping phenomenon chwang and dong 1985 wave interactions with a flexible porous wall wang and ren 1993 wave scattering caused by a submerged porous disk chwang and wu 1994 and impact of a structure system composed of a vertical end wall and a submerged horizontal porous plate on wave reflection wu et al 1998 later hu and wang 2005 proposed a breakwater system composed of a submerged horizontal plate and a vertical porous wall and investigated analytically its performance on attenuating the propagation of sinusoidal waves especially the long waves wave interactions with a vertically slotted breakwater was studied by isaacson et al 1998 considering a nonlinear wave vidal et al 1988 presented experimental data of solitary waves transmitted through a porous breakwater liu and wen 1997 simulated solitary waves propagating through a finite thickness porous breakwater with a numerical model using the runge kutta integration method lynett et al 2000 also developed numerical solvers to model solitary waves

cylinder system by following isaacson s 1983 fourier integral approach lin and karunarathna 2007 used numerical methods to study the wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation of a solitary wave interacting with porous breakwaters recently wu et al 2014 and higuera et al 2014 developed 3 d numerical models to simulate the interaction between a solitary wave and porous structures jensen et al 2014 investigated on the porous media equations and the flow in porous media and alcérreca huerta and oumeraci 2016 studied the wave induced pressures in porous revetment by applying cfd csd model system due to the advances on cfd numerical modeling most of the research proposed numerical methods to solve the complex behavior of a solitary wave propagating through a porous media however most of the methods to be utilized require inevitable understanding on numerical modeling and it is hard to be verified without analytical solutions or experimental data as indicated above the analytical solutions and experimental data necessary to validate those models on studying the interaction between solitary waves and partially submerged porous structures are also rarely available in the present study we provide an analytical investigation of the hydrodynamic performance of a partially submerged porous barrier subject to an encountering of an incident solitary wave based on the fourier integral and solution superposition procedure the velocity potentials in the reflected and transmitted regions that satisfy the boundary conditions and the interfacial matching conditions are derived accordingly the time variations of reflected and transmitted wave profiles as well as the hydrodynamic forces acting on the porous wall are determined a series of experimental measurements with recorded wave profiles in front of and behind the porous barriers were also carried out to verify the derived analytical solutions 2 theoretical formulations in this study the velocity potentials of the interested fluid fields for a solitary wave interacting with a partially submerged porous wall barrier is derived analytically based on the fourier integral method proposed by isaacson 1983 and zhong and wang 2006 the porous effect included in the wall boundary conditions follows chwang s 1983 formulation that was based on the darcy s law also the least squares minimization procedure sneddon 1966 dalrymple and martin 1990 jaf and wang 2015 is applied for the mixed matching conditions defined at the interface to determine the unknown coefficients a schematic diagram showing the problem statement is given in fig 1 due to the existence of a porous wall the fluid domain is separated into two regions as illustrated in fig 1 the region 1 x 0 h z η is defined as the fluid domain on the left side of the porous wall while the region 2 x 0 h z η stands for the fluid domain on the right side of the porous wall the notations with superscript represent the dimensional physical variables a two dimensional 2 d cartesian coordinate system x z is applied for this study as usual the x axis denotes the horizontal axis along the wave propagation direction where x 0 is at the location of a partially submerged porous wall and the z axis points vertically upwards with the undisturbed water surface set at z 0 η and h represent respectively the wave elevation and constant water depth the draft or submerged depth of a partially submerged porous wall is set as d the partially submerged porous wall is assumed to be rigid and thin so that the effect of thickness of the wall is neglected the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and the motion irrotational in order to derive the analytical solution for a solitary wave interacting with a partially submerged porous wall the free surface elevation η i x t of an incident right going propagating along the positive x direction solitary wave according to the solitary wave theory can be expressed as 1 η i h s e c h 2 3 h 4 h 3 x c t where h stands for the wave height and c and t represent respectively the wave celerity and time in eqn 1 the variable with subscript i represents the variables of an incident wave and c g h where g is the gravitational acceleration we define α h h as the dimensionless wave height based on the fourier integral method presented by isaacson 1983 and later extended by zhong and wang 2006 the velocity potential of an incident solitary wave can be expressed as 2 ϕ i h 2 π h g a k i k e i k x c t d k and the corresponding equation for the free surface elevation becomes 3 η i h 2 π a k e i k x c t d k where k represents the component of wave number like parameter for the mathematical convenience eqns 2 and 3 have the complex expressions where the real part of the equations represent the true physical variables from eqns 1 and 3 the coefficient of the fourier integral a k can be derived as 4 a k 4 π h 3 k 3 h c s c h π k h 3 3 h as the fluid domain is separated by a porous wall ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are introduced to represent the velocity potentials in region 1 x 0 h z η and region 2 x 0 h z η respectively for a solitary wave the velocity potential ϕ j j 1 2 in a dimensionless form satisfies the laplace equation 5 2 ϕ j x 2 2 ϕ j z 2 0 j 1 2 where ϕ j ϕ j c 0 h x x h z z h and c 0 g h all physical variables without superscript are nondimensionalized by using h as length scale c0 as velocity scale and h g as time scale a variable with subscript j denotes that variable in region j for a weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive boussinesq class wave wang et al 1992 introduced an expression of the original velocity potential up to the order of α in term of the depth averaged velocity potential shown as 6 ϕ j x z t ϕ j x t α 1 3 z z 2 2 2 ϕ j j 1 2 where ϕ j x t j 1 2 denote the depth averaged velocity potential either in region 1 or region 2 other variables can be transferred into dimensionless forms as k k h η η h c c c 0 and t t h g following the approaches proposed by zhong and wang 2006 and jaf and wang 2015 the depth averaged velocity potential of region 1 including both incident and reflected waves can be approximated as 7 ϕ 1 i q e i k x r 0 e i k x e i k c t d k whereas the depth averaged velocity potential of region 2 can be expressed as 8 ϕ 2 i q t 0 e i k x e i k c t d k where r 0 and t 0 are the reflection and transmission related unknown coefficients respectively and 9 q 2 3 c s c h π k 1 3 h substituting eqn 7 into eqn 6 leads the original velocity potential for region 1 as 10 ϕ 1 i q e i k x r 0 e i k x α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 i q e i k x r 0 e i k x e i k c t d k similarly the velocity potential for region 2 can be formulated from eqns 6 and 8 as 11 ϕ 2 i q t 0 e i k x α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 i q t 0 e i k x e i k c t d k in eqns 10 and 11 r 0 and t 0 are dimensionless unknown coefficients required to be determined from the matching conditions in this integral method the r 0 and t 0 for each wave number k are determined to describe their corresponding contributions to the wave reflection and transmission with the integration the overall reflection and transmission coefficients can be estimated velocity potentials of region 1 and region 2 as shown in eqns 10 and 11 satisfy the far field conditions in order to describe the role played by a porous wall at the interface of region 1 and region 2 darcy s law is applied so that the velocity of fluids flows through the porous plate is linearly proportional to the induced pressure difference across the thin structure chwang 1983 which gives 12 ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x b 0 μ p 1 p 2 where μ is the dynamic viscosity b 0 with a dimension of length is a specific material constant for the porous wall and p 1 and p 2 are the pressures acting on the left and right faces of the porous wall respectively with the use of the approximated dynamic free surface boundary condition applied to each term of the integrations in eqns 10 and 11 the velocities of the fluid at the interface between region 1 and region 2 can be derived as 13 ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x b 0 ρ μ ϕ 1 t ϕ 2 t let b 0 b 0 h the dimensionless form of eqn 13 can be expressed as 14 ϕ 1 x x 0 ϕ 2 x x 0 i k c r e b 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 where r e ρ h g h μ is a parameter of reynolds number describing the flow condition passing through the porous wall in order to solve r 0 and t 0 the matching boundary conditions at the interface x 0 are applied they are 15 ϕ 1 x x 0 ϕ 2 x x 0 1 z 0 16 ϕ 1 x 0 ϕ 2 x 0 1 z d 17 ϕ 1 x x 0 ϕ 2 x x 0 i k c r e b 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 d z 0 here d d h represents the dimensionless submerged depth of a porous wall equation 15 reflects the continuity of the fluid velocity at the interface while eqn 16 describes the continuity of the velocity potential for the opening part of the interface the porous effect is added into the mixed matching conditions with the application of eqn 17 where the normal velocity passing through the porous plate is found to be associated with the difference between the velocity potentials in region 1 and region 2 by substituting eqns 10 and 11 into eqn 15 we can get the relationship between r 0 and t 0 as 18 t 0 1 r 0 also substituting eqns 10 and 11 into eqn 16 we have 19 2 r 0 α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 2 r 0 0 1 z d furthermore from eqn 17 we can rewrite 20 1 r 0 2 g r 0 α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 1 r 0 2 g r 0 0 d z 0 where g r e b 0 c is a dimensionless porous effect parameter equations 19 and 20 form a system of mixed matching conditions a function related to eqns 19 and 20 is defined as 21 h 0 1 1 2 g r 0 α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 1 1 2 g r 0 d z 0 2 r 0 α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 2 r 0 1 z d the least

and 11 in both region 1 and region 2 can be calculated as an approximation for each term of the integration solutions the linearized dynamic free surface boundary condition is applied separately in region1 and region 2 to obtain the free surface elevations in region 1 we have the dimensionless wave elevation as 29 η 1 q k c e i k x r 0 e i k x e i k c t d k similarly the free surface elevation of the transmitted wave in region 2 can be derived as 30 η 2 q k c t 0 e i k x e i k c t d k the real parts of eqns 29 and 30 can be calculated to represent the physical values of the free surface elevations in region 1 and region 2 respectively to determine the maximum hydrodynamic forces on the partially submerged porous wall the pressure distribution along the wall needs to be computed according to the bernoulli equation the dimensionless form of the dynamic pressure can be expressed as 31 p ϕ t 1 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ z 2 where p p ρ g h due to the assumption of a thin wall zero thickness only the horizontal hydrodynamic forces are presented in this study through the approximated procedure and including the effect of the free surface elevation the horizontal hydrodynamic force can be computed by integrating the pressures acting on the front and back faces of the porous wall as 32 f x d 0 p 1 d z 1 2 η 1 η 1 d 0 p 2 d z 1 2 η 2 η 2 where the dimensionless hydrodynamic force per unit width fx is defined as f x ρ g h 2 it should be noted that the maximum force happens at the time when the maximum wave run up reaching the front face of the porous wall 3 experimental study in order to verify the derived analytical solutions as described above laboratory experiments were conducted to measure the free surface elevations of the incident reflected and transmitted waves for a solitary wave interacting with a fixed thin porous wall the experiments were carried out in a 762 cm 25 ft long 30 48 cm 1 ft wide and 91 44 cm 3 ft high glass walled section of a 12 5 m 41 ft long wave tank in the hydraulic lab of the university of houston a side view schematic of the channel is shown in fig 2 by controlling the motions of a tolomatic linear actuator a solitary wave of a given wave height can be generated from a piston type wavemaker at one end of the tank at the other end of the tank energy dissipaters were used to avoid the reflections of the waves after encountering the end wall two resistance type wave gauges were installed along the wavetank to measure the free surface elevations of the incident reflected and transmitted waves gauge 1 was placed at a distance 76 2 cm upstream of the partially submerged porous wall to measure the incident and reflected waves meanwhile gauge 2 was set at a distance 63 5 cm downstream of the porous wall to capture the transmitted waves before recording the wave elevations calibration of wave gauges was performed to ensure the accuracy of the measurements all the wave elevations were recorded by the labview data acquisition system the water depth set for the experiments was 7 62 cm in this study two submerged depth of porous wall i e d 3 81 cm and d 7 62 cm or d 0 5 and d 1 were selected for model tests regarding the incident wave conditions different solitary waves with varying dimensionless wave heights α from 0 09 to 0 33 were generated to test the effect of the wave height on the reflected and transmitted waves for the porous wall a thin porous plate with different porous conditions was placed in a partially submerged position for the wavetank tests each porous plate was made of 11 gauge galvanized steel and the pore pattern was the standard round 60 staggered pattern the calibrated values of b 0 or b 0 b 0 h for the tested porous plates of different porosities and pore sizes given by chu 2014 are shown in table 1 after knowing the water depth the corresponding constant value of r e for describing the flow condition passing through the porous wall can be calculated by adding the effect of b 0 the value of r e b 0 as an inputted parameter of the experimental setup can be obtained the r e b 0 values are also summarized in table 1 4 results and discussion to verify the derived analytical solutions for the interactions of a solitary wave with a partially submerged porous wall the free surface elevations obtained by applying eqns 29 and 30 are compared with the experimental measurements that were recorded by gauge 1 incident wave and reflected waves and gauge 2 transmitted waves in each experiment in this validation study cases with various values of the incident wave height α the submerged depth of porous wall d and the material constant of the porous wall b 0 are included in the comparison plots all the results and plots presented in this study are nondimensionalized by using h as length scale c0 as velocity scale and h g as time scale for example the free surface elevation η equals to η h for the case with 7 62 cm water depth or h 1 d 0 5 submerged depth 50 of the water depth and b 0 10 5 case 1 fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 present the comparisons between the analytically obtained and experimentally recorded wave elevations considering the dimensionless incident wave heights α of 0 09 0 21 and 0 33 respectively the subplots of figs 3 a 4 a and 5 a illustrate the comparisons of incident and reflected waves from both the analytical and experimental results while figs 3 b 5 b reveal the comparisons of transmitted waves all the cases in this study use the same r e value of 65882 as can be seen from figs 3 5 the incident and transmitted waves predicted by the present analytical solutions in magnitudes and phases match well with the experimental data and for the reflected waves in general the variation trend including the phase from the analytical solutions agree reasonably well with the measurements however with slightly over predicted wave peaks as expected since the analytical solutions neglect the energy dissipations due to fluid viscosity and the friction effect caused by the porous wall the reflected waves computed due to their run up run down and backward propagation are shown to have greater wave amplitudes than those from the experimental measurements also by examining the results shown in fig 3 through fig 5 the errors of predicted amplitudes of reflected waves increase as the incident wave height increases due to partly the increased friction effect and partly the enhanced nonlinear effect also noticeable for incident waves with higher amplitude the present solutions misses the predictions of the small oscillatory tails observed in the recorded reflected waves in terms of validations of the results for cases considering a different submerged depth of porous wall fig 6 presents the comparisons of measurements from gauge1 and gauge 2 with analytical solutions for the case case 2 of a α 0 09 solitary wave interacting with a porous wall which is completely submerged d 1 with a material constant of b 0 being equal to 10 5 again the transmitted wave profile obtained from the present analytical model agrees well with the experimental data when comparing to the results presented in fig 3 d 0 5 and α 0 09 a greater reflected wave height for the case of d 1 fig 6 is noticed which reflects that an increase in the submerged depth of the wall results in an increase in the reflected wave height considering the effect of porous wall property fig 7 illustrates the wave profile comparisons for the case case 3 with α 0 33 d 0 5 and b 0 1 6 10 5 the present model predictions in terms of incident and transmitted wave elevations again fit well with the measurements the reflected wave height is however over estimated comparing the results shown in figs 5 and 7 it suggests that the case with b 0 1 6 10 5 is shown to have a greater transmitted wave height than that for the case with b 0 10 5 by examining the comparisons shown in fig 3 through fig 7 the analytical solutions are demonstrated to be able to predict the transmitted wave elevations well and tend to overestimate the reflected wave height for the study of interactions between a solitary wave and a partially submerged porous wall the error by comparing the analytically predicted transmitted wave height with those measured in the wavetank is about 5 for the reflected wave height the error is roughly 30 before carrying out the evaluations of the various affecting variables on the wave transformation and induced forces as a solitary wave propagating past a partially submerged porous wall the variation behaviors of the transmission related coefficients t 0 versus submerged depth are discussed according to eqns 18 and 27 the derived t 0 are functions of the following dimensionless parameters submerged depth draft of the porous wall d incident wave height α material constant of the porous wall b 0 and wave number parameter k here every specific value of k has its associated t 0 values even though the physical variables for describing the interactions between a solitary wave and a partially submerged porous wall require the integration of the derived solutions through wave number k from k to k the variations of t 0 versus the submerged depth d would be interesting to examine for their effects on the eventual transmission coefficient also through the study of the variations of t 0 versus d with and without porous effect we can estimate the influences of the porous properties on the transmission of an incident solitary wave after interacting with a partially submerged porous wall for a case of a solitary wave with α 0 21 interacting with a solid wall it can be considered as a special case of the present solutions by setting the material constant of the porous wall b 0 to be equal to 0 fig 8 a illustrates the variations of t 0 versus d for different k values when b 0 0 the results indicate that when the wave number k increases the transmission related coefficient t 0 decreases physically it suggests that for a given submerged wall depth the effect of t 0 on wave transmission decreases when the value of k increases meanwhile for a fixed wave number k as expected when the submerged depth of the solid wall increases the coefficient t 0 decreases for a solid wall case the initial increase of the submerged depth of the wall tends to have more significant effect on decreasing the coefficient t 0 when the wave number is large however when k becomes smaller it is opposite the change at the cases with larger d value has a stronger effect on decreasing the contributions from those transmitted wave components for a porous wall case with b 0 10 5 the varying trends of t 0 versus d for α 0 21 and different k values are presented in fig 8 b since a porous structure is considered the minimum t 0 for all k values different from a solid wall case reaches a constant of 0 57 when d 1 certainly the minimum t 0 depends on the material constant of the porous wall b 0 similar to the solid wall cases for a fixed k value an increase in submerged depth d the transmission related coefficient t 0 decreases and for a constant d when the wave number k increases the value of t 0 decreases however with any given k value the porous effect makes the changes of t 0 to be more significant in the ranges of smaller d than those when d becomes larger it should be noted for a given k there is a corresponding transmission related coefficient t 0 and for the determination of the overall transmission coefficient which is the ratio of the transmitted wave height to the incident wave height the integration of wave elevation solutions versus k from k to k is required in order to investigate the effect of the r e b 0 on the dimensionless wave run ups dimensional wave run up water depth for various submerged conditions fig 9 shows the plots of wave run ups versus r e b 0 with various submerged depths and a giving incident wave height of 0 2 it can be clearly noticed that when the submerged depth of wall is small the effect of r e b 0 on wave run up is insignificant and as the submerged depth becomes larger the effect of r e b 0 on wave run up becomes more apparent also as the porous wall parameter r e b 0 increases the wave run up decreases to further the analyses of the influences of the submerged depth and r e b 0 on the overall transmission coefficient fig 10 illustrates the variations of the overall transmission coefficient c t versus r e b 0 for various submerged depths and a fixed incident wave height of 0 2 it is found that when the submerged depth is large e g d 1 or d 0 8 the overall transmission coefficient is shown to have a nonlinear increasing trend as r e b 0 increases however when the submerged depth becomes smaller e g d 0 2 or d 0 4 the effect of r e b 0 on the overall transmission coefficient although is not significant reflects that c t has a decreasing initially then increasing trend as r e b 0 increases from fig 10 it can be seen that the role played by the submerged depth of wall on the overall transmission coefficient becomes important when the value of porous wall parameter r e b 0 is small when r e b 0 approaches to 6 the effect of submerged depth on c t is negligible also an interesting phenomenon that the minimum c t occurs at an identified r e b 0 porous condition for cases with smaller submerged depths e g d 0 2 d 0 4 or d 0 6 is observed in fig 10 similar phenomenon was also noticed for cases considering sinusoidal waves interacting with partially submerged porous structures isaacson et al 1998 li et al 2015 considering the effect of energy dissipation caused by the porous structures the variations of c t in fig 10 is potentially a reflection of the variations of the total wave energy as an approximation the total energy c r 2 c t 2 of the reflected and transmitted waves is plotted versus r e b 0 for cases of various submerged depths and a fixed incident wave height of 0 2 in fig 11 here c r is the overall reflection coefficient as the ratio of reflected wave height versus incident wave height it can be seen the variation trends in fig 10 are similar to those in fig 11 therefore for cases with small submerged depth of porous wall the occurrence of maximum energy loss or minimum total energy at an identified r e b 0 value affects more on the transmitted waves and consequently results in the minimum overall transmission coefficient as the results presented in fig 10 hydrodynamic force is also an important and critical physical variable to be determined for the structural design consideration based on eqn 32 the horizontal hydrodynamic forces acting on the wall can be calculated fig 12 shows the comparisons between the estimated maximum horizontal forces on a partially submerged solid wall by applying eqn 32 with b 0 0 and the experimental data from liu and al banaa s 2004 study where 8 cases with different submerged depths and incident waves heights were tested the points along the 45 line indicates the perfect fit it can be seen in general the present analytical results agree reasonable well with the measurements since the approximated procedure is applied to the derivation of the present analytical solutions the comparisons also reflect that the stronger agreement occurs at cases with smaller wave height waves in addition to the performance on wave profile predictions the present analytical model again demonstrates to be able to provide reasonable estimations on wave forces on a partially submerged porous wall in terms of the effect of the submerged depth of the wall on the maximum horizontal force the results showing the maximum horizontal force versus the submerged depth for various incident wave heights under a solid wall condition are presented in fig 13 a and the results for a porous wall case with b 0 10 5 are plotted in fig 13 b more enhanced nonlinear trends showing the increase of maximum horizontal forces as the submerged depth of a solid wall increases can be noticed also for a solid wall case the maximum horizontal force is much larger than that under a porous wall condition especially when the submerged depth becomes larger the combined effects of submerged depth and porous wall parameter r e b 0 on the maximum horizontal force are shown in fig 14 where the incident wave height is set to be 0 2 it is found that when the submerged depth is less than or equal to 0 5 e g d 0 25 or d 0 5 the effect of r e b 0 on the maximum horizontal force is insignificant as the submerged depth become larger the effect of r e b 0 on the maximum horizontal force becomes more important especially for a completely submerged wall where the maximum horizontal force decreases as r e b 0 increases as described above for the solution accuracy consideration relatively the average error for overestimation of the reflected waves are much larger than those of the transmitted waves this suggests that part of the error sources in terms of energy dissipation seems to be overtaken by the reflected waves additionally from the experimental measurements a transmitted wave tends to maintain as a single hump of solitary wave profile however the reflected waves are formed with a main reflected wave and a sequence of oscillatory tails followed those small wave oscillations which are not captured by the analytical solutions are also considered to potentially make lower wave height of the main reflected waves for the reasons described it would be interesting in a future study to develop new formulations for energy dissipations that can be applied correctly to the reflected and transmitted waves and to include the oscillating tail associated nonlinear and dispersive effects into the derivations for improving the predictions of the analytical solutions the analytical solutions with its capability of describing the physical phenomena in domains of generally all sizes could enhance both numerical and experimental studies however their validations require the comparisons with the experimental measurements the scale effect which controls different levels of errors and in some cases limits the data collected always plays an important role in experimental study for wave related measurements the dimensions of a wavetank and wavemaker setting lead the limits on the measurable variables and physical conditions tested in the tank such as water depth incident waves and the size and position of the structures when generating a solitary wave which is a boussinesq type nonlinear shallow water wave it is required to have the setting that balances both the nonlinear and dispersive effects this further limits the cases tested in the wavetank in this study due to the relatively small scale of the laboratory wavetank the setting of water depth for producing solitary waves is comparatively shallow e g 7 62 cm this water depth further limits our experimental cases to two different breakwater submergences d 0 5 and 1 and two walls of different porosities however reasonable data under various wave and testing conditions were successfully collected for validation of the derived analytical solutions to improve the error control and variables tested in the experiments it is recommended to extend the laboratory measurements in a larger wavetank with new data collected from more set cases to further the verification of the analytical solutions and physical interpretation of the results 5 conclusions in this study the hydrodynamic interactions between a solitary wave and a partially submerged thin porous wall are studied with proposed analytical procedures and laboratory verifications according to the defined fluid domains analytical solutions of the velocity potentials wave elevations and hydrodynamic forces in terms of reflection and transmission related coefficients are derived by applying the fourier integral method and solution superposition procedure proposed by isaacson 1983 and zhong and wang 2006 the porous wall boundary conditions based on chwang s 1983 porous flow equations are formulated the least squares method is applied to the mixed matching conditions at the interface of porous wall to obtain the reflection and transmission related coefficients additionally the experimental measurements were carried out to verify the derived analytical solutions of the free surface elevations as shown in the presented results the incident and transmitted waves predicted by the present analytical model in magnitudes and phases match well with the experimental data and for the reflected waves in general the analytical solutions tends to overestimate the reflected wave height as the submerged depth increases stronger nonlinear decreasing trends of the wave run up as r e b 0 increases can be noticed when the submerged porous wall depth is smaller e g d 0 2 or d 0 4 the effect of r e b 0 on the variations of the wave run up is negligible in contrast as r e b 0 increases the overall transmission coefficient increases for a completely submerged porous wall and the increasing trend of the overall transmission coefficient versus r e b 0 is nonlinear for a porous wall with d being equal to or less than 0 6 the overall transmission coefficient has a decreasing initially then increasing trend as r e b 0 increases also the minimum c t occurs at an identified r e b 0 value in terms of the maximum horizontal hydrodynamic forces on a partially submerged solid wall b 0 0 the present analytical results match reasonably well with the experimental measurements from liu and al banaa 2004 with an increase in either the incident wave height or the submerged depth of porous wall the horizontal hydrodynamic forces increase it becomes apparent that the porous wall can reduce the hydrodynamic forces significantly when the submerged depth become larger the present analytical model is demonstrated to be able to provide reasonable estimations on wave transformation and induced hydrodynamic forces for cases considering a solitary wave interacting with a partially submerged porous wall however since the method utilizes linearized velocity potentials it is limited to be more practical for waves with relatively smaller wave heights for a deeper analytical consideration it is generally more challenging typically for highly nonlinear waves to drive the exact solutions for waves passing through porous structures especially to include the detailed energy dissipations or even the flow resistance effect it may require the use of combined perturbation method and comprehensive porous flow conditions to derive higher order solutions in this study the energy dissipation effect which is partly introduced in the porous wall boundary conditions using the darcy s law is indirectly included in the solutions for future study the nonlinear effect and more detailed energy dissipation of a solitary wave when passing through a porous wall especially the portions contributed to the reflected and transmitted waves can be interesting add ons for the analytical solutions to improve the accuracy on estimating the wave reflection

22837,this study presents the development of an approximate analytical model for the investigation of the hydrodynamic interactions between a solitary wave and a partially submerged thin porous wall analytical solutions of the velocity potentials are derived according to the fourier integral and solution superposition procedure along with satisfying the formed boundary and matching conditions the free surface elevations are also formulated the hydrodynamic forces are computed by integrating the pressure distributions along the structural surfaces laboratory experiments were carried out to measure the free surface elevations at locations upstream and downstream of the porous walls tested for the verification of the derived analytical solutions it is demonstrated through result comparisons that the present analytical model can provide nicely matched predictions on the time varying transmitted waves including wave peak but slightly overestimated reflected wave heights the horizontal hydrodynamic forces from the present analytical solutions are also in good agreement with other published experimental data when a special case of non porous wall is considered the variations of wave run up overall transmission coefficient and maximum horizontal force under different conditions are presented and discussed to evaluate the performance of a partially submerged thin porous wall subject to an encountering solitary wave keywords solitary waves partially submerged structures porous wall wave reflection and transmission hydrodynamic forces 1 introduction solitary waves are one of the most common forms which transmit energy from the ocean into shorelines or costal offshore structures and this process significantly influences the coastal and offshore protections and associated structural designs as the energy transmitted by those waves can potentially cause severe damage to the areas without proper wave attenuators studying the interactions between solitary waves and protective structures and the feasibility and effectiveness of the methods for reducing the impacts of the approaching waves have become important aspects of the coastal and offshore engineering after studying the design data and cost of the floating breakwater mccartney 1985 presented that floating breakwaters can be used to protect small boat harbors applying a partially submerged porous breakwater may become a practical way to effectively reduce the impact of the incoming waves in the past decades a significant amount of research has been conducted to study the wave structure interaction maccamy and fuchs 1954 presented one of the first analytical studies on wave diffraction on a cylinder for floating bodies mei and black 1969 developed a numerical model to determine the wave transformation and forces related to waves interacting with rectangular structures mccartney 1985 studied the performances of various types of floating breakwaters used in floating breakwater design later drimer et al 1992 williams et al 2000 and zheng et al 2004 developed analytical models for linear waves propagating through different types of floating bodies others such as murali and mani 1997 koutandos et al 2005 and dong et al 2008 conducted laboratory experiments to investigate the reflection and transmission characteristics and the performance of different types of partially submerged breakwaters similarly for a completely submerged structure ursell 1947 analyzed a fixed vertical barrier on surface waves whereas experimentally the measurements for a solid or a permeable submerged breakwater were conducted by dick and brebner 1968 later through analytical approaches abul azm 1993 xie et al 2011 liu and li 2012 and liu et al 2013 examined the performance of submerged breakwaters in reducing the transmitted wave energy beji and battjes 1993 and stephan et al 1994 also conducted laboratory experiments to measure the reflected and transmitted waves most of the aforementioned studies considered linear or sinusoidal waves and limited attention is set on nonlinear waves e g solitary waves and their interactions with structures for solitary waves goring 1978 investigated the propagation of a tsunami that can be considered as an extreme case of a solitary wave on solitary waves interacting with structures isaacson 1983 developed a combined fourier integral and linear diffraction approach to simplify the solution procedure of solving the nonlinear diffraction problems between a solitary wave and a vertical cylinder in order to improve the results on the nonlinear effects such as wave scattering wang et al 1992 proposed a generalized boussinesq gb model to study the behavior of a solitary wave encountering a vertical cylinder to improve the accuracy to fully nonlinear shallow water waves an established numerical model was developed by zhong and wang 2009 the analytical investigations of solitary waves interacting with either a partially submerged or a completely submerged structure have been very limit recently jaf and wang 2015 by combining isaacson s 1983 and zhong and wang s 2006 approaches obtained an analytical solution in terms of reflection and transmission related coefficients to describe the hydrodynamic interactions between a solitary wave and a completely submerged impermeable barrier researchers have also observed that the energy can be dissipated when a water wave passes through a porous structure chwang 1983 proposed a simplified porous wall boundary condition to examine theoretically the effect of a porous structure on generated waves other studies using the similar porous wall condition but limited to sinusoidal waves include the investigations of wave trapping phenomenon chwang and dong 1985 wave interactions with a flexible porous wall wang and ren 1993 wave scattering caused by a submerged porous disk chwang and wu 1994 and impact of a structure system composed of a vertical end wall and a submerged horizontal porous plate on wave reflection wu et al 1998 later hu and wang 2005 proposed a breakwater system composed of a submerged horizontal plate and a vertical porous wall and investigated analytically its performance on attenuating the propagation of sinusoidal waves especially the long waves wave interactions with a vertically slotted breakwater was studied by isaacson et al 1998 considering a nonlinear wave vidal et al 1988 presented experimental data of solitary waves transmitted through a porous breakwater liu and wen 1997 simulated solitary waves propagating through a finite thickness porous breakwater with a numerical model using the runge kutta integration method lynett et al 2000 also developed numerical solvers to model solitary waves propagating through a porous breakwater extended to three dimensional porous structures zhong and wang 2006 investigated analytically the interactions between solitary waves and a concentric porous cylinder system by following isaacson s 1983 fourier integral approach lin and karunarathna 2007 used numerical methods to study the wave reflection transmission and energy dissipation of a solitary wave interacting with porous breakwaters recently wu et al 2014 and higuera et al 2014 developed 3 d numerical models to simulate the interaction between a solitary wave and porous structures jensen et al 2014 investigated on the porous media equations and the flow in porous media and alcérreca huerta and oumeraci 2016 studied the wave induced pressures in porous revetment by applying cfd csd model system due to the advances on cfd numerical modeling most of the research proposed numerical methods to solve the complex behavior of a solitary wave propagating through a porous media however most of the methods to be utilized require inevitable understanding on numerical modeling and it is hard to be verified without analytical solutions or experimental data as indicated above the analytical solutions and experimental data necessary to validate those models on studying the interaction between solitary waves and partially submerged porous structures are also rarely available in the present study we provide an analytical investigation of the hydrodynamic performance of a partially submerged porous barrier subject to an encountering of an incident solitary wave based on the fourier integral and solution superposition procedure the velocity potentials in the reflected and transmitted regions that satisfy the boundary conditions and the interfacial matching conditions are derived accordingly the time variations of reflected and transmitted wave profiles as well as the hydrodynamic forces acting on the porous wall are determined a series of experimental measurements with recorded wave profiles in front of and behind the porous barriers were also carried out to verify the derived analytical solutions 2 theoretical formulations in this study the velocity potentials of the interested fluid fields for a solitary wave interacting with a partially submerged porous wall barrier is derived analytically based on the fourier integral method proposed by isaacson 1983 and zhong and wang 2006 the porous effect included in the wall boundary conditions follows chwang s 1983 formulation that was based on the darcy s law also the least squares minimization procedure sneddon 1966 dalrymple and martin 1990 jaf and wang 2015 is applied for the mixed matching conditions defined at the interface to determine the unknown coefficients a schematic diagram showing the problem statement is given in fig 1 due to the existence of a porous wall the fluid domain is separated into two regions as illustrated in fig 1 the region 1 x 0 h z η is defined as the fluid domain on the left side of the porous wall while the region 2 x 0 h z η stands for the fluid domain on the right side of the porous wall the notations with superscript represent the dimensional physical variables a two dimensional 2 d cartesian coordinate system x z is applied for this study as usual the x axis denotes the horizontal axis along the wave propagation direction where x 0 is at the location of a partially submerged porous wall and the z axis points vertically upwards with the undisturbed water surface set at z 0 η and h represent respectively the wave elevation and constant water depth the draft or submerged depth of a partially submerged porous wall is set as d the partially submerged porous wall is assumed to be rigid and thin so that the effect of thickness of the wall is neglected the fluid is assumed to be inviscid and incompressible and the motion irrotational in order to derive the analytical solution for a solitary wave interacting with a partially submerged porous wall the free surface elevation η i x t of an incident right going propagating along the positive x direction solitary wave according to the solitary wave theory can be expressed as 1 η i h s e c h 2 3 h 4 h 3 x c t where h stands for the wave height and c and t represent respectively the wave celerity and time in eqn 1 the variable with subscript i represents the variables of an incident wave and c g h where g is the gravitational acceleration we define α h h as the dimensionless wave height based on the fourier integral method presented by isaacson 1983 and later extended by zhong and wang 2006 the velocity potential of an incident solitary wave can be expressed as 2 ϕ i h 2 π h g a k i k e i k x c t d k and the corresponding equation for the free surface elevation becomes 3 η i h 2 π a k e i k x c t d k where k represents the component of wave number like parameter for the mathematical convenience eqns 2 and 3 have the complex expressions where the real part of the equations represent the true physical variables from eqns 1 and 3 the coefficient of the fourier integral a k can be derived as 4 a k 4 π h 3 k 3 h c s c h π k h 3 3 h as the fluid domain is separated by a porous wall ϕ 1 and ϕ 2 are introduced to represent the velocity potentials in region 1 x 0 h z η and region 2 x 0 h z η respectively for a solitary wave the velocity potential ϕ j j 1 2 in a dimensionless form satisfies the laplace equation 5 2 ϕ j x 2 2 ϕ j z 2 0 j 1 2 where ϕ j ϕ j c 0 h x x h z z h and c 0 g h all physical variables without superscript are nondimensionalized by using h as length scale c0 as velocity scale and h g as time scale a variable with subscript j denotes that variable in region j for a weakly nonlinear and weakly dispersive boussinesq class wave wang et al 1992 introduced an expression of the original velocity potential up to the order of α in term of the depth averaged velocity potential shown as 6 ϕ j x z t ϕ j x t α 1 3 z z 2 2 2 ϕ j j 1 2 where ϕ j x t j 1 2 denote the depth averaged velocity potential either in region 1 or region 2 other variables can be transferred into dimensionless forms as k k h η η h c c c 0 and t t h g following the approaches proposed by zhong and wang 2006 and jaf and wang 2015 the depth averaged velocity potential of region 1 including both incident and reflected waves can be approximated as 7 ϕ 1 i q e i k x r 0 e i k x e i k c t d k whereas the depth averaged velocity potential of region 2 can be expressed as 8 ϕ 2 i q t 0 e i k x e i k c t d k where r 0 and t 0 are the reflection and transmission related unknown coefficients respectively and 9 q 2 3 c s c h π k 1 3 h substituting eqn 7 into eqn 6 leads the original velocity potential for region 1 as 10 ϕ 1 i q e i k x r 0 e i k x α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 i q e i k x r 0 e i k x e i k c t d k similarly the velocity potential for region 2 can be formulated from eqns 6 and 8 as 11 ϕ 2 i q t 0 e i k x α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 i q t 0 e i k x e i k c t d k in eqns 10 and 11 r 0 and t 0 are dimensionless unknown coefficients required to be determined from the matching conditions in this integral method the r 0 and t 0 for each wave number k are determined to describe their corresponding contributions to the wave reflection and transmission with the integration the overall reflection and transmission coefficients can be estimated velocity potentials of region 1 and region 2 as shown in eqns 10 and 11 satisfy the far field conditions in order to describe the role played by a porous wall at the interface of region 1 and region 2 darcy s law is applied so that the velocity of fluids flows through the porous plate is linearly proportional to the induced pressure difference across the thin structure chwang 1983 which gives 12 ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x b 0 μ p 1 p 2 where μ is the dynamic viscosity b 0 with a dimension of length is a specific material constant for the porous wall and p 1 and p 2 are the pressures acting on the left and right faces of the porous wall respectively with the use of the approximated dynamic free surface boundary condition applied to each term of the integrations in eqns 10 and 11 the velocities of the fluid at the interface between region 1 and region 2 can be derived as 13 ϕ 1 x ϕ 2 x b 0 ρ μ ϕ 1 t ϕ 2 t let b 0 b 0 h the dimensionless form of eqn 13 can be expressed as 14 ϕ 1 x x 0 ϕ 2 x x 0 i k c r e b 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 where r e ρ h g h μ is a parameter of reynolds number describing the flow condition passing through the porous wall in order to solve r 0 and t 0 the matching boundary conditions at the interface x 0 are applied they are 15 ϕ 1 x x 0 ϕ 2 x x 0 1 z 0 16 ϕ 1 x 0 ϕ 2 x 0 1 z d 17 ϕ 1 x x 0 ϕ 2 x x 0 i k c r e b 0 ϕ 1 ϕ 2 d z 0 here d d h represents the dimensionless submerged depth of a porous wall equation 15 reflects the continuity of the fluid velocity at the interface while eqn 16 describes the continuity of the velocity potential for the opening part of the interface the porous effect is added into the mixed matching conditions with the application of eqn 17 where the normal velocity passing through the porous plate is found to be associated with the difference between the velocity potentials in region 1 and region 2 by substituting eqns 10 and 11 into eqn 15 we can get the relationship between r 0 and t 0 as 18 t 0 1 r 0 also substituting eqns 10 and 11 into eqn 16 we have 19 2 r 0 α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 2 r 0 0 1 z d furthermore from eqn 17 we can rewrite 20 1 r 0 2 g r 0 α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 1 r 0 2 g r 0 0 d z 0 where g r e b 0 c is a dimensionless porous effect parameter equations 19 and 20 form a system of mixed matching conditions a function related to eqns 19 and 20 is defined as 21 h 0 1 1 2 g r 0 α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 1 1 2 g r 0 d z 0 2 r 0 α k 2 1 3 z z 2 2 2 r 0 1 z d the least

and 11 in both region 1 and region 2 can be calculated as an approximation for each term of the integration solutions the linearized dynamic free surface boundary condition is applied separately in region1 and region 2 to obtain the free surface elevations in region 1 we have the dimensionless wave elevation as 29 η 1 q k c e i k x r 0 e i k x e i k c t d k similarly the free surface elevation of the transmitted wave in region 2 can be derived as 30 η 2 q k c t 0 e i k x e i k c t d k the real parts of eqns 29 and 30 can be calculated to represent the physical values of the free surface elevations in region 1 and region 2 respectively to determine the maximum hydrodynamic forces on the partially submerged porous wall the pressure distribution along the wall needs to be computed according to the bernoulli equation the dimensionless form of the dynamic pressure can be expressed as 31 p ϕ t 1 2 ϕ x 2 ϕ z 2 where p p ρ g h due to the assumption of a thin wall zero thickness only the horizontal hydrodynamic forces are presented in this study through the approximated procedure and including the effect of the free surface elevation the horizontal hydrodynamic force can be computed by integrating the pressures acting on the front and back faces of the porous wall as 32 f x d 0 p 1 d z 1 2 η 1 η 1 d 0 p 2 d z 1 2 η 2 η 2 where the dimensionless hydrodynamic force per unit width fx is defined as f x ρ g h 2 it should be noted that the maximum force happens at the time when the maximum wave run up reaching the front face of the porous wall 3 experimental study in order to verify the derived analytical solutions as described above laboratory experiments were conducted to measure the free surface elevations of the incident reflected and transmitted waves for a solitary wave interacting with a fixed thin porous wall the experiments were carried out in a 762 cm 25 ft long 30 48 cm 1 ft wide and 91 44 cm 3 ft high glass walled section of a 12 5 m 41 ft long wave tank in the hydraulic lab of the university of houston a side view schematic of the channel is shown in fig 2 by controlling the motions of a tolomatic linear actuator a solitary wave of a given wave height can be generated from a piston type wavemaker at one end of the tank at the other end of the tank energy dissipaters were used to avoid the reflections of the waves after encountering the end wall two resistance type wave gauges were installed along the wavetank to measure the free surface elevations of the incident reflected and transmitted waves gauge 1 was placed at a distance 76 2 cm upstream of the partially submerged porous wall to measure the incident and reflected waves meanwhile gauge 2 was set at a distance 63 5 cm downstream of the porous wall to capture the transmitted waves before recording the wave elevations calibration of wave gauges was performed to ensure the accuracy of the measurements all the wave elevations were recorded by the labview data acquisition system the water depth set for the experiments was 7 62 cm in this study two submerged depth of porous wall i e d 3 81 cm and d 7 62 cm or d 0 5 and d 1 were selected for model tests regarding the incident wave conditions different solitary waves with varying dimensionless wave heights α from 0 09 to 0 33 were generated to test the effect of the wave height on the reflected and transmitted waves for the porous wall a thin porous plate with different porous conditions was placed in a partially submerged position for the wavetank tests each porous plate was made of 11 gauge galvanized steel and the pore pattern was the standard round 60 staggered pattern the calibrated values of b 0 or b 0 b 0 h for the tested porous plates of different porosities and pore sizes given by chu 2014 are shown in table 1 after knowing the water depth the corresponding constant value of r e for describing the flow condition passing through the porous wall can be calculated by adding the effect of b 0 the value of r e b 0 as an inputted parameter of the experimental setup can be obtained the r e b 0 values are also summarized in table 1 4 results and discussion to verify the derived analytical solutions for the interactions of a solitary wave with a partially submerged porous wall the free surface elevations obtained by applying eqns 29 and 30 are compared with the experimental measurements that were recorded by gauge 1 incident wave and reflected waves and gauge 2 transmitted waves in each experiment in this validation study cases with various values of the incident wave height α the submerged depth of porous wall d and the material constant of the porous wall b 0 are included in the comparison plots all the results and plots presented in this study are nondimensionalized by using h as length scale c0 as velocity scale and h g as time scale for example the free surface elevation η equals to η h for the case with 7 62 cm water depth or h 1 d 0 5 submerged depth 50 of the water depth and b 0 10 5 case 1 fig 3 fig 4 and fig 5 present the comparisons between the analytically obtained and experimentally recorded wave elevations considering the dimensionless incident wave heights α of 0 09 0 21 and 0 33 respectively the subplots of figs 3 a 4 a and 5 a illustrate the comparisons of incident and reflected waves from both the analytical and experimental results while figs 3 b 5 b reveal the comparisons of transmitted waves all the cases in this study use the same r e value of 65882 as can be seen from figs 3 5 the incident and transmitted waves predicted by the present analytical solutions in magnitudes and phases match well with the experimental data and for the reflected waves in general the variation trend including the phase from the analytical solutions agree reasonably well with the measurements however with slightly over predicted wave peaks as expected since the analytical solutions neglect the energy dissipations due to fluid viscosity and the friction effect caused by the porous wall the reflected waves computed due to their run up run down and backward propagation are shown to have greater wave amplitudes than those from the experimental measurements also by examining the results shown in fig 3 through fig 5 the errors of predicted amplitudes of reflected waves increase as the incident wave height increases due to partly the increased friction effect and partly the enhanced nonlinear effect also noticeable for incident waves with higher amplitude the present solutions misses the predictions of the small oscillatory tails observed in the recorded reflected waves in terms of validations of the results for cases considering a different submerged depth of porous wall fig 6 presents the comparisons of measurements from gauge1 and gauge 2 with analytical solutions for the case case 2 of a α 0 09 solitary wave interacting with a porous wall which is completely submerged d 1 with a material constant of b 0 being equal to 10 5 again the transmitted wave profile obtained from the present analytical model agrees well with the experimental data when comparing to the results presented in fig 3 d 0 5 and α 0 09 a greater reflected wave height for the case of d 1 fig 6 is noticed which reflects that an increase in the submerged depth of the wall results in an increase in the reflected wave height considering the effect of porous wall property fig 7 illustrates the wave profile comparisons for the case case 3 with α 0 33 d 0 5 and b 0 1 6 10 5 the present model predictions in terms of incident and transmitted wave elevations again fit well with the measurements the reflected wave height is however over estimated comparing the results shown in figs 5 and 7 it suggests that the case with b 0 1 6 10 5 is shown to have a greater transmitted wave height than that for the case with b 0 10 5 by examining the comparisons shown in fig 3 through fig 7 the analytical solutions are demonstrated to be able to predict the transmitted wave elevations well and tend to overestimate the reflected wave height for the study of interactions between a solitary wave and a partially submerged porous wall the error by comparing the analytically predicted transmitted wave height with those measured in the wavetank is about 5 for the reflected wave height the error is roughly 30 before carrying out the evaluations of the various affecting variables on the wave transformation and induced forces as a solitary wave propagating past a partially submerged porous wall the variation behaviors of the transmission related coefficients t 0 versus submerged depth are discussed according to eqns 18 and 27 the derived t 0 are functions of the following dimensionless parameters submerged depth draft of the porous wall d incident wave height α material constant of the porous wall b 0 and wave number parameter k here every specific value of k has its associated t 0 values even though the physical variables for describing the interactions between a solitary wave and a partially submerged porous wall require the integration of the derived solutions through wave number k from k to k the variations of t 0 versus the submerged depth d would be interesting to examine for their effects on the eventual transmission coefficient also through the study of the variations of t 0 versus d with and without porous effect we can estimate the influences of the porous properties on the transmission of an incident solitary wave after interacting with a partially submerged porous wall for a case of a solitary wave with α 0 21 interacting with a solid wall it can be considered as a special case of the present solutions by setting the material constant of the porous wall b 0 to be equal to 0 fig 8 a illustrates the variations of t 0 versus d for different k values when b 0 0 the results indicate that when the wave number k increases the transmission related coefficient t 0 decreases physically it suggests that for a given submerged wall depth the effect of t 0 on wave transmission decreases when the value of k increases meanwhile for a fixed wave number k as expected when the submerged depth of the solid wall increases the coefficient t 0 decreases for a solid wall case the initial increase of the submerged depth of the wall tends to have more significant effect on decreasing the coefficient t 0 when the wave number is large however when k becomes smaller it is opposite the change at the cases with larger d value has a stronger effect on decreasing the contributions from those transmitted wave components for a porous wall case with b 0 10 5 the varying trends of t 0 versus d for α 0 21 and different k values are presented in fig 8 b since a porous structure is considered the minimum t 0 for all k values different from a solid wall case reaches a constant of 0 57 when d 1 certainly the minimum t 0 depends on the material constant of the porous wall b 0 similar to the solid wall cases for a fixed k value an increase in submerged depth d the transmission related coefficient t 0 decreases and for a constant d when the wave number k increases the value of t 0 decreases however with any given k value the porous effect makes the changes of t 0 to be more significant in the ranges of smaller d than those when d becomes larger it should be noted for a given k there is a corresponding transmission related coefficient t 0 and for the determination of the overall transmission coefficient which is the ratio of the transmitted wave height to the incident wave height the integration of wave elevation solutions versus k from k to k is required in order to investigate the effect of the r e b 0 on the dimensionless wave run ups dimensional wave run up water depth for various submerged conditions fig 9 shows the plots of wave run ups versus r e b 0 with various submerged depths and a giving incident wave height of 0 2 it can be clearly noticed that when the submerged depth of wall is small the effect of r e b 0 on wave run up is insignificant and as the submerged depth becomes larger the effect of r e b 0 on wave run up becomes more apparent also as the porous wall parameter r e b 0 increases the wave run up decreases to further the analyses of the influences of the submerged depth and r e b 0 on the overall transmission coefficient fig 10 illustrates the variations of the overall transmission coefficient c t versus r e b 0 for various submerged depths and a fixed incident wave height of 0 2 it is found that when the submerged depth is large e g d 1 or d 0 8 the overall transmission coefficient is shown to have a nonlinear increasing trend as r e b 0 increases however when the submerged depth becomes smaller e g d 0 2 or d 0 4 the effect of r e b 0 on the overall transmission coefficient although is not significant reflects that c t has a decreasing initially then increasing trend as r e b 0 increases from fig 10 it can be seen that the role played by the submerged depth of wall on the overall transmission coefficient becomes important when the value of porous wall parameter r e b 0 is small when r e b 0 approaches to 6 the effect of submerged depth on c t is negligible also an interesting phenomenon that the minimum c t occurs at an identified r e b 0 porous condition for cases with smaller submerged depths e g d 0 2 d 0 4 or d 0 6 is observed in fig 10 similar phenomenon was also noticed for cases considering sinusoidal waves interacting with partially submerged porous structures isaacson et al 1998 li et al 2015 considering the effect of energy dissipation caused by the porous structures the variations of c t in fig 10 is potentially a reflection of the variations of the total wave energy as an approximation the total energy c r 2 c t 2 of the reflected and transmitted waves is plotted versus r e b 0 for cases of various submerged depths and a fixed incident wave height of 0 2 in fig 11 here c r is the overall reflection coefficient as the ratio of reflected wave height versus incident wave height it can be seen the variation trends in fig 10 are similar to those in fig 11 therefore for cases with small submerged depth of porous wall the occurrence of maximum energy loss or minimum total energy at an identified r e b 0 value affects more on the transmitted waves and consequently results in the minimum overall transmission coefficient as the results presented in fig 10 hydrodynamic force is also an important and critical physical variable to be determined for the structural design consideration based on eqn 32 the horizontal hydrodynamic forces acting on the wall can be calculated fig 12 shows the comparisons between the estimated maximum horizontal forces on a partially submerged solid wall by applying eqn 32 with b 0 0 and the experimental data from liu and al banaa s 2004 study where 8 cases with different submerged depths and incident waves heights were tested the points along the 45 line indicates the perfect fit it can be seen in general the present analytical results agree reasonable well with the measurements since the approximated procedure is applied to the derivation of the present analytical solutions the comparisons also reflect that the stronger agreement occurs at cases with smaller wave height waves in addition to the performance on wave profile predictions the present analytical model again demonstrates to be able to provide reasonable estimations on wave forces on a partially submerged porous wall in terms of the effect of the submerged depth of the wall on the maximum horizontal force the results showing the maximum horizontal force versus the submerged depth for various incident wave heights under a solid wall condition are presented in fig 13 a and the results for a porous wall case with b 0 10 5 are plotted in fig 13 b more enhanced nonlinear trends showing the increase of maximum horizontal forces as the submerged depth of a solid wall increases can be noticed also for a solid wall case the maximum horizontal force is much larger than that under a porous wall condition especially when the submerged depth becomes larger the combined effects of submerged depth and porous wall parameter r e b 0 on the maximum horizontal force are shown in fig 14 where the incident wave height is set to be 0 2 it is found that when the submerged depth is less than or equal to 0 5 e g d 0 25 or d 0 5 the effect of r e b 0 on the maximum horizontal force is insignificant as the submerged depth become larger the effect of r e b 0 on the maximum horizontal force becomes more important especially for a completely submerged wall where the maximum horizontal force decreases as r e b 0 increases as described above for the solution accuracy consideration relatively the average error for overestimation of the reflected waves are much larger than those of the transmitted waves this suggests that part of the error sources in terms of energy dissipation seems to be overtaken by the reflected waves additionally from the experimental measurements a transmitted wave tends to maintain as a single hump of solitary wave profile however the reflected waves are formed with a main reflected wave and a sequence of oscillatory tails followed those small wave oscillations which are not captured by the analytical solutions are also considered to potentially make lower wave height of the main reflected waves for the reasons described it would be interesting in a future study to develop new formulations for energy dissipations that can be applied correctly to the reflected and transmitted waves and to include the oscillating tail associated nonlinear and dispersive effects into the derivations for improving the predictions of the analytical solutions the analytical solutions with its capability of describing the physical phenomena in domains of generally all sizes could enhance both numerical and experimental studies however their validations require the comparisons with the experimental measurements the scale effect which controls different levels of errors and in some cases limits the data collected always plays an important role in experimental study for wave related measurements the dimensions of a wavetank and wavemaker setting lead the limits on the measurable variables and physical conditions tested in the tank such as water depth incident waves and the size and position of the structures when generating a solitary wave which is a boussinesq type nonlinear shallow water wave it is required to have the setting that balances both the nonlinear and dispersive effects this further limits the cases tested in the wavetank in this study due to the relatively small scale of the laboratory wavetank the setting of water depth for producing solitary waves is comparatively shallow e g 7 62 cm this water depth further limits our experimental cases to two different breakwater submergences d 0 5 and 1 and two walls of different porosities however reasonable data under various wave and testing conditions were successfully collected for validation of the derived analytical solutions to improve the error control and variables tested in the experiments it is recommended to extend the laboratory measurements in a larger wavetank with new data collected from more set cases to further the verification of the analytical solutions and physical interpretation of the results 5 conclusions in this study the hydrodynamic interactions between a solitary wave and a partially submerged thin porous wall are studied with proposed analytical procedures and laboratory verifications according to the defined fluid domains analytical solutions of the velocity potentials wave elevations and hydrodynamic forces in terms of reflection and transmission related coefficients are derived by applying the fourier integral method and solution superposition procedure proposed by isaacson 1983 and zhong and wang 2006 the porous wall boundary conditions based on chwang s 1983 porous flow equations are formulated the least squares method is applied to the mixed matching conditions at the interface of porous wall to obtain the reflection and transmission related coefficients additionally the experimental measurements were carried out to verify the derived analytical solutions of the free surface elevations as shown in the presented results the incident and transmitted waves predicted by the present analytical model in magnitudes and phases match well with the experimental data and for the reflected waves in general the analytical solutions tends to overestimate the reflected wave height as the submerged depth increases stronger nonlinear decreasing trends of the wave run up as r e b 0 increases can be noticed when the submerged porous wall depth is smaller e g d 0 2 or d 0 4 the effect of r e b 0 on the variations of the wave run up is negligible in contrast as r e b 0 increases the overall transmission coefficient increases for a completely submerged porous wall and the increasing trend of the overall transmission coefficient versus r e b 0 is nonlinear for a porous wall with d being equal to or less than 0 6 the overall transmission coefficient has a decreasing initially then increasing trend as r e b 0 increases also the minimum c t occurs at an identified r e b 0 value in terms of the maximum horizontal hydrodynamic forces on a partially submerged solid wall b 0 0 the present analytical results match reasonably well with the experimental measurements from liu and al banaa 2004 with an increase in either the incident wave height or the submerged depth of porous wall the horizontal hydrodynamic forces increase it becomes apparent that the porous wall can reduce the hydrodynamic forces significantly when the submerged depth become larger the present analytical model is demonstrated to be able to provide reasonable estimations on wave transformation and induced hydrodynamic forces for cases considering a solitary wave interacting with a partially submerged porous wall however since the method utilizes linearized velocity potentials it is limited to be more practical for waves with relatively smaller wave heights for a deeper analytical consideration it is generally more challenging typically for highly nonlinear waves to drive the exact solutions for waves passing through porous structures especially to include the detailed energy dissipations or even the flow resistance effect it may require the use of combined perturbation method and comprehensive porous flow conditions to derive higher order solutions in this study the energy dissipation effect which is partly introduced in the porous wall boundary conditions using the darcy s law is indirectly included in the solutions for future study the nonlinear effect and more detailed energy dissipation of a solitary wave when passing through a porous wall especially the portions contributed to the reflected and transmitted waves can be interesting add ons for the analytical solutions to improve the accuracy on estimating the wave reflection

introduction general concerns of global warming along with the cost of fossil fuels are rising leading to an increased focus on the development of renewable energy technologies and industries some of these industries such as on shore wind or hydroelectric are well established on the other hand marine energy sources are still to be exploited anywhere near their full potential unlike the on shore wind industry marine energy industries are facing additional challenges due to harsher conditions encountered in their environment large water bodies present their own physical challenges that make it difficult and costly to develop manufacture and maintain marine energy devices for instance these challenges include salinity extreme turbulence environmental issues and difficult expensive accessibility adding the strong currents and very short windows of accessibility specific to tidal flows it is nonetheless believed that the outcome is worth the effort it has been estimated that tidal stream energy capacity worldwide is extremely large with 7 gw maximum power potential just in the minas passage in the bay of fundy canada karsten et al 2008 and as estimated by électricité de france edf 12 5 gw in europe muller et al 2015 for the marine energy industries particularly in stream tidal reliability will be the key turbine developers are putting more and more emphasis on pre deployment testing in order to garner meaningful information on the performance of tidal turbines as stated by tidal turbine manufacturers measuring the performance of a tidal turbine presents two key challenges to the tidal energy industry 1 prediction in the design stage 2 verification of the performance once operational mcnaughton et al 2015 prediction in the design stage is currently done through small scale steady state experimental testing which uses constant velocity towing tank bahaj et al 2007a doman et al 2015 or flume tank mycek et al 2014a to determine power produced and thrust acting on the designed turbine or a numerical model of the turbine over which the turbulent flow is simulated using either a simpler blade element momentum bem bahaj et al 2007b batten et al 2008 lee et al 2012 malki et al 2013 method actuator disks representations johnson et al 2014 harrison et al 2009 shives and crawford 2017 or the more powerful and accurate but also costlier and time consuming computational fluid dynamics cfd methods jo et al 2014 mcnaughton et al 2012 mcsherry et al 2011 large emphasis is given to this stage 1 work since stage 2 verification of the performance once operational has only been undertaken by a select few turbine developers alstom through years of careful measurement and testing mcnaughton et al 2015 openhydro through years at emec and now the bay of fundy and mct with their recently decommissioned strangford lough turbines openhydro for example still appears to be privileging stage 1 design testing through numerical study using steady constant velocity conditions muller et al 2015 with the large emphasis given to stage 1 work it appears important to ensure that the simulations are using appropriate numerical methodologies and tidal flow representative velocity fields as well as validate the obtained numerical results both turbine performance and wake as thoroughly as possible the field of turbine energy research has seen numerous numerical papers published and presented over the last decade with a large fraction using either steady inflow inlet boundary condition velocities mcnaughton et al 2012 or steady quasi steady numerical approaches or both osbourne et al 2015 it has now been shown that tidal flows are highly transient hay et al 2013 mcmillan et al 2015 leading to time varying loads on and power produced by the turbines starzmann et al 2015 therefore in order to properly model the various impact of tidal flow on the turbine and the wake pure transient studies both transient boundary conditions and transient methods will be needed of the various numerical methods that are employed today for studying turbulent flow over turbines very few can be employed to study unsteady flow with high enough accuracy blade element momentum bem methods have been shown to be insufficient for unsteady loading lee et al 2012 the actuator disc method still lacks the solution quality that would result from a standalone cfd model a cfd approach has been shown to have the capability of resolving turbulence in the near and far field regions at fine resolutions for a three dimensional horizontal axis tidal turbine o doherty et al 2009 the most commonly used turbulence model in the field of tidal turbine simulation today is the reynolds average navier stokes rans shear stress transport sst model the sst model utilizes k ω in the inner boundary regions and k ε in the free stream regions has been shown to perform better than just k ω or k ε use on their own and is capable of resolving turbulence within an acceptable margin of error mcnaughton et al 2012 mcsherry et al 2011 currie et al 2016 rans sst simulations can be ran on today s computer providing accurate and mesh converged results in less than 48 h of simulation time using either a quasi steady state or a fully transient approach more computationally expensive numerical methods are also used prime example being large eddy simulation les which is the only method available to resolve eddies of all sizes in the flow and therefore address the full spectra of turbulent fluctuations les studies are by default fully transient and provide extremely fine flow details loading and turbine performance details ahmed et al 2015 afgan et al 2013 hybrid models are also now developed detached eddy simulation des being a good example which uses les in the region of the flow where turbulence needs to be resolved more the wake directly behind the turbine and rans everywhere else the computational cost paid being between rans and les ebdon et al 2016 the shift into unsteady studies has started recently with numerous papers in the last two years looking at various engineering aspects for example cfd study of the load on turbine blades stemming from unsteady tidal flow wang and day 2015 experimental study in a circulating tank of unsteady turbulence generated artificially using static grids effect on a small scale tidal turbine mycek et al 2014a 2014b blackmore et al 2015 these studies however do not look at the impact of the chosen numerical approach frozen rotor or transient rotor approach used to perform the numerical simulations on turbine and wake resolution and behaviour this paper presents a numerical study of the flow on and in the wake of a horizontal axis tidal turbine hatt performed using two numerical approaches the frozen rotor quasi steady approach and the fully transient approach in order to determine the turbine behaviour under turbulent tidal flow conditions the difference in turbine performance and wake prediction between approaches and therefore collect meaningful information on which of these approaches should be used for wake studies the simulations are all performed using rans sst and are validated against experimental results published on ifremer lomc turbine for which wake behaviour were measured mycek et al 2014a 2 turbine geometry the turbine geometry used for this study is based on the small scale three bladed hatt device that was used for the experimental work performed by the french research groups at l institut français de recherche pour l exploitation de la mer ifremer and the laboratoire ondes et milieux complexes lomc at the université du havre mycek et al 2014a the hatt has a rotor diameter d 2r of 700 mm and table 1 presents the blade geometry which is based on the naca 63418 airfoil shape for the blade the twist axis was located at 25 of the chord length from the leading edge for each cross section the blade profiles were exported and lofted in solidworks to create the three dimensional geometry shown in fig 1 the nacelle and support structure geometries were estimated from reviews of the group s publications mycek et al 2014a 2014b dimensions of which are provided in table 2 the blade roots and rotor hub were greatly simplified from the experimental setup to facilitate meshing 3 numerical modelling the numerical simulation presented in this study were performed using ansys cfx version 17 osbourne et al 2015 3 1 fluid domain the experimental tests using this device were completed in a flume tank at ifremer situated in boulogne sur mer mycek et al 2014a dimensions of this testing facility are provided in table 3 these parameters are represented in the numerical fluid domain with the exception of the domain length noting that the height and width of the flume tank and simulated domain corresponds to 2 22d and 4 44d respectively the domain length was shortened to 22d with inlet and outlet lengths distance from device of 2d and 20d respectively fig 2 illustrates the numerical fluid domain it has been shown that this length is sufficient as the near wake physics and performance of the turbine is not significantly affected by the outlet domain length osbourne et al 2015 3 2 turbulence models the k ω shear stress transport sst reynolds averaged navier stokes rans turbulence model was chosen to suitably capture turbulent fluctuations in the flow menter 1994 this is generally accepted as the most suitable turbulence model in similar applications harrison et al 2009 mcsherry et al 2011 afgan et al 2013 sst is a two equation eddy viscosity model that employs k ω in the inner boundary layer and transitions to k ε further in the free stream each model alone have their limitations e g k ε tends to underpredict force components mcnaughton et al 2012 while k ω is sensitive in free shear flows this approach negates the shortcomings of each model accurately models both free stream and boundary layer regions and offers improved prediction of flow separation and adverse pressure gradients sst has been shown to resolve turbulence within an acceptable margin of error for similar flow regimes mcsherry et al 2011 afgan et al 2013 marsh et al 2012 3 3 computational mesh the fluid domain was spatially discretized using ansys mesher unstructured tetrahedrals were used to accurately represent the turbine geometry the domain consisted of the rotating cylindrical domain encompassing the turbine and a larger stationary domain continuity across the interface between the two domains was achieved using the general grid interface ggi through ansys cfx to avoid spending a great deal of time in creating a refined mesh zone around the blade which allowed for a sharp trailing edge the decision to round the trailing edge was made it was shown that adjusting the trailing edge roundness diameter even to a completely sharp tip has a significant impact on the lift produced osbourne et al 2015 currie et al 2016 a sharp trailing edge allows higher lift force values than a rounded trailing edge but requires complex meshing especially in the inflation layer to be achieved the decision was made to reproduce the shape of the blade as closely as possible but without a sharp trailing edge all results presented in this paper incorporate a rounded trailing edge leading to a fully resolved inflation layer around the blade inflation layers were incorporated at the turbine and blade surfaces to better resolve the fluid boundary layer it was desired to numerically resolve the near wall flow with the low reynold s method rather than rely on wall functions a convenient parameter which helps define and ensure resolution of the boundary layer is the dimensionless wall distance y which is defined as 1 y δ y p υ τ w ρ where δ y p is the distance between the first and second grid points off the wall υ is the fluid s kinematic viscosity τ w is the wall shear stress and ρ is the fluid density all results presented in this paper used an inflated mesh with y 4 which is acceptable as y 11 indicates that the first node is within the laminar sublayer and the flow will be fully resolved without wall functions as per the ansys theory guide inc 2013 a detailed view of the turbine mesh is shown in fig 3 showing emphasis on mesh density for the rotor and turbine s blades with a close up of the blade root mesh showed on fig 4 a convergence study of the mesh around the turbine blades has been extensively performed for such geometries in previous work osbourne et al 2015 currie et al 2016 therefore the overall mesh around the turbine was selected directly from those previous study to ensure a resolution beyond the minimum necessary for mesh independence a wake convergence study performed at steady state was completed wherein a cylindrical body of influence was included in the wake of the turbine on which an average cell size could be specified four meshes were studied with varying local wake mesh size as shown in table 4 the first results of this mesh convergence study is that the mesh in the wake showed insignificant effects on the determined turbine power and thrust coefficients as seen in fig 5 this result is promising for researchers who are more interested in design optimization than wake physics as a relatively coarse wake mesh would suffice further results from this convergence study related to the impact on the wake will be discussed in section 5 3 4 numerical setup the boundary conditions for this numerical model are provided in table 5 the fluid domain as mentioned earlier also incorporates a rotating cylindrical mesh enveloping the turbine fig 2 two different approaches are used for the simulations and both have to do with the treatment of that rotating cylindrical mesh the quasi steady state simulations are using the frozen rotor approach in that case the reference frame around the turbine is made to rotate the fluid while the physical turbine does not move osbourne et al 2015 in the transient simulations the cylindrical domain is made to rotate and the simulation advances through time using a small timestep the turbine blades are changing position every timestep the rotational speed of the cylindrical domain or of the reference frame when using the frozen rotor approach is set to achieve a desired tip speed ratio tsr as defined by 2 t s r ω r v 0 where ω is the rotational speed of the turbine in rad s r is the turbine radius and v 0 is the nominal upstream velocity of 0 8 m s a no slip condition and wall velocity of 0 8 m s was added to the tank walls to eliminate the need to solve for boundary layer on these walls all simulations were performed using between 26 and 30 cores on a dell precisiont7810 16 cores 2 4 ghz hyper threaded with 128 gb of ram 4 experimental comparison power and thrust coefficients were used for comparison with the experimental results mycek et al 2014a these parameters are described as follows 3 c t t 1 2 ρ a v 0 2 4 c p p 1 2 ρ a v 0 3 ω q 1 2 ρ a v 0 3 where t and p are the thrust and mechanical power produced respectively ρ is the fluid density a is the rotor swept area and q is the rotor torque it should be noted that results from the experiments were not corrected for blockage so neither were the numerical results fig 6 a and b show experimental numerical comparisons of c p and c t respectively from the experiment and simulations performed in that case using an inlet velocity v 0 1 m s both results follow similar trends in the tsr range of 3 7 centred on the optimum tsr of 5 5 5 the predicted c p curve has an average relative difference of 8 with an average absolute difference of 0 032 below experimental values starting from the fact that experimental measurements do have an uncertainty which was not directly presented in mycek et al 2014a but from other work can be in the range of 1 5 7 doman et al 2015 and that values of c p are known to be sensitive to small deviations in the actual geometry of the system modelled rounding of the trailing edge of the blades imperfect representation of the hub geometry etc this slight under prediction of the c p values numerically is acceptable and in line with numerous other numerical study results in term of order of magnitude and deviation to experimental data it is therefore considered that the results are representative and validated when it comes to c p the predicted c t curve has an average relative difference of only 1 7 and an average absolute difference of 0 0013 the tsr value related to the highest value of c t is in the same range between experimental and numerical simulations tsrmax 5 to 6 these results are considered acceptable considering the unknown experimental uncertainty 5 results and discussions a three bladed hatt has been successfully modelled using ansys cfx for an inlet velocity v 0 0 8 m s a maximum value of c p was found to be 0 403 at tsr 4 5 while experimental peak is 0 42 at tsr 4 5 likewise a maximum value of c t was found to be 0 862 at tsr 6 while experimental peak is 0 833 at tsr 5 and 6 results of a wake mesh convergence study are provided and discussed in section 5 1 while wake physics results for both tested numerical approaches are similarly discussed in section 5 2 5 1 wake mesh convergence study a wake mesh convergence study was completed as described in section 3 using the quasi steady state approach mid plane cross sections and rear views of meshes 1 3 and 4 are shown in fig 7 illustrating the method of local mesh refinement a discussion on the impact of wake mesh sizing on power and thrust coefficients was presented earlier it was found that wake mesh size had minimal impact on these parameters velocity deficit and turbulence intensity were chosen as additional metrics to determine further impacts of mesh sizing these are described as follows 5 v d e f i c i t 1 v w v 0 6 t i 100 v 0 2 3 k where v w is the local wake velocity and v 0 is the inlet velocity in this study v 0 remains constant for the duration of the simulation even in the transient simulations the tsr is fixed to 3 67 and the inlet turbulence intensity is i 3 unless specified otherwise local values of velocity deficit and turbulence intensity were sampled at horizontal and vertical mid plane lines from 3d to 10d downstream of the turbine fig 8 a and b and c show velocity deficit along horizontal sample lines at 3d 6d and 10d downstream of the turbine for the tsr 3 67 simulation tsr value used in the experiments by the ifremer s group mycek et al 2014a 10d away from the turbine the wake velocity deficit is still significant even for the finest mesh mesh 4 meshes 1 and 2 the two coarsest meshes demonstrate the necessity of mesh convergence studies overestimating the velocity deficit and not capturing local phenomena velocity deficit begins to converge as mesh density is increased in the wake region meshes 3 and 4 finer meshes converge to the same solution for velocity deficit also showing a faster wake recovery fig 8d e and f show velocity deficit at vertical sample lines at the same distance behind the turbine for the same tsr fluctuations are much more sporadic in the vertical direction due to flow interaction with the nacelle support structure the three finest meshes tend to capture these fluctuations fairly well again converging for meshes 3 and 4 a local peak in velocity deficit particularly pronounced at 3d at the y d position of 0 5 is also observed in the vertical direction this location corresponding with the blade tip pointing straight down during the steady state frozen rotor simulations similarly fig 9 a and b and c and fig 9d e and f provide horizontal and vertical turbulence intensities respectively at 3d 6d and 10d behind the turbine again for a tsr 3 67 the symmetry in the horizontal direction that was observed for the velocity deficit is no longer observed in the turbulence intensity results this is attributed to a combination of swirl in the wake causes by the rotation of the fluid around the turbine as well as fluid interaction with the nacelle support structure the vertical samples of turbulence intensity display three distinct peaks the peaks located at y d 0 and 0 5 correspond to turbulence and vortex shedding at the blade root nacelle and blade tip of the turbine these two areas of abrupt planform change are commonly associated with vortex creation a corollary of this is an increase in turbine drag meshes 3 and 4 again converge on the calculated fluid turbulence intensity which is grossly underpredicted for the coarser mesh as can be seen in figs 8 and 9 the results obtained with meshes 3 and 4 vary only very slightly from one another as the number of elements is much smaller in mesh 3 than mesh 4 30 millions against 45 millions mesh 3 was considered a converged mesh and was chosen for subsequent studies all results provided henceforth use mech 3 5 2 steady state frozen rotor versus transient rotor in this section the results of simulations performed using the two different approaches mentioned earlier quasi steady state frozen rotor and transient are presented for both approaches near and far field wake propagation is investigated and discussed thus a comparison between the two approaches is made to garner meaningful information on which numerical methods should be preferred in wake studies since every variable is constantly changing over time during the transient simulations all following transient results were generated from a snapshot made after 80 s of simulation a period long enough to ensure that the wake had time to fully reach the 20d outlet and become fully establish fig 10 shows how the power coefficient c p compares between a quasi steady state frozen rotor simulation and the transient rotor one ultimately once the flow is established the predicted values are about the same 0 366 from frozen rotor versus an average of 0 367 for the transient study this is the level of agreement obtained between the two approaches when it comes to c p and c t and both are slightly underpredicting the experimental value of c p and c t as discussed in section 4 and presented in fig 6 fig 10 also shows that it does take a few seconds at start up to get the turbine and flow to reach an establish regime fig 11 shows the normalized velocity v v 0 in the wake of the turbine for tsr 3 67 in both cases the oscillating wake from the support structure is evident at the top velocity deficits are also notable from both blade tips and blade roots nacelle for the simulation performed using the frozen rotor approach fig 11a there is a separation in the wake occurring at roughly 3d after the turbine this could be caused by the rotating flow leaving the tip of the downward facing blades remembering that in the frozen rotor approach the turbine blades do not spin during the simulation therefore the downward facing blades are always at the same position which could lead to a permanent wake feature like what is observed in the near wake the velocity deficit in the wake recovers fasters in the frozen rotor simulation compare to the transient one fig 11b at a distance 10d behind the turbine halfway from the turbine to the outlet in fig 11 the normalized velocity for the transient case is still low v v 0 0 55 while it is greatly recovered in the frozen rotor simulation v v 0 0 80 the overall shape of the wake is also dissimilar apart from the wake separation at 3d mentioned earlier the far wake is seen to oscillate in the transient results following the rotation of the blades small velocity ripples emerge at a distance of 10d and continue downstream from the turbine still the overall height and width of the wakes fig 12 shows the wakes view from the top are very similar for both approach being approximately the size of the turbine blade diameter at first and slowly expending radially further from it fig 13 presents the turbulence intensity ti in the wake of the turbine for tsr 3 67 much larger differences are observed in the strength of ti and the shape of it in the wake compared to the velocity deficit again ripples are observed in the transient case fig 13b the regions of strongest ti are also different for both approach the frozen rotor ti reaching a maximum before 10d and forming two zones just above and below the rotational axis of the turbine or left and right of it as seen in fig 14 for the transient simulations the strongest ti is found inside the rotating wake and the ripples that appear finally the near field wake ti is greatly different between the two approaches similar to the velocity deficit turbulence intensity is higher in the transient case than the steady one especially in the mid and far wake by comparing these figures it is clear that choosing the frozen rotor or the transient rotor approach will lead to different results and conclusions on the behaviour of the wake fig 15 presents velocity deficit plots in both the horizontal and vertical planes at four different distances in the wake of the turbine 3d 10d 15d and 20d the shape and amplitude of the velocity deficit are similar in both approaches at distance of 10d and beyond with the quasi steady state frozen rotor result always resulting in smaller deficit the main difference being at 3d especially in the vertical direction where as discussed before the impact of the fixed blade using in this approach are clearly leading to rapid spatial changes in velocity deficit at x d 0 5 the larger difference between both approaches is seen in fig 16 which shows turbulence intensity plots in both the horizontal and vertical planes at four different distances in the wake of the turbine 3d 10d 15d and 20d the distribution of the turbulence intensity within both planes is difference between both approaches for the first 10d behind the turbine after that the transient approach leads to larger turbulence intensity of approximately 4 in the flow the width of the turbulence intensity wake also increases constantly this being captured by both approaches the clearest difference between the nature of the flow in the wake of a turbine as predicted by both approaches can be seen in figs 17 and 18 these figures show respectively normalized velocity and vorticity contour plots at a distance 1d and 5d downstream from the turbine and these plots vary considerably depending on the approach chosen the shape of the velocity and vorticity contour plots are clearly different for the transient simulation the wake is cylindrical as expected from a rotating device however the shape of the three bladed device can easily be seen in the wake from the steady frozen rotor simulation this three bladed shape remains even 5d behind the turbine with very little mixing with the rest of the fluid in simulations where a wake was generated from a front turbine to determine the behaviour of a second turbine behind in the flow this large difference in the nature of the predicted wake would inevitably impact the predicted performance obtained finally it can also be seen from fig 18 that the steady simulation overestimates the vorticity and therefore eddy generation of the blades results at 1d compared to the transient simulation where vorticity and eddies are mixed behind the turbine from the continuous rotation of the blades 5 3 inlet turbulence intensity effect fig 19 shows the comparison in velocity deficit and turbulence intensity in the horizontal plane and in the wake up to a distance of 10d behind the turbine for two inlet turbulence intensity i 3 and 15 as expected the turbulence intensity in the wake is smaller in the case of i 3 although around the x d 0 position the turbulence intensity reach similar values the amount of ti for i 3 exceeding the i 15 amount at 4d it is hard to tell how much of this is due to the actual flow physics or simply numerical artifacts of the numerical scheme used in ansys cfx since it is known that ti will often rapidly numerically decay in cfd codes the velocity deficit plot shows a slightly faster wake recovery for the lower level of inlet turbulence intensity which is physically expected 5 4 validation of transient rotor wake results it is possible to compare the velocity deficit obtained using both numerical methods to experimental results the ifremer research group did characterize the velocity in the wake of their turbine during testing mycek et al 2014a there measurements in the form of normalized velocity are compared to the numerical predictions under the same conditions of v 0 0 8 m s i 3 and tsr 3 67 and on four horizontal lines behind the turbine at position 2d 3d 6d and 10d in fig 20 the shape of the wake obtained numerically with both methods is representative of the one measured experimentally with the numerical models both predicting a width of the wake to only extend to approximately 0 5 d above and below the rotor hub however both numerical methods are predicting a greater velocity deficit directly behind the nacelle the experiment led to velocity deficits varying from nearly 60 at 2d to 30 at 10d for the numerical methods the transient study predicts a deficit in velocity of 80 at 2d decreasing to 50 at 10d while for the quasi steady frozen rotor approach it varies from 80 to 30 this interesting result can be interpreted in a few different ways at this point as mentioned previously the wake recovers more rapidly in the quasi steady approach which leads the quasi steady results to fall within the experimental error at both 6d and 10d this could point to the quasi steady approach predicting the right range of velocities in the wake for distance larger than 6d however the velocity deficit change for the quasi steady results goes from 80 to 30 between 2d and 10d an overall change in the extent of the velocity deficit of 50 over that distance both the transient numerical results and the experiment experience a 30 change in the extend of the velocity deficit over the same distance although the transient numerical results overpredicts the size of the velocity deficit by approximately 20 at each section therefore a second interpretation is that the transient numerical results are predicting the appropriate recovery rate of the wake although in this simulation over predicting the actual local deficit the overprediction could be the result of limitations of the rans sst method in the near wake close to the nacelle the meshing and wall treatment around that nacelle or simply variations in the modelled geometry of the nacelle that was as mentioned earlier created in a simplified way from information and photographs found in the work of the ifremer researchers ultimately looking at the complete picture the agreement between both numerical methods and the experimental result is good while still pointing at numerical issues that need to be addressed further 6 conclusion a numerical cfd study was performed comparing the results obtained from a quasi steady state frozen rotor approach to a transient rotor one when simulating the flow over a three bladed horizontal axis tidal turbine and in the resulting wake the turbine used was the one tested at the ifremer research laboratory the numerical results from this study were compared to the experimental measurements from ifremer where good agreement were obtained both in terms of predicted c p and c t and velocity in the wake the comparison between steady state and transient numerical approaches showed that the velocity deficit is more important for transient simulations in the far wake 10d and more the wake is also slightly wider in the transient simulation the largest difference between the two approaches is in the resulting turbulence intensity in the wake with zones of highest density appearing in different area in each one this comparative analysis of numerical steady state and transient simulations and both compared to experimental measurements shows the impact of the numerical approach selection the predicted performance of the turbine c p and c t is quickly and fairly accurately determined using either numerical methods the quasi steady state approach being numerically less expensive it can be applied rapidly to determine these two general turbine performance indicators however the wake obtained from both method is different first in a qualitative way with the transient study simulating the full rotation of the turbine as well as accounting for the transient nature of the flow in the wake leads to wake behaviour that appear more physical oscillation in the wake in line with the turbine rotational speed distribution of the turbulence intensity that differs greatly from the quasi steady state approach and distribution of flow and velocity in planes behind the turbine showing the mixing expected of rotating blades this proper wake behaviour will become more and more important in future fine scale studies of turbine arrays still the numerical prediction of the quantitative velocity deficit does not perfectly match the experimental measurements with the quasi steady state method providing results in line with the experiment only for distances greater than 6d behind the turbine and the transient method showing the right range of wake recovery while overpredicting the local velocity deficit it therefore appears that the transient method can provide a more physically meaningful wake behaviour although prediction problem of the velocity deficit amplitude still needs to be looked at furthermore for any type of studies that will look at the transient impact of velocity change on a turbine and in the wake the transient method will be the only one that can be employed to that effect the authors will as a next step employ this transient

introduction general concerns of global warming along with the cost of fossil fuels are rising leading to an increased focus on the development of renewable energy technologies and industries some of these industries such as on shore wind or hydroelectric are well established on the other hand marine energy sources are still to be exploited anywhere near their full potential unlike the on shore wind industry marine energy industries are facing additional challenges due to harsher conditions encountered in their environment large water bodies present their own physical challenges that make it difficult and costly to develop manufacture and maintain marine energy devices for instance these challenges include salinity extreme turbulence environmental issues and difficult expensive accessibility adding the strong currents and very short windows of accessibility specific to tidal flows it is nonetheless believed that the outcome is worth the effort it has been estimated that tidal stream energy capacity worldwide is extremely large with 7 gw maximum power potential just in the minas passage in the bay of fundy canada karsten et al 2008 and as estimated by électricité de france edf 12 5 gw in europe muller et al 2015 for the marine energy industries particularly in stream tidal reliability will be the key turbine developers are putting more and more emphasis on pre deployment testing in order to garner meaningful information on the performance of tidal turbines as stated by tidal turbine manufacturers measuring the performance of a tidal turbine presents two key challenges to the tidal energy industry 1 prediction in the design stage 2 verification of the performance once operational mcnaughton et al 2015 prediction in the design stage is currently done through small scale steady state experimental testing which uses constant velocity towing tank bahaj et al 2007a doman et al 2015 or flume tank mycek et al 2014a to determine power produced and thrust acting on the designed turbine or a numerical model of the turbine over which the turbulent flow is simulated using either a simpler blade element momentum bem bahaj et al 2007b batten et al 2008 lee et al 2012 malki et al 2013 method actuator disks representations johnson et al 2014 harrison et al 2009 shives and crawford 2017 or the more powerful and accurate but also costlier and time consuming computational fluid dynamics cfd methods jo et al 2014 mcnaughton et al 2012 mcsherry et al 2011 large emphasis is given to this stage 1 work since stage 2 verification of the performance once operational has only been undertaken by a select few turbine developers alstom through years of careful measurement and testing mcnaughton et al 2015 openhydro through years at emec and now the bay of fundy and mct with their recently decommissioned strangford lough turbines openhydro for example still appears to be privileging stage 1 design testing through numerical study using steady constant velocity conditions muller et al 2015 with the large emphasis given to stage 1 work it appears important to ensure that the simulations are using appropriate numerical methodologies and tidal flow representative velocity fields as well as validate the obtained numerical results both turbine performance and wake as thoroughly as possible the field of turbine energy research has seen numerous numerical papers published and presented over the last decade with a large fraction using either steady inflow inlet boundary condition velocities mcnaughton et al 2012 or steady quasi steady numerical approaches or both osbourne et al 2015 it has now been shown that tidal flows are highly transient hay et al 2013 mcmillan et al 2015 leading to time varying loads on and power produced by the turbines starzmann et al 2015 therefore in order to properly model the various impact of tidal flow on the turbine and the wake pure transient studies both transient boundary conditions and transient methods will be needed of the various numerical methods that are employed today for studying turbulent flow over turbines very few can be employed to study unsteady flow with high enough accuracy blade element momentum bem methods have been shown to be insufficient for unsteady loading lee et al 2012 the actuator disc method still lacks the solution quality that would result from a standalone cfd model a cfd approach has been shown to have the capability of resolving turbulence in the near and far field regions at fine resolutions for a three dimensional horizontal axis tidal turbine o doherty et al 2009 the most commonly used turbulence model in the field of tidal turbine simulation today is the reynolds average navier stokes rans shear stress transport sst model the sst model utilizes k ω in the inner boundary regions and k ε in the free stream regions has been shown to perform better than just k ω or k ε use on their own and is capable of resolving turbulence within an acceptable margin of error mcnaughton et al 2012 mcsherry et al 2011 currie et al 2016 rans sst simulations can be ran on today s computer providing accurate and mesh converged results in less than 48 h of simulation time using either a quasi steady state or a fully transient approach more computationally expensive numerical methods are also used prime example being large eddy simulation les which is the only method available to resolve eddies of all sizes in the flow and therefore address the full spectra of turbulent fluctuations les studies are by default fully transient and provide extremely fine flow details loading and turbine performance details ahmed et al 2015 afgan et al 2013 hybrid models are also now developed detached eddy simulation des being a good example which uses les in the region of the flow where turbulence needs to be resolved more the wake directly behind the turbine and rans everywhere else the computational cost paid being between rans and les ebdon et al 2016 the shift into unsteady studies has started recently with numerous papers in the last two years looking at various engineering aspects for example cfd study of the load on turbine blades stemming from unsteady tidal flow wang and day 2015 experimental study in a circulating tank of unsteady turbulence generated artificially using static grids effect on a small scale tidal turbine mycek et al 2014a 2014b blackmore et al 2015 these studies however do not look at the impact of the chosen numerical approach frozen rotor or transient rotor approach used to perform the numerical simulations on turbine and wake resolution and behaviour this paper presents a numerical study of the flow on and in the wake of a horizontal axis tidal turbine hatt performed using two numerical approaches the frozen rotor quasi steady approach and the fully transient approach in order to determine the turbine behaviour under turbulent tidal flow conditions the difference in turbine performance and wake prediction between approaches and therefore collect meaningful information on which of these approaches should be used for wake studies the simulations are all performed using rans sst and are validated against experimental results published on ifremer lomc turbine for which wake behaviour were measured mycek et al 2014a 2 turbine geometry the turbine geometry used for this study is based on the small scale three bladed hatt device that was used for the experimental work performed by the french research groups at l institut français de recherche pour l exploitation de la mer ifremer and the laboratoire ondes et milieux complexes lomc at the université du havre mycek et al 2014a the hatt has a rotor diameter d 2r of 700 mm and table 1 presents the blade geometry which is based on the naca 63418 airfoil shape for the blade the twist axis was located at 25 of the chord length from the leading edge for each cross section the blade profiles were exported and lofted in solidworks to create the three dimensional geometry shown in fig 1 the nacelle and support structure geometries were estimated from reviews of the group s publications mycek et al 2014a 2014b dimensions of which are provided in table 2 the blade roots and rotor hub were greatly simplified from the experimental setup to facilitate meshing 3 numerical modelling the numerical simulation presented in this study were performed using ansys cfx version 17 osbourne et al 2015 3 1 fluid domain the experimental tests using this device were completed in a flume tank at ifremer situated in boulogne sur mer mycek et al 2014a dimensions of this testing facility are provided in table 3 these parameters are represented in the numerical fluid domain with the exception of the domain length noting that the height and width of the flume tank and simulated domain corresponds to 2 22d and 4 44d respectively the domain length was shortened to 22d with inlet and outlet lengths distance from device of 2d and 20d respectively fig 2 illustrates the numerical fluid domain it has been shown that this length is sufficient as the near wake physics and performance of the turbine is not significantly affected by the outlet domain length osbourne et al 2015 3 2 turbulence models the k ω shear stress transport sst reynolds averaged navier stokes rans turbulence model was chosen to suitably capture turbulent fluctuations in the flow menter 1994 this is generally accepted as the most suitable turbulence model in similar applications harrison et al 2009 mcsherry et al 2011 afgan et al 2013 sst is a two equation eddy viscosity model that employs k ω in the inner boundary layer and transitions to k ε further in the free stream each model alone have their limitations e g k ε tends to underpredict force components mcnaughton et al 2012 while k ω is sensitive in free shear flows this approach negates the shortcomings of each model accurately models both free stream and boundary layer regions and offers improved prediction of flow separation and adverse pressure gradients sst has been shown to resolve turbulence within an acceptable margin of error for similar flow regimes mcsherry et al 2011 afgan et al 2013 marsh et al 2012 3 3 computational mesh the fluid domain was spatially discretized using ansys mesher unstructured tetrahedrals were used to accurately represent the turbine geometry the domain consisted of the rotating cylindrical domain encompassing the turbine and a larger stationary domain continuity across the interface between the two domains was achieved using the general grid interface ggi through ansys cfx to avoid spending a great deal of time in creating a refined mesh zone around the blade which allowed for a sharp trailing edge the decision to round the trailing edge was made it was shown that adjusting the trailing edge roundness diameter even to a completely sharp tip has a significant impact on the lift produced osbourne et al 2015 currie et al 2016 a sharp trailing edge allows higher lift force values than a rounded trailing edge but requires complex meshing especially in the inflation layer to be achieved the decision was made to reproduce the shape of the blade as closely as possible but without a sharp trailing edge all results presented in this paper incorporate a rounded trailing edge leading to a fully resolved inflation layer around the blade inflation layers were incorporated at the turbine and blade surfaces to better resolve the fluid boundary layer it was desired to numerically resolve the near wall flow with the low reynold s method rather than rely on wall functions a convenient parameter which helps define and ensure resolution of the boundary layer is the dimensionless wall distance y which is defined as 1 y δ y p υ τ w ρ where δ y p is the distance between the first and second grid points off the wall υ is the fluid s kinematic viscosity τ w is the wall shear stress and ρ is the fluid density all results presented in this paper used an inflated mesh with y 4 which is acceptable as y 11 indicates that the first node is within the laminar sublayer and the flow will be fully resolved without wall functions as per the ansys theory guide inc 2013 a detailed view of the turbine mesh is shown in fig 3 showing emphasis on mesh density for the rotor and turbine s blades with a close up of the blade root mesh showed on fig 4 a convergence study of the mesh around the turbine blades has been extensively performed for such geometries in previous work osbourne et al 2015 currie et al 2016 therefore the overall mesh around the turbine was selected directly from those previous study to ensure a resolution beyond the minimum necessary for mesh independence a wake convergence study performed at steady state was completed wherein a cylindrical body of influence was included in the wake of the turbine on which an average cell size could be specified four meshes were studied with varying local wake mesh size as shown in table 4 the first results of this mesh convergence study is that the mesh in the wake showed insignificant effects on the determined turbine power and thrust coefficients as seen in fig 5 this result is promising for researchers who are more interested in design optimization than wake physics as a relatively coarse wake mesh would suffice further results from this convergence study related to the impact on the wake will be discussed in section 5 3 4 numerical setup the boundary conditions for this numerical model are provided in table 5 the fluid domain as mentioned earlier also incorporates a rotating cylindrical mesh enveloping the turbine fig 2 two different approaches are used for the simulations and both have to do with the treatment of that rotating cylindrical mesh the quasi steady state simulations are using the frozen rotor approach in that case the reference frame around the turbine is made to rotate the fluid while the physical turbine does not move osbourne et al 2015 in the transient simulations the cylindrical domain is made to rotate and the simulation advances through time using a small timestep the turbine blades are changing position every timestep the rotational speed of the cylindrical domain or of the reference frame when using the frozen rotor approach is set to achieve a desired tip speed ratio tsr as defined by 2 t s r ω r v 0 where ω is the rotational speed of the turbine in rad s r is the turbine radius and v 0 is the nominal upstream velocity of 0 8 m s a no slip condition and wall velocity of 0 8 m s was added to the tank walls to eliminate the need to solve for boundary layer on these walls all simulations were performed using between 26 and 30 cores on a dell precisiont7810 16 cores 2 4 ghz hyper threaded with 128 gb of ram 4 experimental comparison power and thrust coefficients were used for comparison with the experimental results mycek et al 2014a these parameters are described as follows 3 c t t 1 2 ρ a v 0 2 4 c p p 1 2 ρ a v 0 3 ω q 1 2 ρ a v 0 3 where t and p are the thrust and mechanical power produced respectively ρ is the fluid density a is the rotor swept area and q is the rotor torque it should be noted that results from the experiments were not corrected for blockage so neither were the numerical results fig 6 a and b show experimental numerical comparisons of c p and c t respectively from the experiment and simulations performed in that case using an inlet velocity v 0 1 m s both results follow similar trends in the tsr range of 3 7 centred on the optimum tsr of 5 5 5 the predicted c p curve has an average relative difference of 8 with an average absolute difference of 0 032 below experimental values starting from the fact that experimental measurements do have an uncertainty which was not directly presented in mycek et al 2014a but from other work can be in the range of 1 5 7 doman et al 2015 and that values of c p are known to be sensitive to small deviations in the actual geometry of the system modelled rounding of the trailing edge of the blades imperfect representation of the hub geometry etc this slight under prediction of the c p values numerically is acceptable and in line with numerous other numerical study results in term of order of magnitude and deviation to experimental data it is therefore considered that the results are representative and validated when it comes to c p the predicted c t curve has an average relative difference of only 1 7 and an average absolute difference of 0 0013 the tsr value related to the highest value of c t is in the same range between experimental and numerical simulations tsrmax 5 to 6 these results are considered acceptable considering the unknown experimental uncertainty 5 results and discussions a three bladed hatt has been successfully modelled using ansys cfx for an inlet velocity v 0 0 8 m s a maximum value of c p was found to be 0 403 at tsr 4 5 while experimental peak is 0 42 at tsr 4 5 likewise a maximum value of c t was found to be 0 862 at tsr 6 while experimental peak is 0 833 at tsr 5 and 6 results of a wake mesh convergence study are provided and discussed in section 5 1 while wake physics results for both tested numerical approaches are similarly discussed in section 5 2 5 1 wake mesh convergence study a wake mesh convergence study was completed as described in section 3 using the quasi steady state approach mid plane cross sections and rear views of meshes 1 3 and 4 are shown in fig 7 illustrating the method of local mesh refinement a discussion on the impact of wake mesh sizing on power and thrust coefficients was presented earlier it was found that wake mesh size had minimal impact on these parameters velocity deficit and turbulence intensity were chosen as additional metrics to determine further impacts of mesh sizing these are described as follows 5 v d e f i c i t 1 v w v 0 6 t i 100 v 0 2 3 k where v w is the local wake velocity and v 0 is the inlet velocity in this study v 0 remains constant for the duration of the simulation even in the transient simulations the tsr is fixed to 3 67 and the inlet turbulence intensity is i 3 unless specified otherwise local values of velocity deficit and turbulence intensity were sampled at horizontal and vertical mid plane lines from 3d to 10d downstream of the turbine fig 8 a and b and c show velocity deficit along horizontal sample lines at 3d 6d and 10d downstream of the turbine for the tsr 3 67 simulation tsr value used in the experiments by the ifremer s group mycek et al 2014a 10d away from the turbine the wake velocity deficit is still significant even for the finest mesh mesh 4 meshes 1 and 2 the two coarsest meshes demonstrate the necessity of mesh convergence studies overestimating the velocity deficit and not capturing local phenomena velocity deficit begins to converge as mesh density is increased in the wake region meshes 3 and 4 finer meshes converge to the same solution for velocity deficit also showing a faster wake recovery fig 8d e and f show velocity deficit at vertical sample lines at the same distance behind the turbine for the same tsr fluctuations are much more sporadic in the vertical direction due to flow interaction with the nacelle support structure the three finest meshes tend to capture these fluctuations fairly well again converging for meshes 3 and 4 a local peak in velocity deficit particularly pronounced at 3d at the y d position of 0 5 is also observed in the vertical direction this location corresponding with the blade tip pointing straight down during the steady state frozen rotor simulations similarly fig 9 a and b and c and fig 9d e and f provide horizontal and vertical turbulence intensities respectively at 3d 6d and 10d behind the turbine again for a tsr 3 67 the symmetry in the horizontal direction that was observed for the velocity deficit is no longer observed in the turbulence intensity results this is attributed to a combination of swirl in the wake causes by the rotation of the fluid around the turbine as well as fluid interaction with the nacelle support structure the vertical samples of turbulence intensity display three distinct peaks the peaks located at y d 0 and 0 5 correspond to turbulence and vortex shedding at the blade root nacelle and blade tip of the turbine these two areas of abrupt planform change are commonly associated with vortex creation a corollary of this is an increase in turbine drag meshes 3 and 4 again converge on the calculated fluid turbulence intensity which is grossly underpredicted for the coarser mesh as can be seen in figs 8 and 9 the results obtained with meshes 3 and 4 vary only very slightly from one another as the number of elements is much smaller in mesh 3 than mesh 4 30 millions against 45 millions mesh 3 was considered a converged mesh and was chosen for subsequent studies all results provided henceforth use mech 3 5 2 steady state frozen rotor versus transient rotor in this section the results of simulations performed using the two different approaches mentioned earlier quasi steady state frozen rotor and transient are presented for both approaches near and far field wake propagation is investigated and discussed thus a comparison between the two approaches is made to garner meaningful information on which numerical methods should be preferred in wake studies since every variable is constantly changing over time during the transient simulations all following transient results were generated from a snapshot made after 80 s of simulation a period long enough to ensure that the wake had time to fully reach the 20d outlet and become fully establish fig 10 shows how the power coefficient c p compares between a quasi steady state frozen rotor simulation and the transient rotor one ultimately once the flow is established the predicted values are about the same 0 366 from frozen rotor versus an average of 0 367 for the transient study this is the level of agreement obtained between the two approaches when it comes to c p and c t and both are slightly underpredicting the experimental value of c p and c t as discussed in section 4 and presented in fig 6 fig 10 also shows that it does take a few seconds at start up to get the turbine and flow to reach an establish regime fig 11 shows the normalized velocity v v 0 in the wake of the turbine for tsr 3 67 in both cases the oscillating wake from the support structure is evident at the top velocity deficits are also notable from both blade tips and blade roots nacelle for the simulation performed using the frozen rotor approach fig 11a there is a separation in the wake occurring at roughly 3d after the turbine this could be caused by the rotating flow leaving the tip of the downward facing blades remembering that in the frozen rotor approach the turbine blades do not spin during the simulation therefore the downward facing blades are always at the same position which could lead to a permanent wake feature like what is observed in the near wake the velocity deficit in the wake recovers fasters in the frozen rotor simulation compare to the transient one fig 11b at a distance 10d behind the turbine halfway from the turbine to the outlet in fig 11 the normalized velocity for the transient case is still low v v 0 0 55 while it is greatly recovered in the frozen rotor simulation v v 0 0 80 the overall shape of the wake is also dissimilar apart from the wake separation at 3d mentioned earlier the far wake is seen to oscillate in the transient results following the rotation of the blades small velocity ripples emerge at a distance of 10d and continue downstream from the turbine still the overall height and width of the wakes fig 12 shows the wakes view from the top are very similar for both approach being approximately the size of the turbine blade diameter at first and slowly expending radially further from it fig 13 presents the turbulence intensity ti in the wake of the turbine for tsr 3 67 much larger differences are observed in the strength of ti and the shape of it in the wake compared to the velocity deficit again ripples are observed in the transient case fig 13b the regions of strongest ti are also different for both approach the frozen rotor ti reaching a maximum before 10d and forming two zones just above and below the rotational axis of the turbine or left and right of it as seen in fig 14 for the transient simulations the strongest ti is found inside the rotating wake and the ripples that appear finally the near field wake ti is greatly different between the two approaches similar to the velocity deficit turbulence intensity is higher in the transient case than the steady one especially in the mid and far wake by comparing these figures it is clear that choosing the frozen rotor or the transient rotor approach will lead to different results and conclusions on the behaviour of the wake fig 15 presents velocity deficit plots in both the horizontal and vertical planes at four different distances in the wake of the turbine 3d 10d 15d and 20d the shape and amplitude of the velocity deficit are similar in both approaches at distance of 10d and beyond with the quasi steady state frozen rotor result always resulting in smaller deficit the main difference being at 3d especially in the vertical direction where as discussed before the impact of the fixed blade using in this approach are clearly leading to rapid spatial changes in velocity deficit at x d 0 5 the larger difference between both approaches is seen in fig 16 which shows turbulence intensity plots in both the horizontal and vertical planes at four different distances in the wake of the turbine 3d 10d 15d and 20d the distribution of the turbulence intensity within both planes is difference between both approaches for the first 10d behind the turbine after that the transient approach leads to larger turbulence intensity of approximately 4 in the flow the width of the turbulence intensity wake also increases constantly this being captured by both approaches the clearest difference between the nature of the flow in the wake of a turbine as predicted by both approaches can be seen in figs 17 and 18 these figures show respectively normalized velocity and vorticity contour plots at a distance 1d and 5d downstream from the turbine and these plots vary considerably depending on the approach chosen the shape of the velocity and vorticity contour plots are clearly different for the transient simulation the wake is cylindrical as expected from a rotating device however the shape of the three bladed device can easily be seen in the wake from the steady frozen rotor simulation this three bladed shape remains even 5d behind the turbine with very little mixing with the rest of the fluid in simulations where a wake was generated from a front turbine to determine the behaviour of a second turbine behind in the flow this large difference in the nature of the predicted wake would inevitably impact the predicted performance obtained finally it can also be seen from fig 18 that the steady simulation overestimates the vorticity and therefore eddy generation of the blades results at 1d compared to the transient simulation where vorticity and eddies are mixed behind the turbine from the continuous rotation of the blades 5 3 inlet turbulence intensity effect fig 19 shows the comparison in velocity deficit and turbulence intensity in the horizontal plane and in the wake up to a distance of 10d behind the turbine for two inlet turbulence intensity i 3 and 15 as expected the turbulence intensity in the wake is smaller in the case of i 3 although around the x d 0 position the turbulence intensity reach similar values the amount of ti for i 3 exceeding the i 15 amount at 4d it is hard to tell how much of this is due to the actual flow physics or simply numerical artifacts of the numerical scheme used in ansys cfx since it is known that ti will often rapidly numerically decay in cfd codes the velocity deficit plot shows a slightly faster wake recovery for the lower level of inlet turbulence intensity which is physically expected 5 4 validation of transient rotor wake results it is possible to compare the velocity deficit obtained using both numerical methods to experimental results the ifremer research group did characterize the velocity in the wake of their turbine during testing mycek et al 2014a there measurements in the form of normalized velocity are compared to the numerical predictions under the same conditions of v 0 0 8 m s i 3 and tsr 3 67 and on four horizontal lines behind the turbine at position 2d 3d 6d and 10d in fig 20 the shape of the wake obtained numerically with both methods is representative of the one measured experimentally with the numerical models both predicting a width of the wake to only extend to approximately 0 5 d above and below the rotor hub however both numerical methods are predicting a greater velocity deficit directly behind the nacelle the experiment led to velocity deficits varying from nearly 60 at 2d to 30 at 10d for the numerical methods the transient study predicts a deficit in velocity of 80 at 2d decreasing to 50 at 10d while for the quasi steady frozen rotor approach it varies from 80 to 30 this interesting result can be interpreted in a few different ways at this point as mentioned previously the wake recovers more rapidly in the quasi steady approach which leads the quasi steady results to fall within the experimental error at both 6d and 10d this could point to the quasi steady approach predicting the right range of velocities in the wake for distance larger than 6d however the velocity deficit change for the quasi steady results goes from 80 to 30 between 2d and 10d an overall change in the extent of the velocity deficit of 50 over that distance both the transient numerical results and the experiment experience a 30 change in the extend of the velocity deficit over the same distance although the transient numerical results overpredicts the size of the velocity deficit by approximately 20 at each section therefore a second interpretation is that the transient numerical results are predicting the appropriate recovery rate of the wake although in this simulation over predicting the actual local deficit the overprediction could be the result of limitations of the rans sst method in the near wake close to the nacelle the meshing and wall treatment around that nacelle or simply variations in the modelled geometry of the nacelle that was as mentioned earlier created in a simplified way from information and photographs found in the work of the ifremer researchers ultimately looking at the complete picture the agreement between both numerical methods and the experimental result is good while still pointing at numerical issues that need to be addressed further 6 conclusion a numerical cfd study was performed comparing the results obtained from a quasi steady state frozen rotor approach to a transient rotor one when simulating the flow over a three bladed horizontal axis tidal turbine and in the resulting wake the turbine used was the one tested at the ifremer research laboratory the numerical results from this study were compared to the experimental measurements from ifremer where good agreement were obtained both in terms of predicted c p and c t and velocity in the wake the comparison between steady state and transient numerical approaches showed that the velocity deficit is more important for transient simulations in the far wake 10d and more the wake is also slightly wider in the transient simulation the largest difference between the two approaches is in the resulting turbulence intensity in the wake with zones of highest density appearing in different area in each one this comparative analysis of numerical steady state and transient simulations and both compared to experimental measurements shows the impact of the numerical approach selection the predicted performance of the turbine c p and c t is quickly and fairly accurately determined using either numerical methods the quasi steady state approach being numerically less expensive it can be applied rapidly to determine these two general turbine performance indicators however the wake obtained from both method is different first in a qualitative way with the transient study simulating the full rotation of the turbine as well as accounting for the transient nature of the flow in the wake leads to wake behaviour that appear more physical oscillation in the wake in line with the turbine rotational speed distribution of the turbulence intensity that differs greatly from the quasi steady state approach and distribution of flow and velocity in planes behind the turbine showing the mixing expected of rotating blades this proper wake behaviour will become more and more important in future fine scale studies of turbine arrays still the numerical prediction of the quantitative velocity deficit does not perfectly match the experimental measurements with the quasi steady state method providing results in line with the experiment only for distances greater than 6d behind the turbine and the transient method showing the right range of wake recovery while overpredicting the local velocity deficit it therefore appears that the transient method can provide a more physically meaningful wake behaviour although prediction problem of the velocity deficit amplitude still needs to be looked at furthermore for any type of studies that will look at the transient impact of velocity change on a turbine and in the wake the transient method will be the only one that can be employed to that effect the authors will as a next step employ this transient modelling to look at the impact transient and turbulent inlet conditions with velocities representative of a tidal site have on the loading of turbine blades the instantaneous power and thrust

intentional events islam and yazdani 2008 williams and williamson 2011 mobaraki and vaghefi 2015 koneshwaran et al 2015 haciefendioglu et al 2015 wang et al 2014a zhang et al 2017 hacıefendioğlu and koç 2016 yang et al 2017 de et al 2017 blast loading has the natures of extremely short duration but high intensity resulting in the dynamic response of structures is more complex than that caused by the seismic or any other static loadings hence the analysis and design of structures against static and low rate dynamic loads cannot be directly applied onto the design of structures subjected to blast loads hao et al 2016 reinforced concrete rc columns are the most common components used in civil and military engineering structures such as a bridge subway station and overpass rc columns are very vulnerable structural components and their failure may lead to progressive collapse in framed structures common types of columns are circle square and rectangle and those columns may be located in different environments most of them are exposed in the air and under the threat of air blast loads some columns are located in the water such as bridge columns may be subjected to underwater explosions moreover the detonate modes may be contact or non contact explosions hence it is necessary to investigate the effect of the cross section shape on the response of columns induced by various blast scenarios understanding the mechanical mechanism of rc columns with different sectional shapes to various blast loads is crucial for the design of structures and options for enhancing blast protection at present most of the achievements of rc structures under blast loads are concentrated on air explosions yuan et al 2017 used two 1 3 scale rc bridge columns with circular and square cross sections to investigate the damage profiles and structural response of the two columns under air contact explosion the results showed that the square column experienced larger blast loads and generated more severe damage li et al 2016 carried out a series of experiments on concrete slabs to observe the crater and spall damage under blast loadings empirical methods were proposed to predict concrete spallation and the fragments size distribution zhang et al 2017 studied the blast resistance of ultra high performance concrete filled double skin tubes cfdst subjected to close range blast loading the results showed that the cfdst column was able to withstand a large blast load without failure li and hao 2014 investigated the spall damage of rc columns under blast loads based on three dimensional numerical models empirical relations considering different explosion scenarios column dimensions and reinforcement were proposed to predict concrete spall damage although most of the above studies have focused their attention on the response of concrete columns slabs subjected to contact or non contact blast loading limited investigation exists on the effects of cross section shape on the behavior of concrete columns in different explosive environments such as air and underwater explosions especially for underwater explosion most of the research achievements are focused on ship engineering few investigation concentrates on the rc structures ming et al 2016 investigated the damage process of ship structures subjected to underwater contact explosions based on sph fem coupling method there were obvious three stages in the damage process for the plate structure namely localized bulging discing and petaling hsiao et al hsiao and chahine 2015 applied numerical approach to simulate the dynamic response of a composite propeller blade subjected to shock and bubble pressure loading caused by underwater explosions gauch et al 2018 studied the response of composite cylinders with polyurea coatings to near field underwater explosive loading through experiments and computational simulations the results showed that the application of a polyurea coating was effective for reducing damage in the cylinders ge et al song et al 2017 studied the similarity relation between model and prototype based on centrifugal similarity criteria and it was proved that underwater explosion shock wave and bubble pulsation were in accordance with the centrifugal similarity wang et al 2014b experimentally and numerically investigated the failure mechanism of ship structure under the combined effect of shock wave loads and bubble pulsations induced by close in non contact underwater explosions zhao et al 2018 employed fem sph method to investigate the damage features of rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions this study aims to investigate the effects of the cross section shape on the response of rc columns subjected to various blast scenarios a fully coupled numerical approach which combined lagrange and euler methods is adopted to allow for the incorporation of the essential processes such as the explosion shock wave propagation multiple reflections structure fluid interaction and structural response the accuracies of the numerical method are verified by comparing the experimental and numerical results based on the calibrated numerical model the objectives of the current research are as follows a to investigate the effects of section shape on the blast resistance of the rc column subjected to contact and close in air explosions b to study the anti knock performance of the rc column with different cross section shapes subjected to contact and close in underwater explosions c to compare the nonlinear dynamic response behavior and damage mechanism of the rc column subjected to contact and close in blast loads in different propagation mediums d to discuss the improvement effects of the reinforcement ratio and ultra high performance concrete on the blast resistance of the underwater rc column 2 description of the coupled model 2 1 material model 2 1 1 concrete the response of the concrete material under impact or blast loading is a complex non linear and rate dependent process bischoff and perry 1991 markel et al 1998 schuler et al 2006 at high strain rates the compressive strength of the concrete can significantly increase by more than 100 and in excess of 600 for tensile strength malvar 1998 in 1993 holmquist et al holomquist et al 1993 constructed a brittle damage model named hjc for concrete material under extreme loadings based on the hjc model riedel et al 1999 proposed the rht model this model which can reflect the characteristics of the concrete material behavior at a high strain rate is particularly useful for modeling the dynamic behavior of brittle materials such as concrete and rock under dynamic loading codina et al 2016 2017 wang et al 2013 the rht model consists

approach a coupled method cle benson 1992 veen 2003 which combines the advantages of lagrangian and eulerian algorithms can effectively model some problems involving fluid structure interaction and large deformation this coupling is realized based on a special algorithm the lagrangian grids can invade into the eulerian elements eulerian elements can impose pressure on the lagrangian surfaces causing deformation of the solid medium in other words the lagrangian elements provide displacement boundary conditions geometric constraints to eulerian algorithm and eulerian material exerts pressure boundary conditions on the lagrangian grids as shown in fig 1 the discretized differential equation for the structure can be described as 13 m x c x k x f t where x is the structural displacement vector x and x are structural velocity and acceleration respectively m c and k are the structural mass damping and stiffness matrix respectively f t is the time varying load applied to the structure 14 f t ga f p i p s where p i and p s are the incident pressure and scatted pressure respectively g is the matrix relating the structural degrees of freedom to the fluid a f is the matrix containing the areas of the elements in the fluid mesh the pressure boundary conditions each lagrangian boundary element is treated as an independent segment and divided into a set of subsegments each subsegment is defined as the portion of the segment that divides an eulerian grid the force applied by the fluid to a lagrangian segment is the stress acting at the subsegment centroid times the area of the subsegment 15 f i seg n l σ l j k n j a n i k the force is shared by two lagrangian nodes 16 f a i 1 2 n l σ l j k n j a n i k n α x k where k marks the kth element a k is the area of the kth subsegment n is the normal of the boundary segment the displacement boundary conditions the velocities of the lagrangian elements are equal to that of eulerian grids on the fluid structure interaction surface first the calculation of edge velocities is managed then the volume of the fluid is obtained by subtracting the solid volume from the eulerian element after the quantities are determined the stress and pressure are updated the velocities of the lagrangian and eulerian grids away from the interface are calculated in the normal way 2 3 erosion algorithm the lagrange technique has the advantage of reducing computational cost and can correctly describe the material interfaces however when the materials undergo large deformations or high velocity distorts the calculation time steps will become small and computational efficiency will decrease which thus causes the interruption of the calculation or incorrect results in order to improve the computational efficiency the erosion algorithm based on plastic or geometric strain is introduced when the dynamic response of a cell reaches the given criterion the distorted cells will be automatically erased from the model the erosion algorithm must be selected cautiously large erosion criteria may lead to excessive element distortion and computational overflow while low defined criteria may not maintain the conservation of mass and energy and the numerical results are no longer reliable li and hao 2014 the erosion algorithm has been widely applied in simulating the dynamic response of concrete structures subjected to impact or blast loading kamal and eltehewy 2012 prakash et al 2015 xu and lu 2006 li et al 2017 hao and tang 2010 kamal et al kamal and eltehewy 2012 and prakash et al 2015 used an erosion criterion based on the geometric strain to simulate successfully the damage characteristics of concrete targets under high velocity impact loads other researchers xu and lu 2006 li et al 2017 hao and tang 2010 used an erosion criterion based on the principle strain to describe the behavior of concrete structures subjected to blast loads in the present study intensive simulations are performed with different erosion criteria it is found that using geometric strain of 0 5 codina et al 2016 as the erosion criterion which leads to reliable predictions of rc column responses 3 numerical model calibration 3 1 experimental setup a field blast test performed by yuan et al 2017 on a square rc column is used to calibrate the present numerical model the blast loads are generated from a 1 0 kg tnt explosive the dynamic response and damage profiles of the rc column induced by the contact blast loads are reproduced the results are compared with those recorded in the experiment to verify the present numerical method the calibrated model will be used to analyze the response of the rc column under various blasting scenarios fig 2 gives the details of geometry and cross section of the square rc column the rc column top was fixed by a steel hoop and the foundation of the column was inserted into the ground a 1 kg tnt charge was placed on the front surface of specimen the distance between the charge center and the ground surface was 330 mm the rc column specimen had a cross sectional dimension of 400 400 mm and a clear height of 3700 mm the reinforcements within the specimen were constructed using 12 mm diameter longitudinal rebar and 8 mm diameter stirrup rebar the reinforcement layout and section details of the test specimen are shown in fig 2 b the thickness of the concrete cover was 30 mm the average cubic compressive strength was 38 5 mpa longitudinal reinforcement made of ribbed steel bars hrb400 had the yield strength of 400 mpa plain roller steel bars hpb300 with the yield strength of 300 mpa were used as stirrups both the longitudinal and stirrup rebar had the elastic modulus of 200 gpa an accelerometer was installed on the back surface of the rc column as shown in fig 2 b the distance between the accelerometer and the ground surface was 1750 mm more detailed information about the blast test can be found in the reference yuan et al 2017 3 2 finite element model construction different from the ref yuan et al 2017 the cle method is employed in this paper instead of the ale method unlike the ale method the cel method don t need to match the lagrangian structural element mesh to the eulerian fluid grids which means that the eulerian and lagrangian elements don t need to share common faces and nodes it is very convenient for researchers to establish the complicated numerical model numerical model of the contact explosion test based on the cle algorithm is shown in fig 2 c the dimensions of the air domain are 1 m 1 m 4 m and the dimensions of the foundation are 1 m 1 m 0 5 m in the simulation both the ground and concrete column are modeled with lagrange elements the reinforcement bar is described by beam elements while the euler method is used to model the tnt charge and air to obtain accurate simulation results with high efficiency different mesh sizes for the concrete column are used a fine mesh size of 10 mm is employed for the concrete near the tnt charge i e 0 1 m above the ground surface the remaining part of the specimen has a coarse mesh size of 20 mm in the z direction as shown in fig 2 d both the element sizes of the air and the reinforcement bars are 20 mm the numerical model consists of 480 000 lagrange elements 500 000 euler elements and 6500 beam elements two target points are installed on the back surface of the column to monitor the dynamic response of the structure under blast loads meanwhile a cross section 1 1 is arranged to observe the damage evolution of interior concrete the arrangement of the target points and cross section can be found in fig 2 b outflow boundaries are applied on the side and top surfaces of the euler domain in order to decrease the stress wave reflection at these computational boundaries meanwhile the transmission boundaries are applied on the profile and bottom surfaces of the ground to allow for free passage of shock stress waves the bottom surface of the ground and the column top are considered as fixed in all directions in this numerical simulation a fully coupled approach combining the lagrange and euler methods is adopted to simulate the interaction between the column air and explosion the positions of steel bar nodes coincide with those of concrete nodes nodes of the steel layers are attached to the concrete nodes one to one at the intersections preventing the two materials from sliding as shown in fig 2 d 3 3 mesh sensitivity employing appropriate mesh size is critical for accurate simulation results hence a mesh convergence study was performed to determine the cell size in the numerical model three models with different element sizes namely mesh i mesh ii and mesh ⅲ are built for mesh i a fine mesh size of 10 mm is employed for the concrete 0 1 m above the ground surface the remaining part of the specimen has a coarse mesh size of 20 mm in the z direction for mesh ii the fine and coarse mesh sizes are 15 and 30 mm respectively for mesh ⅲ the fine and coarse mesh sizes are 20 and 30 mm respectively fig 3 shows the influence of the mesh density on the displacement time histories at the target 1 the charge weight is 1 0 kg and the explosive distance is 12 cm with the decrease of the mesh size the maximum displacement of the column at target 1 declines slightly the trends of the curves with different mesh sizes are very similar further reduction of the mesh size may result in a more precise numerical result but will substantially increase the computational time and will cause computer memory overflows hence it is feasible to adopt the coupled model with the aforementioned mesh sizes 3 4 model calibration and discussion fig 4 shows the damaged patterns of the rc column obtained from the cle model the severe damage of the specimen around the charge is apparent the cover concrete on the front surface is completely destroyed due to extremely high compressive blast loads as displayed in fig 4 a the length of the major damage zone on the front surface is about 60 cm meanwhile severely damaged region generated on the side surfaces of the column can be observed clearly some concrete spalled at the corners of the square column above the major damage region fig 4 a d this kind of extensive concrete damage is primarily caused by stress concentration at the corners of the square column in addition several cracks can be observed clearly on the back surface while there is no spalling generated as shown in fig 4 d the experimental results are shown in fig 5 comparison of figs 4 and 5 shows that the presented cle model successfully predicts the damage patterns of the rc column the length of the major damage zone on the front surface obtained from the cle method is very close to that measured in the experimental test the calculated lengths of the damage area at the corners are slightly smaller than the average value of the test result generally it can be concluded that the damage profiles predicted by the present cle model give a good agreement with the experimental results fig 6 shows the results of the rc column specimen obtained from the ale method yuan et al 2017 it can be found that the damage areas fringe levels 2 of the column are evidently larger than those observed in the real member besides severe concrete spalling can be observed on the back surface fig 6 d while during the test there was only small concrete spalling on the back surface fig 5 d comparing the numerical results obtained from the cle and ale methods it can be concluded that the cle method give a more reasonable agreement with the observations of the blast test fig 7 shows the acceleration versus time plots obtained from the cle method and those from the experimental test it can be found that the global variation trends of the numerical acceleration time curves agree with the experiment results well except some discrepancies the peak values of the acceleration from the experimental test and numerical simulation are 30 000 and 33 000 m s2 respectively both the analytical damage patterns and acceleration time curves show favorable agreement with those from the field test indicating that the presented cle method can effectively predict the dynamic response of rc structures under blast loads 4 effect of column section shape to air explosion in order to investigate the effect of cross section shape on the response of the rc column subjected to various blast loads square and circular cross sections are taken as research objects the dimensions of the square column are shown in fig 2 the distance between the ground surface and the charge center is also 330 mm the inertia moment of the square column is 0 0021 m4 and the reinforcement ratio is 0 85 the detailed geometry of the circular column is shown in fig 8 the clear height of the circular column is 3700 mm and the diameter is 400 mm the distance between the charge center and the ground surface is also 330 mm the arrangement of reinforcement is shown in fig 8 b the properties of the concrete and the rebar in the circular column are same as those in the square column the inertia moment of the circular column is 0 0013 m4 and the reinforcement ratio is 0 9 because of the larger sectional area of the square column the consumption of the concrete and reinforcing steel bar in square column is also larger than those in the circular column the weight of the tnt charge is 1 0 kg the finite element model of the circular rc column is shown in fig 8 c a fine mesh size of 10 mm is employed for the concrete near the tnt charge i e 0 1 m above the ground surface the remaining part of the specimen has a coarse mesh size of 20 mm in the z direction the dimensions of the air domain and the foundation are consistent with those of the square column the boundary conditions are same as that described in section 3 4 1 effect of column section shape to air contact explosion to better understand the damage mechanism of the rc column with different cross sections to air blast loads the stress wave propagation within the cross section 1 1 is captured fig 9 a presents a series of pressure contours as time progresses in the square rc column where the shock wave propagation immediately after detonation of the explosives spherical shock waves radiate out from the charge location under the fierce shock waves the concrete around the tnt charge is firstly crushed the remaining blast energy continues propagating in the form of compressive waves upon impinging with the side surfaces only a very small distance is travelled and almost no wave divergence occurs the compressive waves reflect into tensile waves and interact with upcoming compressive waves the resultant tensile stress is easily larger than the dynamic tensile strength of concrete fig 9 a t 0 08 ms at t 0 11 ms the compressive waves impact on the back surface resulting in a tension stress zone on the back surface fig 9 b shows a series of pressure contours in the circular rc column the concrete near the tnt charge is also crushed because the magnitude of blast shock waves is considerably larger than the dynamic compressive strength of the concrete it can be seen that there is a big difference of the stress wave propagation in the rc column with different cross section shapes the geometric properties of the square section easily lead to the stress superposition at the corners under the cooperative effect of the incident waves and reflections while the stress superposition phenomenon is mitigated within the circular column a series of target points are arranged in the air domain to monitor the pressure time history as shown in fig 10 a the pressure time curves are displayed in fig 10 b d from fig 10 b it can be seen that more shock waves are reflected on the front face of the square column which can cause more severe impact on the front face of the square column meanwhile more shock waves diffract along the surface of the circular column as shown in fig 10 c and d although the diffraction processes of the waves are observed clearly the influence of the diffraction effect on the damage profiles of the column is quite limited because the pressure of the diffraction waves is significantly smaller compared to the pressure propagated in the column and the arrival time of the blast waves on the side and back surfaces is far behind the stress waves transmitted within the column fig 11 a and b present the damage profiles of the square and circular columns under air contact explosion respectively it can be noticed that both the square and circular columns suffer extensive compressive failure on the front surface severe concrete damage is also observed on the side surfaces several cracks induced by the subsequent flexural response of the columns can be found on the back surface there is no obvious concrete spalling on the back surfaces while previous research results on concrete slabs show more prominent distal surface damage li et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 one possible reason for such deviation is the different geometric characteristics of the structures the ratio of thickness to width of the column is much larger than that of the slab structure causing the propagation of stress waves in the column affects by the two free flanks extensive concrete failure on the front and side surfaces consume a large proportion of the blast energy and concrete on the rear surface which corresponds to the longest travel distance for the blast waves therefore suffers lower tensile failure however the propagation of the stress waves in the slab structure is almost not affected by the flanks and the depletion of compressive waves along the direction of the thickness is negligible due to the short propagation distance the magnitude of the reflected waves is easily larger than the dynamic tensile strength of the concrete resulting in the rear surface of the slab suffers more tensile failure from fig 11 a and b it can be seen that the square column experiences more damage than the circular column the overall damage height of the front surface is 60 cm slightly larger than the circular column of 55 cm both the damage degrees of the front and back surfaces in the circular column are milder than those in the square column fig 12 shows the maximum x displacement of the column along z direction with different cross sections under the air contact explosion it can be seen that the circular column experiences smaller deformation the maximum displacements of the column with square and circular cross sections are 16 and 11 5 mm respectively the maximum deformation of the column with circular cross section drops by 30 it can be concluded that employing circular cross section can not only reduce the consumption of concrete and steel bar but also improve the anti knock performance of column structures to air contact explosion 4 2 effect of column section shape to air close in explosion the analysis results in section 4 1 demonstrate that employing circular section can improve the blast resistance of the column however both the square and circular columns are disrupted severely under the contact explosion of 1 kg tnt hence further investigations are conducted to explore the effect of the section shape on the response of the column subjected to air non contact explosion considering the distance between the column surface and packaging housing is 10 15 cm the explosion distance is selected as 12 cm fig 13 presents the damage profiles of the column with different cross sections under air close in explosion of 1 0 kg tnt charge when the distances between the front surface and the tnt charge increase from 0 to 12 cm the magnitude of the compressive stress acting on the column decreases sharply there is almost no concrete cover spalling from the surfaces of the column under the close in explosion only local damage region generated it can also be found that the anti knock performance of the circular column is stronger than that of the square column the damage degrees of the concrete around the tnt charge in the circular column are milder than those in the square column more cracks can be found in the square column fig 14 shows the displacement time curves of the column at target 1 under the air close in explosion the trends of the displacement time histories of the square column are similar with those of the circular column the maximum displacements of the column at target 1 with square and circular cross sections are 2 6 and 1 1 mm respectively table 2 presents the maximum displacements of the column with different cross sections at target 1 under air contact and close in explosion it can be concluded that the anti knock performance of the circular column is stronger than that of square column no matter subjected to air contact or close in explosions meanwhile it can be found that the explosion distance has a significant impact on the response of the column although the alteration of the distance is inconspicuous the maximum displacement of the column at target 1 with the explosion distance of 12 cm drops by 80 90 compared with the contact explosion the damage degrees of the rc column under air contact explosion fig 11 are significantly larger than those under air closed in explosion fig 13 hence some protective measures such as protecting crust can be installed on the surface of the column to improve its blast resistance 5 effect of column section shape to underwater explosion as we known some columns are exposed to the air but some are located in the water such as bridge pier the analysis results presented in section 4 demonstrate that employing the circular cross section can improve the anti knock performance of the column to air blast loading hence it is very necessary to investigate the effect of section shape on the dynamic response of the rc columns subjected to underwater explosion underwater explosion can cause significantly more damage to the structures than the same amount of explosive in air wang et al 2014a zhao et al 2018 therefore the weight of tnt charge is selected as 0 1 kg the water depth is 2 0 m and the distance between the charge center and the ground surface is also 330 mm as shown in fig 15 the boundary conditions are same as that described in section 3 there are two main loads in underwater explosions namely shock waves and bubbles however when the structures subjected to contact or close in underwater explosions the development of the bubble is restricted by the structures this is because the distance between the structures and the explosives is smaller than the maximum diameter of the bubble in this paper the effects of the shock waves and detonation products on the rc column are considered based on the fully coupled lagrange euler method 5 1 effect of column section shape to underwater contact explosion fig 16 a and b present the propagation processes of the shock waves induced by the underwater contact explosion of 0 1 kg tnt immediately after detonation of the explosives spherical shock waves radiate out from the charge location under the fierce shock waves the concrete around the tnt charge is crushed with the time goes the wave front propagates from the front surface to the interior of the rc column because the propagation speed of the shock waves in the water is much faster than that in the air the arrival time of the blast waves on the side and back surfaces is just a little behind the stress waves transmitted within the column unlike the shock waves transmitted into the air the pressure of the diffraction waves in the water cannot be neglected compared to the pressure propagated into the column on the surfaces of the column the shock waves transmitted within the concrete and water will superimpose causing the concrete damaged severely meanwhile due to the effect of the detonation products the front surface of the column is in the compression status for a long time the pressure time histories at different monitoring points in the water domain are shown in fig 17 from fig 17 b it can be seen that much more shock waves are reflected on the front face of the square column due to the larger reflective surface which indicates the square column experiences much more blast loads fig 17 c shows that more shock waves diffract along the surface of the circular column the pressure time plots at target 4 have several peaks a possible reason for such results is the multiple reflections and diffractions it is interesting that both the pressure time histories at target 5 have two obvious crests as shown in fig 17 d the first peak is caused by the transmitted waves propagated in the column fig 16 t 0 25 ms the other is induced by the diffracted waves propagated in the water fig 16 t 0 40 ms the peak values of the transmitted waves from the square and circular columns are 5 4 and 4 6 mpa respectively the peak values of the diffracted waves from the square and circular columns are 3 2 and 5 0 mpa respectively fig 18 shows the final damage profiles of the column with square and circular cross sections caused by underwater contact explosion both the square and circular columns suffer serious damage the concrete around the tnt charge is destroyed severely under the effect of the shock waves and detonation products in addition many cracks can be seen along the z direction the damage degree and fracture area of the concrete on the front surface of the circular column are evidently smaller than those in the square column moreover the back surface of the square column severed more damage than the circular column the maximum x displacement of the column with different cross sections along z direction is shown in fig 19 unlike the deformation induced by the air blast loads the maximum displacement caused by the underwater explosion occurs at a position of 0 8 m above the ground instead of the position of the explosive the deflection profile of the circular column is obviously smaller than the square column although the blasting scenarios are identical the maximum displacements of the column with square and circular cross sections are 32 and 20 mm respectively the maximum deformation of the column with circular cross section drops by 37 compared with the square column as expected when the column located in the water the circular cross section can also diffract more blast energy and improve the blast resistance of the column 5 2 effect of column section shape to underwater close in explosion further investigations are conducted to explore the influence of the cross section shape on the response of the column to underwater close in explosion the weight of tnt charge is 0 1 kg and the distance between the charge and the front surface is also set as 12 cm fig 20 shows the damage profiles of the rc column subjected to the underwater close in explosion both the square and circular columns are damaged seriously it is worth noting that the flanks of the column suffer more damage than that of the front face due to the effects of the reflected waves and diffracted waves moreover the concrete on the back surface is also damaged severely under the flexural response of the column the deformation of the column with different cross sections subjected to underwater close in explosion is shown in fig 21 the deformation of the circular column is very similar with that of the square column however the deflection of the circular column is also significantly smaller than the square column the maximum displacements of the column with square and circular cross sections are 26 and 15 mm respectively the deformation of the column with circular cross section drops by 42 table 3 presents the maximum displacements of the column with different section shapes at target 1 subjected to underwater contact and close in explosions it can be also concluded that the circular column experiences smaller blast loads and generates smaller deformation no matter subjected to underwater contact or non contact explosions the results presented in section 4 2 demonstrate that increasing a small distance between the charge and the structure can significantly improve the safety of the column to air blast loadings however increasing a small explosion distance cannot significantly improve the resistance of the rc column to underwater explosions the damage degrees of the rc column caused by underwater explosions cannot be decreased by increasing a small explosion distance as shown in figs 18 and 20 this is because that the compressibility of water is much smaller than the air and the shock wave attenuates more slowly in the water medium the blast energy cannot dissipate rapidly in the water 5 3 protective measures against underwater explosion the results from sections 5 1 and 5 2 show that increasing a little explosion distance cannot improve the blast resistance of structures to underwater blast loads hence some other reinforcement measures are employed to improve the blast resistance of the rc column to underwater blast loads common reinforcement measures are applying novel structures concrete filled double skin steel column concrete filled steel column bonding steel plate or carbon fiber sheet enhancing steel reinforcement using ultra high performance concrete material and so on in this paper the effects of longitudinal transverse reinforcement spacing and concrete strength on the response of the square rc columns subjected to underwater blast loads are investigated the basic features of the four column types are summarized as follows case a the rc column is same as that described in section 3 case b decreasing the transverse reinforcement spacing as shown in fig 22 a the compressive strength of the concrete is 38 5 mpa case c decreasing the longitudinal reinforcement spacing the reinforcement ratio is 1 4 as shown in fig 22 b the compressive strength of the concrete is 38 5 mpa case d employing ultra high performance concrete compressive strength is 140 mpa the parameters of the ultra high performance concrete can be found in ansys inc 2010 the rebar reinforcement details are shown in fig 22 c the same as that in section 3 the material parameters of reinforcing bars are the same as those presented in section 2 1 5 the diameters of the longitudinal and transverse rebar are 12 and 8 mm respectively the weight of tnt charge is 0 1 kg the water depth is 2 0 m and the distance between the charge center and the ground surface is also 330 mm the boundary conditions are consistent with those described in section 3 fig 23 shows the displacement along height direction plots for the four column types subjected to underwater contact blast loading the deformation laws of the four column types are very similar decreasing the transverse or longitudinal reinforcement spacing can improve the blast resistance of the rc column the maximum deformations of the column in cases a b and c are 32 27 5 and 25 5 mm respectively the maximum displacement in cases b and c drops by 17 and 20 respectively when employing the ultra high performance concrete the blast resistance of the column can be improved significantly the maximum displacement of the column in case d is about 16 mm compared with the conventional column case a the maximum deformation drops by 50 the results show that increasing reinforcement can improve the blast resistance of structures employing the ultra high performance material can better enhance the resistance of the structure to underwater blast loads 6 conclusions this paper is aimed to investigate the cross section shape effects on the anti knock performance of rc columns under various explosions the reliabilities of the rc model subjected to blast loads are verified by comparing with the results of the field blast test the anti knock performance of the rc column with square and circular cross sections subjected to air contact and close in blast loads are investigated respectively besides the effect of the cross section shape on the structural response of the column subjected to underwater contact and close in explosions is discussed the effects of the longitudinal and transverse reinforcement spacing concrete strength on the blast resistance of the rc column subjected to underwater contact explosion are also explored the major conclusions drawn from the research presented in this paper are 1 the damage patterns of the rc column obtained from the numerical method match well with the experimental results which indicate that the presented cle model can predict effectively the dynamic response and damage propagation process of rc structures under blast loads 2 the cross section shape has a significant impact on the dynamic behavior of the rc column the diffraction of the shock waves on the curved surface resulting in the blast loads acting on the circular column is smaller than that on the square column employing circular cross section can not only reduce the consumption of concrete and steel bar but also improve the blast resistance of column structures hence it is recommended that the column structures such as bridge piers subway columns should adopt circular section 3 the diffraction wave effect induced by air explosion on the damage profiles of the column is quite limited because the pressure of the diffraction waves is significantly small and the arrival time of the diffraction waves on the side and back surfaces is far behind the stress waves transmitted in the column however the diffraction effect caused by underwater explosion on the response of the column cannot be neglected the shock waves transmitted within the column and water will superimpose causing the concrete damaged severely 4 some protective measures such as protecting crust can be installed on the surfaces of the structures to improve their safety subjected to air blast loads however such protective measure cannot be applied to improve the blast resistance of structures to underwater explosion other protective measures such as increasing the reinforcement ratio and using the ultra high performance concrete should be employed to enhance the blast resistance of underwater structures declarations of interest none acknowledgments the authors gratefully appreciate the supports from the major program of technological innovation of

section shape air explosion underwater explosion 1 introduction structural dynamic behavior induced by blast loads has drawn more and more attention in recent years due to the many accidental or intentional events islam and yazdani 2008 williams and williamson 2011 mobaraki and vaghefi 2015 koneshwaran et al 2015 haciefendioglu et al 2015 wang et al 2014a zhang et al 2017 hacıefendioğlu and koç 2016 yang et al 2017 de et al 2017 blast loading has the natures of extremely short duration but high intensity resulting in the dynamic response of structures is more complex than that caused by the seismic or any other static loadings hence the analysis and design of structures against static and low rate dynamic loads cannot be directly applied onto the design of structures subjected to blast loads hao et al 2016 reinforced concrete rc columns are the most common components used in civil and military engineering structures such as a bridge subway station and overpass rc columns are very vulnerable structural components and their failure may lead to progressive collapse in framed structures common types of columns are circle square and rectangle and those columns may be located in different environments most of them are exposed in the air and under the threat of air blast loads some columns are located in the water such as bridge columns may be subjected to underwater explosions moreover the detonate modes may be contact or non contact explosions hence it is necessary to investigate the effect of the cross section shape on the response of columns induced by various blast scenarios understanding the mechanical mechanism of rc columns with different sectional shapes to various blast loads is crucial for the design of structures and options for enhancing blast protection at present most of the achievements of rc structures under blast loads are concentrated on air explosions yuan et al 2017 used two 1 3 scale rc bridge columns with circular and square cross sections to investigate the damage profiles and structural response of the two columns under air contact explosion the results showed that the square column experienced larger blast loads and generated more severe damage li et al 2016 carried out a series of experiments on concrete slabs to observe the crater and spall damage under blast loadings empirical methods were proposed to predict concrete spallation and the fragments size distribution zhang et al 2017 studied the blast resistance of ultra high performance concrete filled double skin tubes cfdst subjected to close range blast loading the results showed that the cfdst column was able to withstand a large blast load without failure li and hao 2014 investigated the spall damage of rc columns under blast loads based on three dimensional numerical models empirical relations considering different explosion scenarios column dimensions and reinforcement were proposed to predict concrete spall damage although most of the above studies have focused their attention on the response of concrete columns slabs subjected to contact or non contact blast loading limited investigation exists on the effects of cross section shape on the behavior of concrete columns in different explosive environments such as air and underwater explosions especially for underwater explosion most of the research achievements are focused on ship engineering few investigation concentrates on the rc structures ming et al 2016 investigated the damage process of ship structures subjected to underwater contact explosions based on sph fem coupling method there were obvious three stages in the damage process for the plate structure namely localized bulging discing and petaling hsiao et al hsiao and chahine 2015 applied numerical approach to simulate the dynamic response of a composite propeller blade subjected to shock and bubble pressure loading caused by underwater explosions gauch et al 2018 studied the response of composite cylinders

reducing damage in the cylinders ge et al song et al 2017 studied the similarity relation between model and prototype based on centrifugal similarity criteria and it was proved that underwater explosion shock wave and bubble pulsation were in accordance with the centrifugal similarity wang et al 2014b experimentally and numerically investigated the failure mechanism of ship structure under the combined effect of shock wave loads and bubble pulsations induced by close in non contact underwater explosions zhao et al 2018 employed fem sph method to investigate the damage features of rc slabs subjected to air and underwater contact explosions this study aims to investigate the effects of the cross section shape on the response of rc columns subjected to various blast scenarios a fully coupled numerical approach which combined lagrange and euler methods is adopted to allow for the incorporation of the essential processes such as the explosion shock wave propagation multiple reflections structure fluid interaction and structural response the accuracies of the numerical method are verified by comparing the experimental and numerical results based on the calibrated numerical model the objectives of the current research are as follows a to investigate the effects of section shape on the blast resistance of the rc column subjected to contact and close in air explosions b to study the anti knock performance of the rc column with different cross section shapes subjected to contact and close in underwater explosions c to compare the nonlinear dynamic response behavior and damage mechanism of the rc column subjected to contact and close in blast loads in different propagation mediums d to discuss the improvement effects of the reinforcement ratio and ultra high performance concrete on the blast resistance of the underwater rc column 2 description of the coupled model 2 1 material model 2 1 1 concrete the response of the concrete material under impact or blast loading is a complex non linear and rate dependent process bischoff and perry 1991 markel et al 1998 schuler et al 2006 at high strain rates the compressive strength of the concrete

concrete material under extreme loadings based on the hjc model riedel et al 1999 proposed the rht model this model which can reflect the characteristics of the concrete material behavior at a high strain rate is particularly useful for modeling the dynamic behavior of brittle materials such as concrete and rock under dynamic loading codina et al 2016 2017 wang et al 2013 the rht model consists

approach a coupled method cle benson 1992 veen 2003 which combines the advantages of lagrangian and eulerian algorithms can effectively model some problems involving fluid structure interaction and large deformation this coupling is realized based on a special algorithm the lagrangian grids can invade into the eulerian elements eulerian elements can impose pressure on the lagrangian surfaces causing deformation of the solid medium in other words the lagrangian elements provide displacement boundary conditions geometric constraints to eulerian algorithm and eulerian material exerts pressure boundary conditions on the lagrangian grids as shown in fig 1 the discretized differential equation for the structure can be described as 13 m x c x k x f t where x is the structural displacement vector x and x are structural velocity and acceleration respectively m c and k are the structural mass damping and stiffness matrix respectively f t is the time varying load applied to the structure 14 f t ga f p i p s where p i and p s are the incident pressure and scatted pressure respectively g is the matrix relating the structural degrees of freedom to the fluid a f is the matrix containing the areas of the elements in the fluid mesh the pressure boundary conditions each lagrangian boundary element is treated as an independent segment and divided into a set of subsegments each subsegment is defined as the portion of the segment that divides an eulerian grid the force applied by the fluid to a lagrangian segment is the stress acting at the subsegment centroid times the area of the subsegment 15 f i seg n l σ l j k n j a n i k the force is shared by two lagrangian nodes 16 f a i 1 2 n l σ l j k n j a n i k n α x k where k marks the kth element a k is the area of the kth subsegment n is the normal of the boundary segment the displacement boundary conditions the velocities of the lagrangian elements are equal to that of eulerian grids on the fluid structure interaction surface first the calculation of edge velocities is managed then the volume of the fluid is obtained by subtracting the solid volume from the eulerian element after the quantities are determined the stress and pressure are updated the velocities of the lagrangian and eulerian grids away from the interface are calculated in the normal way 2 3 erosion algorithm the lagrange technique has the advantage of reducing computational cost and can correctly describe the material interfaces however when the materials undergo large deformations or high velocity distorts the calculation time steps will become small and computational efficiency will decrease which thus causes the interruption of the calculation or incorrect results in order to improve the computational efficiency the erosion algorithm based on plastic or geometric strain is introduced when the dynamic response of a cell reaches the given criterion the distorted cells will be automatically erased from the model the erosion algorithm must be selected cautiously large erosion criteria may lead to excessive element distortion and computational overflow while low defined criteria may not maintain the conservation of mass and energy and the numerical results are no longer reliable li and hao 2014 the erosion algorithm has been widely applied in simulating the dynamic response of concrete structures subjected to impact or blast loading kamal and eltehewy 2012 prakash et al 2015 xu and lu 2006 li et al 2017 hao and tang 2010 kamal et al kamal and eltehewy 2012 and prakash et al 2015 used an erosion criterion based on the geometric strain to simulate successfully the damage characteristics of concrete targets under high velocity impact loads other researchers xu and lu 2006 li et al 2017 hao and tang 2010 used an erosion criterion based on the principle strain to describe the behavior of concrete structures subjected to blast loads in the present study intensive simulations are performed with different erosion criteria it is found that using geometric strain of 0 5 codina et al 2016 as the erosion criterion which leads to reliable predictions of rc column responses 3 numerical model calibration 3 1 experimental setup a field blast test performed by yuan et al 2017 on a square rc column is used to calibrate the present numerical model the blast loads are generated from a 1 0 kg tnt explosive the dynamic response and damage profiles of the rc column induced by the contact blast loads are reproduced the results are compared with those recorded in the experiment to verify the present numerical method the calibrated model will be used to analyze the response of the rc column under various blasting scenarios fig 2 gives the details of geometry and cross section of the square rc column the rc column top was fixed by a steel hoop and the foundation of the column was inserted into the ground a 1 kg tnt charge was placed on the front surface of specimen the distance between the charge center and the ground surface was 330 mm the rc column specimen had a cross sectional dimension of 400 400 mm and a clear height of 3700 mm the reinforcements within the specimen were constructed using 12 mm diameter longitudinal rebar and 8 mm diameter stirrup rebar the reinforcement layout and section details of the test specimen are shown in fig 2 b the thickness of the concrete cover was 30 mm the average cubic compressive strength was 38 5 mpa longitudinal reinforcement made of ribbed steel bars hrb400 had the yield strength of 400 mpa plain roller steel bars hpb300 with the yield strength of 300 mpa were used as stirrups both the longitudinal and stirrup rebar had the elastic modulus of 200 gpa an accelerometer was installed on the back surface of the rc column as shown in fig 2 b the distance between the accelerometer and the ground surface was 1750 mm more detailed information about the blast test can be found in the reference yuan et al 2017 3 2 finite element model construction different from the ref yuan et al 2017 the cle method is employed in this paper instead of the ale method unlike the ale method the cel method don t need to match the lagrangian structural element mesh to the eulerian fluid grids which means that the eulerian and lagrangian elements don t need to share common faces and nodes it is very convenient for researchers to establish the complicated numerical model numerical model of the contact explosion test based on the cle algorithm is shown in fig 2 c the dimensions of the air domain are 1 m 1 m 4 m and the dimensions of the foundation are 1 m 1 m 0 5 m in the simulation both the ground and concrete column are modeled with lagrange elements the reinforcement bar is described by beam elements while the euler method is used to model the tnt charge and air to obtain accurate simulation results with high efficiency different mesh sizes for the concrete column are used a fine mesh size of 10 mm is employed for the concrete near the tnt charge i e 0 1 m above the ground surface the remaining part of the specimen has a coarse mesh size of 20 mm in the z direction as shown in fig 2 d both the element sizes of the air and the reinforcement bars are 20 mm the numerical model consists of 480 000 lagrange elements 500 000 euler elements and 6500 beam elements two target points are installed on the back surface of the column to monitor the dynamic response of the structure under blast loads meanwhile a cross section 1 1 is arranged to observe the damage evolution of interior concrete the arrangement of the target points and cross section can be found in fig 2 b outflow boundaries are applied on the side and top surfaces of the euler domain in order to decrease the stress wave reflection at these computational boundaries meanwhile the transmission boundaries are applied on the profile and bottom surfaces of the ground to allow for free passage of shock stress waves the bottom surface of the ground and the column top are considered as fixed in all directions in this numerical simulation a fully coupled approach combining the lagrange and euler methods is adopted to simulate the interaction between the column air and explosion the positions of steel bar nodes coincide with those of concrete nodes nodes of the steel layers are attached to the concrete nodes one to one at the intersections preventing the two materials from sliding as shown in fig 2 d 3 3 mesh sensitivity employing appropriate mesh size is critical for accurate simulation results hence a mesh convergence study was performed to determine the cell size in the numerical model three models with different element sizes namely mesh i mesh ii and mesh ⅲ are built for mesh i a fine mesh size of 10 mm is employed for the concrete 0 1 m above the ground surface the remaining part of the specimen has a coarse mesh size of 20 mm in the z direction for mesh ii the fine and coarse mesh sizes are 15 and 30 mm respectively for mesh ⅲ the fine and coarse mesh sizes are 20 and 30 mm respectively fig 3 shows the influence of the mesh density on the displacement time histories at the target 1 the charge weight is 1 0 kg and the explosive distance is 12 cm with the decrease of the mesh size the maximum displacement of the column at target 1 declines slightly the trends of the curves with different mesh sizes are very similar further reduction of the mesh size may result in a more precise numerical result but will substantially increase the computational time and will cause computer memory overflows hence it is feasible to adopt the coupled model with the aforementioned mesh sizes 3 4 model calibration and discussion fig 4 shows the damaged patterns of the rc column obtained from the cle model the severe damage of the specimen around the charge is apparent the cover concrete on the front surface is completely destroyed due to extremely high compressive blast loads as displayed in fig 4 a the length of the major damage zone on the front surface is about 60 cm meanwhile severely damaged region generated on the side surfaces of the column can be observed clearly some concrete spalled at the corners of the square column above the major damage region fig 4 a d this kind of extensive concrete damage is primarily caused by stress concentration at the corners of the square column in addition several cracks can be observed clearly on the back surface while there is no spalling generated as shown in fig 4 d the experimental results are shown in fig 5 comparison of figs 4 and 5 shows that the presented cle model successfully predicts the damage patterns of the rc column the length of the major damage zone on the front surface obtained from the cle method is very close to that measured in the experimental test the calculated lengths of the damage area at the corners are slightly smaller than the average value of the test result generally it can be concluded that the damage profiles predicted by the present cle model give a good agreement with the experimental results fig 6 shows the results of the rc column specimen obtained from the ale method yuan et al 2017 it can be found that the damage areas fringe levels 2 of the column are evidently larger than those observed in the real member besides severe concrete spalling can be observed on the back surface fig 6 d while during the test there was only small concrete spalling on the back surface fig 5 d comparing the numerical results obtained from the cle and ale methods it can be concluded that the cle method give a more reasonable agreement with the observations of the blast test fig 7 shows the acceleration versus time plots obtained from the cle method and those from the experimental test it can be found that the global variation trends of the numerical acceleration time curves agree with the experiment results well except some discrepancies the peak values of the acceleration from the experimental test and numerical simulation are 30 000 and 33 000 m s2 respectively both the analytical damage patterns and acceleration time curves show favorable agreement with those from the field test indicating that the presented cle method can effectively predict the dynamic response of rc structures under blast loads 4 effect of column section shape to air explosion in order to investigate the effect of cross section shape on the response of the rc column subjected to various blast loads square and circular cross sections are taken as research objects the dimensions of the square column are shown in fig 2 the distance between the ground surface and the charge center is also 330 mm the inertia moment of the square column is 0 0021 m4 and the reinforcement ratio is 0 85 the detailed geometry of the circular column is shown in fig 8 the clear height of the circular column is 3700 mm and the diameter is 400 mm the distance between the charge center and the ground surface is also 330 mm the arrangement of reinforcement is shown in fig 8 b the properties of the concrete and the rebar in the circular column are same as those in the square column the inertia moment of the circular column is 0 0013 m4 and the reinforcement ratio is 0 9 because of the larger sectional area of the square column the consumption of the concrete and reinforcing steel bar in square column is also larger than those in the circular column the weight of the tnt charge is 1 0 kg the finite element model of the circular rc column is shown in fig 8 c a fine mesh size of 10 mm is employed for the concrete near the tnt charge i e 0 1 m above the ground surface the remaining part of the specimen has a coarse mesh size of 20 mm in the z direction the dimensions of the air domain and the foundation are consistent with those of the square column the boundary conditions are same as that described in section 3 4 1 effect of column section shape to air contact explosion to better understand the damage mechanism of the rc column with different cross sections to air blast loads the stress wave propagation within the cross section 1 1 is captured fig 9 a presents a series of pressure contours as time progresses in the square rc column where the shock wave propagation immediately after detonation of the explosives spherical shock waves radiate out from the charge location under the fierce shock waves the concrete around the tnt charge is firstly crushed the remaining blast energy continues propagating in the form of compressive waves upon impinging with the side surfaces only a very small distance is travelled and almost no wave divergence occurs the compressive waves reflect into tensile waves and interact with upcoming compressive waves the resultant tensile stress is easily larger than the dynamic tensile strength of concrete fig 9 a t 0 08 ms at t 0 11 ms the compressive waves impact on the back surface resulting in a tension stress zone on the back surface fig 9 b shows a series of pressure contours in the circular rc column the concrete near the tnt charge is also crushed because the magnitude of blast shock waves is considerably larger than the dynamic compressive strength of the concrete it can be seen that there is a big difference of the stress wave propagation in the rc column with different cross section shapes the geometric properties of the square section easily lead to the stress superposition at the corners under the cooperative effect of the incident waves and reflections while the stress superposition phenomenon is mitigated within the circular column a series of target points are arranged in the air domain to monitor the pressure time history as shown in fig 10 a the pressure time curves are displayed in fig 10 b d from fig 10 b it can be seen that more shock waves are reflected on the front face of the square column which can cause more severe impact on the front face of the square column meanwhile more shock waves diffract along the surface of the circular column as shown in fig 10 c and d although the diffraction processes of the waves are observed clearly the influence of the diffraction effect on the damage profiles of the column is quite limited because the pressure of the diffraction waves is significantly smaller compared to the pressure propagated in the column and the arrival time of the blast waves on the side and back surfaces is far behind the stress waves transmitted within the column fig 11 a and b present the damage profiles of the square and circular columns under air contact explosion respectively it can be noticed that both the square and circular columns suffer extensive compressive failure on the front surface severe concrete damage is also observed on the side surfaces several cracks induced by the subsequent flexural response of the columns can be found on the back surface there is no obvious concrete spalling on the back surfaces while previous research results on concrete slabs show more prominent distal surface damage li et al 2016 zhao et al 2018 one possible reason for such deviation is the different geometric characteristics of the structures the ratio of thickness to width of the column is much larger than that of the slab structure causing the propagation of stress waves in the column affects by the two free flanks extensive concrete failure on the front and side surfaces consume a large proportion of the blast energy and concrete on the rear surface which corresponds to the longest travel distance for the blast waves therefore suffers lower tensile failure however the propagation of the stress waves in the slab structure is almost not affected by the flanks and the depletion of compressive waves along the direction of the thickness is negligible due to the short propagation distance the magnitude of the reflected waves is easily larger than the dynamic tensile strength of the concrete resulting in the rear surface of the slab suffers more tensile failure from fig 11 a and b it can be seen that the square column experiences more damage than the circular column the overall damage height of the front surface is 60 cm slightly larger than the circular column of 55 cm both the damage degrees of the front and back surfaces in the circular column are milder than those in the square column fig 12 shows the maximum x displacement of the column along z direction with different cross sections under the air contact explosion it can be seen that the circular column experiences smaller deformation the maximum displacements of the column with square and circular cross sections are 16 and 11 5 mm respectively the maximum deformation of the column with circular cross section drops by 30 it can be concluded that employing circular cross section can not only reduce the consumption of concrete and steel bar but also improve the anti knock performance of column structures to air contact explosion 4 2 effect of column section shape to air close in explosion the analysis results in section 4 1 demonstrate that employing circular section can improve the blast resistance of the column however both the square and circular columns are disrupted severely under the contact explosion of 1 kg tnt hence further investigations are conducted to explore the effect of the section shape on the response of the column subjected to air non contact explosion considering the distance between the column surface and packaging housing is 10 15 cm the explosion distance is selected as 12 cm fig 13 presents the damage profiles of the column with different cross sections under air close in explosion of 1 0 kg tnt charge when the distances between the front surface and the tnt charge increase from 0 to 12 cm the magnitude of the compressive stress acting on the column decreases sharply there is almost no concrete cover spalling from the surfaces of the column under the close in explosion only local damage region generated it can also be found that the anti knock performance of the circular column is stronger than that of the square column the damage degrees of the concrete around the tnt charge in the circular column are milder than those in the square column more cracks can be found in the square column fig 14 shows the displacement time curves of the column at target 1 under the air close in explosion the trends of the displacement time histories of the square column are similar with those of the circular column the maximum displacements of the column at target 1 with square and circular cross sections are 2 6 and 1 1 mm respectively table 2 presents the maximum displacements of the column with different cross sections at target 1 under air contact and close in explosion it can be concluded that the anti knock performance of the circular column is stronger than that of square column no matter subjected to air contact or close in explosions meanwhile it can be found that the explosion distance has a significant impact on the response of the column although the alteration of the distance is inconspicuous the maximum displacement of the column at target 1 with the explosion distance of 12 cm drops by 80 90 compared with the contact explosion the damage degrees of the rc column under air contact explosion fig 11 are significantly larger than those under air closed in explosion fig 13 hence some protective measures such as protecting crust can be installed on the surface of the column to improve its blast resistance 5 effect of column section shape to underwater explosion as we known some columns are exposed to the air but some are located in the water such as bridge pier the analysis results presented in section 4 demonstrate that employing the circular cross section can improve the anti knock performance of the column to air blast loading hence it is very necessary to investigate the effect of section shape on the dynamic response of the rc columns subjected to underwater explosion underwater explosion can cause significantly more damage to the structures than the same amount of explosive in air wang et al 2014a zhao et al 2018 therefore the weight of tnt charge is selected as 0 1 kg the water depth is 2 0 m and the distance between the charge center and the ground surface is also 330 mm as shown in fig 15 the boundary conditions are same as that described in section 3 there are two main loads in underwater explosions namely shock waves and bubbles however when the structures subjected to contact or close in underwater explosions the development of the bubble is restricted by the structures this is because the distance between the structures and the explosives is smaller than the maximum diameter of the bubble in this paper the effects of the shock waves and detonation products on the rc column are considered based on the fully coupled lagrange euler method 5 1 effect of column section shape to underwater contact explosion fig 16 a and b present the propagation processes of the shock waves induced by the underwater contact explosion of 0 1 kg tnt immediately after detonation of the explosives spherical shock waves radiate out from the charge location under the fierce shock waves the concrete around the tnt charge is crushed with the time goes the wave front propagates from the front surface to the interior of the rc column because the propagation speed of the shock waves in the water is much faster than that in the air the arrival time of the blast waves on the side and back surfaces is just a little behind the stress waves transmitted within the column unlike the shock waves transmitted into the air the pressure of the diffraction waves in the water cannot be neglected compared to the pressure propagated into the column on the surfaces of the column the shock waves transmitted within the concrete and water will superimpose causing the concrete damaged severely meanwhile due to the effect of the detonation products the front surface of the column is in the compression status for a long time the pressure time histories at different monitoring points in the water domain are shown in fig 17 from fig 17 b it can be seen that much more shock waves are reflected on the front face of the square column due to the larger reflective surface which indicates the square column experiences much more blast loads fig 17 c shows that more shock waves diffract along the surface of the circular column the pressure time plots at target 4 have several peaks a possible reason for such results is the multiple reflections and diffractions it is interesting that both the pressure time histories at target 5 have two obvious crests as shown in fig 17 d the first peak is caused by the transmitted waves propagated in the column fig 16 t 0 25 ms the other is induced by the diffracted waves propagated in the water fig 16 t 0 40 ms the peak values of the transmitted waves from the square and circular columns are 5 4 and 4 6 mpa respectively the peak values of the diffracted waves from the square and circular columns are 3 2 and 5 0 mpa respectively fig 18 shows the final damage profiles of the column with square and circular cross sections caused by underwater contact explosion both the square and circular columns suffer serious damage the concrete around the tnt charge is destroyed severely under the effect of the shock waves and detonation products in addition many cracks can be seen along the z direction the damage degree and fracture area of the concrete on the front surface of the circular column are evidently smaller than those in the square column moreover the back surface of the square column severed more damage than the circular column the maximum x displacement of the column with different cross sections along z direction is shown in fig 19 unlike the deformation induced by the air blast loads the maximum displacement caused by the underwater explosion occurs at a position of 0 8 m above the ground instead of the position of the explosive the deflection profile of the circular column is obviously smaller than the square column although the blasting scenarios are identical the maximum displacements of the column with square and circular cross sections are 32 and 20 mm respectively the maximum deformation of the column with circular cross section drops by 37 compared with the square column as expected when the column located in the water the circular cross section can also diffract more blast energy and improve the blast resistance of the column 5 2 effect of column section shape to underwater close in explosion further investigations are conducted to explore the influence of the cross section shape on the response of the column to underwater close in explosion the weight of tnt charge is 0 1 kg and the distance between the charge and the front surface is also set as 12 cm fig 20 shows the damage profiles of the rc column subjected to the underwater close in explosion both the square and circular columns are damaged seriously it is worth noting that the flanks of the column suffer more damage than that of the front face due to the effects of the reflected waves and diffracted waves moreover the concrete on the back surface is also damaged severely under the flexural response of the column the deformation of the column with different cross sections subjected to underwater close in explosion is shown in fig 21 the deformation of the circular column is very similar with that of the square column however the deflection of the circular column is also significantly smaller than the square column the maximum displacements of the column with square and circular cross sections are 26 and 15 mm respectively the deformation of the column with circular cross section drops by 42 table 3 presents the maximum displacements of the column with different section shapes at target 1 subjected to underwater contact and close in explosions it can be also concluded that the circular column experiences smaller blast loads and generates smaller deformation no matter subjected to underwater contact or non contact explosions the results presented in section 4 2 demonstrate that increasing a small distance between the charge and the structure can significantly improve the safety of the column to air blast loadings however increasing a small explosion distance cannot significantly improve the resistance of the rc column to underwater explosions the damage degrees of the rc column caused by underwater explosions cannot be decreased by increasing a small explosion distance as shown in figs 18 and 20 this is because that the compressibility of water is much smaller than the air and the shock wave attenuates more slowly in the water medium the blast energy cannot dissipate rapidly in the water 5 3 protective measures against underwater explosion the results from sections 5 1 and 5 2 show that increasing a little explosion distance cannot improve the blast resistance of structures to underwater blast loads hence some other reinforcement measures are employed to improve the blast resistance of the rc column to underwater blast loads common reinforcement measures are applying novel structures concrete filled double skin steel column concrete filled steel column bonding steel plate or carbon fiber sheet enhancing steel reinforcement using ultra high performance concrete material and so on in this paper the effects of longitudinal transverse reinforcement spacing and concrete strength on the response of the square rc columns subjected to underwater blast loads are investigated the basic features of the four column types are summarized as follows case a the rc column is same as that described in section 3 case b decreasing the transverse reinforcement spacing as shown in fig 22 a the compressive strength of the concrete is 38 5 mpa case c decreasing the longitudinal reinforcement spacing the reinforcement ratio is 1 4 as shown in fig 22 b the compressive strength of the concrete is 38 5 mpa case d employing ultra high performance concrete compressive strength is 140 mpa the parameters of the ultra high performance concrete can be found in ansys inc 2010 the rebar reinforcement details are shown in fig 22 c the same as that in section 3 the material parameters of reinforcing bars are the same as those presented in section 2 1 5 the diameters of the longitudinal and transverse rebar are 12 and 8 mm respectively the weight of tnt charge is 0 1 kg the water depth is 2 0 m and the distance between the charge center and the ground surface is also 330 mm the boundary conditions are consistent with those described in section 3 fig 23 shows the displacement along height direction plots for the four column types subjected to underwater contact blast loading the deformation laws of the four column types are very similar decreasing the transverse or longitudinal reinforcement spacing can improve the blast resistance of the rc column the maximum deformations of the column in cases a b and c are 32 27 5 and 25 5 mm respectively the maximum displacement in cases b and c drops by 17 and 20 respectively when employing the ultra high performance concrete the blast resistance of the column can be improved significantly the maximum displacement of the column in case d is about 16 mm compared with the conventional column case a the maximum deformation drops by 50 the results show that increasing reinforcement can improve the blast resistance of structures employing the ultra high performance material can better enhance the resistance of the structure to underwater blast loads 6 conclusions this paper is aimed to investigate the cross section shape effects on the anti knock performance of rc columns under various explosions the reliabilities of the rc model subjected to blast loads are verified by comparing with the results of the field blast test the anti knock performance of the rc column with square and circular cross sections subjected to air contact and close in blast loads are investigated respectively besides the effect of the cross section shape on the structural response of the column subjected to underwater contact and close in explosions is discussed the effects of the longitudinal and transverse reinforcement spacing concrete strength on the blast resistance of the rc column subjected to underwater contact explosion are also explored the major conclusions drawn from the research presented in this paper are 1 the damage patterns of the rc column obtained from the numerical method match well with the experimental results which indicate that the presented cle model can predict effectively the dynamic response and damage propagation process of rc structures under blast loads 2 the cross section shape has a significant impact on the dynamic behavior of the rc column the diffraction of the shock waves on the curved surface resulting in the blast loads acting on the circular column is smaller than that on the square column employing circular cross section can not only reduce the consumption of concrete and steel bar but also improve the blast resistance of column structures hence it is recommended that the column structures such as bridge piers subway columns should adopt circular section 3 the diffraction wave effect induced by air explosion on the damage profiles of the column is quite limited because the pressure of the diffraction waves is significantly small and the arrival time of the diffraction waves on the side and back surfaces is far behind the stress waves transmitted in the column however the diffraction effect caused by underwater explosion on the response of the column cannot be neglected the shock waves transmitted within the column and water will superimpose causing the concrete damaged severely 4 some protective measures such as protecting crust can be installed on the surfaces of the structures to improve their safety subjected to air blast loads however such protective measure cannot be applied to improve the blast resistance of structures to underwater explosion other protective measures such as increasing the reinforcement ratio and using the ultra high performance concrete should be employed to enhance the blast resistance of underwater structures declarations of interest none acknowledgments the authors gratefully appreciate the supports from the major program of technological innovation of
