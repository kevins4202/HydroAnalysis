920,freshwater provision is an ecosystem service usually offered by natural watersheds but threatened by anthropogenic degradation pollution reduced water supply and led to high socio economic costs this study examined water accessibility in three wards of morogoro municipality in tanzania in terms of household sources of water supply availability consumption and spending it involved primary data collected through household questionnaire survey key informant interviews and observation and secondary data from water supply authority and basin offices quantitative data were analyzed by descriptive techniques that involved computation of maximum and minimum values means and percentages and qualitative data by content analysis technique about 80 of study respondents were not connected to the public water supply networks they depended on sources like boreholes wells rainwater and streams water supply was insufficient and partly unaffordable during scarcity the study findings were linked to the unesco ihp ix framework to achieve water related sdgs to improve water provision efficiency keywords watershed degradation water provision water scarcity tanzania 1 introduction safe

parts of urban tanzania are subject to water insufficiency due to the increasing population and limited water sources urt 2012 morogoro municipality is among such urban centers depending mainly on mindu dam as the main available source of water supply both domestic and industrial for its population urt 2016 moruwasa and wrbwb 2019 at the same time information on whether available domestic water is accessible and affordable in urban areas of tanzania remains scarce masanyiwa et al 2017 this paper attempted to address that knowledge gap by examining household access to and affordability of water supply in tanzania urban centers it examined available sources of domestic water its accessibility and actual household water consumption in morogoro municipality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area this study was conducted in morogoro municipality fig 1 in tanzania the major source of water is mindu dam a natural water reservoir located in the ruvu catchment wami ruvu basin ngonyani and nkotagu 2007 it is located in the southeast of ngerengere river valley between the uluguru and the mindu mountains 16 km west of morogoro town kihila 2005 the dam is drained by mzinga mlali mgera lukulunge and ngerengere rivers its original volume was 20 7 million m3 and is currently estimated to be 13 million m3 of which 2 02 million m3 is dead volume not available for use kihila 2005 urt 2012 the estimated population of morogoro municipality is 400 155 people growing at a 3 per annum growth rate urt 2012 the area activities are crop farming livestock domestication and fishing supported by mindu dam moruwasa and wrbwb 2019 2 2 sampling procedure this study used a three stage sampling technique with random sampling to offer an equal chance reduce biases and enable reliability of the study findings kumar 2005 sampled respondents were both who have stayed for a long time and those with short stays during transition from wet to dry season to capture all the variabilities the first stage involved random sampling of wards bigwa chamwino and mindu at the second stage streets were randomly selected from each ward bigwa barabarani from bigwa shule from chamwino and mindu and mikoroshini from mindu the third stage was marked by random household sampling from each street with a 10 sampling intensity neuman 2014 the distribution of the study sample across wards and streets is shown in table 1 2 2 research design used this study used a cross sectional design that involved collecting data once at a point newman 2014 both quantitative and qualitative data were gathered to address the study objectives primary data were collected from households that were used as sampling units because it is where domestic water supply and consumption are determined masanyiwa et al 2017 secondary data were obtained from morogoro urban water supply and sanitation authority moruwasa grey literature to complement primary data grey literature was used to provide details on the status and statistics of water supply and demand over time in the municipality these included unpublished data on how the amount of water needed varied over time with an increase in population 2 3 data collection methods for a better insight validity and reliability of the research findings a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative approaches was used for data collection the study used a questionnaire survey key informants interview observation and literature search a structured questionnaire was used in the household survey to collect socio economic characteristics water consumption and accessibility water supply data key informants interviews were organized with moruwasa officials field observation involved observing available household water sources and grey literature search to examine water supply records 2 3 data analysis quantitative data from the household questionnaire survey were imported to the statistical package for social sciences spss and microsoft excel that were used for quantitative analysis they were analyzed for descriptive statistics like frequencies means maximum and minimum values the distribution of water access cost was examined across the wards using box plots qualitative data from key informant interviews and observation were transcribed and analyzed by content analysis technique to unveil relevant patterns and themes due to the complementarity of qualitative and quantitative data their presentation and discussion were weaved together 3 results 3 1 sources of domestic water to know whether water is domestically available and accessible an investigation of available sources of water across the 3 wards bigwa chamwino and mindu was done however these wards were randomly selected they reflected all possible alternatives for accessing water in the study area the main water supply means were grouped and categorized as moruwasa when the household had connectivity to public water supply authority boreholes and wells for either hand dug well borehole or any other means installed to harvest groundwater rainwater harvesting was a case if the household relied on rainwater either having a private system connected with gutters or harvesting water from the uphill post rain season the last category was other sources this included a combination of traditional means like directly collecting water from springs surface streams and dams without any installed system to ease its domestic delivery the distribution of major water sources by wards is shown in table 2 below the main available sources of getting portable and domestic water varied from place to place some had more than one source while others had just only one major source mindu ward being the peripheral one in the municipality had no connectivity to the authorized water supply the overall water supply means included moruwasa pipe connections 20 4 boreholes and wells 8 6 rainwater 22 2 and direct intake from other sources 48 4 while moruwasa was the only available source in chamwino mindu dwellers had no connectivity to the moruwasa network nearly half of its population relies on water direct from the mindu dam 48 4 and wells 5 4 with rainwater as a supplementary source 3 2 accessibility of domestic water to know the extent of water accessibility for households in the study area respondents characterized water accessibility by the number of days in a week that they access to water fig 2 the figure illustrates the overview of water accessibility throughout the study area the responses were not significantly different across the three wards thus presented as whole having weekly water accessibility frequencies respondents ranked the extent of public water supply in their respective areas ranking assumed a likert scale of very good to very poor and the results are summarized in fig 3 a large proportion ranked the service as very poor 81 7 and optimal 12 9 this indicates the inadequacy of domestic water supply making inhabitants outsource alternative means only a small population 1 1 ranked the service as good this is linked to the increasing population in the study area while the sources remain the same 3 3 household water consumption with the available water supply situation and concerning a household water source respondents characterized their daily water consumption spending and monthly water bills when the supply is reduced especially during the dry season additional financial costs are incurred these were termed scarcity monetary costs the general water consumption is shown in table 3 representing the overall statistics as all the wards had a similar situation water was essential for daily undertakings across the study area respondents dare to incur some costs in favor of water the monthly water bills and scarcity cost the cost of obtaining the same amount of water during water scarce period were unavailable 0 tzs only to households with private sources like wells and rainwater harvesting systems the average cost of obtaining water during a scarce period becomes higher 24 595 tzs equivalent to 171 tzs l as compared to normal monthly bills 15 976 tzs equivalent to 111 tzs l the cost of water bills depend upon among other factors a the source system providing water b the amount of water consumed however there is no strict management policy regarding securing water availability the management approach to respond to degradation and reduced flow around the main source is by raising the side walls of the dam consequently the available water keeps shrinking and the dead volume increase as degradations on the catchments do not stop and siltation keeps going higher water scarcity was cited as among the prevalent problems affecting the majority 95 7 of respondents as shown in table 4 the distribution of scarcity costs varied across wards as shown by the boxplot diagram fig 4 chamwino ward in most cases depended on public water as compared to other wards bigwa whose inhabitants had the system of harvesting rainwater from uphill had the lowest scarcity cost this was sough as a good alternative but not as such efficient in all areas 4 discussion 4 1 sources of domestic water the study findings indicate the inadequacy of public water supply in the municipality as earlier found by other studies masanyiwa et al 2017 urt 2012 pauschert et al 2012 in urban centers of tanzania and urban and other developing countries prasad 2006 garcia valinas et al 2010 the situation is even worse in peri urban areas the shortage of calls for private water service providers and suppliers to intervene and work together with public entities to improve efficiency in urban water supply smiley 2016 this accounts for a reason why some households in urban centers opt to invest in their private water supply like rainwater harvesting mussa et al 2019 and boreholes martínez santos et al 2017 2020 to supplement inadequate public water supply or its mere absence in urban townships 4 2 accessibility of domestic water problems in water accessibility frequency are also known to have an impact on social welfare as households spend much time collecting water reducing the time available for other households productive and domestic activities pauschert et al 2012 iied 2016 masanyiwa et al 2015 2017 ensured access to water 66 7 was common among respondents who either owned water sources commonly boreholes wells and rainwater harvesting system or had direct access from the dam and other sources table 2 the remaining population opts for private suppliers to get water at a convenient time to meet their needs these findings are in line with those of prasad 2006 christopher and beal 2022 and masanyiwa et al 2015 that recommended non centralized private water supply to complement public water supply due to some revealed inefficiencies smiley 2016 wbg 2018 other studies garcia valinas et al 2010 iied 2016 masanyiwa et al 2017 linked such inappropriate water access in peri urban areas to poor infrastructure in public network connections masanyiwa et al 2017 and christopher and beal 2022 also found households with unsecured access to consuming water from unsafe sources that could not guarantee public health insecure water problems like pollution were liked to ever reported anthropogenic conducts and chemical pollution from the mzinga military area industrial discharge ngonyani and nkotagu 2007 moruwasa and wrbwb 2019 and sedimentation kihila 2005 due to population increase urt 2012 recognizing such a reduction in water supply moruwasa established a mambogo treatment plant to increase the rate of water treatment and delivery to the public 4 3 household water consumption and financial cost as the study findings indicate households were able to access about 144 litres of water on average table 3 that meet only basic needs like drinking and food preparation this is within the who established levels of 20 litres per person per day masanyiwa et al 2017 due to many utilities this amount was inadequate for hygienic practices like hand washing laundry and bathing this reflects the idea developed ever before that water sufficiency may differ across areas depending on the extent of activities that available water is used for unicef and who 2015 who 2017 a few households 14 ranked the level of public water access as optimal to good implying that public water supply does not meet their demands table 4 these findings complement previous studies garcia valinas et al 2010 kayser et al 2013 across sub saharan countries that found it is difficult for public water supply to meet the demand of the entire urban population insufficiency to guarantee better public health the amount of water collected and consumed on daily basis is according to masanyiwa et al 2017 vital in water supply accessibility as it reflects distance time reliability and cost of available water although there is no formally agreed universal amount of water holding to meet domestic uses several reference levels have been established masanyiwa et al 2015 iied 2016 while who justified 20 liters per person per day iied 2016 the tanzania water policy recommends a minimum of 25 liters per day per person urt 2012 the interpretation of the observed difference between the two levels implies that the appropriate amount depends on the specific area of concern although the average water consumption per household complied with both the who and tanzanian recommended levels it was still insufficient in the study area due to increased activities that depend on water availability and a large disparity between the household sizes a similar situation is common in unplanned peri urban areas making them victims of water access and some operations cease leading to urban water poverty pauschert et al 2012 masanyiwa et al 2017 the observed costs in mindu ward regardless of having direct access from the dam are attributable to reported progressive sedimentation kihila 2005 sedimentation reduces the operational capacity by lowering the depth and volume of mindu dam largely depending on public water connection from moruwasa chamwino counted for the highest values both for minimum 18 000 tzs and maximum costs 60 000 tzs associated with water accessibility fig 1 higher costs in mindu ward were due to both some defaults in their connections leading to unrealistic bill counts sometimes and unplanned dwellings leading to difficulties in being accessible even to private vendors hence high costs following high water costs some households were unable to access domestic water because they cannot afford to pay unaffordability of domestic water is among the causes of households losing their right to access water garcia valinas et al 2010 who 2016 iied 2016 masanyiwa et al 2017 4 4 water provision in the framework of unesco ihp the intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp has in the nineth phase ihp ix of implementation identified key priority areas in the water sector to support its member states towards achievement of the water related sustainable development goals sdgs and the global agenda with the specific focus on science for a water secure world in a changing climate the plan calls for a better understanding hydrology with due consideration of human water systems interaction in the perspective of environmental changes and human behavior exploring such interaction aids among other things serves to figure out degradation of water ecosystems and its reflection on water provision as this paper did in developing world as addressed in this paper s case the degradation of water ecosystems and provision is critical this study thus disclosed a need for the international scientific community to operationalize a transdisciplinary solutions for a water secure developing world and bridging a gap between data science knowledge and practice this paper builds up on the ihp ix 2022 2029 identified global water challenges by acknowledging the impact of population growth on fresh water ecosystems water accessibility and availability this is essential to refine and develop a comprehensive management plan of water resources that takes due consideration of hydrology and the influence of socio economic factors alongside changing climate as one of the major drivers of water challenges the cross sectoral horizontal and vertical integration is thus a key for the optimization of water use and smart management through water trainings research governance for a water secure world and societies recognition of water as a climate connector by the world water development report wwdr 2020 stress a wide collaboration among stakeholders to secure water ecosystems the fact that demographic pressure jeopardize watersheds and capacity of ecosystems posing a significant threat to water availability reflect the need for transdisciplinary ecohydrology approaches to sustainable water resources management for improved water provision in a changing environment this paper further the implementation of ihp ix plan by providing scientific knowledge disclosing data and real picture to inform sound and holistic water management by integrating ecosystems ecohydrology the contribution of this paper to the mission of ihp ix is by exposing water challenges associated with the human ecosystem interaction to bridge the gap between water knowledge data and practice 5 conclusion and recommendations this study examined the accessibility of water supply in the bigwa chamwino and mindu wards of morogoro municipality tanzania the main finding was the prevalence of limited accessibility of domestic water supply to the households the inadequacy was attributable to low water supply coverage due to the increasing population while the main sources remain the same consequently a substantial proportion of households especially in peri urban areas depend on unimproved sources consuming contaminated water although the daily water consumption levels complied with the minimum thresholds some households were able to meet only the basic access available water supply service was still insufficient to guarantee proper sanitary practices water scarcity was reflected in higher water bills that had financial implications affordability and accessibility criterion unmet by some households the study findings necessitate a need for service extension to connect uncovered peri urban areas and find alternative sources in case available public sources do not suffice interventions to improve water supply access should focus on conserving water sources to prevent further degradation and pollution and ensure a natural water flow this paper contributed to the ideas and priorities highlighted in the ihp ix by exposing the water provision challenges in the face of population pressure and urban growth

and chemical pollution from the mzinga military area industrial discharge ngonyani and nkotagu 2007 moruwasa and wrbwb 2019 and sedimentation kihila 2005 due to population increase urt 2012 recognizing such a reduction in water supply moruwasa established a mambogo treatment plant to increase the rate of water treatment and delivery to the public 4 3 household water consumption and financial cost as the study findings indicate households were able to access about 144 litres of water on average table 3 that meet only basic needs like drinking and food preparation this is within the who established levels of 20 litres per person per day masanyiwa et al 2017 due to many utilities this amount was inadequate for hygienic practices like hand washing laundry and bathing this reflects the idea developed ever before that water sufficiency may differ across areas depending on the extent of activities that available water is used for unicef and who 2015 who 2017 a few households 14 ranked the level of public water access as optimal to good implying that public water supply does not meet their demands table 4 these findings complement previous studies garcia valinas et al 2010 kayser et al 2013 across sub saharan countries that found it is difficult for public water supply to meet the demand of the entire urban population insufficiency to guarantee better public health the amount of water collected and consumed on daily basis is according to masanyiwa et al 2017 vital in water supply accessibility as it reflects distance time reliability and cost of available water although there is no formally agreed universal amount of water holding to meet domestic uses several reference levels have been established masanyiwa et al 2015 iied 2016 while who justified 20 liters per person per day iied 2016 the tanzania water policy recommends a minimum of 25 liters per day per person urt 2012 the interpretation of the observed difference between the two levels implies that the appropriate amount depends on the specific area of concern although the average water consumption per household complied with both the who and tanzanian recommended levels it was still insufficient in the study area due to increased activities that depend on water availability and a large disparity between the household sizes a similar situation is common in unplanned peri urban areas making them victims of water access and some operations cease leading to urban water poverty pauschert et al 2012 masanyiwa et al 2017 the observed costs in mindu ward regardless of having direct access from the dam are attributable to reported progressive sedimentation kihila 2005 sedimentation reduces the operational capacity by lowering the depth and volume of mindu dam largely depending on public water connection from moruwasa chamwino counted for the highest values both for minimum 18 000 tzs and maximum costs 60 000 tzs associated with water accessibility fig 1 higher costs in mindu ward were due to both some defaults in their connections leading to unrealistic bill counts sometimes and unplanned dwellings leading to difficulties in being accessible even to private vendors hence high costs following high water costs some households were unable to access domestic water because they cannot afford to pay unaffordability of domestic water is among the causes of households losing their right to access water garcia valinas et al 2010 who 2016 iied 2016 masanyiwa et al 2017 4 4 water provision in the framework of unesco ihp the intergovernmental hydrological programme ihp has in the nineth phase ihp ix of implementation identified key priority areas in the water sector to support its member states towards achievement of the water related sustainable development goals sdgs and the global agenda with the specific focus on science for a water secure world in a changing climate the plan calls for a better understanding hydrology with due consideration of human water systems interaction in the perspective of environmental changes and human behavior exploring such interaction aids among other things serves to figure out degradation of water ecosystems and its reflection on water provision as this paper did in developing world as addressed in this paper s case the degradation of water ecosystems and provision is critical this study thus disclosed a need for the international scientific community to operationalize a transdisciplinary solutions for a water secure developing world and bridging a gap between data science knowledge and practice this paper builds up on the ihp ix 2022 2029 identified global water challenges by acknowledging the impact of population growth on fresh water ecosystems water accessibility and availability this is essential to refine and develop a comprehensive management plan of water resources that takes due consideration of hydrology and the influence of socio economic factors alongside changing climate as one of the major drivers of water challenges the cross sectoral horizontal and vertical integration is thus a key for the optimization of water use and smart management through water trainings research governance for a water secure world and societies recognition of water as a climate connector by the world water development report wwdr 2020 stress a wide collaboration among stakeholders to secure water ecosystems the fact that demographic pressure jeopardize watersheds and capacity of ecosystems posing a significant threat to water availability reflect the need for

providing scientific knowledge disclosing data and real picture to inform sound and holistic water management by integrating ecosystems ecohydrology the contribution of this paper to the mission of ihp ix is by exposing water challenges associated with the human ecosystem interaction to bridge the gap between water knowledge data and practice 5 conclusion and recommendations this study examined the accessibility of water supply in the bigwa chamwino and mindu wards of morogoro municipality tanzania the main finding was the prevalence of limited accessibility of domestic water supply to the households the inadequacy was attributable to low water supply coverage due to the increasing population while the main sources remain the same consequently a substantial proportion of households especially in peri urban areas depend on unimproved sources consuming contaminated water although the daily water consumption levels complied with the minimum thresholds some households were able to meet only the basic access available water supply service was still insufficient to guarantee proper sanitary practices water scarcity was reflected in higher water bills that had financial implications affordability and accessibility criterion unmet by some households the study findings necessitate a need for service extension to connect uncovered peri urban areas and find alternative sources in case available public sources do not suffice interventions to improve water supply access should focus on conserving water sources to prevent further degradation and pollution and ensure a natural water flow this paper contributed to the ideas and priorities highlighted in the ihp ix by exposing the water provision challenges in the face of population pressure and urban growth

921,there is a knowledge gap on the extent of the impact of waste disposal sites on water resources in uganda this study assessed the effectiveness of the leachate treatment process and the extent of water pollution by the leachate at the biggest sanitary landfill in east africa the kiteezi landfill samples of leachate surface water and groundwater were collected in and around the landfill for four months results showed that leachate treatment at the landfill is ineffective for reducing its pollution potential all the measured parameters except nitrate and sodium were above uganda s national standards for effluent discharge after treatment treated leachate had higher ph 9 1 0 10 ec 22 384 879 µs cm and concentrations of nitrate 0 469 0 035 mg l and potassium 320 30 mg l than the untreated leachate but lower ammonium concentration the groundwater had very high concentration of ammonium range 67 8 1313 mg l indicating possible pollution by leachate additionally surface water from the point at which untreated leachate enters the kitetikka stream had values comparable to raw leachate for all measured parameters the study recommends the improvement of the leachate collection and treatment system to reduce untreated leachate flow into the surface water further study into the health impact of the water quality on the local community is essential keywords kiteezi landfill landfill leachate waste disposal sites water pollution surface water groundwater 1 introduction waste disposal sites wds pose serious threats to the health quality and resilience of all ecosystems and human health ihedioha et al 2017 however waste disposal remains the primary means for managing municipal solid waste msw in developing countries because it is inexpensive and a readily available option to these countries ferronato torretta 2019 unfortunately the disposal is mostly done indiscriminately in open dumps where all kinds of untreated wastes are discarded with minimal or no covering moreover due to limited resources and poor management in developing countries precautions at the setup and operation of wds are not adequately addressed idowu et al 2019 with waste amounts increasing alarmingly in most parts of the world powell et al 2018 the pressure placed on wds is worsening and the need to open up more land for disposal is increasing aryampa et al 2019 alternatively existing sites in developing countries are being used beyond their carrying capacities due to resource limitations for setting up new sites consequently numerous disposal sites in developing countries have reached unsustainable points abd el salam abu zuid 2015 aryampa et al 2021a majolagbe et al 2017 and protecting the environment from the solid waste hazards is becoming a significant challenge the main concern from wds in regard to water resources is leachate which can cause significant impacts even in small quantities due to its high concentration of pollutants since most wds receive large quantities of highly hazardous materials abd el salam abu zuid 2015 aryampa et al 2021b erses et al 2005 leachate from most sites can considerably alter the water quality parameters and result in water quality degradation kareem et al 2016 moreover it is impossible to eliminate dangerous and deleterious chemicals from msw because many products used in homes and commercial areas are potentially hazardous to the environment and public health slack et al 2005 hence wds leachates potentially carry carcinogens and other toxic chemicals yet not all potentially hazardous chemicals in leachates have standards lee jones lee 1994 the growing use of more land for waste disposal especially in developing countries creates a rising threat to water resources lebreton andrady 2019 with more land being used for waste disposal especially beyond its carrying capacity aryampa et al 2019 the risk of water resources being contaminated by waste or subsequent leachates increases aryampa et al 2019 accordingly several studies from different parts of the world have reported contamination of groundwater and surface water by wds leachate associated with the movement of leachate into water sources abd el salam abu zuid 2015 alemayehu et al 2019 krika et al 2021 nyika onyari 2019 ololade et al 2019 in uganda leachate escaping into the surrounding water is among the most significant concern regarding the operation of wds aryampa et al 2021a mwiganga kansiime 2005 most sites do not have proper leachate management and yet they continue to be used beyond their capacities moreover most local populations in the areas of wds locations rely on either groundwater or surface water for home usage and agriculture directorate of water development 2019 however research about water contamination has generally not received adequate attention in the country and is still insufficient in africa kareem et al 2016 most studies about landfills impact give qualitative descriptions of water contamination gbolo 2021 madinah hanifah 2019 nabukeera et al 2015 and quantitate research showing the extent of the pollution are still limited hence there is a knowledge gap on the extent of the impact of wds on water resources in the country and the consequent loss of water security to wds therefore the objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the leachate treatment process at the kiteezi landfill and the extent of groundwater and surface water contamination by the leachate from the landfill 2 methodology the study was conducted through 1 fieldwork including the assessment of the leachate collection plant and field sample collection over four months followed by 2 laboratory analysis of the samples followed by 3 data analysis of laboratory results 2 1 study site the kiteezi landfill is the biggest landfill in east africa located 13 km from kampala city at latitude 0o 25 0 and longitude 32o 34 00 aryampa et al 2021a the landfill is 25 years old and occupies 35 acres its capacity ran out in 2009 but it still receives about 1300 tons of municipal solid waste daily from kampala city and neighbouring areas of wakiso district both organic and recyclable waste is deposited at the site but informal waste pickers pick out most of the recyclable waste for income aryampa et al 2022 about 60 of the solid waste generated in kampala city is disposed of at the landfill aryampa et al 2019 although the site is due for closure and plans for its closure and for a new landfill site are underway there have been several reports of environmental pollution by the landfill over the years of its existence kampala city council 2008a mwiganga kansiime 2005 additionally because of the landfill utilisation beyond its capacity and improper waste slopes waste in the landfill collapsed in 2017 after the incident efforts to stabilise the waste in the leachate treatment plant s direction blocked some channels for directing raw leachate to the treatment plant causing the leachate to find other routes and ending up in the stream without treatment the climate of the landfill location is tropical equatorial with bimodal rainfall and the area has a long rainfall season from march to june and a short rainy season from november to december with yearly variations the average rainfall is 1300 mm per annum with mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures of about 28 c and 16 5 c respectively the landfill site has a smooth rolling terrain with hilly surroundings on the southern and eastern sides the predominant geological layer is the granite gneiss sub stratum and the minor layer in the swamp is the alluvial sediment kampala city council 2008b the primary vegetation surrounding the landfill is short grass with a few trees and shrubs but the entire eastern boundary is part of an ecologically important wetland the walufumbe swamp with relatively thick vegetation and papyrus reeds the walufumbe wetland is a seasonal wetland formed along river walufumbe covering an area of 1 33 km2 in a shallow but broad valley between several hills with an altitude ranging between 1143 1173 48 m ndibaisa 2013 the wetland drains into the victoria nile catchment the general drainage pattern of the landfill location is semi dendrite forming a regional catchment area kcc 2008 groundwater generally flows towards the walufumbe wetland kampala city council 2008b the drainage density around the landfill is low 50 76 km km2 to moderate 77 112 km km2 but there is a high groundwater potential birungi 2019 the major hydrologic feature is a perennial stream kitetikka located about 500 m from the landfill in the valley bottom flowing southeast of the landfill through the walufumbe wetland the groundwater table is at an average depth of about 30 35 m on the west air water earth ltd 2013 but the depth decreases towards the east with the lowest depth of 0 2 m on the eastern side there are numerous small gardens around the landfill in the wetland on the southeast side of the landfill which is not surrounded by homes water from the stream is used for irrigating these gardens through channels that direct water from the stream to the individual gardens in addition there are several boreholes within the 2 km radius around the landfill from which water for human consumption and domestic use is obtained 2 1 1 the leachate treatment plant at the kiteezi landfill fig 1 shows the flowchart of leachate treatment plant at the kiteezi landfill the plant comprises the leachate collection tank equalisation tank sedimentation tank aeration tank clarifier a reed bed and a sludge bed leachate percolates from the waste through perforated pipes in the ground and surface channels to the leachate collection tank it is then mechanically pumped through a metallic pipe to the equalisation tank in which hydrochloric acid is added to reduce the leachate s alkalinity the leachate is then mechanically pumped from the equalisation tank to the sedimentation tank in which suspended solids settle by gravity the settled solids are drained through pipes at the bottom of the tank to the sludge bed excess leachate from the sedimentation tank flows by gravity through a wide pipe to the aeration tank in which impellers spin the leachate to aerate it leachate from the aeration tank then overflows to the clarifier tank where the formed sludge settles at the bottom of the tank by gravity scrappers at the bottom of the clarifier drain the settled sludge centripetally to the sludge bed and the highest percentage is pumped back to the aeration tank for further treatment finally an overflow of the leachate from the clarifier joins the reed bed maturation pond for the final aerobic treatment from where it enters the kitetikka stream the effectiveness of the leachate treatment plant was evaluated during the field observations of the state and functioning of the plant in line with the requirements for reducing leachate pollution potential additionally the difference in the quality of the leachate entering and leaving the plant was used to show the efficiency of the plant 2 2 sample collection samples of the leachate surface water and groundwater were collected in and around the landfill for four months november 2017 to february 2018 once each month in the locations shown in fig 2 the coordinates of the sample collection points are provided in the supplementary material fig 3 shows the collection of surface water samples from each position three different samples were collected all water and leachate samples were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles according to guidelines by world health organisation who 2017 immediately stored in separate insulated iceboxes and transported below 4 c to the laboratory where analysis started immediately for groundwater three samples were collected for each month from each of the following locations i a borehole upstream of the landfill about 1 km from the landfill east of the landfill ii a borehole just outside the landfill boundary on the western side of the landfill iii a groundwater monitoring well at the landfill near the leachate treatment plant iv a groundwater monitoring well that had not been used for a long and was under a bush in the southeast of the landfill for surface water three samples were collected for each month from each of the following points of the kitetikka stream i 1000 m upstream of the landfill ii downstream just before the point of leachate release from the treatment plant iii about 1000 m downstream of the leachate treatment plant similarly three leachate samples were collected from each of the following points for each sample collection month i the leachate collection tank before leachate treatment ii the clarifier after treatment but before discharge to the reed bed iii a location through which leachate escapes to the kitetikka stream without treatment 2 3 laboratory analysis chemical analyses of the samples were conducted using methods described by nollet de gelder 2013 ammonium was determined using the colorimetric method and nitrate using high performance liquid chromatography sodium and calcium concentrations were obtained using atomic absorption spectrometry while potassium concentration was determined using flame photometry ph was determined using a ph meter while electric conductivity ec was determined using an ec meter 2 4 data analysis data were analysed using spss ibm 25 the assumptions of anova were tested for each variable before testing for differences in means normality was tested using skewness and kurtosis and homogeneity of variance was tested using leven s test anova was then conducted for the parameters that met the assumptions the brown forsythe test for equality of means was used for the parameters that did not meet the assumption of homogeneity of variance means were compared using fischer s protected least significant difference at 0 05 and 95 confidence interval for the brown forsythe test and anova respectively means comparisons were made between the values of the different types of samples results of an environmental audit of the landfill conducted from june to november 2013 air water earth ltd 2013 were also used to determine the changes in the water resources since the audit among the audit s objectives were to describe the landfill s physical biological and socio cultural conditions review previous environmental impact assessments for the landfill and assess landfill compliance with national regulations however it was faced with the challenge of the absence of past environmental approval conditions as there was no baseline information about compliance and monitoring requirements during the landfill operation 3 results 3 1 state leachate treatment plant several management and operational issues in the leachate treatment process were identified at the kiteezi landfill namely 1 there is no monitoring of the leachate composition at the kiteezi landfill because the laboratory is non functional however regular monitoring of leachate composition is crucial in leachate management for environmental protection hence the lack of monitoring could have serious consequences when large amounts of hazardous material are brought to a wds making leachate highly concentrated in toxic chemicals 2 although there are supposed to be two aerators in the aeration tank of the leachate treatment plant only one was operational at the time of the study 3 the acid solution required to reduce leachate ph was no longer being added to the leachate in the equalisation tank at the time of the study 4 the leachate collection system does not have an impermeable liner to prevent the perforation of untreated leachate into the deeper soil layers 3 2 leachate composition table 1 shows the composition of the leachate collected from the different sources at the kiteezi landfill the composition of the leachate collected from the same source did not significantly vary with the sampling month however leachate composition at the kiteezi landfill varied significantly p 0 05 with the source of the leachate all parameters varied significantly p 0 05 between the leachate from the different sources the treated leachate from the clarifier had higher values of ph 9 1 0 10 ec 22 384 879 µs cm nitrate 0 469 0 035 mg l and potassium 320 30 mg l than the untreated leachate from the leachate collection tank but lower ammonium concentration the treated leachate had higher ph and ec than the raw leachate escaping into the stream but lower ammonium nitrate and potassium concentrations furthermore there were also significant p 0 05 variations between the composition of the raw leachate from the collection tank and the one from the point at which leachate escapes to the kitetikka stream the leachate flowing into the stream had higher ph and ammonium concentration than the escaping leachate but lower concentrations of all other nutrients the concentration of all nutrients in both the treated and untreated leachate except nitrate and sodium was above the national standards for effluent discharge 3 3 groundwater quality table 1 shows the quality of surface and groundwater at the kiteezi landfill showing the mean and standard error of parameters at each water source all parameters varied significantly p 0 005 with the groundwater source water from the monitoring well under bush had significantly higher levels of ph 6 8 0 14 ec 709 31 8 µs cm nitrate 0 025 0 005 mg l ammonium 1313 145 3 mg l potassium 17 53 1 76 mg l calcium 35 75 1 73 mg l and sodium 10 32 0 10 mg l than all the other groundwater sources table 1 after the monitoring well under the bush the borehole at the furthest distance had the highest concentration of all nutrients the borehole just outside the landfill boundary on the western side had the lowest concentration of all nutrients except nitrate and ph the nitrate concentration and ph at this site were not significantly higher than the monitoring well next to the leachate treatment plant all parameters in the groundwater from all sources were below the national standards for portable water for uganda except ammonium the ammonium concentrations from all water sources were higher than the standards all groundwater sources had lower ph and concentrations of nitrate and sodium but higher ammonium concentrations than the 2013 audit values the monitoring well under bush had higher ec ammonium and potassium than the audit 3 4 surface water quality concentrations of all measured parameters of the surface water did not vary with the sampling time however all parameters varied significantly p 0 005 with the location from which the water was collected surface water collected from the point at which untreated leachate enters the stream had significantly higher values for all measured parameters than the other two samples levels were comparable to those in raw leachate water collected upstream of the landfill had significantly p 0 005 higher ph ec and concentrations of all other measured nutrients than the water collected downstream except nitrate and potassium the concentration of all nutrients in the surface water at the point of raw leachate entry except ph nitrate and sodium were above the national standard for drinking water all surface water sources had ammonium concentrations higher than those recorded in 2013 and national standards for drinking water table 1 the upstream and treated leachate entry points had potassium calcium and sodium concentrations which were lower than the 2013 values and the national standards the ph of all the surface water was within the range for the national standards for portable water and was relatively comparable to the ph obtained during the 2013 audit table 1 similarly the ec of the water collected upstream and near the leachate treatment plant was below the national standard and comparable to the 2013 audit values but the ec at the point of untreated leachate entry was higher than the 2013 audit values nitrate concentrations from all water sources were higher than the 2013 audit value but lower than the national standard 4 discussion 4 1 leachate composition the ph observed in this study is in line with the range of 7 09 to 9 3 reported by other researchers for raw untreated leachate aderemi et al 2011 fatta et al 1999 mishra et al 2019 rathod et al 2013 singh et al 2008 similarly the high conductivity is in agreement with other studies that have reported values for untreated leachate ranging from 3830 to 42 400 µs cm aderemi et al 2011 fadhullah et al 2019 fatta et al 1999 rathod et al 2013 the extremely high electrical conductivity indicates a high concentration of anions and cations in the leachate furthermore the high levels of ammonium concentration in the leachate observed in this study are within the ranges reported by vaccari et al 2019 1013 1599 mg l and robinson 2007 1035 1511 mg l for untreated leachate such high ammonium levels are typical of leachate from old landfills renou et al 2008 contrarily nitrate concentration was much lower than the values ranging from 60 to 525 mg l reported by other researchers longe balogun 2010 mishra et al 2019 singh et al 2008 the extremely high ammonium concentrations pose an environmental risk because large amounts of ammonia are extremely toxic to bacteria and affect microorganisms required to break down pollutants in the leachate the potassium concentration is in line with the mean of 135 mg l reported by singh et al 2008 but much lower than values reported by other researchers which range from 1155 to 6000 mg l aderemi et al 2011 fatta et al 1999 mishra et al 2019 the sodium concentration in this study was also much lower than that reported by other studies fatta et al 1999 mishra et al 2019 the calcium range was in line with the range 360 340 mg l reported by mishra et al 2019 but higher than the ranges reported by fatta et al 1999 and singh et al 2008 leachate composition is highly variable depending on many interrelated factors like wds design operation age waste composition and depth and the presence of moisture and oxygen aderemi et al 2011 reinhart et al 2002 the differences between the treated and untreated leachate indicate the inefficiency of the treatment process in reducing the leachate s polluting power the decrease in ammonium concentration during treatment from 1760 to 790 mg l and increase in nitrate concentration are attributed to the aeration process which increases ammonium conversion to nitrate extended aeration has generally been viewed as an effective and cheap method for removing pathogens organic and inorganic matter however the concentrations of most nutrients in the treated leachate were higher than the national standards for effluent discharge the major problems are the absence of the second aerator and the lack of ph buffering during leachate treatment the nitrifying bacteria require dissolved oxygen of 1 0 mg l or more to function correctly kim et al 2013 which could probably not be achieved by the single aerator at the landfill additionally adequate buffering alkalinity approximately 50 100 mg l caco3 is required to enhance nitrifying bacteria s performance the aeration process could be improved by longer retention of leachate or a second aerator the lower ammonium concentration in the escaping leachate than the leachate from the collection tank could be attributed to more oxygen potentially mixing with the leachate at the escape point contributing to the higher nitrate levels in this leachate and lower ammonium on the other hand the lower concentration of potassium calcium and sodium observed in the leachate from the collection tank could be attributed to the settlement of these ions at the tank s bottom with the sediments 4 2 impact on groundwater quality the mean groundwater ph in this study range 6 0 to 6 8 is similar to the study by longe balogun 2010 which equally reported acidic groundwater near landfills however the ec observed in this study is lower than the ec reported in other studies for groundwater near wds ranging from 320 to 4000 fatta et al 1999 han et al 2014 krčmar et al 2018 mishra et al 2019 rathod et al 2013 singh et al 2008 the lower ec could indicate a lower impact of the kiteezi landfill on groundwater than the other studied wds potassium concentration was low and within the range 1 53 43 mg l reported by singh et al 2008 sodium concentrations were also lower than those reported by other studies ranging from 20 4 872 mg l fatta et al 1999 han et al 2014 mishra et al 2019 singh et al 2008 calcium concentration fell within the range of 6 88 mg l reported by mishra et al 2019 but was generally lower than that in other studies han et al 2014 singh et al 2008 ammonium concentrations in this study were higher than those reported by other studies ranging from 0 01 to 11 61 mg l krčmar et al 2018 longe balogun 2010 rahim et al 2010 however the nitrate concentration was lower than that 0 1 73 5 mg l recorded in groundwater near landfills in other studies han et al 2014 longe balogun 2010 rahim et al 2010 singh et al 2008 low nitrate levels comparable to the present study 0 01 0 83 mg l were reported by krčmar et al 2018 the higher concentration of ammonium in all groundwater sources than the national standards for drinking water of uganda indicates contamination by leachate the higher groundwater ammonium concentration in the current study compared to 2013 audit indicates pollution of groundwater by the landfill since 2013 additionally the groundwater has become slightly acidic from neutral within the eight years since groundwater ph was lower than that observed in the audit 7 06 the differences in groundwater quality from the borehole on the west and the one in the east of the kiteezi landfill could be attributed to the variation in the water table depth around the landfill which is just 0 2 m in the east compared to 20 30 m in the west the shallower water table in the east explains the lower water quality in the borehole in that direction despite it being further from the landfill additionally the higher levels of all measured parameters in the groundwater from the monitoring well under bush could be attributed to contamination by human faeces found next to the well some were washed into the well by the rainwater contributing to the low quality of water in this well unknown people were using the bushes near this well to ease themselves highlighting the importance of restricting access to wds and having adequate hygiene facilities on sites additionally this well was next to the point at which raw leachate gets into the kitetikka stream in the southeast of the landfill the contaminated surface water could have seeped into the groundwater as the water table is only 0 2 m above ground level at this point 4 3 impact on surface water quality the ph of surface water range 6 2 8 7 in the study is similar to that reported for surface water in other studies alemayehu et al 2019 islam et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2020 naminata et al 2018 rathod et al 2013 the ec of the surface water before the point of raw leachate entry into the stream at the kiteezi is within ranges reported in other studies mekonnen et al 2020 ololade et al 2019 after the point of raw leachate entry the ec falls within the much higher values range 1640 17 544 μs cm reported at other wds alemayehu et al 2019 naminata et al 2018 rathod et al 2013 showing that the leachate is a major source of contamination for the kitetikka river sodium potassium and calcium concentrations were lower than in other studies alemayehu et al 2019 mekonnen et al 2020 ololade et al 2019 probably due to differences in the waste hence leachate composition and soil mineralogy other studies similarly reported low nitrate levels in surface water polluted by leachate han et al 2014 mekonnen et al 2020 however high nitrate concentration has also been reported ranging from 5 1 to 42 9 mg l alemayehu et al 2019 han et al 2014 omofunmi et al 2017 ammonium at the kiteezi landfill was higher than the levels reported by alemayehu et al 2019 probably due to the anaerobic conditions created by waterlogged conditions in the wetland into which the leachate enters the stream such conditions inhibit ammonium oxidation leading to higher ammonium levels and lower nitrate levels observed in this study the levels of the measured parameter in the surface water at the point of untreated leachate entry almost equal to the leachate composition highlight the problems caused for surface water resources by improper management of leachate at wds there is escape of raw leachate on several points along the kiteezi landfill due to design inefficiencies for leachate flow aryampa et al 2021b and blocked leachate collection channels due to the 2017 waste collapse this direct entry of leachate into the stream is disastrous for the water quality and aquatic life downstream of the entry point research is needed to determine how far this contamination of the surface water goes along the stream moreover most of the vegetation in the wetland around the entry point was scorched reducing the efficiency of phytoremediation of the papyrus reed bed also the leachate treatment plant is not well protected from stormwater so leachate mixes with the water and washes directly into the stream during heavy rains the higher values of parameters from the surface water collected upstream of the landfill than downstream before the point of raw leachate entry indicate other pollution sources within the area beside the kiteezi landfill these include waste recycling factories located upstream of the landfill that discharge their liquid waste into the stream without prior treatment the presence of wds usually encourages the development of related recycling companies in nearby areas the pollution from the different sources along the stream needs investigation the impact of the landfill has gone beyond surface water quality to affect water access and security water with low quality observed for surface water and groundwater in this study is unsuitable for human consumption as it is a substantial threat to human health posing a public health risk to the local community the local communities initially used water from the kitetika stream for domestic purposes as well as human and animal consumption at points located both upstream and downstream of the landfill aryampa et al 2021a in assessing the quality of drinking water consumers rely principally upon their senses water with very high turbidity colour or unpleasant taste or odour is usually regarded as unsafe who 2017 therefore water usage from points near the landfill for domestic purposes ceased due to the water s darkened and milky colour fig 3 additionally the use of polluted water for irrigation and in a nearby fishpond or feeding animals poses food safety problems in the area 5 conclusions and recommendations the study highlighted the concern for both groundwater and surface water quality at the kiteezi landfill the probable pollution of groundwater by the leachate is indicated by the high ammonium concentration the groundwater pollution is a significant health risk for the local community that depend on it for human consumption therefore further research into the impact of the water pollution on the health of the residents of the kiteezi community is essential the continued direct discharge of improperly treated leachate into the environment at the kiteezi landfill has long term implications for sustainability and water security the impact of the landfill leachate on the ecologically important walufumbe wetland and on the general aquatic ecosystem health and resilience also require further research to prevent further pollution appropriate management strategies of leachate are required although repairing the leachate treatment plant and continuous monitoring are crucial they require significant funding usually unavailable in developing countries therefore cheaper measures like constructing channels with appropriate dimensions for collecting the leachate and preventing its movement into the environment can go a long way in preventing further pollution longer leachate retention in additional ponds and phytoremediation may also

921,there is a knowledge gap on the extent of the impact of waste disposal sites on water resources in uganda this study assessed the effectiveness of the leachate treatment process and the extent of water pollution by the leachate at the biggest sanitary landfill in east africa the kiteezi landfill samples of leachate surface water and groundwater were collected in and around the landfill for four months results showed that leachate treatment at the landfill is ineffective for reducing its pollution potential all the measured parameters except nitrate and sodium were above uganda s national standards for effluent discharge after treatment treated leachate had higher ph 9 1 0 10 ec 22 384 879 µs cm and concentrations of nitrate 0 469 0 035 mg l and potassium 320 30 mg l than the untreated leachate but lower ammonium concentration the groundwater had very high concentration of ammonium range 67 8 1313 mg l indicating possible pollution by leachate additionally surface water from the point at which untreated leachate enters the kitetikka stream had values comparable to raw leachate for all measured parameters the study recommends the improvement of the leachate collection and treatment system to reduce untreated leachate flow into the surface water further study into the health impact of the water quality on the local community is essential keywords kiteezi landfill landfill leachate waste disposal sites water pollution surface water groundwater 1 introduction waste disposal sites wds pose serious threats to the health quality and resilience of all ecosystems and human health ihedioha et al 2017 however waste disposal remains the primary means for managing municipal solid waste msw in developing countries because it is inexpensive and a readily available option to these countries ferronato torretta 2019 unfortunately the disposal is mostly done indiscriminately in open dumps where all kinds of untreated wastes are discarded with minimal or no covering moreover due to limited resources and poor management in developing countries precautions at the setup and operation of wds are not adequately addressed idowu et al 2019 with waste amounts increasing alarmingly in most parts of the world powell et al 2018 the pressure placed on wds is worsening and the need to open up more land for disposal is increasing aryampa et al 2019 alternatively existing sites in developing countries are being used beyond their carrying capacities due to resource limitations for setting up new sites consequently numerous disposal sites in developing countries have reached unsustainable points abd el salam abu zuid 2015 aryampa et al 2021a majolagbe et al 2017 and protecting the environment from the solid waste hazards is becoming a significant challenge the main concern from wds in regard to water resources is leachate which can cause significant impacts even in small quantities due to its high concentration of pollutants since most wds receive large quantities of highly hazardous materials abd el salam abu zuid 2015 aryampa et al 2021b erses et al 2005 leachate from most sites can considerably alter the water quality parameters and result in water quality degradation kareem et al 2016 moreover it is impossible to eliminate dangerous and deleterious chemicals from msw because many products used in homes and commercial areas are potentially hazardous to the environment and public health slack et al 2005 hence wds leachates potentially carry carcinogens and other toxic chemicals yet not all potentially hazardous chemicals in leachates have standards lee jones lee 1994 the growing use of more land for waste disposal especially in developing countries creates a rising threat to water resources lebreton andrady 2019 with more land being used for waste disposal especially beyond its carrying capacity aryampa et al 2019 the risk of water resources being contaminated by waste or subsequent leachates increases aryampa et al 2019 accordingly several studies from different parts of the world have reported contamination of groundwater and surface water by wds leachate associated with the movement of leachate into water sources abd el salam abu zuid 2015 alemayehu et al 2019 krika et al 2021 nyika onyari 2019 ololade et al 2019 in uganda leachate escaping into the surrounding water is among the most significant concern regarding the operation of wds aryampa et al 2021a mwiganga kansiime 2005 most sites do not have proper leachate management and yet they continue to be used beyond their capacities moreover most local populations in the areas of wds locations rely on either groundwater or surface water for home usage and agriculture directorate of water development 2019 however research about water contamination has generally not received adequate attention in the country and is still insufficient in africa kareem et al 2016 most studies about landfills impact give qualitative descriptions of water contamination gbolo 2021 madinah hanifah 2019 nabukeera et al 2015 and quantitate research showing the extent of the pollution are still limited hence there is a knowledge gap on the extent of the impact of wds on water resources in the country and the consequent loss of water security to wds therefore the objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the leachate treatment process at the kiteezi landfill and the extent of groundwater and surface water contamination by the leachate from the landfill 2 methodology the study was conducted through 1 fieldwork including the assessment of the leachate collection plant and field sample collection over four months followed by 2 laboratory analysis of the samples followed by 3 data analysis of laboratory results 2 1 study site the kiteezi landfill is the biggest landfill in east africa located 13 km from kampala city at latitude 0o 25 0 and longitude 32o 34 00 aryampa et al 2021a the landfill is 25 years old and occupies 35 acres its capacity ran out in 2009 but it still receives about 1300 tons of municipal solid waste daily from kampala city and neighbouring areas of wakiso district both organic and recyclable waste is deposited at the site but informal waste pickers pick out most of the recyclable waste for income aryampa et al 2022 about 60 of the solid waste generated in kampala city is disposed of at the landfill aryampa et al 2019 although the site is due for closure and plans for its closure and for a new landfill site are underway there have been several reports of environmental pollution by the landfill over the years of its existence kampala city council 2008a mwiganga kansiime 2005 additionally because of the landfill utilisation beyond its capacity and improper waste slopes waste in the landfill collapsed in 2017 after the incident efforts to stabilise the waste in the leachate treatment plant s direction blocked some channels for directing raw leachate to the treatment plant causing the leachate to find other routes and ending up in the stream without treatment the climate of the landfill location is tropical equatorial with bimodal rainfall and the area has a long rainfall season from march to june and a short rainy season from november to december with yearly variations the average rainfall is 1300 mm per annum with mean daily maximum and minimum temperatures of about 28 c and 16 5 c respectively the landfill site has a smooth rolling terrain with hilly surroundings on the southern and eastern sides the predominant geological layer is the granite gneiss sub stratum and the minor layer in the swamp is the alluvial sediment kampala city council 2008b the primary vegetation surrounding the landfill is short grass with a few trees and shrubs but the entire eastern boundary is part of an ecologically important wetland the walufumbe swamp with relatively thick vegetation and papyrus reeds the walufumbe wetland is a seasonal wetland formed along river walufumbe covering an area of 1 33 km2 in a shallow but broad valley between several hills with an altitude ranging between 1143 1173 48 m ndibaisa 2013 the wetland drains into the victoria nile catchment the general drainage pattern of the landfill location is semi dendrite forming a regional catchment area kcc 2008 groundwater generally flows towards the walufumbe wetland kampala city council 2008b the drainage density around the landfill is low 50 76 km km2 to moderate 77 112 km km2 but there is a high groundwater potential birungi 2019 the major hydrologic feature is a perennial stream kitetikka located about 500 m from the landfill in the valley bottom flowing southeast of the landfill through the walufumbe wetland the groundwater table is at an average depth of about 30 35 m on the west air water earth ltd 2013 but the depth decreases towards the east with the lowest depth of 0 2 m on the eastern side there are numerous small gardens around the landfill in the wetland on the southeast side of the landfill which is not surrounded by homes water from the stream is used for irrigating these gardens through channels that direct water from the stream to the individual gardens in addition there are several boreholes within the 2 km radius around the landfill from which water for human consumption and domestic use is obtained 2 1 1 the leachate treatment plant at the kiteezi landfill fig 1 shows the flowchart of leachate treatment plant at the kiteezi landfill the plant comprises the leachate collection tank equalisation tank sedimentation tank aeration tank clarifier a reed bed and a sludge bed leachate percolates from the waste through perforated pipes in the ground and surface channels to the leachate collection tank it is then mechanically pumped through a metallic pipe to the equalisation tank in which hydrochloric acid is added to reduce the leachate s alkalinity the leachate is then mechanically pumped from the equalisation tank to the sedimentation tank in which suspended solids settle by gravity the settled solids are drained through pipes at the bottom of the tank to the sludge bed excess leachate from the sedimentation tank flows by gravity through a wide pipe to the aeration tank in which impellers spin the leachate to aerate it leachate from the aeration tank then overflows to the clarifier tank where the formed sludge settles at the bottom of the tank by gravity scrappers at the bottom of the clarifier drain the settled sludge centripetally to the sludge bed and the highest percentage is pumped back to the aeration tank for further treatment finally an overflow of the leachate from the clarifier joins the reed bed maturation pond for the final aerobic treatment from where it enters the kitetikka stream the effectiveness of the leachate treatment plant was evaluated during the field observations of the state and functioning of the plant in line with the requirements for reducing leachate pollution potential additionally the difference in the quality of the leachate entering and leaving the plant was used to show the efficiency of the plant 2 2 sample collection samples of the leachate surface water and groundwater were collected in and around the landfill for four months november 2017 to february 2018 once each month in the locations shown in fig 2 the coordinates of the sample collection points are provided in the supplementary material fig 3 shows the collection of surface water samples from each position three different samples were collected all water and leachate samples were collected in high density polyethylene hdpe bottles according to guidelines by world health organisation who 2017 immediately stored in separate insulated iceboxes and transported below 4 c to the laboratory where analysis started immediately for groundwater three samples were collected for each month from each of the following locations i a borehole upstream of the landfill about 1 km from the landfill east of the landfill ii a borehole just outside the landfill boundary on the western side of the landfill iii a groundwater monitoring well at the landfill near the leachate treatment plant iv a groundwater monitoring well that had not been used for a long and was under a bush in the southeast of the landfill for surface water three samples were collected for each month from each of the following points of the kitetikka stream i 1000 m upstream of the landfill ii downstream just before the point of leachate release from the treatment plant iii about 1000 m downstream of the leachate treatment plant similarly three leachate samples were collected from each of the following points for each sample collection month i the leachate collection tank before leachate treatment ii the clarifier after treatment but before discharge to the reed bed iii a location through which leachate escapes to the kitetikka stream without treatment 2 3 laboratory analysis chemical analyses of the samples were conducted using methods described by nollet de gelder 2013 ammonium was determined using the colorimetric method and nitrate using high performance liquid chromatography sodium and calcium concentrations were obtained using atomic absorption spectrometry while potassium concentration was determined using flame photometry ph was determined using a ph meter while electric conductivity ec was determined using an ec meter 2 4 data analysis data were analysed using spss ibm 25 the assumptions of anova were tested for each variable before testing for differences in means normality was tested using skewness and kurtosis and homogeneity of variance was tested using leven s test anova was then conducted for the parameters that met the assumptions the brown forsythe test for equality of means was used for the parameters that did not meet the assumption of homogeneity of variance means were compared using fischer s protected least significant difference at 0 05 and 95 confidence interval for the brown forsythe test and anova respectively means comparisons were made between the values of the different types of samples results of an environmental audit of the landfill conducted from june to november 2013 air water earth ltd 2013 were also used to determine the changes in the water resources since the audit among the audit s objectives were to describe the landfill s physical biological and socio cultural conditions review previous environmental impact assessments for the landfill and assess landfill compliance with national regulations however it was faced with the challenge of the absence of past environmental approval conditions as there was no baseline information about compliance and monitoring requirements during the landfill operation 3 results 3 1 state leachate treatment plant several management and operational issues in the leachate treatment process were identified at the kiteezi landfill namely 1 there is no monitoring of the leachate composition at the kiteezi landfill because the laboratory is non functional however regular monitoring of leachate composition is crucial in leachate management for environmental protection hence the lack of monitoring could have serious consequences when large amounts of hazardous material are brought to a wds making leachate highly concentrated in toxic chemicals 2 although there are supposed to be two aerators in the aeration tank of the leachate treatment plant only one was operational at the time of the study 3 the acid solution required to reduce leachate ph was no longer being added to the leachate in the equalisation tank at the time of the study 4 the leachate collection system does not have an impermeable liner to prevent the perforation of untreated leachate into the deeper soil layers 3 2 leachate composition table 1 shows the composition of the leachate collected from the different sources at the kiteezi landfill the composition of the leachate collected from the same source did not significantly vary with the sampling month however leachate composition at the kiteezi landfill varied significantly p 0 05 with the source of the leachate all parameters varied significantly p 0 05 between the leachate from the different sources the treated leachate from the clarifier had higher values of ph 9 1 0 10 ec 22 384 879 µs cm nitrate 0 469 0 035 mg l and potassium 320 30 mg l than the untreated leachate from the leachate collection tank but lower ammonium concentration the treated leachate had higher ph and ec than the raw leachate escaping into the stream but lower ammonium nitrate and potassium concentrations furthermore there were also significant p 0 05 variations between the composition of the raw leachate from the collection tank and the one from the point at which leachate escapes to the kitetikka stream the leachate flowing into the stream had higher ph and ammonium concentration than the escaping leachate but lower concentrations of all other nutrients the concentration of all nutrients in both the treated and untreated leachate except nitrate and sodium was above the national standards for effluent discharge 3 3 groundwater quality table 1 shows the quality of surface and groundwater at the kiteezi landfill showing the mean and standard error of parameters at each water source all parameters varied significantly p 0 005 with the groundwater source water from the monitoring well under bush had significantly higher levels of ph 6 8 0 14 ec 709 31 8 µs cm nitrate 0 025 0 005 mg l ammonium 1313 145 3 mg l potassium 17 53 1 76 mg l calcium 35 75 1 73 mg l and sodium 10 32 0 10 mg l than all the other groundwater sources table 1 after the monitoring well under the bush the borehole at the furthest distance had the highest concentration of all nutrients the borehole just outside the landfill boundary on the western side had the lowest concentration of all nutrients except nitrate and ph the nitrate concentration and ph at this site were not significantly higher than the monitoring well next to the leachate treatment plant all parameters in the groundwater from all sources were below the national standards for portable water for uganda except ammonium the ammonium concentrations from all water sources were higher than the standards all groundwater sources had lower ph and concentrations of nitrate and sodium but higher ammonium concentrations than the 2013 audit values the monitoring well under bush had higher ec ammonium and potassium than the audit 3 4 surface water quality concentrations of all measured parameters of the surface water did not vary with the sampling time however all parameters varied significantly p 0 005 with the location from which the water was collected surface water collected from the point at which untreated leachate enters the stream had significantly higher values for all measured parameters than the other two samples levels were comparable to those in raw leachate water collected upstream of the landfill had significantly p 0 005 higher ph ec and concentrations of all other measured nutrients than the water collected downstream except nitrate and potassium the concentration of all nutrients in the surface water at the point of raw leachate entry except ph nitrate and sodium were above the national standard for drinking water all surface water sources had ammonium concentrations higher than those recorded in 2013 and national standards for drinking water table 1 the upstream and treated leachate entry points had potassium calcium and sodium concentrations which were lower than the 2013 values and the national standards the ph of all the surface water was within the range for the national standards for portable water and was relatively comparable to the ph obtained during the 2013 audit table 1 similarly the ec of the water collected upstream and near the leachate treatment plant was below the national standard and comparable to the 2013 audit values but the ec at the point of untreated leachate entry was higher than the 2013 audit values nitrate concentrations from all water sources were higher than the 2013 audit value but lower than the national standard 4 discussion 4 1 leachate composition the ph observed in this study is in line with the range of 7 09 to 9 3 reported by other researchers for raw untreated leachate aderemi et al 2011 fatta et al 1999 mishra et al 2019 rathod et al 2013 singh et al 2008 similarly the high conductivity is in agreement with other studies that have reported values for untreated leachate ranging from 3830 to 42 400 µs cm aderemi et al 2011 fadhullah et al 2019 fatta et al 1999 rathod et al 2013 the extremely high electrical conductivity indicates a high concentration of anions and cations in the leachate furthermore the high levels of ammonium concentration in the leachate observed in this study are within the ranges reported by vaccari et al 2019 1013 1599 mg l and robinson 2007 1035 1511 mg l for untreated leachate such high ammonium levels are typical of leachate from old landfills renou et al 2008 contrarily nitrate concentration was much lower than the values ranging from 60 to 525 mg l reported by other researchers longe balogun 2010 mishra et al 2019 singh et al 2008 the extremely high ammonium concentrations pose an environmental risk because large amounts of ammonia are extremely toxic to bacteria and affect microorganisms required to break down pollutants in the leachate the potassium concentration is in line with the mean of 135 mg l reported by singh et al 2008 but much lower than values reported by other researchers which range from 1155 to 6000 mg l aderemi et al 2011 fatta et al 1999 mishra et al 2019 the sodium concentration in this study was also much lower than that reported by other studies fatta et al 1999 mishra et al 2019 the calcium range was in line with the range 360 340 mg l reported by mishra et al 2019 but higher than the ranges reported by fatta et al 1999 and singh et al 2008 leachate composition is highly variable depending on many interrelated factors like wds design operation age waste composition and depth and the presence of moisture and oxygen aderemi et al 2011 reinhart et al 2002 the differences between the treated and untreated leachate indicate the inefficiency of the treatment process in reducing the leachate s polluting power the decrease in ammonium concentration during treatment from 1760 to 790 mg l and increase in nitrate concentration are attributed to the aeration process which increases ammonium conversion to nitrate extended aeration has generally been viewed as an effective and cheap method for removing pathogens organic and inorganic matter however the concentrations of most nutrients in the treated leachate were higher than the national standards for effluent discharge the major problems are the absence of the second aerator and the lack of ph buffering during leachate treatment the nitrifying bacteria require dissolved oxygen of 1 0 mg l or more to function correctly kim et al 2013 which could probably not be achieved by the single aerator at the landfill additionally adequate buffering alkalinity approximately 50 100 mg l caco3 is required to enhance nitrifying bacteria s performance the aeration process could be improved by longer retention of leachate or a second aerator the lower ammonium concentration in the escaping leachate than the leachate from the collection tank could be attributed to more oxygen potentially mixing with the leachate at the escape point contributing to the higher nitrate levels in this leachate and lower ammonium on the other hand the lower concentration of potassium calcium and sodium observed in the leachate from the collection tank could be attributed to the settlement of these ions at the tank s bottom with the sediments 4 2 impact on groundwater quality the mean groundwater ph in this study range 6 0 to 6 8 is similar to the study by longe balogun 2010 which equally reported acidic groundwater near landfills however the ec observed in this study is lower than the ec reported in other studies for groundwater near wds ranging from 320 to 4000 fatta et al 1999 han et al 2014 krčmar et al 2018 mishra et al 2019 rathod et al 2013 singh et al 2008 the lower ec could indicate a lower impact of the kiteezi landfill on groundwater than the other studied wds potassium concentration was low and within the range 1 53 43 mg l reported by singh et al 2008 sodium concentrations were also lower than those reported by other studies ranging from 20 4 872 mg l fatta et al 1999 han et al 2014 mishra et al 2019 singh et al 2008 calcium concentration fell within the range of 6 88 mg l reported by mishra et al 2019 but was generally lower than that in other studies han et al 2014 singh et al 2008 ammonium concentrations in this study were higher than those reported by other studies ranging from 0 01 to 11 61 mg l krčmar et al 2018 longe balogun 2010 rahim et al 2010 however the nitrate concentration was lower than that 0 1 73 5 mg l recorded in groundwater near landfills in other studies han et al 2014 longe balogun 2010 rahim et al 2010 singh et al 2008 low nitrate levels comparable to the present study 0 01 0 83 mg l were reported by krčmar et al 2018 the higher concentration of ammonium in all groundwater sources than the national standards for drinking water of uganda indicates contamination by leachate the higher groundwater ammonium concentration in the current study compared to 2013 audit indicates pollution of groundwater by the landfill since 2013 additionally the groundwater has become slightly acidic from neutral within the eight years since groundwater ph was lower than that observed in the audit 7 06 the differences in groundwater quality from the borehole on the west and the one in the east of the kiteezi landfill could be attributed to the variation in the water table depth around the landfill which is just 0 2 m in the east compared to 20 30 m in the west the shallower water table in the east explains the lower water quality in the borehole in that direction despite it being further from the landfill additionally the higher levels of all measured parameters in the groundwater from the monitoring well under bush could be attributed to contamination by human faeces found next to the well some were washed into the well by the rainwater contributing to the low quality of water in this well unknown people were using the bushes near this well to ease themselves highlighting the importance of restricting access to wds and having adequate hygiene facilities on sites additionally this well was next to the point at which raw leachate gets into the kitetikka stream in the southeast of the landfill the contaminated surface water could have seeped into the groundwater as the water table is only 0 2 m above ground level at this point 4 3 impact on surface water quality the ph of surface water range 6 2 8 7 in the study is similar to that reported for surface water in other studies alemayehu et al 2019 islam et al 2013 mekonnen et al 2020 naminata et al 2018 rathod et al 2013 the ec of the surface water before the point of raw leachate entry into the stream at the kiteezi is within ranges reported in other studies mekonnen et al 2020 ololade et al 2019 after the point of raw leachate entry the ec falls within the much higher values range 1640 17 544 μs cm reported at other wds alemayehu et al 2019 naminata et al 2018 rathod et al 2013 showing that the leachate is a major source of contamination for the kitetikka river sodium potassium and calcium concentrations were lower than in other studies alemayehu et al 2019 mekonnen et al 2020 ololade et al 2019 probably due to differences in the waste hence leachate composition and soil mineralogy other studies similarly reported low nitrate levels in surface water polluted by leachate han et al 2014 mekonnen et al 2020 however high nitrate concentration has also been reported ranging from 5 1 to 42 9 mg l alemayehu et al 2019 han et al 2014 omofunmi et al 2017 ammonium at the kiteezi landfill was higher than the levels reported by alemayehu et al 2019 probably due to the anaerobic conditions created by waterlogged conditions in the wetland into which the leachate enters the stream such conditions inhibit ammonium oxidation leading to higher ammonium levels and lower nitrate levels observed in this study the levels of the measured parameter in the surface water at the point of untreated leachate entry almost equal to the leachate composition highlight the problems caused for surface water resources by improper management of leachate at wds there is escape of raw leachate on several points along the kiteezi landfill due to design inefficiencies for leachate flow aryampa et al 2021b and blocked leachate collection channels due to the 2017 waste collapse this direct entry of leachate into the stream is disastrous for the water quality and aquatic life downstream of the entry point research is needed to determine how far this contamination of the surface water goes along the stream moreover most of the vegetation in the wetland around the entry point was scorched reducing the efficiency of phytoremediation of the papyrus reed bed also the leachate treatment plant is not well protected from stormwater so leachate mixes with the water and washes directly into the stream during heavy rains the higher values of parameters from the surface water collected upstream of the landfill than downstream before the point of raw leachate entry indicate other pollution sources within the area beside the kiteezi landfill these include waste recycling factories located upstream of the landfill that discharge their liquid waste into the stream without prior treatment the presence of wds usually encourages the development of related recycling companies in nearby areas the pollution from the different sources along the stream needs investigation the impact of the landfill has gone beyond surface water quality to affect water access and security water with low quality observed for surface water and groundwater in this study is unsuitable for human consumption as it is a substantial threat to human health posing a public health risk to the local community the local communities initially used water from the kitetika stream for domestic purposes as well as human and animal consumption at points located both upstream and downstream of the landfill aryampa et al 2021a in assessing the quality of drinking water consumers rely principally upon their senses water with very high turbidity colour or unpleasant taste or odour is usually regarded as unsafe who 2017 therefore water usage from points near the landfill for domestic purposes ceased due to the water s darkened and milky colour fig 3 additionally the use of polluted water for irrigation and in a nearby fishpond or feeding animals poses food safety problems in the area 5 conclusions and recommendations the study highlighted the concern for both groundwater and surface water quality at the kiteezi landfill the probable pollution of groundwater by the leachate is indicated by the high ammonium concentration the groundwater pollution is a significant health risk for the local community that depend on it for human consumption therefore further research into the impact of the water pollution on the health of the residents of the kiteezi community is essential the continued direct discharge of improperly treated leachate into the environment at the kiteezi landfill has long term implications for sustainability and water security the impact of the landfill leachate on the ecologically important walufumbe wetland and on the general aquatic ecosystem health and resilience also require further research to prevent further pollution appropriate management strategies of leachate are required although repairing the leachate treatment plant and continuous monitoring are crucial they require significant funding usually unavailable in developing countries therefore cheaper measures like constructing channels with appropriate dimensions for collecting the leachate and preventing its movement into the environment can go a long way in preventing further pollution longer leachate retention in additional ponds and phytoremediation may also be affordable options at the landfill since the landfill is due for closure with the development of a new landfill underway planning for aftercare and remediation are vital declaration of competing

shifting of forest land to agricultural land and continued cropping li et al 2021 throughout india nearly 37 of the total geographical area 120 70 mha is deteriorated due to a variety of natural and sociocultural factors naas 2010 and in this context to attain land degradation neutrality india intends to have restored 26 million hectares of degraded land by 2030 singh and tewari 2021 soil hydraulic characteristics are important for water and solute flow evaporation runoff generation soil water storage and deep percolation and even for regulating the rainfall and snow meltwater partitioning bodhinayake and si 2004 zhang et al 2021 understanding soil hydraulic properties shps is indispensable for visualising the mechanisms of the hydrologic cycle water management and transport processes hillel 1998 as a result assessing soil hydraulic response to various land use regimes may aid in the long term management of ecologically sensitive and vulnerable agroecosystems patra et al 2019a zhang et al 2021 however poor soil hydraulic property reduces soil hydraulic conductivity water transmitting macro and mesopores moret and arrúe 2007 and reduces crop productivity chen et al 2021 in addition the shps control the functioning of the hydrological and ecological cycle of the watershed hence its better understanding is required chen et al 2021 moreover conversion of native lands to other management practices may significantly improve or degrade the soil properties in terms of soil pores hydraulic properties mean weighted diameter mwd bulk density bd soc zhang et al 2021 land use practices particularly root systems and amendment of organic matter play a pivotal role in modifying shps in terms of infiltration rate hydraulic conductivity water stable aggregates dong et al 2021 shi et al 2021 the hydraulic conductivity had both negative and positive correlations with soil organic matter som as evidenced from semiarid sandy soils it is adversely associated due to lower wettability produced by som in sandy soils wang et al 2009 however because of enhanced wettability and soil aggregation in loamy soil hydraulic conductivity is positively associated with som ellerbrock et al 2005 furthermore the compactness of soil as influenced by land management may also significantly affect the soil hydraulic properties and water infiltration rate kelishadi et al 2014 furthermore researchers discovered that tillage techniques had a considerable influence on the spatio temporal variation of soil hydraulic characteristics caused by changes in soil structure and biological activity buczko et al 2006 alletto and coquet 2009 schluter et al 2020 as a result various factors impact soil hydraulic characteristics including land management tillage soil texture som bulk density and mwd although natural climatic hazards pose risk to human livelihood and socioeconomic development such as crop failure due to water stress and erosion with nutrient transportation by excess water kar et al 2018 kar et al 2022 but by adopting conservation agriculture ca it minimizes the decomposition of soc and also reduces its transportation by erosion lal 2013 as in the case of ca the soil is not tilled or minimally tilled unlike traditional agriculture hence it had several environmental soil physical and chemical benefits by reducing consumption of nonrenewable energy sources promoting microbial growth improving soc amwd reducing erosion and greenhouse gas emission lal 2004 singh et al 2019 since ca improves soil biophysical qualities it provides a sustainable alternative to other cropping systems for enhancing soil health parihar et al 2016 soil structure changes dynamically among various land uses due to the complex interaction among the land use practices and shps ca improves soil structure and biological activity by boosting hydraulic conductivity water conducting macroporosity and decreasing tortuosity schwen et al 2011 singh et al 2021 the soil surface pore and soil hydraulic conductivity are important parameters of shp which vary with land use change and it regulates the infiltrability of soil and controls the hydrologic cycle and water balance bodhinayake and si 2004 sandin et al 2017 therefore the selection of suitable land use practices is important for sustainable soil environment management several methods tension disc infiltrometers hood infiltrometers guelph permeameter for infiltration measurement are available varying in process of water infiltration from the instrument to soil surface degrees of surface sealing pore clogging and disturbance of soil surface reynolds and elrick 1985 schwärzel and punzel 2007 schluter et al 2020 however despite accounting for a minute part of overall porosity the majority of water flow more than 65 is controlled by macropores during saturation bodhinayake si 2004 carey et al 2007 patra et al 2019a hence it is important to determine water conducting porosity and its contribution to total flow by meso and macropores for differentiating the characteristics of various land use systems using an undisturbed measurement technique in this context a unique non destructive infiltrometer hood infiltrometer may be utilised to quantify saturated soil hydraulic conductivity sshc near saturated soil hydraulic conductivity nsshc up to bubble point and macropores which otherwise will not be possible by other infiltrometers due to choking and surface sealing by the contact material in the latter one schwärzel and punzel 2007 although several other studies were done concerning shps under various cropping patterns the restoration pattern of soil to the original level is discussed in this paper despite much researches suggesting the impact of conservation agriculture limited quantitative data are available regarding changing patterns of shps from forest land to conventional land and further conservation agriculture for the himalayan region we hypothesized that although the conversion of native forest land to conventional agriculture land degrades the soil hydraulic properties the soil hydraulic properties will be restored gradually by adopting conservation agriculture practices in a nutshell the final aim of the study was to look at the influence of land use conversion on shps in india s n w himalayan area one of the world s most susceptible agroecosystems with these considerations in mind the goal of this research was to assess variations in shps in native forest land and subsequent agricultural areas under various management practices also the water conducting porosity at different pressure heads as well as the contribution of macro and mesopores to saturation flow was quantified furthermore to establish the relationship among different soil properties and to determine the relationship of k with other parameters for this purpose a scatter plot matrix was prepared the results may provide in depth knowledge for the selection of suitable land management practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the current investigation was undertaken at the selakui research farm of the icar iiswc dehradun india which is

meteorological parameters were obtained from the meteorological station of icar iiswc which is located close to the study field fig 1 depicts a map of the observation site s location 2 2 experimental details the research study was carried out in 2020 21 with four treatments control virgin sal forest shorea robusta l sf conventional tillage ct reduced tillage rt and zero tillage zt located adjacent to each other in a rainfed system of north western indian himalayas the ct rt and zt plots have an area of 450 m2 75 m 6 m each with rectangular shape the prevalent cropping pattern in agricultural land is wheat during rabi season followed by maize during kharif season whereas the undisturbed forest consists of virgin sal forest of 75 years old some portion of the sal forest was cut down during the 1980s and converted into agricultural lands however the conservation agriculture experiment was established in 2011 prior to that the land was under conventional agriculture practices in conventional tillage the traditional farmers practice was adopted where a tractor drawn tyne cultivator is used six times for ploughing 12 14 cm average tillage depth followed by planking for seedbed preparation and manual broadcasting of wheat and maize seeds during respective seasons in reduced tillage a tractor drawn tyne cultivator was used three times 9 11 cm average tillage depth followed by planking and here a seed drill was used for wheat sowing and maize is sown by manual row broadcasting in the case of a zero tillage a seed drill was used for the direct sowing of seeds without much physical disturbance to the soil the recommended p2o5 and k2o were applied as an initial dose combined with n 50 and the remaining n was given at 30 35 das and 60 das of maize for wheat recommended p2o5 and k2o were given as initial doses combined with n 50 the remaining n was applied at the cri and booting stages pre emergence herbicides such as atrazine or pendimethalin 1 5 kg a i ha 1 were used to suppress weeds in a maize field whereas 2 4 d 1 0 kg a i ha 1 and isoproturon 0 5 kg a i ha 1 were used after 35 40 das in wheat throughout the years precautions were made to avoid insect infestation and disease attacks in maize and wheat harvests 2 3 infiltration measurement using hood infiltrometer the infiltration rate and soil hydraulic conductivity of surface soil were investigated under the sal forest ct rt and zt land use during october 2020 using the hood infiltrometer 12 4 cm hood diameter with six replications in each plot during the in situ infiltration measurements three pressure heads h 0 1 and 3 cm were applied sequentially in all replications using the method proposed by schwärzel and punzel 2007 cumulative water infiltration was measured till the steady state infiltration ssi rate was obtained i e the increase in infiltration was the same over three constant periods it took around 50 mins for each pressure head to reach its steady state the infiltration measuring instrument mentioned above aids in determining the ssi rate from the saturation point to the soil s bubble point 2 4 estimation of soil hydraulic properties from infiltrometer experiment the data acquired from the infiltration experiment was analysed using the methodology outlined below firstly a relationship was established between hydraulic conductivity and its respective pressure head using wooding s analytical approach wooding 1968 the derived data were used to calculate shps viz the flow weighted mean pore radius matric flux potential reynolds et al 1995 maximum equivalent pore radius vomocil 1965 hydraulically active porosity watson and luxmoore 1986 bodhinayake et al 2004 as described below 2 4 1 saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivity following the methods laid out by ankeny et al 1991 the nexus between hydraulic conductivity k x and pressure head x was established from recorded steady state infiltration rates wooding 1968 approximation of steady state unconfined infiltration rate with a constant pressure head from a circular source at the soil surface is given by eq 1 1 q x k x π y 2 y f α where q x l3t 1 is the ssi rate water infiltration volume per unit time k x lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity at water potential of x y l is the hood radius f 0 25 is a shape factor α l 1 is the sorptive number or derivative of the hydraulic conductivity function the first component on the right side of the equation represents gravity force based water flow while the second term represents capillary force effect and supply source geometry kirkham 2005 and kelishadi et al 2014 the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to exponentially vary with pressure head as given by gardener as follows gardner 1958 2 k x k f s e x p α x where kfs lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and α l 1 is the sorptive number by putting eq 2 in eq 1 woodings solution had the following unknown values k f s and α which were calculated using two adjacent pressure heads 0 cm and 1 cm 1 cm and 3 cm as given below 3 q x k f s e x p α x π y 2 y g α the following equations were found by substituting two adjacent flow rates qhi and qhi 1 for respective pressure heads xi and xi 1 in eq 3 4 q x i k f s e x p α x i π y 2 y g α 5 q x i 1 k f s e x p α x i 1 π y 2 y g α α the sorptive number was calculated by solving the above equations and is given below 6 α i i 1 ln q x i q x i 1 x i x i 1 i 1 2 n 1 the equations below will be used to calculate k h for pressure heads 7 k 0 k 0 α 0 1 8 k 1 k 1 α 0 1 k 1 α 1 3 2 9 k 3 k 3 α 1 3 2 5 soil pore characteristics 2 5 1 flow weighted mean pore radius under a certain pressure head the effective equivalent mean pore radius is used to describe the water transmitting macro and mesoporosity of soil under various land use treatments and it is represented by the flow weighted mean pore radius r0 reynolds et al 1995 moret arrúe 2007 the r0 is expressed as per reynolds et al 1995 is given below 10 r o t k x ρ g m where t mt 2 is the surface tension of water k x lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil at pressure head x ρ ml 3 is the density of water g lt 2 is the acceleration due to gravity m l2t 1 is the matric flux potential and it is calculated as per the following equation given by gardner 1958 11 m x i x 0 k x d x where xi is the initial or background pore water pressure head in the unsaturated soil and x0 is the pressure head applied at the soil surface however the soil s matric flux potential consists of two flux potential components viz residual flux potential mr and tension flux potential mt reynolds et al 1995 the values of mt were calculated by numerical integration of k x versus x curve under the cubic spline segments iovino et al 2016 patra et al 2019a 12 m t 1 2 i 1 3 k i 1 k i x i 1 x i the values of m r will be computed by using wooding s 1968 relationship 13 m r q x π y 2 k x g y where q x and k x are the steady state flow rate and hydraulic conductivity at the lowest pressure head 3 cm respectively y is the radius of the hood and g 4 219 is a dimensionless shape factor reynolds and elrick 1991 2 5 2 maximum equivalent pore radius rmax the rmax for water storage was derived utilising capillary rise equation at a specific water pressure head h vomocil 1965 reynolds et al 1995 whereas equivalent pore radius r0 is based on the whole range of pore sizes contributing to water transmission the capillary method implies that the flow is laminar and that the pores are filled with water but not linked nevertheless the water flow is influenced by tortuosity entrapped air bubbles bottleneck effect etc reynolds et al 1995 patra et al 2019 the equation for maximum equivalent pore radius is given below 14 r m a x 2 t c o s γ ρ g h where t is the surface tension of water mt 2 t 71 99 gs 2 25 c γ 0 is the contact angle between the water air interface and the soil solid phase buczko et al 2006 schwen et al 2011 ρ and g are as discussed earlier 2 5 3 hydraulically active porosity the soil hydraulic conductivity at pressure head intervals estimated from the two radii of p and q is used to determine the water conducting porosity or hydraulically active porosity as given below watson and luxmoore 1986 bodhinayake et al 2004 buczko et al 2006 for the above interval of pore radii the contribution of hydraulically active porosity was estimated as below bodhinayake et al 2004 15 ε p q 2 μ ρ g t 2 x p x q d k x d x x 2 dx where ε p q l3l 3 is the hydraulically active porosity of soil at pore radius of p and q µ is the dynamic viscosity of water ml 1t 1 ρ g and t are as described earlier the analytical solution to eq 15 for estimating hydraulically active porosity was given by bodhinayake et al 2004 using gardner s exponential equation as given below 16 ε p q 2 μ ρ g k f s t 2 exp 2 t α ρ g q 4 t 2 ρ g q 2 4 t ρ g q α 2 α 2 exp 2 t α ρ g p 4 t 2 ρ g p 2 4 t ρ g p α 2 α 2 where kfs lt 1 and α l 1 are as described earlier 2 6 soil sample collection and its physicochemical properties analysis soil samples six replications were obtained from each treatment immediately below the hood infiltrometer experiment site to estimate bulk density mwd mm texture organic carbon and ph 1 2 5 in the laboratory however before the experiment began soil samples were taken from 0 15 cm soil depth next to the experiment sites for the determination of initial soil moisture with a stainless steel core 5 cm each by height and internal diameter intact soil samples were obtained individually to evaluate soil moisture and bulk density and it was oven dried for 24 hours at 105 c to achieve a constant dry weight blake and hartge 1986 the water stable aggregate distribution or mwd was determined by aggregate size analysis of soil using a yoder apparatus following the wet sieving principle yoder 1936 the mechanical sieve shaker consists of a nest of sieves of different mesh sizes viz 0 0 12 mm 0 12 0 25 mm 0 25 0 50 mm 0 50 1 mm 1 2 mm 2 4 mm and 4 8 mm air dried soil sample 100 gm free from any foreign material was processed through an 8 mm sieve and placed on the sieve shaker s topmost sieve 4 mm mesh size before beginning the wet sieving process the soil sample was slowly rewetted for 10 minutes and then the nest of sieves were moved up and down with an amplitude of 3 cm and at a rate of 30 cycles minute for 30 minutes inside the water drum zhou et al 2020 the water stable aggregates that remained on each sieve at the end of the process were collected and oven dried at 60 80 c until a constant weight was reached to assess the impact of land conversion from forest type to other agricultural practices on soil structure the mwd of aggregates was determined using the following formula kemper and rosenau 1986 17 mwd mm i 1 n x i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the proportion of soil mass g retained in each aggregate class to total soil mass xi is the average diameter of the respective sieve mm the air dried soil samples were further passed through a 2 mm sieve to analyze texture soil organic carbon and ph in the laboratory the soc was determined by wet digestion via the walkley and black method walkley black 1934 particle size distribution of the soil sample was obtained by pipette method piper 1966 followed by assignment of soil textural class based on united states department of agriculture usda textural triangle system a digital ph meter was used for the analysis of soil ph 1 2 5 soil water suspension 2 7 statistical analysis to determine the normality of the treatment data the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 was used and a natural log transformation was done to achieve a near normal distribution when the data was not normally distributed it was then followed by one way analysis of variance anova to determine if there was a significant difference p 0 05 between the parameters of the treatments in the case of transformed data the natural log transformed data was used in anova the multiple comparisons of means were made using a parametric test least significant difference test webster 2007 a nonparametric test kruskal wallis was carried out to test the significant difference p 0 05 among the means of parameters which are not normally distributed even after suitable transformation zhang et al 2021 the scatter plot matrix of soil physicochemical characteristics and saturation hydraulic conductivity across four land uses was prepared the spss software version 21 was used to perform all the statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil physicochemical properties the mean and standard deviation of topsoil 0 to 15 cm physical and chemical parameters among land uses sal forest conventional tillage reduced tillage and zero tillage are shown in table 1 loam was the most common soil texture class across the treatments and the proportions of sand silt and clay components did not change significantly across all the land uses p 0 05 which indicates that the treatments are nearly homogeneous the difference of clay silt and sand fractions among the treatments was insignificant p 0 05 the organic carbon in surface soil 0 15 cm was significantly reduced p 0 05 by conversion of forest land to agricultural land however after adopting conservation agriculture practices the soc was significantly improved as observed after ten years the soc in topsoil layer followed the trend forest zt rt ct the variations of soc between forest and other land use were remarkable as the soc value 1 81 0 13 of the forest lands was significantly higher p 0 05 than other tillage treatments table 1 the reduction of soc in ct might be attributed to the tillage induced disturbance of soil aggregates by microbial deterioration olson and al kaisi 2015 the soc of rt 0 50 0 01 was significantly lower p 0 05 than zt 0 57 0 04 the difference of soc between rt and ct was insignificant p 0 05 although the soc content in rt is higher than in ct the soc was reduced by 3 7 times by converting land use from forest to ct however in the case of zt the soc level was restored in soil and reached up to 32 of the original soc as in the forest tillage leads to soc mixing with subsurface layers and high erosion rates as in the case of ct and the condition gradually improves toward conservation tillage and forest land use due to less soil disturbance higher residue retention litter addition and further soc stratification patra et al 2019b kabir et al 2020 furthermore the considerably reduced bulk density in the surface soil was related to the comparatively greater soc in the forest zt and rt treatments the forest land had significantly p 0 05 lower bulk density than other land uses the lowest soil bulk density in forest land may be due to the perennial plant cover and continued litter addition accompanied by zero mechanical disturbance that avoids soil compaction and increased soc input kabir et al 2020 the highest bulk density g cm3 was observed in ct treatment 1 45 0 11 followed by rt 1 41 0 12 zt 1 33 0 06 and forest 1 03 0 05 nonetheless no significant variation was seen between the pairs zt rt and rt ct even though zt had significantly p 0 05 lower bulk density than ct the increased soil bulk density in ct may be due to less residue retention and intensive tillage and compaction of soil due to heavy machinery alletto and coquet 2009 havaee et al 2014 other studies have revealed a similar pattern of reduced bulk density in forests and zt cavalieri et al 2009 patra et al 2019b this difference in bulk density related to land use was mostly attributable to the combined influence of soc tillage techniques root density of crop land use and rainfall intensity kumar et al 2018 singh et al 2021 hence converting forest to agricultural land increased the bd which may be due to a decrease in total porosity lowering of soc and earthworm activity li et al 2021 however the increase in zt s bulk density is smaller compared to other tillage practices likewise the influence of various land use practices on soil aggregate mwd is visible as presented in table 1 the forest soil had significantly p 0 05 higher mwd mm 1 51 0 39 among all other treatments likely due to higher soc and stable aggregate it was followed by zt having significantly p 0 05 higher mwd 1 20 0 33 as compared to rt and ct however no statistical significance was observed between rt and ct although rt had a higher mwd 0 89 0 07 than ct 0 85 0 10 it may be observed that a decrease 56 in mwd of conventional tillage was observed after conversion from forest land to ct however an increase 1 4 times in mwd had occurred due to the adoption of zt relative to ct the higher water stable aggregation in forest and conservation tillage may be due to higher soc root induced physical entanglement of aggregates increased root exudates and reinforcement of soil particle contact due to better root growth pohl et al 2009 yoo et al 2011 parihar et al 2016 patra et al 2019a thereby switching forest to agricultural land reduced the stability of soil aggregate considerably as observed from the finding of decreases in mwd and it was restored near to original level by adopting conservation practices additionally soil moisture an essential parameter for plant growth varied significantly among land uses the transition of forest to farmland reduced the soil water content significantly at the 0 15 cm depth the ct rt and zt had 0 42 0 41 and 0 67 times soil moisture respectively relative to the forest forest had significantly p 0 05 higher soil moisture 27 5 2 09 among all treatments followed by zt treatment which had higher soil moisture 18 4 1 44 than rt and ct however the rt and ct had no significant difference in soil moisture although ct had a higher value than rt this variation between rt and ct might be attributed to ct s higher clay content reduced crop growth and lower potential evapotranspiration compared to rt fu et al 2003 gao et al 2014 overall the results demonstrated that while soil physical values worsened owing to conversion of land use from forest to ct adopting ca approaches improved soil physical qualities when compared to ct practices 3 2 land use implications on near saturated hydraulic conductivity as per the findings shown in fig 2 and fig 3 the k x and q x increased towards the soil saturation point i e these parameters increased as the water pressure head decreased fig 2 depicts the effect of land usage on steady state water flow q at saturated and near saturated states the water flux was significantly higher for forest land use than other treatments irrespective of the pressure head applied this may be due to the presence of coarser roots which increased macropores or aeration pores and higher root density in forest and conservation agriculture land use respectively burr hersey et al 2020 chen et al 2021 moreover the trend followed was forest zt rt ct although statistically insignificant the zt treatment showed comparatively higher water flux than rt and ct a similar trend of water flux for various land uses was also documented by other researchers giertz et al 2005 abu hashim et al 2011 it is indicative from the results that the water flux value increased with a decrease in pressure head due to the contribution of large conducting macropores to water flow at a near saturation state kelishadi et al 2014 kabir et al 2020 the lowest q value was observed for the ct among all treatments which may be attributed to a decrease in pore size due to high compactness of soil fewer macropores weak soil structure and less microbial activity due to less soc giertz et al 2005 kelishadi et al 2014 several researchers have observed a greater steady state infiltration rate in the forest relative to other land uses owing to the existence of a deep root system and longer taproot shi et al 2021 fig 3 illustrates the sshc and nsshc estimates from the ssi rate using wooding s analytical solution at 0 1 and 3 cm pressure heads for various land use treatments similar to water flux q the highest mean kfs 0 cm was observed under forest 122 15 mm h 1 afterward by zt 69 17 mm h 1 rt 59 94 mm h 1 and ct 36 08 mm h 1 respectively and a similar trend was also followed for hydraulic conductivity at 1 cm pressure head however the nsshc at 3 cm pressure head followed the magnitude like forest rt zt ct the land use induced structural changes and modification of pore dynamics are reflected in this variation of near saturated hydraulic conductivity at saturation the forest had a significantly p 0 05 higher kfs than other land uses however there was no significant difference amongst zt rt and ct the hydraulic conductivity value of zt and rt were 1 92 and 1 66 times higher than ct respectively the k 1 and k 3 values for forest land were also highest among other land uses with respective hydraulic conductivity values of 68 31 mm hr and 32 26 mm hr the least value for k x and q x were seen in ct regardless of pressure heads 0 1 and 3 cm which was likely attributable to soil compaction caused by the regular use of agricultural machinery and intensive ploughing operations which might have destructed the macropore and soil structure kabir et al 2020 several studies li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 had reported the decrease in hydraulic conductivity with a decrease in pressure head and among the treatments the direction of decrease was from forest land towards agricultural land higher litter deposit in the forest and agricultural residue retention in ca along with favourable circumstances for the establishment of earthworms and soil fauna may have enhanced soil porosity patra et al 2019a at pressure heads of 0 1 3 cm the k x values increased by 1 92 1 65 and 1 43 times respectively after switching from ct to zt from the above assessment of conversion of forest land to ct and ca and its subsequent effect on shps it was evident that the ct gradually decreased k x value however by adopting ca zt and rt the k x value started restoring it may be justified by a similar variation in tillage practices bd som particle size distribution mwd and root growth for the respective land use ghestem et al 2011 udom et al 2018 li et al 2021 retention of leaf litters and crop residues as in the case of forest and zt or rt leads to an increase in soil macro porosity more connected pore structure and thereby higher saturated hydraulic conductivity dong et al 2021 maier et al 2020 studied the effect of aging of moraines 10000 3000 160 and 30 years old on surface soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in the central swiss alps and it was observed that median hydraulic conductivity was highest on the youngest moraine 432 cm hr 1 and lowest 54 cm hr 1 on the oldest moraine due to changes in soil texture li et al 2021 also studied the chrono sequence of land use change forest 41 50 and 65 years of cultivation on soil hydraulic properties and observed that the hydraulic conductivity decreased with increasing soil depth range 0 15 cm and it was highest for forest 51 9 cm day 1 to lowest for 50 years of cultivation 19 6 cm day 1 furthermore the hydraulic response of the soil under four treatments was analyzed employing matric flux potential mr and mt for the entire pressure head range i e from 0 to 3 cm under near saturated conditions fig 4 illustrates the effect of different treatments on matric flux potential from 0 to 3 cm water pressure head similar to the tendencies of k x and q forest land had the greatest mt and mr followed by zt rt and ct the forest mt was much greater than the other treatments however the difference was insignificant with zt however the mr of treatments did not vary significantly overall results indicate that the ca based treatment showed higher tension and residual flux potential next to forest land and the ct based treatments had shown the lowest value for both the parameters similar results of lowest mt and mr in ct compared to zt and rt were documented in previous studies patra et al 2019a singh et al 2021 the greater mt cm2s 1 value in the forest and zt might be credited to the land management impact and a better root network leading to hydrologically active pathways shougrakpam et al 2010 moreover higher mwd in the above treatments influenced the inter aggregate pore space causing higher infiltration flux singh et al 2021 3 3 soil pore characteristics conductivity relationship the r0 is an indirect measure of land management induced variation in the soil s pore structure and represents the contribution of pore size to water flux schwen et al 2011 the relation of pressure head h variation with rmax and r0 for various tillage practices is shown in fig 5 forest had the greatest r0 mm values among the treatments in near saturated conditions with values at pressure heads of 0 1 and 3 cm were of 0 49 0 06 0 31 0 04 and 0 28 0 04 respectively whereas ct had consistently lower r0 values however the r0 values of forest and zt were relatively closer to each other and with rmax values at all pressure heads which indicates better connectivity of pores in forest and zt as compared to other land use the higher r0 represents improved biopore connectivity in forest and ca might be due to the presence of root networks higher abundance of earthworms and other soil microbes and their biological activity better soil aggregate stability patra et al 2019a schluter et al 2020 at near saturation state when the water flux is governed by macropores the differences between rmax and r0 are maximum for all the treatments moreover at saturation state the r0 values of forest and zt were significantly p 0 05 higher than ct even though the variation in rt and ct was insignificant p 0 05 the decreasing trend of pore network connectivity was forest zt rt ct at three pressure heads which indicates a gradual increase in tortuosity due to breakdown of soil structure and less biological activity schwen et al 2011 3 4 effect of land use on hydraulically active porosity the water conducting porosity as a percentage of soil volume in the range of pressure heads 0 to 3 cm as influenced by four land use practices is presented in table 2 the pressure heads of 0 1 and 3 cm represent the soil pore radius of 2 50 1 49 and 0 50 mm respectively bodhinayake and si 2004 suggested to assume a maximum pore radius of 2 50 mm at saturation 0 cm pressure head which suitably represents the bio pores created by earthworm burrowing activity root networks or activity by other soil fauna a significantly p 0 05 higher water conducting porosity soil volume 10 5 was observed in the forest 182 81 74 64 followed by zt 97 19 35 74 rt 83 01 25 98 and ct 48 49 9 34 for the complete pore radius regime of 0 50 to 2 50 mm a similar trend of water conducting porosity was followed for 0 50 to 1 49 mm and 1 49 to 2 50 mm pore radius range the gradual reduction of soil macropore to mesopore and micropore towards ct from zt was significantly due to increased traffic of agricultural machinery breakdown of soil structure less biological activity high tortuosity daraghmeh et al 2008 schwen et al 2011 the soil volume conducting water in zt and rt was consistently higher 2 and 1 71 times respectively than ct in all the pore radius ranges although the difference was insignificant p 0 05 in previous studies researchers have reported similar ranges of wcp for different land use singh et al 2021 patra et al 2019a water conducting porosity soil volume varied from 0 00063 to 0 0016 for cultivated land and native grassland respectively bodhinayake si 2004 0 0008 in cropland to 0 0035 in grassland yu et al 2015 0 00017 in ct to 0 00078 in zt patra et al 2019a although the water conducting macro porosity accounts for a minimal proportion of total soil volume it plays a vital role in runoff generation and water flux at the near saturated state of soil carey et al 2007 moret arrúe 2007 singh et al 2021 moreover the water flow through different groups of pore size 0 50 0 50 1 49 and 1 49 mm in the four land uses was estimated using the equation given by bodhinayake et al 2004 and presented in fig 6 the macropores 0 5 mm in radius and the meso micropores 0 50 mm in radius contributed 61 99 73 44 and 26 56 38 01 of total flow respectively across the land uses the contribution of macropores 0 5 mm pores to water movement was maximum in the forest 73 44 followed by zt 72 23 rt 67 14 and ct 61 99 whereas the meso and micropores 0 50 mm in radius contribution followed the trend like ct 38 01 rt 32 86 zt 27 77 and forest 26 56 the soil pores having radius 0 50 mm contributed about 73 44 72 23 67 14 and 61 99 of total flow at saturation state in the associated wcp of 0 00182 0 00097 0 00083 and 0 00048 of soil volume under forest zt rt and ct respectively in the water conducting process in all land use systems a relatively higher contribution by macropores which comprised only 0 0018 to 0 0004 of total soil volume signifies its importance the study results of share to total flow through macropore at near saturated condition was consistent with the findings of previously reported estimates of 60 to 73 of total water flow in the forest land watson luxmoore 1986 zhang et al 2021 67 of the total flow in the bamboo forest patra et al 2021 up to 80 of total flow under forest grassland and cropland at various soil depths yu et al 2015 hence the forest zt and rt s soil profiles were more prone to macropore flow than ct nevertheless ct was more susceptible to meso and micropore flow it indicates that converting natural forest lands to conventional agriculture deformed soil macropores structure and hydraulic conductivity however it had a positive impact in the case of ca as observed from the increased contribution of macropores it might be because of the increased soc which enhanced the soil aggregate formation as observed from mwd and increased soil stability and the evolution of root networks leading to better macroporosity zhang et al 2021 for forest land use the decayed root channels create larger macropores which contribute towards higher total water flow cadisch et al 2004 3 5 correlation of soil hydraulic and physicochemical properties the scatter plot matrix between soil hydrological dependent variable and physiochemical independent variable parameters were established to assess the impact of different land management strategies on soil hydraulic conductivity the strength of interrelations of the soil hydraulic conductivity values at saturation with bd soil moisture soc ec mwd and infiltration rate at saturation was examined using scatter plot matrix as shown in fig 7 the k 0 0 cm pressure head is positively correlated with soil moisture mwd soc q and negatively correlated with bulk density the decrease in hydraulic conductivity with the conversion of forest land to ct is attributed to their soil physical properties the bd mwd and soc are interrelated as decrease in soc porosity and increased soil compaction leads to elevation of soil bulk density and thereby reduced mwd of soil our findings agreed with those of bodhinayake and si 2004 parihar et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 li et al 2021 4 conclusions the restoration pattern of soil in terms of shps to the original level due to land use reformation is discussed in this paper the present study fulfills the limited availability of quantitative data regarding changing patterns of shps from forest land to conventional land and further conservation agriculture for the himalayan region the research explores the changes in shps caused by the transition of natural forest land to succeeding agricultural fields under various management strategies ct rt and zt in india s nw himalayan region one of the highly vulnerable agroecosystems in terms of soil hydraulic conductivity total tension flux potential residual flux potential flow weighted mean pore radius and hydraulically active porosity the forest land use showed the highest value followed by zt rt and ct respectively however the r0 values of forest and zt were relatively closer to each other and with rmax values at all pressure heads which indicates better connectivity of pores in forest and zt as compared to other land use although after conversion of forest land to conventional land increased bd thereby compactness and reduced mwd and soc but it was improved after adopting conservation agriculture additionally the macropores 0 5 mm in radius contributed 61 99 73 44 of total water flow while the meso and micropores 0 50 mm in radius contributed 26 56 38 01 of total flow across the land uses moreover the soil pores having radius 0 50 mm conducted about 73 44 72 23 67 14 and 61 99 of total flow at saturation state in the respective wcp of 0 00182 0 00097 0 00083 and 0 00048 of soil volume under forest zt rt and ct in the water conducting process in all land use systems macropore s relatively higher contribution which comprises only small space 0 0018 to 0 0004 of total soil volume signifies its importance further scatter plot matrix analysis depicted that among the various soil physical and chemical properties the mwd and soc are the dominating factors controlling the nsshc for all the land use systems overall our results suggest that adoption of conservation tillage practices may enhance soil hydraulic properties following conversion of forest land as compared to ct based agriculture further these results are important to understand that due to higher observed soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of ca it will improve water infiltration rate into soil layers retain more soil moisture and reduce runoff and

properties shps of various land use regimes may aid in the long term management of ecologically sensitive and vulnerable agroecosystems the study looked at influence of land use conversion from native forest land to subsequent agricultural practices on shps in india s n w himalayan area one of the world s most susceptible agroecosystems moreover the water conducting porosity at different pressure heads and the contribution of macro and mesopores to saturation flow were quantified for this purpose the infiltration rate and soil hydraulic conductivity of surface soil were investigated for sal forest conventional tillage ct reduced tillage rt and zero tillage zt using the hood infiltrometer at three pressure heads the forest land use showed the highest value followed by zt rt and ct respectively for soil hydraulic conductivity tension and residual flux potential flow weighted mean pore radius and hydraulically active porosity additionally the macropores contributed 61 99 73 44 of total water flow while the meso micropores contributed 26 56 38 01 of total flow across the land uses in the water conducting process in all land use systems macropore s contribution was relatively higher which comprised only small space of total soil volume signifies its importance further scatter plot matrix depicted that mean weighted diameter mwd and soil organic carbon soc are dominating factors controlling hydraulic conductivity the findings strongly suggest that while conversion of native forest land to conventional agriculture degrades soil hydraulic characteristics shps may be progressively recovered in the himalayan region by adopting conservation agriculture strategies keywords forest conservation agriculture land use change hood infiltrometer soil hydraulic properties

hydraulic characteristics are important for water and solute flow evaporation runoff generation soil water storage and deep percolation and even for regulating the rainfall and snow meltwater partitioning bodhinayake and si 2004 zhang et al 2021 understanding soil hydraulic properties shps is indispensable for visualising the mechanisms of the hydrologic cycle water management and transport processes hillel 1998 as a result assessing soil hydraulic response to various land use regimes may aid in the long term management of ecologically sensitive and vulnerable agroecosystems patra et al 2019a zhang et al 2021 however poor soil hydraulic property reduces soil hydraulic conductivity water transmitting macro and mesopores moret and arrúe 2007 and reduces crop productivity chen et al 2021 in addition the shps control the functioning of the hydrological and ecological cycle of the watershed hence its better understanding is required chen et al 2021 moreover conversion of native lands to other management practices may significantly improve or degrade the soil properties in terms of soil pores hydraulic properties mean weighted diameter mwd bulk density bd soc zhang et al 2021 land use practices particularly root systems and amendment of organic matter play a pivotal role in modifying shps in terms of infiltration rate hydraulic conductivity water stable aggregates dong et al 2021 shi et al 2021 the hydraulic conductivity had both negative and positive correlations with soil organic matter som as evidenced from semiarid sandy soils it is adversely associated due to lower wettability produced by som in sandy soils wang et al 2009 however because of enhanced wettability and soil aggregation in loamy soil hydraulic conductivity is positively associated with som ellerbrock et al 2005 furthermore the compactness of soil as influenced by land management may also significantly affect the soil hydraulic properties and water infiltration rate kelishadi et al 2014 furthermore researchers discovered that tillage techniques had a considerable influence on the spatio temporal variation of soil hydraulic characteristics caused by changes in soil structure and biological activity buczko et al 2006 alletto and coquet 2009 schluter et al 2020 as a result various factors impact soil hydraulic characteristics including land management tillage soil texture som bulk density and mwd although natural climatic hazards pose risk to human livelihood and socioeconomic development such as crop failure due to water stress and erosion with nutrient transportation by excess water kar et al 2018 kar et al 2022 but by adopting conservation agriculture ca it minimizes the decomposition of soc and also reduces its transportation by erosion lal 2013 as in the case of ca the soil is not tilled or minimally tilled unlike traditional agriculture hence it had several environmental soil physical and chemical benefits by reducing consumption of nonrenewable energy sources promoting microbial growth improving soc amwd reducing erosion and greenhouse gas emission lal 2004 singh et al 2019 since ca improves soil biophysical qualities it provides a sustainable alternative to other cropping systems for enhancing soil health parihar et al 2016 soil structure changes dynamically among various land uses due to the complex interaction among the land use practices and shps ca improves soil structure and biological activity by boosting hydraulic conductivity water conducting macroporosity and decreasing tortuosity schwen et al 2011 singh et al 2021 the soil surface pore and soil hydraulic conductivity are important parameters of shp which vary with land use change and it regulates the infiltrability of soil and controls the hydrologic cycle and water balance bodhinayake and si 2004 sandin et al 2017 therefore the selection of suitable land use practices is important for sustainable soil environment management several methods tension disc infiltrometers hood infiltrometers guelph permeameter for infiltration measurement are available varying in process of water infiltration from the instrument to soil surface degrees of surface sealing pore clogging and disturbance of soil surface reynolds and elrick 1985 schwärzel and punzel 2007 schluter et al 2020 however despite accounting for a minute part of overall porosity the majority of water flow more than 65 is controlled by macropores during saturation bodhinayake si 2004 carey et al 2007 patra et al 2019a hence it is important to determine water conducting porosity and its contribution to total flow by meso and macropores for differentiating the characteristics of various land use systems using an undisturbed measurement technique in this context a unique non destructive infiltrometer hood infiltrometer may be utilised to quantify saturated soil hydraulic conductivity sshc near saturated soil hydraulic conductivity nsshc up to bubble point and macropores which otherwise will not be possible by other infiltrometers due to choking and surface sealing by the contact material in the latter one schwärzel and punzel 2007 although several other studies were done concerning shps under various cropping patterns the restoration pattern of soil to the original level is discussed in this paper despite much researches suggesting the impact of conservation agriculture limited quantitative data are available regarding changing patterns of shps from forest land to conventional land and further conservation agriculture for the himalayan region we hypothesized that although the conversion of native forest land to conventional agriculture land degrades the soil hydraulic properties the soil hydraulic properties will be restored gradually by adopting conservation agriculture practices in a nutshell the final aim of the study was to look at the influence of land use conversion on shps in india s n w himalayan area one of the world s most susceptible agroecosystems with these considerations in mind the goal of this research was to assess variations in shps in native forest land and subsequent agricultural areas under various management practices also the water conducting porosity at different pressure heads as well as the contribution of macro and mesopores to saturation flow was quantified furthermore to establish the relationship among different soil properties and to determine the relationship of k with other parameters for this purpose a scatter plot matrix was prepared the results may provide in depth knowledge for the selection of suitable land management practices 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the current investigation was undertaken at the selakui research farm of the icar iiswc dehradun india which is

to each other in a rainfed system of north western indian himalayas the ct rt and zt plots have an area of 450 m2 75 m 6 m each with rectangular shape the prevalent cropping pattern in agricultural land is wheat during rabi season followed by maize during kharif season whereas the undisturbed forest consists of virgin sal forest of 75 years old some portion of the sal forest was cut down during the 1980s and converted into agricultural lands however the conservation agriculture experiment was established in 2011 prior to that the land was under conventional agriculture practices in conventional tillage the traditional farmers practice was adopted where a tractor drawn tyne cultivator is used six times for ploughing 12 14 cm average tillage depth followed by planking for seedbed preparation and manual broadcasting of wheat and maize seeds during respective seasons in reduced tillage a tractor drawn tyne cultivator was used three times 9 11 cm average tillage depth followed by planking and here a seed drill was used for wheat sowing and maize is sown by manual row broadcasting in the case of a zero tillage a seed drill was used for the direct sowing of seeds without much physical disturbance to the soil the recommended p2o5 and k2o were applied as an initial dose combined with n 50 and the remaining n was given at 30 35 das and 60 das of maize for wheat recommended p2o5 and k2o were given as initial doses combined with n 50 the remaining n was applied at the cri and booting stages pre emergence herbicides such as atrazine or pendimethalin 1 5 kg a i ha 1 were used to suppress weeds in a maize field whereas 2 4 d 1 0 kg a i ha 1 and isoproturon 0 5 kg a i ha 1 were used after 35 40 das in wheat throughout the years precautions were made to avoid insect infestation and disease attacks in maize and wheat harvests 2 3 infiltration measurement using hood infiltrometer the infiltration rate and soil hydraulic conductivity of surface soil were investigated under the sal forest ct rt and zt land use during october 2020 using the hood infiltrometer 12 4 cm hood diameter with six replications in each plot during the in situ infiltration measurements three pressure heads h 0 1 and 3 cm were applied sequentially in all replications using the method proposed by schwärzel and punzel 2007 cumulative water infiltration was measured till the steady state infiltration ssi rate was obtained i e the increase in infiltration was the same over three constant periods it took around 50 mins for each pressure head to reach its steady state the infiltration measuring instrument mentioned above aids in determining the ssi rate from the saturation point to the soil s bubble point 2 4 estimation of soil hydraulic properties from infiltrometer experiment the data acquired from the infiltration experiment was analysed using the methodology outlined below firstly a relationship was established between hydraulic conductivity and its respective pressure head using wooding s analytical approach wooding 1968 the derived data were used to calculate shps viz the flow weighted mean pore radius matric flux potential reynolds et al 1995 maximum equivalent pore radius vomocil 1965 hydraulically active porosity watson and luxmoore 1986 bodhinayake et al 2004 as described below 2 4 1 saturated and near saturated hydraulic conductivity following the methods laid out by ankeny et al 1991 the nexus between hydraulic conductivity k x and pressure head x was established from recorded steady state infiltration rates wooding 1968 approximation of steady state unconfined infiltration rate with a constant pressure head from a circular source at the soil surface is given by eq 1 1 q x k x π y 2 y f α where q x l3t 1 is the ssi rate water infiltration volume per unit time k x lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity at water potential of x y l is the hood radius f 0 25 is a shape factor α l 1 is the sorptive number or derivative of the hydraulic conductivity function the first component on the right side of the equation represents gravity force based water flow while the second term represents capillary force effect and supply source geometry kirkham 2005 and kelishadi et al 2014 the hydraulic conductivity is assumed to exponentially vary with pressure head as given by gardener as follows gardner 1958 2 k x k f s e x p α x where kfs lt 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and α l 1 is the sorptive number by putting eq 2 in eq 1 woodings solution had the following unknown values k f s and α which were calculated using two adjacent pressure heads 0 cm and 1 cm 1 cm and 3 cm as given below 3 q x k f s e x p α x π y 2 y g α the following equations were found by substituting two adjacent flow rates qhi and qhi 1 for respective pressure heads xi and xi 1 in eq 3 4 q x i k f s e x p α x i π y 2 y g α 5 q x i 1 k f s e x p α x i 1 π y 2 y g α α the sorptive number was calculated by solving the above equations and is given below 6 α i i 1 ln q x i q x i 1 x i x i 1 i 1 2 n 1 the equations below will be used to calculate k h for pressure heads 7 k 0 k 0 α 0 1 8 k 1 k 1 α 0 1 k 1 α 1 3 2 9 k 3 k 3 α 1 3 2 5 soil pore characteristics 2 5 1 flow weighted mean pore radius under a certain pressure head the effective equivalent mean pore radius is used to describe the water transmitting macro and mesoporosity of soil under various land use treatments and it is represented by the flow weighted mean pore radius r0 reynolds et al 1995 moret arrúe 2007 the r0 is expressed as per reynolds et al 1995 is given below 10 r o t k x ρ g m where t mt 2 is the surface tension of water k x lt 1 is the hydraulic conductivity of the soil at pressure head x ρ ml 3 is the density of water g lt 2 is the acceleration due to gravity m l2t 1 is the matric flux potential and it is calculated as per the following equation given by gardner 1958 11 m x i x 0 k x d x where xi is the initial or background pore water pressure head in the unsaturated soil and x0 is the pressure head applied at the soil surface however the soil s matric flux potential consists of two flux potential components viz residual flux potential mr and tension flux potential mt reynolds et al 1995 the values of mt were calculated by numerical integration of k x versus x curve under the cubic spline segments iovino et al 2016 patra et al 2019a 12 m t 1 2 i 1 3 k i 1 k i x i 1 x i the values of m r will be computed by using wooding s 1968 relationship 13 m r q x π y 2 k x g y where q x and k x are the steady state flow rate

radius rmax the rmax for water storage was derived utilising capillary rise equation at a specific water pressure head h vomocil 1965 reynolds et al 1995 whereas equivalent pore radius r0 is based on the whole range of pore sizes contributing to water transmission the capillary method implies that the flow is laminar and that the pores are filled with water but not linked nevertheless the water flow is influenced by tortuosity entrapped air bubbles bottleneck effect etc reynolds et al 1995 patra et al 2019 the equation for maximum equivalent pore radius is given below 14 r m a x 2 t c o s γ

as discussed earlier 2 5 3 hydraulically active porosity the soil hydraulic conductivity at pressure head intervals estimated from the two radii of p and q is used to determine the water conducting porosity or hydraulically active porosity as given below watson and luxmoore 1986 bodhinayake et al 2004 buczko et al 2006 for the above interval of pore radii the contribution of hydraulically active porosity was estimated as below bodhinayake et al 2004 15 ε p q 2 μ ρ g t 2 x p x q d k x d x x 2 dx where ε p q l3l 3 is the hydraulically active porosity of soil at pore radius of p and q µ is the dynamic viscosity of water ml 1t 1 ρ g and t are as described earlier the analytical solution to eq 15 for estimating hydraulically active porosity was given by bodhinayake et al 2004 using gardner s exponential equation as given below 16 ε p q 2 μ ρ g k f s t 2 exp 2 t α ρ g q 4 t 2 ρ g q 2 4 t ρ g q α 2 α 2 exp 2 t α ρ g p 4 t 2 ρ g p 2 4 t ρ g p α 2 α 2 where kfs lt 1 and α l 1 are as described earlier 2 6 soil sample collection and its physicochemical properties analysis soil samples six replications were obtained from each treatment immediately below the hood infiltrometer experiment site to estimate bulk density mwd mm texture organic carbon and ph 1 2 5 in the laboratory however before the experiment began soil samples were taken from 0 15 cm soil depth next to the experiment sites for the determination of initial soil moisture with a stainless steel core 5 cm each by height and internal diameter intact soil samples were obtained individually to evaluate soil moisture and bulk density and it was oven dried for 24 hours at 105 c to achieve a constant dry weight blake and hartge 1986 the water stable aggregate distribution or mwd was determined by aggregate size analysis of soil using a yoder apparatus following the wet sieving principle yoder 1936 the mechanical sieve shaker consists of a nest of sieves of different mesh sizes viz 0 0 12 mm 0 12 0 25 mm 0 25 0 50 mm 0 50 1 mm 1 2 mm 2 4 mm and 4 8 mm air dried soil sample 100 gm free from any foreign material was processed through an 8 mm sieve and placed on the sieve shaker s topmost sieve 4 mm mesh size before beginning the wet sieving process the soil sample was slowly rewetted for 10 minutes and then the nest of sieves were moved up and down with an amplitude of 3 cm and at a rate of 30 cycles minute for 30 minutes inside the water drum zhou et al 2020 the water stable aggregates that remained on each sieve at the end of the process were collected and oven dried at 60 80 c until a constant weight was reached to assess the impact of land conversion from forest type to other agricultural practices on soil structure the mwd of aggregates was determined using the following formula kemper and rosenau 1986 17 mwd mm i 1 n x i w i i 1 n w i where wi is the proportion of soil mass g retained in each aggregate class to total soil mass xi is the average diameter of the respective sieve mm the air dried soil samples were further passed through a 2 mm sieve to analyze texture soil organic carbon and ph in the laboratory the soc was determined by wet digestion via the walkley and black method walkley black 1934 particle size distribution of the soil sample was obtained by pipette method piper 1966 followed by assignment of soil textural class based on united states department of agriculture usda textural triangle system a digital ph meter was used for the analysis of soil ph 1 2 5 soil water suspension 2 7 statistical analysis to determine the normality of the treatment data the shapiro wilk test shapiro and wilk 1965 was used and a natural log transformation was done to achieve a near normal distribution when the data was not normally distributed it was then followed by one way analysis of variance anova to determine if there was a significant difference p 0 05 between the parameters of the treatments in the case of transformed data the natural log transformed data was used in anova the multiple comparisons of means were made using a parametric test least significant difference test webster 2007 a nonparametric test kruskal wallis was carried out to test the significant difference p 0 05 among the means of parameters which are not normally distributed even after suitable transformation zhang et al 2021 the scatter plot matrix of soil physicochemical characteristics and saturation hydraulic conductivity across four land uses was prepared the spss software version 21 was used to perform all the statistical analyses 3 results and discussion 3 1 soil physicochemical properties the mean and standard deviation of topsoil 0 to 15 cm physical and chemical parameters among land uses sal forest conventional tillage reduced tillage and zero tillage are shown in table 1 loam was the most common soil texture class across the treatments and the proportions of sand silt and clay components did not change significantly across all the land uses p 0 05 which indicates that the treatments are nearly homogeneous the difference of clay silt and sand fractions among the treatments was insignificant p 0 05 the organic carbon in surface soil 0 15 cm was significantly reduced p 0 05 by conversion of forest land to agricultural land however after adopting conservation agriculture practices the soc was significantly improved as observed after ten years the soc in topsoil layer followed the trend forest zt rt ct the variations of soc between forest and other land use were remarkable as the soc value 1 81 0 13 of the forest lands was significantly higher p 0 05 than other tillage treatments table 1 the reduction of soc in ct might be attributed to the tillage induced disturbance of soil aggregates by microbial deterioration olson and al kaisi 2015 the soc of rt 0 50 0 01 was significantly lower p 0 05 than zt 0 57 0 04 the difference of soc between rt and ct was insignificant p 0 05 although the soc content in rt is higher than in ct the soc was reduced by 3 7 times by converting land use from forest to ct however in the case of zt the soc level was restored in soil and reached up to 32 of the original soc as in the forest tillage leads to soc mixing with subsurface layers and high erosion rates as in the case of ct and the condition gradually improves toward conservation tillage and forest land use due to less soil disturbance higher residue retention litter addition and further soc stratification patra et al 2019b kabir et al 2020 furthermore the considerably reduced bulk density in the surface soil was related to the comparatively greater soc in the forest zt and rt treatments the forest land had significantly p 0 05 lower bulk density than other land uses the lowest soil bulk density in forest land may be due to the perennial plant cover and continued litter addition accompanied by zero mechanical disturbance that avoids soil compaction and increased soc input kabir et al 2020 the highest bulk density g cm3 was observed in ct treatment 1 45 0 11 followed by rt 1 41 0 12 zt 1 33 0 06 and forest 1 03 0 05 nonetheless no significant variation was seen between the pairs zt rt and rt ct even though zt had significantly p 0 05 lower bulk density than ct the increased soil bulk density in ct may be due to less residue retention and intensive tillage and compaction of soil due to heavy machinery alletto and coquet 2009 havaee et al 2014 other studies have revealed a similar pattern of reduced bulk density in forests and zt cavalieri et al 2009 patra et al 2019b this difference in bulk density related to land use was mostly attributable to the combined influence of soc tillage techniques root density of crop land use and rainfall intensity kumar et al 2018 singh et al 2021 hence converting forest to agricultural land increased the bd which may be due to a decrease in total porosity lowering of soc and earthworm activity li et al 2021 however the increase in zt s bulk density is smaller compared to other tillage practices likewise the influence of various land use practices on soil aggregate mwd is visible as presented in table 1 the forest soil had significantly p 0 05 higher mwd mm 1 51 0 39 among all other treatments likely due to higher soc and stable aggregate it was followed by zt having significantly p 0 05 higher mwd 1 20 0 33 as compared to rt and ct however no statistical significance was observed between rt and ct although rt had a higher mwd 0 89 0 07 than ct 0 85 0 10 it may be observed that a decrease 56 in mwd of conventional tillage was observed after conversion from forest land to ct however an increase 1 4 times in mwd had occurred due to the adoption of zt relative to ct the higher water stable aggregation in forest and conservation tillage may be due to higher soc root induced physical entanglement of aggregates increased root exudates and reinforcement of soil particle contact due to better root growth pohl et al 2009 yoo et al 2011 parihar et al 2016 patra et al 2019a thereby switching forest to agricultural land reduced the stability of soil aggregate considerably as observed from the finding of decreases in mwd and it was restored near to original level by adopting conservation practices additionally soil moisture an essential parameter for plant growth varied significantly among land uses the transition of forest to farmland reduced the soil water content significantly at the 0 15 cm depth the ct rt and zt had 0 42 0 41 and 0 67 times soil moisture respectively relative to the forest forest had significantly p 0 05 higher soil moisture 27 5 2 09 among all treatments followed by zt treatment which had higher soil moisture 18 4 1 44 than rt and ct however the rt and ct had no significant difference in soil moisture although ct had a higher value than rt this variation between rt and ct might be attributed to ct s higher clay content reduced crop growth and lower potential evapotranspiration compared to rt fu et al 2003 gao et al 2014 overall the results demonstrated that while soil physical values worsened owing to conversion of land use from forest to ct adopting ca approaches improved soil physical qualities when compared to ct practices 3 2 land use implications on near saturated hydraulic conductivity as per the findings shown in fig 2 and fig 3 the k x and q x increased towards the soil saturation point i e these parameters increased as the water pressure head decreased fig 2 depicts the effect of land usage on steady state water flow q at saturated and near saturated states the water flux was significantly higher for forest land use than other treatments irrespective of the pressure head applied this may be due to the presence of coarser roots which increased macropores or aeration pores and higher root density in forest and conservation agriculture land use respectively burr hersey et al 2020 chen et al 2021 moreover the trend followed was forest zt rt ct although statistically insignificant the zt treatment showed comparatively higher water flux than rt and ct a similar trend of water flux for various land uses was also documented by other researchers giertz et al 2005 abu hashim et al 2011 it is indicative from the results that the water flux value increased with a decrease in pressure head due to the contribution of large conducting macropores to water flow at a near saturation state kelishadi et al 2014 kabir et al 2020 the lowest q value was observed for the ct among all treatments which may be attributed to a decrease in pore size due to high compactness of soil fewer macropores weak soil structure and less microbial activity due to less soc giertz et al 2005 kelishadi et al 2014 several researchers have observed a greater steady state infiltration rate in the forest relative to other land uses owing to the existence of a deep root system and longer taproot shi et al 2021 fig 3 illustrates the sshc and nsshc estimates from the ssi rate using wooding s analytical solution at 0 1 and 3 cm pressure heads for various land use treatments similar to water flux q the highest mean kfs 0 cm was observed under forest 122 15 mm h 1 afterward by zt 69 17 mm h 1 rt 59 94 mm h 1 and ct 36 08 mm h 1 respectively and a similar trend was also followed for hydraulic conductivity at 1 cm pressure head however the nsshc at 3 cm pressure head followed the magnitude like forest rt zt ct the land use induced structural changes and modification of pore dynamics are reflected in this variation of near saturated hydraulic conductivity at saturation the forest had a significantly p 0 05 higher kfs than other land uses however there was no significant difference amongst zt rt and ct the hydraulic conductivity value of zt and rt were 1 92 and 1 66 times higher than ct respectively the k 1 and k 3 values for forest land were also highest among other land uses with respective hydraulic conductivity values of 68 31 mm hr and 32 26 mm hr the least value for k x and q x were seen in ct regardless of pressure heads 0 1 and 3 cm which was likely attributable to soil compaction caused by the regular use of agricultural machinery and intensive ploughing operations which might have destructed the macropore and soil structure kabir et al 2020 several studies li et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 had reported the decrease in hydraulic conductivity with a decrease in pressure head and among the treatments the direction of decrease was from forest land towards agricultural land higher litter deposit in the forest and agricultural residue retention in ca along with favourable circumstances for the establishment of earthworms and soil fauna may have enhanced soil porosity patra et al 2019a at pressure heads of 0 1 3 cm the k x values increased by 1 92 1 65 and 1 43 times respectively after switching from ct to zt from the above assessment of conversion of forest land to ct and ca and its subsequent effect on shps it was evident that the ct gradually decreased k x value however by adopting ca zt and rt the k x value started restoring it may be justified by a similar variation in tillage practices bd som particle size distribution mwd and root growth for the respective land use ghestem et al 2011 udom et al 2018 li et al 2021 retention of leaf litters and crop residues as in the case of forest and zt or rt leads to an increase in soil macro porosity more connected pore structure and thereby higher saturated hydraulic conductivity dong et al 2021 maier et al 2020 studied the effect of aging of moraines 10000 3000 160 and 30 years old on surface soil saturated hydraulic conductivity in the central swiss alps and it was observed that median hydraulic conductivity was highest on the youngest moraine 432 cm hr 1 and lowest 54 cm hr 1 on the oldest moraine due to changes in soil texture li et al 2021 also studied the chrono sequence of land use change forest 41 50 and 65 years of cultivation on soil hydraulic properties and observed that the hydraulic conductivity decreased with increasing soil depth range 0 15 cm and it was highest for forest 51 9 cm day 1 to lowest for 50 years of cultivation 19 6 cm day 1 furthermore the hydraulic response of the soil under four treatments was analyzed employing matric flux potential mr and mt for the entire pressure head range i e from 0 to 3 cm under near saturated conditions fig 4 illustrates the effect of different treatments on matric flux potential from 0 to 3 cm water pressure head similar to the tendencies of k x and q forest land had the greatest mt and mr followed by zt rt and ct the forest mt was much greater than the other treatments however the difference was insignificant with zt however the mr of treatments did not vary significantly overall results indicate that the ca based treatment showed higher tension and residual flux potential next to forest land and the ct based treatments had shown the lowest value for both the parameters similar results of lowest mt and mr in ct compared to zt and rt were documented in previous studies patra et al 2019a singh et al 2021 the greater mt cm2s 1 value in the forest and zt might be credited to the land management impact and a better root network leading to hydrologically active pathways shougrakpam et al 2010 moreover higher mwd in the above treatments influenced the inter aggregate pore space causing higher infiltration flux singh et al 2021 3 3 soil pore characteristics conductivity relationship the r0 is an indirect measure of land management induced variation in the soil s pore structure and represents the contribution of pore size to water flux schwen et al 2011 the relation of pressure head h variation with rmax and r0 for various tillage practices is shown in fig 5 forest had the greatest r0 mm values among the treatments in near saturated conditions with values at pressure heads of 0 1 and 3 cm were of 0 49 0 06 0 31 0 04 and 0 28 0 04 respectively whereas ct had consistently lower r0 values however the r0 values of forest and zt were relatively closer to each other and with rmax values at all pressure heads which indicates better connectivity of pores in forest and zt as compared to other land use the higher r0 represents improved biopore connectivity in forest and ca might be due to the presence of root networks higher abundance of earthworms and other soil microbes and their biological activity better soil aggregate stability patra et al 2019a schluter et al 2020 at near saturation state when the water flux is governed by macropores the differences between rmax and r0 are maximum for all the treatments moreover at saturation state the r0 values of forest and zt were significantly p 0 05 higher than ct even though the variation in rt and ct was insignificant p 0 05 the decreasing trend of pore network connectivity was forest zt rt ct at three pressure heads which indicates a gradual increase in tortuosity due to breakdown of soil structure and less biological activity schwen et al 2011 3 4 effect of land use on hydraulically active porosity the water conducting porosity as a percentage of soil volume in the range of pressure heads 0 to 3 cm as influenced by four land use practices is presented in table 2 the pressure heads of 0 1 and 3 cm represent the soil pore radius of 2 50 1 49 and 0 50 mm respectively bodhinayake and si 2004 suggested to assume a maximum pore radius of 2 50 mm at saturation 0 cm pressure head which suitably represents the bio pores created by earthworm burrowing activity root networks or activity by other soil fauna a significantly p 0 05 higher water conducting porosity soil volume 10 5 was observed in the forest 182 81 74 64 followed by zt 97 19 35 74 rt 83 01 25 98 and ct 48 49 9 34 for the complete pore radius regime of 0 50 to 2 50 mm a similar trend of water conducting porosity was followed for 0 50 to 1 49 mm and 1 49 to 2 50 mm pore radius range the gradual reduction of soil macropore to mesopore and micropore towards ct from zt was significantly due to increased traffic of agricultural machinery breakdown of soil structure less biological activity high tortuosity daraghmeh et al 2008 schwen et al 2011 the soil volume conducting water in zt and rt was consistently higher 2 and 1 71 times respectively than ct in all the pore radius ranges although the difference was insignificant p 0 05 in previous studies researchers have reported similar ranges of wcp for different land use singh et al 2021 patra et al 2019a water conducting porosity soil volume varied from 0 00063 to 0 0016 for cultivated land and native grassland respectively bodhinayake si 2004 0 0008 in cropland to 0 0035 in grassland yu et al 2015 0 00017 in ct to 0 00078 in zt patra et al 2019a although the water conducting macro porosity accounts for a minimal proportion of total soil volume it plays a vital role in runoff generation and water flux at the near saturated state of soil carey et al 2007 moret arrúe 2007 singh et al 2021 moreover the water flow through different groups of pore size 0 50 0 50 1 49 and 1 49 mm in the four land uses was estimated using the equation given by bodhinayake et al 2004 and presented in fig 6 the macropores 0 5 mm in radius and the meso micropores 0 50 mm in radius contributed 61 99 73 44 and 26 56 38 01 of total flow respectively across the land uses the contribution of macropores 0 5 mm pores to water movement was maximum in the forest 73 44 followed by zt 72 23 rt 67 14 and ct 61 99 whereas the meso and micropores 0 50 mm in radius contribution followed the trend like ct 38 01 rt 32 86 zt 27 77 and forest 26 56 the soil pores having radius 0 50 mm contributed about 73 44 72 23 67 14 and 61 99 of total flow at saturation state in the associated wcp of 0 00182 0 00097 0 00083 and 0 00048 of soil volume under forest zt rt and ct respectively in the water conducting process in all land use systems a relatively higher contribution by macropores which comprised only 0 0018 to 0 0004 of total soil volume signifies its importance the study results of share to total flow through macropore at near saturated condition was consistent with the findings of previously reported estimates of 60 to 73 of total water flow in the forest land watson luxmoore 1986 zhang et al 2021 67 of the total flow in the bamboo forest patra et al 2021 up to 80 of total flow under forest grassland and cropland at various soil depths yu et al 2015 hence the forest zt and rt s soil profiles were more prone to macropore flow than ct nevertheless ct was more susceptible to meso and micropore flow it indicates that converting natural forest lands to conventional agriculture deformed soil macropores structure and hydraulic conductivity however it had a positive impact in the case of ca as observed from the increased contribution of macropores it might be because of the increased soc which enhanced the soil aggregate formation as observed from mwd and increased soil stability and the evolution of root networks leading to better macroporosity zhang et al 2021 for forest land use the decayed root channels create larger macropores which contribute towards higher total water flow cadisch et al 2004 3 5 correlation of soil hydraulic and physicochemical properties the scatter plot matrix between soil hydrological dependent variable and physiochemical independent variable parameters were established to assess the impact of different land management strategies on soil hydraulic conductivity the strength of interrelations of the soil hydraulic conductivity values at saturation with bd soil moisture soc ec mwd and infiltration rate at saturation was examined using scatter plot matrix as shown in fig 7 the k 0 0 cm pressure head is positively correlated with soil moisture mwd soc q and negatively correlated with bulk density the decrease in hydraulic conductivity with the conversion of forest land to ct is attributed to their soil physical properties the bd mwd and soc are interrelated as decrease in soc porosity and increased soil compaction leads to elevation of soil bulk density and thereby reduced mwd of soil our findings agreed with those of bodhinayake and si 2004 parihar et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 li et al 2021 4 conclusions the restoration pattern of soil in terms of shps to the original level due to land use reformation is discussed in this paper the present study fulfills the limited availability of quantitative data regarding changing patterns of shps from forest land to conventional land and further conservation agriculture for the himalayan region the research explores the changes in shps caused by the transition of natural forest land to succeeding agricultural fields under various management strategies ct rt and zt in india s nw himalayan region one of the highly vulnerable agroecosystems in terms of soil hydraulic conductivity total tension flux potential residual flux potential flow weighted mean pore radius and hydraulically active porosity the forest land use showed the highest value followed by zt rt and ct respectively however the r0 values of forest and zt were relatively closer to each other and with rmax values at all pressure heads which indicates better connectivity of pores in forest and zt as compared to other land use although after conversion of forest land to conventional land increased bd thereby compactness and reduced mwd and soc but it was improved after adopting conservation agriculture additionally the macropores 0 5 mm in radius contributed 61 99 73 44 of total water flow while the meso and micropores 0 50 mm in radius contributed 26 56 38 01 of total flow across the land uses moreover the soil pores having radius 0 50 mm conducted about 73 44 72 23 67 14 and 61 99 of total flow at saturation state in the respective wcp of 0 00182 0 00097 0 00083 and 0 00048 of soil volume under forest zt rt and ct in the water conducting process in all land use systems macropore s relatively higher contribution which comprises only small space 0 0018 to 0 0004 of total soil volume signifies its importance further scatter plot matrix analysis depicted that among the various soil physical and chemical properties the mwd and soc are the dominating factors controlling the nsshc for all the land use systems overall our results suggest that adoption of conservation tillage practices may enhance soil hydraulic properties following conversion of forest land as compared to ct based agriculture further these results are important to understand that due to higher observed soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of ca it will improve water infiltration rate into soil layers retain more soil moisture and reduce runoff and

analysis 
923,the jarama river due to its proximity to madrid has been a highly regulated and polluted for decades we evaluated the effects of changing multi pressures over time and along the fluvial continuum changes in macrobenthic composition and structure in response to alterations in river habitat have been analyzed from two macroinvertebrate sampling campaigns carried out 42 years apart at 11 locations along the jarama river results show that the macrobenthic communities follow a similar pattern along the river continuum in both periods richness and diversity were higher at mountain reaches without pollution and unregulated the minimum values are reached at san fernando de henares although in the lower part of the river after receiving all the pollution discharges from the manzanares river there are no macrobenthos since the jarama bottoms are anoxic sludge comparing the communities at the same localities we have detected clear temporal changes in the upper zone the total number of taxa and diversity decreased but the fauna richness is maintained in the section just below large reservoirs we find an increase in macrobenthos richness in all the medium sections there is a recovery in all the macrobenthos parameters but this improvement does not reach good ecological status due to the high concentrations of ammonia in the lower section no changes are detected because the accumulated sludge is still present keywords macroinvertebrates pollution flow regulation environmental flows long term changes 1 introduction water is one of the resources most affected by humans as it is used in all the activities that develop for this reason the water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec manages and protects the water bodies in the european union with the aim to achieve a good ecological status in this sense water authorities in each country should carry out programs to monitor their status by the analysis of indicators that can be physicochemical or biological those water bodies flowing close to highly populated urban areas are more exposed to anthropogenic stressors such as water demand and water quality impoverishment arenas sánchez et al 2021 giri 2021 leading to several alterations on the fauna living in these habitats wepener et al 2011 then special attention should be paid to these highly exposed rivers in an effort to improve and conserve a healthy status the lack of information on the relationship between parameters that can be considered toxic when exceeding some limits and other factors that modify the properties of the water means that attempts should be made to mitigate the effects of a single factor when several factors are acting this coexistence of impacts with diverse and even opposing effects on water has been reported in previous studies lowell culp and dubé 2000 schäfer et al 2016 in terms of the aquatic ecosystem response to the action of multiple factors we can highlight the decrease in the species richness frequently found in rivers boix et al 2010 gutiérrez cánovas et al 2013 lobera et al 2017 quevedo baez et al 2018 particularly macroinvertebrate communities are frequently used as adequate indicators of the ecological status of the water body as they present very diverse river habitat requirements and occupies a large part of river ecological niches alba tercedor and sánchez ortega 1988 armanini et al 2014 in alluvial rivers macroinvertebrate communities are the most interesting biological indicators due to their multiple interactions with the environment given their dependency on the physico chemical conditions of the water moreover their uniform size abundance and diversity facilitate sampling and there are standardized indices at the european level prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 gamboa et al 2008 ladreda 2012 many studies both worldwide fruget et al 2015 li et al 2014 and particularly in spain monzón et al 1991 rallo et al 2004 have attempted to monitor changes both in the longitudinal distribution of species and in water quality in the medium term however due to the fact that numerous studies about macrobenthos started in the mid 1970s long term studies with a period of analysis around 50 years are still not frequent jackson and füreder 2006 in this context this study aims to understand the evolution of the composition and structure of macroinvertebrate communities in response to the environmental changes occurred in the river especially in terms of water quality and flow regime alteration over several decades to that purpose the jarama river basin located in central spain that represents a fluvial network highly regulated mainly due to the proximity of large urban centers as the city of madrid has been selected as this metropolis demands a constant supply of water six large reservoirs were constructed at the headstreams from where water is derived though pipes and canals to the city this cause long river reaches to have their flow greatly reduced as occurs downstream of el vado reservoir located in the jarama river and below the mouth of the lozoya river its main tributary which is regulated by the pinilla riosequillo puentes viejas el villar and el atazar reservoirs the reaches below dams were even completely dry during some years hidalgo 2005 sánchez 2012 sotelo and sotelo 2013 in addition the jarama river system especially in its middle and lower reaches receives urban wastewater after being treated although not all dumping was debugged and even today the debugging is not complete water quality impoverishment and flow regulation interact from different locations along the jarama river continuum flow regulation caused by large dams located in the foothills while pollution occurs in the lower reaches around the city of madrid several mitigation measures have been implemented in the last decades which affect macroinvertebrates communities in a spatial context environmental flows implemented mainly below dams and pollution control in the lowlands with the construction of water treatment plants we hypothesize that 1 the intensity of the flow regulation reduces macrobenthic biodiversity while the environmental minimum flows measured by the rate of increase of minimum and summer flows allow the recovery of macroinvertebrate biodiversity and 2 the degree of water organic pollution and eutrophication bod5 o2 and nh4 determines a loss of biodiversity along the study period as a background samples taken in the jarama river in 1979 gonzález del tánago et al 1982 and in 1987 prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 will serve as a reference to define the trajectory followed by the fluvial ecosystem along its longitudinal gradient and validate the hypothesis 2 material and methods 2 1 location of sampling stations and macroinvertebrate collection a total of 11 sampling points were selected along the jarama river points j 1 to j 11 in figure 1 which were the same reaches sampled by gonzález del tánago et al 1982 in the 1970s in addition stations j 5 to j 10 were sampled in the 1980s by prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 the selection of the same stations as in the previous studies allows a more accurate comparison two sampling campaigns were carried out the first during autumn and winter 2018 and the second in spring 2019 in the lotic and lentic facies both samplings were attempted to be as similar as possible to those carried out in the previous studies using a hand meshed net with a 20 15 cm metal frame to which was attached a final mesh of 1 mm mesh size and a depth of 30 cm in both the lotic and lentic facies sampling were executed by the kicking method macan 1958 five and four kicks were taken at each sampling point in lotic and lentic facies respectively distributed throughout the river section trying to locate the different microhabitats that can be found in the area to be representative of the reach the organisms obtained were placed in cylindrical plastic jars with an approximate capacity of 0 5 l duly labelled and 96 alcohols was added for their preservation at the laboratory each sample was cleaned with the help of a binocular magnifying glass meji brand macroinvertebrate individuals were counted and identified according to wallace et al 1990 tachet et al 2000 at the genus level when possible although in some cases was done at the family level depending on the state of development conservation or the difficulty of each group 2 2 physico chemical data and gauging the temporal analysis of physico chemical water condition was carried out using data from the cemas network confederación hidrográfica del tajo 2023 http www chtajo es lacuenca calidadagua resultados informes documents aguassuperficiales red 20ica informes ica htm collected at 7 stations along the jarama river for the period 1978 to 2017 figure 1 the parameters of ammonium conductivity biochemical oxygen demand bod5 hereafter and dissolved oxygen o2 hereafter have been considered as they are those that most affect the macroinvertebrate communities and are the most frequently measured also conductivity measurements were taken at all stations for the present study together with those provided by confederación hidrográfica del tajo the flow regime and its temporal evolution have been analyzed from the collection of daily flow data from 5gauge stations cedex 2020 gauge 3050 el vado reservoir was used to calculate incoming flow regime representative of station j 2 while the outflows were representative of j 3 gauge 3153 located downstream of lozoya river confluence was considered representative of station j 5 and j 6 gauge 3051 is located downstream of the confluence with guadalix river and was representative of station j 7 and j 8 gauge 3052 located downstream of the confluence with henares river and representative of station j 9 and finally gauge 3074 and gauge 3075 that had complementary information and were assigned to station j 11 two period of analysis were considered a first period from 1972 to 1987 to characterize the initial macroinvertebrate sampling gonzález del tánago et al 1982 prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 and from 2000 to 2017 to characterize the current sampling flow regime was characterized by means of different parameters for medium and extreme magnitudes and intra annual variability 2 3 macroinvertebrate indicators the analysis of the macroinvertebrate communities present in the jarama river is based on the indicators of faunal richness number of taxa differentiated at each station and by sampling occasion and shannon diversity shannon 1948 for the determination of the ecological status the ecological quality ratio eqr hereafter defined as a quotient of the measured value between the reference values for each type of river has been estimated based on the ibmwp index alba tercedor and sánchez ortega 1988 as it is one of the most widely used biological indicators in spain and based on royal decree 817 2015 of 11 september which establishes the criteria for monitoring and evaluating the status of surface waters and the environmental quality standards 2 4 data analysis to detect and spatio temporal response in macroinvertebrate communities non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was used to visualize the gradient along the river and during the study period using metamds function from the vegan package oksanen et al 2020 in r r core team 2019 nmds is considered the most robust ecological analysis of communities minchin 1987 and it is a flexible technique that can be applied to any type of data without normality requirements the inter sampling distance matrix was based on the bray curtis algorithm to assess the mesological factors influencing the communities we have used the vector fitting method applying the envfit function from the vegan package oksanen et al 2020 in r this method fits vectors or environmental factors into an ordination correlating their length and direction with the projections of the points in the ordination oksanen j 2015 3 results 3 1 present conditions in sampling period 2018 2019 the richness pattern along the jarama river shows a decreasing trend from the headwaters j 1 and j 2 to the sections below the el vado reservoir j3 and j 4 where richness is greatly recovered after receiving the lozoya river j 5 and j 6 arising maximum values figure 2 downstream from the confluence with guadalix river coinciding with a continuum of industrial estates the richness drops sharply reaching the minimum value in j 9 and especially in j 11 where the substrate was anoxic sludge macroinvertebrate s richness was higher in spring than in autumn except for stations j 7 j 9 and j 10 figure 2 where autumn winter richness was slightly higher than in spring shannon diversity show similar trends figure 3 although less marked and with the maximum values at the headwaters in general spring diversity is higher than autumn winter except in j 8 and j 10 while j 3 and j 5 presented similar values in both samplings the ecological status assessed based on the eqr of macrobenthos table 1 shows that in all stations the spring sampling have better ecological status values than in the autumn winter sampling except in stations j 9 and j 10 it is interesting to note that the section downstream of the lozoya confluence j 5 is the only one that has a very good condition in both samplings analyzing the evolution of these three parameters along the longitudinal gradient of the jarama river a very similar pattern can be observed they initially reduce their values from j 1 to j 3 downstream of the el vado dam presenting the minimum values from here they rise uniformly in j 4 j 5 downstream of the lozoya river which is strongly regulated by a string of large reservoirs until reaching maximum values in j 6 talamanca from the mouth of the guadalix river j 7 the jarama river enters a section of strong industrial and urban development and the parameters drop sharply which remain stable j 8 and j 9 until the confluence with the henares river j 10 in which they increase slightly finally below the confluence of the manzanares river the river is heavily impacted and at the station located further downstream j 11 remains highly degraded 3 2 longitudinal gradient and temporal evolution 3 2 1 water physicochemical evolution the temporal change of the physicochemical parameters analyzed were water mineralization conductivity and the load of organic matter bod5 together with those resulting from its decomposition that reduces dissolved oxygen and releases nutrients ammonium the water mineralization figure 4 and table s1 evaluated through its conductivity gradually increases downstream along the river but a sharp increase can be observed below el vado reservoir j 4 with respect to the average values of the previous stations station j 5 shows a slightly decrease compared to j 4 and then an increasing trend is observed downstream arising maximum values in j 11 higher than 1100 µs m regarding the temporal evolution stations j 2 and j 4 can be considered stable as they present similar values in stations j 5 j 7 j 9 and j 10 the conductivity has been decreasing but it should be noted that stations j 5 and j 7 present increased values during the 90 s that decrease in subsequent decades finally at station j 11 the conductivity remains stable along the period regarding the bod5 it is quite stable in upstream stations from j 2 to j 5 with slightly variations less than 9 in the case of j 2 and j 4 however in the remaining downstream stations there has been a great decrease in the mean values of bod5 during the last decades with reductions higher than 90 in j 10 and j 11 since the subperiod 1978 1989 emphasizing the longitudinal variation of the parameter it is seen that currently 2010 2017 all stations present similar values and less than 4 mg l in the case of dissolved oxygen in jarama river an inverse longitudinal pattern can be observed compared to bod5 figure 4 and table s1 downstream along the river a reduction in oxygen levels can be observed in all decades except for station j 10 and j 11 in the last decade where the dissolved oxygen level increase compared to upstream values stations j 2 j 4 and j 5 have remained stable over time with variations lower than 7 while stations j 7 j 9 j 10 and j 11 show an increase regarding the ammonium concentration it can be observed a gradual increase downstream along the river until station j 5 j 7 presents a sharp increase and the maximum ammonium values are found at j 9 that slightly decrease in the downstream stations j 10 and j 11 observing the variations occurred within the stations it is seen that in j 2 and j 4 there have been hardly any changes in this parameter in the following stations j 5 and j 7 it can be seen how in the 80s the values were like those that are found today however in the 90s the ammonium levels increased although they have been decreasing to the present day at stations j 9 j 10 and j 11 a reduction in the values is observed although the current values are still too high 3 2 2 changes on flow regime maximum annual flows qmax and the 90th percentile flow decrease from the first period to the last throughout the entire jarama river table 2 the same pattern is found with the mean and median flows but in this case the stations corresponding to j 5 and j 6 valdepeñas show an increase in the last period low flow indicators the minimum annual flow qmin the percentile 10 p10 and summer flow qsummer tend to increase in most of the stations especially this rise is remarkable in the sections downstream of the reservoirs valdepeñas qmin and p10 tripled and summer flows increased by 80 on the contrary in the head stations j 1 and j2 together with the further downstream ones j 11 the low flows decrease the intrannual flow variability cv does not greatly vary between periods but it shows a longitudinal trend in the upper section it is high and it is reduced below the el vado reservoir recovering with the contribution of the lozoya until in the lower sections that decreases drastically 3 2 3 evolution of macroinvertebrate communities comparison of macroinvertebrate species richness from this work with the previous ones gonzález del tánago et al 1982 is shown in table 3 together with the number of taxa from the first study that appear disappear and remain the loss of taxa from station j 1 to j 4 is remarkable comparing current communities with those from the 70s with losses of more than 33 taxa in the four stations on the other hand new 9 taxa appear but they are not enough to alleviate the decline in biodiversity that occurs in these stations in the jarama upper zones cryophilic taxa have mainly disappeared while new ones are eurioic secondly in j 5 and j 6 which are located below the confluence with the lozoya river biodiversity has increased since there are more new taxa than disappeared most of the disappeared taxa are thermophiles some of great conservation interest like marthamea vitripennis while most of the new ones are eurioic and some cryophilic downstream from j 7 the number of taxa decreases in both studies and it can be said that stations j 7 j 8 and j 10 remain relatively stable due to the balance between losses and gains of taxa all new taxa are eurioic and tolerant to eutrophic environments on the contrary the j 9 station has had a great improvement in diversity since in the first study carried out no macroinvertebrate was found while currently 13 different taxa appear it should be noted that in j 11 the station remains stable due to the absence of macroinvertebrates in the samplings in a comparative overview it is observed that in some stations there has been a great variation in fauna richness table 4 the greatest loss of taxa per sample occurs in station j 2 since in the current samplings 2019 an average of 10 6 less taxa have been found than in the samplings of the former study 1979 on the other hand j 6 is the station with the highest increase with 17 6 more taxa on average it should be noted that in the past the station with the highest average richness was j 2 while today the station with the highest value is j 6 the polluted reaches downstream from j 7 that obtained the lowest richness values in the past corresponds to the lowest current values although a recovery is clear the macrobenthic community structure measured by mean diversity per sample table 4 has undergone great variations from the first study in 1979 to the present diversity has been reduced from station j 1 to j 4 especially in station j 2 it should be noted that this station was formerly the one with the highest average diversity value from j 5 to j 10 diversity values increase in the last sampling with the largest change being found in j 10 from 0 65 in 1979 to 2 24 in 2019 although these recoveries in this area j 1 also present a high diversity comparable to j 5 it should be noted that the minimum mean values found in the first studies and in the present appear in station j 9 which although it is the one with the worst values is the third station that has noticed the greatest improvement the spatio temporal evolution of the ecological status estimated by the eqr ecological quality ratio based on the ibmwp of the jarama river is shown in table 5 in the comparison of eqr means of previous samplings and current ones it is possible to observe great variations for example j 2 change from very good to good status while in j 5 and j 6 the change has been the opposite it should be noted that a decrease in eqr has only been found at stations j 2 and j 3 in previous studies the maximum eqr value appeared in j 2 while it currently appears in j 5 on the contrary in 1978 the sections from j 7 to j 10 had a very bad condition and have improved to moderate j 7 and j 8 and to bad j 9 and j 10 3 2 4 evaluation of the controlling factors of the changes the results of the spatial temporal ordering of the macrobenthic communities by means of the multivariate nmds analysis are presented in figure 5 a the adjustment obtained in this arrangement or stress was 0 118 which according to kruskal 1964 is good the first axis of this arrangement nmds1 in figure 5 establishes a spatial gradient in the distribution of species from the upper reaches of the jarama river versus the lower ones it separates species which are typical from mountain streams rhithron such as glossosoma hydropsyche gr fulvipes hydraena micrasema dinocras lepidostoma anomalopterygella agapetus sericostomatidae larcasia partita allogamus limoniidae rhyacophila hydropsyche cf punica perla leuctra protonemura and epeorus from potamic and pollution tolerant species such as chironomus gr plumosus physa fontinalis hirudinea caenis potamanthus chironomidae tubificidae hydropsyche exocellata and ancyclus fluviatilis on the contrary the second axis is related to the temporal changes discriminating the communities from 1978 79 with higher values from the recent 2018 2019 this axis separates more relevant taxa in the seventies isoperla hydroptilidae taeniopteryx hydropsyche siltalai limoniidae hydropsyche pellucidula perla potamanthus atyaephyra desmarestii hydropsyche bulbifera from the current taxa hydropsyche cf punica allogamus larcasi partita sericostomatidae lepidostoma agapetus anomalopterygella dinocras micrasema the adjustment of the vectors to this taxonomical arrangement shows a longitudinal gradient in the first axis figure 5b associating higher dissolved oxygen to communities with higher ecological status eqr diversity and richness in the upper reaches compared to the lower reaches that are significantly correlated with pollution bod5 and ammonium more mineralized waters high conductivity and with higher flow rates high qmax table 6 the vectors adjusted to the second axis also explain the temporal changes of the macroinvertebrate communities and the characteristics of the water figure 5b indeed this axis discriminates between bod5 in the positive side versus ammonium which is in the negative part of the axis and biodiversity versus richness factors that have changed between both sampling periods the bod5 has been reduced by the operation improvement of the sewage treatment plants although they have been unable to eliminate the ammonia then species have disappeared globally although the richness of seasonal samplings has been greater that is the seasonal overlap of species has been reduced 4 discussion 4 1 current longitudinal distribution of macroinvertebrates communities based on the results obtained in the macrobenthos samplings in autumn winter and spring the jarama river can be divided into two well differentiated zones according to the human pressure on the water body alric et al 2021 first the upper zone from j 1 to j 6 is characterized by a high species richness and a diverse macroinvertebrate community where the observed values of the eqr reflect a good status of the water bodies coinciding with good water physicochemical conditions it should be noted that species richness is a variable that depends on the time of the year since most macroinvertebrates are insects and spend a part of their life cycle outside of the aquatic environment therefore a taxonomic variation is observed and expected both along the river and within the same sampling site depending on the season when the samplings were carried out regarding the dominant taxa this zone is represented mainly by the family heptageniidae especially by the genera epeorus sp ecdyonurus sp and rhithrogena sp although genera baetis sp and ephemerella sp from ephemeroptera order and larcasia partita from trichoptera order are also abundant in this upper zone there is a remarkable decrease in richness diversity and eqr in j 2 and j 3 that is recovered downstream from j 3 to j 6 this longitudinal improvement would respond to the hypothesis about the recovery of macroinvertebrates diversity related to environmental flows implementations in regulated reaches as it could be related with the confluence with lozoya river a regulated river with a lower anthropic pressure related to urban areas where environmental flows are implemented in its further downstream reservoir el atazar this large reservoir with a dam 134 meters high releases cold water on summer from hypolimneon leading this reach to be the only one with higher minimum and summer flows table 2 in effect it is a river section considered as a strategic water body that according to river basin management plans are the only ones in which the implementation of environmental flows is mandatory since 2016 royal decree 1 2016 the first two rbmp from 2009 to 20214 and from 2015 to 2021 fixed constant minimum e flows below el vado reservoir 0 30 m3 s and below el atazar 0 88 m3 s this means that stations j 3 and j 4 should had at least 0 30 m3 s and j 5 and j 6 should have 1 19 m3 s secondly the middle and lower zone of the river from j 7 to j 11 present a low macroinvertebrate richness probably related to the water quality impoverishment due to the numerous polluting water inputs that comes from densely populated then at this reach high pollution conditions would condition macroinvertebrates response over flow regulation conditions however it should be noted that from stations j 9 to j 10 there is a slight increase in macroinvertebrate richness this improvement could be due to the confluence with the henares river that by a dilution effect decrease the pollution that have been accumulated up to this point in this lower river segment the chironomidae family is dominant with chironomus gr plumosus being the main species and sometimes the family simuliidae baetis sp and hydropsyche exocellata are also very abundant regarding the eqr of the river all the values correspond to status worse than good particularly moderate in j 7 and j 8 bad in j 9 and j 10 and very bad in j 11 4 2 temporal trend of studied parameters and consequences on macroinvertebrate communities in general all the physicochemical parameters currently analyzed present better values than in the 70s and 80s it is remarkable the great decrease of the bod5 which in the 70s and 80s present very high values in the stations with available data values higher than 30 mg l in j 10 and j 11 while at present it is at acceptable levels lower than 4 mg l this may be associated with the implementation of the royal decree 509 1996 that establishes the rules applicable to sewage water treatment indicating that bod5 levels should be reduced by 20 before discharge and later by the order arm 2656 2008 that imposes bod5 instream values below the threshold of 6 mg l flow regime has experienced a general reduction in the jarama river all high flows both maximum and 90th percentiles have decreased together with mean annual flows that have been reduced due to the intensification of water resources demand in the catchment and probably due to climate change however mezger lorenzo et al 2022 studied the evolution of annual streamflow in the tagus river basin spain during the 1950 2010 period was studied their analyses revealed a general decreasing trend in streamflow and an increasing trend in air temperature while trends in precipitation are less clear suggesting that the expansion of forested areas a 60 and irrigated land a 400 since 1950 could have been important factors in the reduction of streamflow in the tagus basin on the contrary the river reach below the lozoya mouth station j 5 valdepeñas is a clear exception because it s mean and median flows and especially the low ones summer p10 and minimum have increased probably due to environment flows implementation based on the temporal evolution of macroinvertebrate communities five different segments can be differentiated a first segment from j 1 to j 2 located upstream of the el vado reservoir where a loss of biological integrity has occurred since their communities have partially lost their complexity with fewer species although the richness per sampling indicates a reduction in the temporal overlap of species this change may be the effect of global warming and its consequence of a reduction on instreams flows as community lost some cryophilic species and gain eurioic ones similar consequences have been reported in the upper rhône by fruget et al 2015 where its communities exhibited biological profiles closer to those ones from further downstream reaches the next segment from j 3 to j 4 below el vado reservoir built in 1954 experienced a similar loss of biological integrity although it was already impacted by flow regulation before the first samplings the third segment j 5 to j 6 shows a great improvement in almost all the macrobenthic indicators analyzed probably due to the changes in the flow regulation of the lozoya river with an increase in summer flows when the reservoirs are stratified and then releasing colder waters than in the previous period ward and stanford 1979 rader and ward 1988 ellis and jones 2013 phillips et al 2015 in the fourth segment from j 7 to j 10 all the indicator values show a significant improvement especially when comparing the current levels with those found by prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 since at that time the river suffered the highest levels of pollution coinciding with very low flow events as some zero days flows were registered producing high levels of stress in the river prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 therefore in this section although the good ecological status has not been reached yet table 5 it has notably improved since the very poor condition that existed in 1979 finally the last segment j 11 is characterized by the stable poor conditions in relation to the anoxic sludge covering the riverbed already detected some decades ago that make the life of the macrobenthos impossible matisoff fisher and matis 1985 lake et al 2000 the physical chemical parameters trend indicates that water pollution has been mitigated in the last period while the alteration of the flow regime becomes more intense the comparative analysis carried out to relate the macroinvertebrate communities to the mesological characteristics show a direct relation between the improvement of water quality conditions and the recovery of diversity in the fluvial ecosystem as previous authors found in other rivers turunen et al 2016 johnson et al 2017 on the contrary we did not find any correlation between the greater flow regime alteration flow regime and the degradation of microbenthic diversity failing to prove the first hypothesis put forward in this study instead our results indicate that water pollution is the limiting factor of the good state evaluated by macroinvertebrate with the high positive gradient found in nmds analysis for the ammonium and bod5 with the first component nmds1 thus answering the second hypothesis raised in this study where it is indicated that a higher organic pollution in water implies a loss of biodiversity three main drivers would be causing a synergic effect in jarama river that has improved richness and diversity of macroinvertebrates communities in the last decades first the flow alteration cause by dam construction has artificially increased summer discharges that indirectly decrease water temperature as the water releases are hypolimnetic second this flow alteration has been recently modified by the implementation of environmental flows that ensure minimum flows around 10 of mean annual flow throughout the year remarkable improvements on biological communities have been also found by previous authors with the implementation of environmental flows weisberg et al 1990 lind et al 2007 belmar et al 2012 mackie et al 2013 pander et al 2019 and third the operation improvement of the sewage treatment plants this being a positive effect for macroinvertebrate communities arce at al 2014 which although they have been unable to eliminate the ammonia they efficiently reduce other pollutant elements such as the bod5 as found in this study the reduction of nutrients from wastewater treatment plant effluent concentrations is a target that water managers must assume and bolinches et al 2020 have estimated a threshold up to 0 65 mg l of ammonium and 0 55 mg l of phosphate to achieve the environmental goals in the jarama tajo system as we have shown the jarama macroinvertebrates communities are being recover in the middle reaches thanks to the implementation of environmental flows and the reduction of organic pollution however there is still a long way to go in this recovery process especially in its lower sections on the contrary in the upper jarama sections we have found a slight degradation process that probably is associated to global warming changes as it is expected to have strong effects on mediterranean climate regions lawrence et al 2010 long term ecological studies of freshwater macroinvertebrates are of great value to have a realistic view as has been highlighted by jackson and fürether 2006 and feio et al 2021 as they give an overall ecological assessment of water bodies undergoing multi stressors reyjol at al 2014 and the understanding of the jarama river recovery process really needs further studying its macrobenthic trajectory 5 conclusions in accordance with the objectives and in response to the proposed hypotheses it can be concluded in the present work that a longitudinal trend of the ecological status has been found in the jarama river with better quality conditions in the upper section leading to high diversity and richness while the lower sections present moderate to bad quality conditions probably due to high anthropic pressures downstream along the river thus flow alteration and pollution pressures acting together or alone reduce macrobenthic diversity the temporal trend suggests an improvement of the water quality and partial recovery of macroinvertebrate communities in the middle sections the implementation of environmental flows has allowed a considerable increase in biodiversity where in the past the low water levels were very pronounced as well as a summer cooling of the waters when they are released by the el vado and atazar reservoir nevertheless great value species that have disappeared like marthamea vitripennis never will come back therefore the effects of minimum environmental flows together with the cooling effect of large dams overrides the effects of the altered flow regime in the lower reaches improved sewage treatment plants have reduced bod5 from discharges according to legislation and consequently the oxygen levels on jarama river have increased however nutrients are not sufficiently treated ammonium levels well above the legal threshold of 1mg l that maintain eutrophication and therefore a high primary production that increases oxygen consumption this pollution improvement goes along with an increase of flow regime alteration and the macrobenthic biodiversity improves finally in the lower river sections the organic sludge and silt accumulated in the river bottoms for decades have a delay in their self recovery that still limits their colonization by macroinvertebrates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper supplementary materials supplementary

923,the jarama river due to its proximity to madrid has been a highly regulated and polluted for decades we evaluated the effects of changing multi pressures over time and along the fluvial continuum changes in macrobenthic composition and structure in response to alterations in river habitat have been analyzed from two macroinvertebrate sampling campaigns carried out 42 years apart at 11 locations along the jarama river results show that the macrobenthic communities follow a similar pattern along the river continuum in both periods richness and diversity were higher at mountain reaches without pollution and unregulated the minimum values are reached at san fernando de henares although in the lower part of the river after receiving all the pollution discharges from the manzanares river there are no macrobenthos since the jarama bottoms are anoxic sludge comparing the communities at the same localities we have detected clear temporal changes in the upper zone the total number of taxa and diversity decreased but the fauna richness is maintained in the section just below large reservoirs we find an increase in macrobenthos richness in all the medium sections there is a recovery in all the macrobenthos parameters but this improvement does not reach good ecological status due to the high concentrations of ammonia in the lower section no changes are detected because the accumulated sludge is still present keywords macroinvertebrates pollution flow regulation environmental flows long term changes 1 introduction water is one of the resources most affected by humans as it is used in all the activities that develop for this reason the water framework directive directive 2000 60 ec manages and protects the water bodies in the european union with the aim to achieve a good ecological status in this sense water authorities in each country should carry out programs to monitor their status by the analysis of indicators that can be physicochemical or biological those water bodies flowing close to highly populated urban areas are more exposed to anthropogenic stressors such as water demand and water quality impoverishment arenas sánchez et al 2021 giri 2021 leading to several alterations on the fauna living in these habitats wepener et al 2011 then special attention should be paid to these highly exposed rivers in an effort to improve and conserve a healthy status the lack of information on the relationship between parameters that can be considered toxic when exceeding some limits and other factors that modify the properties of the water means that attempts should be made to mitigate the effects of a single factor when several factors are acting this coexistence of impacts with diverse and even opposing effects on water has been reported in previous studies lowell culp and dubé 2000 schäfer et al 2016 in terms of the aquatic ecosystem response to the action of multiple factors we can highlight the decrease in the species richness frequently found in rivers boix et al 2010 gutiérrez cánovas et al 2013 lobera et al 2017 quevedo baez et al 2018 particularly macroinvertebrate communities are frequently used as adequate indicators of the ecological status of the water body as they present very diverse river habitat requirements and occupies a large part of river ecological niches alba tercedor and sánchez ortega 1988 armanini et al 2014 in alluvial rivers macroinvertebrate communities are the most interesting biological indicators due to their multiple interactions with the environment given their dependency on the physico chemical conditions of the water moreover their uniform size abundance and diversity facilitate sampling and there are standardized indices at the european level prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 gamboa et al 2008 ladreda 2012 many studies both worldwide fruget et al 2015 li et al 2014 and particularly in spain monzón et al 1991 rallo et al 2004 have attempted to monitor changes both in the longitudinal distribution of species and in water quality in the medium term however due to the fact that numerous studies about macrobenthos started in the mid 1970s long term studies with a period of analysis around 50 years are still not frequent jackson and füreder 2006 in this context this study aims to understand the evolution of the composition and structure of macroinvertebrate communities in response to the environmental changes occurred in the river especially in terms of water quality and flow regime alteration over several decades to that purpose the jarama river basin located in central spain that represents a fluvial network highly regulated mainly due to the proximity of large urban centers as the city of madrid has been selected as this metropolis demands a constant supply of water six large reservoirs were constructed at the headstreams from where water is derived though pipes and canals to the city this cause long river reaches to have their flow greatly reduced as occurs downstream of el vado reservoir located in the jarama river and below the mouth of the lozoya river its main tributary which is regulated by the pinilla riosequillo puentes viejas el villar and el atazar reservoirs the reaches below dams were even completely dry during some years hidalgo 2005 sánchez 2012 sotelo and sotelo 2013 in addition the jarama river system especially in its middle and lower reaches receives urban wastewater after being treated although not all dumping was debugged and even today the debugging is not complete water quality impoverishment and flow regulation interact from different locations along the jarama river continuum flow regulation caused by large dams located in the foothills while pollution occurs in the lower reaches around the city of madrid several mitigation measures have been implemented in the last decades which affect macroinvertebrates communities in a spatial context environmental flows implemented mainly below dams and pollution control in the lowlands with the construction of water treatment plants we hypothesize that 1 the intensity of the flow regulation reduces macrobenthic biodiversity while the environmental minimum flows measured by the rate of increase of minimum and summer flows allow the recovery of macroinvertebrate biodiversity and 2 the degree of water organic pollution and eutrophication bod5 o2 and nh4 determines a loss of biodiversity along the study period as a background samples taken in the jarama river in 1979 gonzález del tánago et al 1982 and in 1987 prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 will serve as a reference to define the trajectory followed by the fluvial ecosystem along its longitudinal gradient and validate the hypothesis 2 material and methods 2 1 location of sampling stations and macroinvertebrate collection a total of 11 sampling points were selected along the jarama river points j 1 to j 11 in figure 1 which were the same reaches sampled by gonzález del tánago et al 1982 in the 1970s in addition stations j 5 to j 10 were sampled in the 1980s by prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 the selection of the same stations as in the previous studies allows a more accurate comparison two sampling campaigns were carried out the first during autumn and winter 2018 and the second in spring 2019 in the lotic and lentic facies both samplings were attempted to be as similar as possible to those carried out in the previous studies using a hand meshed net with a 20 15 cm metal frame to which was attached a final mesh of 1 mm mesh size and a depth of 30 cm in both the lotic and lentic facies sampling were executed by the kicking method macan 1958 five and four kicks were taken at each sampling point in lotic and lentic facies respectively distributed throughout the river section trying to locate the different microhabitats that can be found in the area to be representative of the reach the organisms obtained were placed in cylindrical plastic jars with an approximate capacity of 0 5 l duly labelled and 96 alcohols was added for their preservation at the laboratory each sample was cleaned with the help of a binocular magnifying glass meji brand macroinvertebrate individuals were counted and identified according to wallace et al 1990 tachet et al 2000 at the genus level when possible although in some cases was done at the family level depending on the state of development conservation or the difficulty of each group 2 2 physico chemical data and gauging the temporal analysis of physico chemical water condition was carried out using data from the cemas network confederación hidrográfica del tajo 2023 http www chtajo es lacuenca calidadagua resultados informes documents aguassuperficiales red 20ica informes ica htm collected at 7 stations along the jarama river for the period 1978 to 2017 figure 1 the parameters of ammonium conductivity biochemical oxygen demand bod5 hereafter and dissolved oxygen o2 hereafter have been considered as they are those that most affect the macroinvertebrate communities and are the most frequently measured also conductivity measurements were taken at all stations for the present study together with those provided by confederación hidrográfica del tajo the flow regime and its temporal evolution have been analyzed from the collection of daily flow data from 5gauge stations cedex 2020 gauge 3050 el vado reservoir was used to calculate incoming flow regime representative of station j 2 while the outflows were representative of j 3 gauge 3153 located downstream of lozoya river confluence was considered representative of station j 5 and j 6 gauge 3051 is located downstream of the confluence with guadalix river and was representative of station j 7 and j 8 gauge 3052 located downstream of the confluence with henares river and representative of station j 9 and finally gauge 3074 and gauge 3075 that had complementary information and were assigned to station j 11 two period of analysis were considered a first period from 1972 to 1987 to characterize the initial macroinvertebrate sampling gonzález del tánago et al 1982 prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 and from 2000 to 2017 to characterize the current sampling flow regime was characterized by means of different parameters for medium and extreme magnitudes and intra annual variability 2 3 macroinvertebrate indicators the analysis of the macroinvertebrate communities present in the jarama river is based on the indicators of faunal richness number of taxa differentiated at each station and by sampling occasion and shannon diversity shannon 1948 for the determination of the ecological status the ecological quality ratio eqr hereafter defined as a quotient of the measured value between the reference values for each type of river has been estimated based on the ibmwp index alba tercedor and sánchez ortega 1988 as it is one of the most widely used biological indicators in spain and based on royal decree 817 2015 of 11 september which establishes the criteria for monitoring and evaluating the status of surface waters and the environmental quality standards 2 4 data analysis to detect and spatio temporal response in macroinvertebrate communities non metric multidimensional scaling nmds was used to visualize the gradient along the river and during the study period using metamds function from the vegan package oksanen et al 2020 in r r core team 2019 nmds is considered the most robust ecological analysis of communities minchin 1987 and it is a flexible technique that can be applied to any type of data without normality requirements the inter sampling distance matrix was based on the bray curtis algorithm to assess the mesological factors influencing the communities we have used the vector fitting method applying the envfit function from the vegan package oksanen et al 2020 in r this method fits vectors or environmental factors into an ordination correlating their length and direction with the projections of the points in the ordination oksanen j 2015 3 results 3 1 present conditions in sampling period 2018 2019 the richness pattern along the jarama river shows a decreasing trend from the headwaters j 1 and j 2 to the sections below the el vado reservoir j3 and j 4 where richness is greatly recovered after receiving the lozoya river j 5 and j 6 arising maximum values figure 2 downstream from the confluence with guadalix river coinciding with a continuum of industrial estates the richness drops sharply reaching the minimum value in j 9 and especially in j 11 where the substrate was anoxic sludge macroinvertebrate s richness was higher in spring than in autumn except for stations j 7 j 9 and j 10 figure 2 where autumn winter richness was slightly higher than in spring shannon diversity show similar trends figure 3 although less marked and with the maximum values at the headwaters in general spring diversity is higher than autumn winter except in j 8 and j 10 while j 3 and j 5 presented similar values in both samplings the ecological status assessed based on the eqr of macrobenthos table 1 shows that in all stations the spring sampling have better ecological status values than in the autumn winter sampling except in stations j 9 and j 10 it is interesting to note that the section downstream of the lozoya confluence j 5 is the only one that has a very good condition in both samplings analyzing the evolution of these three parameters along the longitudinal gradient of the jarama river a very similar pattern can be observed they initially reduce their values from j 1 to j 3 downstream of the el vado dam presenting the minimum values from here they rise uniformly in j 4 j 5 downstream of the lozoya river which is strongly regulated by a string of large reservoirs until reaching maximum values in j 6 talamanca from the mouth of the guadalix river j 7 the jarama river enters a section of strong industrial and urban development and the parameters drop sharply which remain stable j 8 and j 9 until the confluence with the henares river j 10 in which they increase slightly finally below the confluence of the manzanares river the river is heavily impacted and at the station located further downstream j 11 remains highly degraded 3 2 longitudinal gradient and temporal evolution 3 2 1 water physicochemical evolution the temporal change of the physicochemical parameters analyzed were water mineralization conductivity and the load of organic matter bod5 together with those resulting from its decomposition that reduces dissolved oxygen and releases nutrients ammonium the water mineralization figure 4 and table s1 evaluated through its conductivity gradually increases downstream along the river but a sharp increase can be observed below el vado reservoir j 4 with respect to the average values of the previous stations station j 5 shows a slightly decrease compared to j 4 and then an increasing trend is observed downstream arising maximum values in j 11 higher than 1100 µs m regarding the temporal evolution stations j 2 and j 4 can be considered stable as they present similar values in stations j 5 j 7 j 9 and j 10 the conductivity has been decreasing but it should be noted that stations j 5 and j 7 present increased values during the 90 s that decrease in subsequent decades finally at station j 11 the conductivity remains stable along the period regarding the bod5 it is quite stable in upstream stations from j 2 to j 5 with slightly variations less than 9 in the case of j 2 and j 4 however in the remaining downstream stations there has been a great decrease in the mean values of bod5 during the last decades with reductions higher than 90 in j 10 and j 11 since the subperiod 1978 1989 emphasizing the longitudinal variation of the parameter it is seen that currently 2010 2017 all stations present similar values and less than 4 mg l in the case of dissolved oxygen in jarama river an inverse longitudinal pattern can be observed compared to bod5 figure 4 and table s1 downstream along the river a reduction in oxygen levels can be observed in all decades except for station j 10 and j 11 in the last decade where the dissolved oxygen level increase compared to upstream values stations j 2 j 4 and j 5 have remained stable over time with variations lower than 7 while stations j 7 j 9 j 10 and j 11 show an increase regarding the ammonium concentration it can be observed a gradual increase downstream along the river until station j 5 j 7 presents a sharp increase and the maximum ammonium values are found at j 9 that slightly decrease in the downstream stations j 10 and j 11 observing the variations occurred within the stations it is seen that in j 2 and j 4 there have been hardly any changes in this parameter in the following stations j 5 and j 7 it can be seen how in the 80s the values were like those that are found today however in the 90s the ammonium levels increased although they have been decreasing to the present day at stations j 9 j 10 and j 11 a reduction in the values is observed although the current values are still too high 3 2 2 changes on flow regime maximum annual flows qmax and the 90th percentile flow decrease from the first period to the last throughout the entire jarama river table 2 the same pattern is found with the mean and median flows but in this case the stations corresponding to j 5 and j 6 valdepeñas show an increase in the last period low flow indicators the minimum annual flow qmin the percentile 10 p10 and summer flow qsummer tend to increase in most of the stations especially this rise is remarkable in the sections downstream of the reservoirs valdepeñas qmin and p10 tripled and summer flows increased by 80 on the contrary in the head stations j 1 and j2 together with the further downstream ones j 11 the low flows decrease the intrannual flow variability cv does not greatly vary between periods but it shows a longitudinal trend in the upper section it is high and it is reduced below the el vado reservoir recovering with the contribution of the lozoya until in the lower sections that decreases drastically 3 2 3 evolution of macroinvertebrate communities comparison of macroinvertebrate species richness from this work with the previous ones gonzález del tánago et al 1982 is shown in table 3 together with the number of taxa from the first study that appear disappear and remain the loss of taxa from station j 1 to j 4 is remarkable comparing current communities with those from the 70s with losses of more than 33 taxa in the four stations on the other hand new 9 taxa appear but they are not enough to alleviate the decline in biodiversity that occurs in these stations in the jarama upper zones cryophilic taxa have mainly disappeared while new ones are eurioic secondly in j 5 and j 6 which are located below the confluence with the lozoya river biodiversity has increased since there are more new taxa than disappeared most of the disappeared taxa are thermophiles some of great conservation interest like marthamea vitripennis while most of the new ones are eurioic and some cryophilic downstream from j 7 the number of taxa decreases in both studies and it can be said that stations j 7 j 8 and j 10 remain relatively stable due to the balance between losses and gains of taxa all new taxa are eurioic and tolerant to eutrophic environments on the contrary the j 9 station has had a great improvement in diversity since in the first study carried out no macroinvertebrate was found while currently 13 different taxa appear it should be noted that in j 11 the station remains stable due to the absence of macroinvertebrates in the samplings in a comparative overview it is observed that in some stations there has been a great variation in fauna richness table 4 the greatest loss of taxa per sample occurs in station j 2 since in the current samplings 2019 an average of 10 6 less taxa have been found than in the samplings of the former study 1979 on the other hand j 6 is the station with the highest increase with 17 6 more taxa on average it should be noted that in the past the station with the highest average richness was j 2 while today the station with the highest value is j 6 the polluted reaches downstream from j 7 that obtained the lowest richness values in the past corresponds to the lowest current values although a recovery is clear the macrobenthic community structure measured by mean diversity per sample table 4 has undergone great variations from the first study in 1979 to the present diversity has been reduced from station j 1 to j 4 especially in station j 2 it should be noted that this station was formerly the one with the highest average diversity value from j 5 to j 10 diversity values increase in the last sampling with the largest change being found in j 10 from 0 65 in 1979 to 2 24 in 2019 although these recoveries in this area j 1 also present a high diversity comparable to j 5 it should be noted that the minimum mean values found in the first studies and in the present appear in station j 9 which although it is the one with the worst values is the third station that has noticed the greatest improvement the spatio temporal evolution of the ecological status estimated by the eqr ecological quality ratio based on the ibmwp of the jarama river is shown in table 5 in the comparison of eqr means of previous samplings and current ones it is possible to observe great variations for example j 2 change from very good to good status while in j 5 and j 6 the change has been the opposite it should be noted that a decrease in eqr has only been found at stations j 2 and j 3 in previous studies the maximum eqr value appeared in j 2 while it currently appears in j 5 on the contrary in 1978 the sections from j 7 to j 10 had a very bad condition and have improved to moderate j 7 and j 8 and to bad j 9 and j 10 3 2 4 evaluation of the controlling factors of the changes the results of the spatial temporal ordering of the macrobenthic communities by means of the multivariate nmds analysis are presented in figure 5 a the adjustment obtained in this arrangement or stress was 0 118 which according to kruskal 1964 is good the first axis of this arrangement nmds1 in figure 5 establishes a spatial gradient in the distribution of species from the upper reaches of the jarama river versus the lower ones it separates species which are typical from mountain streams rhithron such as glossosoma hydropsyche gr fulvipes hydraena micrasema dinocras lepidostoma anomalopterygella agapetus sericostomatidae larcasia partita allogamus limoniidae rhyacophila hydropsyche cf punica perla leuctra protonemura and epeorus from potamic and pollution tolerant species such as chironomus gr plumosus physa fontinalis hirudinea caenis potamanthus chironomidae tubificidae hydropsyche exocellata and ancyclus fluviatilis on the contrary the second axis is related to the temporal changes discriminating the communities from 1978 79 with higher values from the recent 2018 2019 this axis separates more relevant taxa in the seventies isoperla hydroptilidae taeniopteryx hydropsyche siltalai limoniidae hydropsyche pellucidula perla potamanthus atyaephyra desmarestii hydropsyche bulbifera from the current taxa hydropsyche cf punica allogamus larcasi partita sericostomatidae lepidostoma agapetus anomalopterygella dinocras micrasema the adjustment of the vectors to this taxonomical arrangement shows a longitudinal gradient in the first axis figure 5b associating higher dissolved oxygen to communities with higher ecological status eqr diversity and richness in the upper reaches compared to the lower reaches that are significantly correlated with pollution bod5 and ammonium more mineralized waters high conductivity and with higher flow rates high qmax table 6 the vectors adjusted to the second axis also explain the temporal changes of the macroinvertebrate communities and the characteristics of the water figure 5b indeed this axis discriminates between bod5 in the positive side versus ammonium which is in the negative part of the axis and biodiversity versus richness factors that have changed between both sampling periods the bod5 has been reduced by the operation improvement of the sewage treatment plants although they have been unable to eliminate the ammonia then species have disappeared globally although the richness of seasonal samplings has been greater that is the seasonal overlap of species has been reduced 4 discussion 4 1 current longitudinal distribution of macroinvertebrates communities based on the results obtained in the macrobenthos samplings in autumn winter and spring the jarama river can be divided into two well differentiated zones according to the human pressure on the water body alric et al 2021 first the upper zone from j 1 to j 6 is characterized by a high species richness and a diverse macroinvertebrate community where the observed values of the eqr reflect a good status of the water bodies coinciding with good water physicochemical conditions it should be noted that species richness is a variable that depends on the time of the year since most macroinvertebrates are insects and spend a part of their life cycle outside of the aquatic environment therefore a taxonomic variation is observed and expected both along the river and within the same sampling site depending on the season when the samplings were carried out regarding the dominant taxa this zone is represented mainly by the family heptageniidae especially by the genera epeorus sp ecdyonurus sp and rhithrogena sp although genera baetis sp and ephemerella sp from ephemeroptera order and larcasia partita from trichoptera order are also abundant in this upper zone there is a remarkable decrease in richness diversity and eqr in j 2 and j 3 that is recovered downstream from j 3 to j 6 this longitudinal improvement would respond to the hypothesis about the recovery of macroinvertebrates diversity related to environmental flows implementations in regulated reaches as it could be related with the confluence with lozoya river a regulated river with a lower anthropic pressure related to urban areas where environmental flows are implemented in its further downstream reservoir el atazar this large reservoir with a dam 134 meters high releases cold water on summer from hypolimneon leading this reach to be the only one with higher minimum and summer flows table 2 in effect it is a river section considered as a strategic water body that according to river basin management plans are the only ones in which the implementation of environmental flows is mandatory since 2016 royal decree 1 2016 the first two rbmp from 2009 to 20214 and from 2015 to 2021 fixed constant minimum e flows below el vado reservoir 0 30 m3 s and below el atazar 0 88 m3 s this means that stations j 3 and j 4 should had at least 0 30 m3 s and j 5 and j 6 should have 1 19 m3 s secondly the middle and lower zone of the river from j 7 to j 11 present a low macroinvertebrate richness probably related to the water quality impoverishment due to the numerous polluting water inputs that comes from densely populated then at this reach high pollution conditions would condition macroinvertebrates response over flow regulation conditions however it should be noted that from stations j 9 to j 10 there is a slight increase in macroinvertebrate richness this improvement could be due to the confluence with the henares river that by a dilution effect decrease the pollution that have been accumulated up to this point in this lower river segment the chironomidae family is dominant with chironomus gr plumosus being the main species and sometimes the family simuliidae baetis sp and hydropsyche exocellata are also very abundant regarding the eqr of the river all the values correspond to status worse than good particularly moderate in j 7 and j 8 bad in j 9 and j 10 and very bad in j 11 4 2 temporal trend of studied parameters and consequences on macroinvertebrate communities in general all the physicochemical parameters currently analyzed present better values than in the 70s and 80s it is remarkable the great decrease of the bod5 which in the 70s and 80s present very high values in the stations with available data values higher than 30 mg l in j 10 and j 11 while at present it is at acceptable levels lower than 4 mg l this may be associated with the implementation of the royal decree 509 1996 that establishes the rules applicable to sewage water treatment indicating that bod5 levels should be reduced by 20 before discharge and later by the order arm 2656 2008 that imposes bod5 instream values below the threshold of 6 mg l flow regime has experienced a general reduction in the jarama river all high flows both maximum and 90th percentiles have decreased together with mean annual flows that have been reduced due to the intensification of water resources demand in the catchment and probably due to climate change however mezger lorenzo et al 2022 studied the evolution of annual streamflow in the tagus river basin spain during the 1950 2010 period was studied their analyses revealed a general decreasing trend in streamflow and an increasing trend in air temperature while trends in precipitation are less clear suggesting that the expansion of forested areas a 60 and irrigated land a 400 since 1950 could have been important factors in the reduction of streamflow in the tagus basin on the contrary the river reach below the lozoya mouth station j 5 valdepeñas is a clear exception because it s mean and median flows and especially the low ones summer p10 and minimum have increased probably due to environment flows implementation based on the temporal evolution of macroinvertebrate communities five different segments can be differentiated a first segment from j 1 to j 2 located upstream of the el vado reservoir where a loss of biological integrity has occurred since their communities have partially lost their complexity with fewer species although the richness per sampling indicates a reduction in the temporal overlap of species this change may be the effect of global warming and its consequence of a reduction on instreams flows as community lost some cryophilic species and gain eurioic ones similar consequences have been reported in the upper rhône by fruget et al 2015 where its communities exhibited biological profiles closer to those ones from further downstream reaches the next segment from j 3 to j 4 below el vado reservoir built in 1954 experienced a similar loss of biological integrity although it was already impacted by flow regulation before the first samplings the third segment j 5 to j 6 shows a great improvement in almost all the macrobenthic indicators analyzed probably due to the changes in the flow regulation of the lozoya river with an increase in summer flows when the reservoirs are stratified and then releasing colder waters than in the previous period ward and stanford 1979 rader and ward 1988 ellis and jones 2013 phillips et al 2015 in the fourth segment from j 7 to j 10 all the indicator values show a significant improvement especially when comparing the current levels with those found by prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 since at that time the river suffered the highest levels of pollution coinciding with very low flow events as some zero days flows were registered producing high levels of stress in the river prieto and garcía de jalón 1987 therefore in this section although the good ecological status has not been reached yet table 5 it has notably improved since the very poor condition that existed in 1979 finally the last segment j 11 is characterized by the stable poor conditions in relation to the anoxic sludge covering the riverbed already detected some decades ago that make the life of the macrobenthos impossible matisoff fisher and matis 1985 lake et al 2000 the physical chemical parameters trend indicates that water pollution has been mitigated in the last period while the alteration of the flow regime becomes more intense the comparative analysis carried out to relate the macroinvertebrate communities to the mesological characteristics show a direct relation between the improvement of water quality conditions and the recovery of diversity in the fluvial ecosystem as previous authors found in other rivers turunen et al 2016 johnson et al 2017 on the contrary we did not find any correlation between the greater flow regime alteration flow regime and the degradation of microbenthic diversity failing to prove the first hypothesis put forward in this study instead our results indicate that water pollution is the limiting factor of the good state evaluated by macroinvertebrate with the high positive gradient found in nmds analysis for the ammonium and bod5 with the first component nmds1 thus answering the second hypothesis raised in this study where it is indicated that a higher organic pollution in water implies a loss of biodiversity three main drivers would be causing a synergic effect in jarama river that has improved richness and diversity of macroinvertebrates communities in the last decades first the flow alteration cause by dam construction has artificially increased summer discharges that indirectly decrease water temperature as the water releases are hypolimnetic second this flow alteration has been recently modified by the implementation of environmental flows that ensure minimum flows around 10 of mean annual flow throughout the year remarkable improvements on biological communities have been also found by previous authors with the implementation of environmental flows weisberg et al 1990 lind et al 2007 belmar et al 2012 mackie et al 2013 pander et al 2019 and third the operation improvement of the sewage treatment plants this being a positive effect for macroinvertebrate communities arce at al 2014 which although they have been unable to eliminate the ammonia they efficiently reduce other pollutant elements such as the bod5 as found in this study the reduction of nutrients from wastewater treatment plant effluent concentrations is a target that water managers must assume and bolinches et al 2020 have estimated a threshold up to 0 65 mg l of ammonium and 0 55 mg l of phosphate to achieve the environmental goals in the jarama tajo system as we have shown the jarama macroinvertebrates communities are being recover in the middle reaches thanks to the implementation of environmental flows and the reduction of organic pollution however there is still a long way to go in this recovery process especially in its lower sections on the contrary in the upper jarama sections we have found a slight degradation process that probably is associated to global warming changes as it is expected to have strong effects on mediterranean climate regions lawrence et al 2010 long term ecological studies of freshwater macroinvertebrates are of great value to have a realistic view as has been highlighted by jackson and fürether 2006 and feio et al 2021 as they give an overall ecological assessment of water bodies undergoing multi stressors reyjol at al 2014 and the understanding of the jarama river recovery process really needs further studying its macrobenthic trajectory 5 conclusions in accordance with the objectives and in response to the proposed hypotheses it can be concluded in the present work that a longitudinal trend of the ecological status has been found in the jarama river with better quality conditions in the upper section leading to high diversity and richness while the lower sections present moderate to bad quality conditions probably due to high anthropic pressures downstream along the river thus flow alteration and pollution pressures acting together or alone reduce macrobenthic diversity the temporal trend suggests an improvement of the water quality and partial recovery of macroinvertebrate communities in the middle sections the implementation of environmental flows has allowed a considerable increase in biodiversity where in the past the low water levels were very pronounced as well as a summer cooling of the waters when they are released by the el vado and atazar reservoir nevertheless great value species that have disappeared like marthamea vitripennis never will come back therefore the effects of minimum environmental flows together with the cooling effect of large dams overrides the effects of the altered flow regime in the lower reaches improved sewage treatment plants have reduced bod5 from discharges according to legislation and consequently the oxygen levels on jarama river have increased however nutrients are not sufficiently treated ammonium levels well above the legal threshold of 1mg l that maintain eutrophication and therefore a high primary production that increases oxygen consumption this pollution improvement goes along with an increase of flow regime alteration and the macrobenthic biodiversity improves finally in the lower river sections the organic sludge and silt accumulated in the river bottoms for decades have a delay in their self recovery that still limits their colonization by macroinvertebrates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper supplementary materials supplementary

924,a good many research works focused on investigating wetland habitat state and trophic state ts but as far the knowledge is concerned very little attention was paid to the hydrological state hs modelling of wetlands and no such attention was paid on exploring the linkage between hs and ts but it is very essential to explore the role of hydrological characters on ts in order to frame hydrological management strategies considering this the present study intended to build hs models using image driven hydrological components like water presence frequency hydro period water depth to estimate trophic state index tsi using field driven water samples and finally linking hs and tsi of the wetland successful results can open up a new approach to improve the strategies for water quality and ecological efficiency management machine learning models were applied for building the hs model and carlson s tsi method was applied to explore water quality and ecological state the ordinary least square regression was applied for linking hs and tsi results showed that hydrological modification and associated causes obliterated 32 32 km2 of wetland between the pre dam and post dam periods the support vector machine model was found as the best suited hs model to all the applied models tsi was found poor over a wider part of the wetland especially over the hydrologically poor patches of the wetland the hydrological worsening is a cause for the worsening of ts so it can be stated that managing hydrological components is a good way to manage ts keywords hydrological modification hydrological state of wetland machine learning trophic state linking hydrological and trophic state and ordinary least square regression 1 introduction along with wetland reclamation caused by agricultural encroachment invasion of built up land and fragmentation of wetlands due to perforation of infrastructures ke et al 2018 ghosh et al 2018 peng et al 2020 mao et al 2021 basu et al 2021 dam induced hydrological modification in the river and consequent transformation in wetland hydrology is a very vital issue today in last few decades most of the large and medium rivers have been tamed through damming over india and abroad wang et al 2019 akbarzadeh et al 2019 ekka et al 2020 farah pérez et al 2020 li et al 2021 pal and sarda 2020 khatun et al 2021 kundu et al 2021 at present 4104 large dams are available in india shi et al 2019 and it causes massive hydrological geomorphological and ecological transformation in downstream rivers in particular pradhan et al 2021

it covers only 6 8 geographical area but it supports 40 50 ecological return janse et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a keesstra et al 2021 jang et al 2022 different issues were reported as the reasons behind the hydrological transformation of wetlands like irrigation water draft pool et al 2021 jouma and dadaser celik 2021 industrial municipal and domestic water harvesting kumar et al 2021 dar et al 2021a ground water lowering and transformation of influent wetland to effluent wetland dwire et al 2018 neff et al 2020 climate change induced rainfall scarcity adeleke et al 2019 rahman et al 2020 lack of flood water supply yu et al 2018 o keeffe et al 2019 berkowitz et al 2019 however in seasonally inundated flood plain wetland discharge control in rivers through damming was found very vital it directly and indirectly poses pressure on the wetland in the one hand it curtails water supply to the wetland and reduction of water availability in rivers exerts extra pressure on wetlands for water harvesting dar et al 2021b sibanda and ahmed 2021 a good many researchers like murshed et al 2019 akbarzadeh et al 2019 de jalón et al 2019 best 2019 zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b swarnkar et al 2021 mezger et al 2021 sarathi and pani 2022 reported dwindling of flow in river ganga barakar jialing duero ebro tajo basins due to damming a few studies also investigated the role of flow attenuation of rivers on the active floodplain of tangon atreyee punarbhaba river basins and flood plain wetlands talukdar and pal 2020 kundu et al 2021 khatun and pal 2021 pal and singha 2022a the previous studies explored the direct linkage between flow attenuation and adverse hydrological transformation in wetlands of late debanshi and pal 2020a khatun et al 2021 pal and sarda 2021a applied water richness models for exploring the integrated hydrological transformation of wetlands and they reported worsening of hydrological richness over a wider part of the natural riverine wetland while developing such models proxy parameters like water cover area its shape size fragmentation consistency of water appearance relative values of water indices as a representative of water depth were considered debanshi and pal 2020b khatun et al 2021 added hydro period and absolute water depth data as new indicators for deriving water depth data they calibrated image driven water indices with field measured depth data they rightly mentioned water depth and hydro period are strongly linked with ecological niche and species phenology but lack of such data at spatial level often restricts researchers to do away from this debanshi and pal 2020a khatun et al 2021 pal and sarda 2021a kundu et al 2022 developed an acceptable method for developing hydro period maps of each year using satellite images at pixel level certainly these are some remarkable advancements towards working with wetland surface hydrology integration of such relevant hydrological components can build a good hydrological state hs model the hydrological state of wetlands mainly focused on consistency in water appearance in seasonally inundated wetlands duration of water in a year and depth of water developing such hs models in pre and post dam periods can portray a picture of integrated hydrological transformation while modelling wetland habitat water richness using proxy parameters bivariate statistical models geo statistical modelling approach data mining approaches were used by the previous literatures and they recommended machine learning ml hybrid machine learning hml approach for such modelling since these are capable to resolve the intricate non linear relationship among the contributing parameters in very robust manner pal and paul 2020 pal and debanshi 2021b pal and sarda 2021a considering this the present study adopted the ml approach for hs modelling physical hydrological state and its dynamics can control the water quality and ecological productivity of the river and riparian wetlands carlson 1977 developed a trophic state index tsi in order to explore the water quality and ecological condition based on some parameters like chlorophyll a chl a total phosphorus tp and secchi disk depth sdd in the agriculture dominated flood plain wetlands where agriculture residues dominated eutrophication is a major problem zhang et al 2020b dar et al 2021c datta et al 2022 tsi is a very efficient method since the study area is highly populated and agriculturally rich tsi was used for water quality and ecological efficiency mapping hydrological richness is linked with water quality and ecological efficiency of the wetland bolpagni et al 2020 day et al 2021 a given volume of pollutants or agricultural residues when mixed with a very little amount of water its degree of contamination will be much greater than if it s mixed with a greater volume of water moreover flow continuity in form of flood wash and backwash not only caused for dynamics of water volume in wetland lane et al 2018 chaparro et al 2019 but it also refreshes the wetland pollutants supplies fish seeds and seeds of some other economically viable species nutrients supplements etc li et al 2019 jakubínský et al 2021 moreover timing of influx whether the total amount of pollutant mixed in a certain time or over a longer period of time is also a crucial determinant of water quality in this perspective characterizing the hydrological condition of seasonally inundated flood plain wetlands and analyzing the role of it on tsi is very vital if such analysis can establish the fact that hydrological condition is the major determinant of tsi management of hydrological condition would be an acceptable alternative option of trophic state management considering this issue the present work tried to explore the hydrological condition of the wetland and assessed the role of hydrological condition on determining trophic state of the flood plain wetland since tangon river basin of barind plain of india and bangladesh has experienced remarkable hydrological modification due to damming over it the wetland rich lower part of this river basin was taken as a case 2 study area tangon river basin of india and bangladesh fig 1 traversing the older alluvium barind tract was hydrologically intervened majorly through damming over it in 1989 pal et al 2019 pal and singha 2021 in consequence of this flow volume has declined significantly leading to rapid hydrological transformation in riparian wetlands since the wetlands are majorly fed by rain and flood water seasonal rainfall disparity itself is a major reason behind the hydrological and morphological dynamics of the wetland pal et al 2019 khatun and pal 2021 kundu et al 2022 since out of total annual average rainfall 1257 mm to 1508 mm 80 happens during monsoon season june to september seasonally inundated wetlands expand maximally during monsoon time and squeezes maximally during pre monsoon season march

quality table 1 there was no sample data for pre dam period the present sample test results of chl a sdd and tp were used for calibrating the indices of the pre dam period it is not the right method however due to lack of data of that period it was done however the study suggested that it is better to use field data of a specific time for calibrating the image of that period of time ndwi was found to be the best fitted spectral index that can be taken for calibrating the tsi constituting parameters it is to be mentioned that rmndwi and ndwi both were selected to represent the wetland inventory map and accuracy of the former method was slightly better still it was not taken for the calibration process since the correlation value table 1 was very unacceptable linear regression equations of different quality parameters for both pre and post dam periods were computed and used for calibrating the concerned ndwi image in order to build chl a sdd and tp eqs 4 6 and 7 9 are the computed regression equations for pre and post dam periods respectively and these were applied for the modelling of chl a sdd and tp 4 i n c h l a 0 22 i n n d w i 0 069 5 i n s d d 0 161 i n n d w i

tsi based on the measured value of three water quality parameters tsi effectively measures the water quality biological response and ecosystem health of a water body carlson 1977 many researchers jally et al 2016 membrillo abad et al 2016 patra et al 2017 calculated tsi based on only the chl a or sdd or tp while very few researchers saluja and garg 2017 wen et al 2019 calculated average tsi based on these three parameters in the present study we used chl a sdd and tp for computing average tsi as the actual trophic state can be explored if these three parameters are applied together carlson 1977 exhibited a continuous scale 0 to 100 integrating chl a sdd and tp tsi was categorized into four classes with this scale i e oligotrophic 40 meso trophic 40 60 eutrophic 60 80 and hypereutrophic 80 eq 10 was used for computing tsi averaging tsi of the constituting parameters image driven components were validated with the data from secondary sources for the pre dam phase and

total phosphorus chlorophyll a secchi disk depth respectively 3 2 3 methods for developing hydrological state 3 2 3 1 parameter selection for hs modelling and multi collinearity test modelling the hydrological state is very difficult due to the scarcity of spatial hydrological data across the wetlands sometimes a few hydrological data monitoring stations are installed in some strategically important wetlands recently debanshi and pal 2020a pal and sarda 2021b khatun et al 2021 kundu et al 2022 attempted to develop pixel scale spatial hydrological data particularly from satellite images with adequate credit inspired by their success the present work also derived hydrological data like water presence frequency wpf water depth wd and hydro period hp from multi date time series satellite images these parameters were used for building hs models wpf refers to the frequency of water presence in a pixel in a defined period of time borro et al 2014 debanshi and pal 2020a and it is used for measuring the consistency of water appearance in the seasonally inundated wetlands the time series water index maps used for wetland mapping were converted into binary maps assigning 1 to the water and 0 to non water pixels binary maps of all the selected years were summed and divided by the number of years considered eq 11 it can be expressed in decimal 0 1 or in percentage 0 100 wpf value near to 1 or 100 indicates that water appearance in a pixel is regular this method was successfully applied by many scholars like pal and saha 2018 saha and pal 2019 pal and sarda 2021b khatun and pal 2021 kundu et al 2022 11 w p f p i 1 n x j n where wpfp is calculated water presence frequency for p pixel xj is the frequency of jth pixel in image x having water appearance and n is the number of years taken water depth data derived from satellite images is really very difficult following the line of thinking of gao 1996 lee et al 1999 tried to develop water depth data layers from image data gao 1996 stated that the greater value of the water index ndwi reflects the greater thickness of water although many factors control the water indices value proper field data driven calibration can help to build a reliable water depth layer following the predecessors the present study also measured water depth from a field at 33 sites and those data were used for developing a regression model with water indices values of the respective field sites the computed regression model was used for calibrating ndwi map for developing water depth layer eq 12 12 y 0 279 14 105 x where y is the water depth and x is the ndwi value of a specific pixel hydro period means the duration of water stagnation in a wetland pixel in a year bertassello et al 2019 atta darkwa et al 2020 based on this wetland can be classified into perennial water retains all through the year seasonal water retains part of a year or ephemeral water retains in a very short period of time this layer was composed using monthly binary rmndwi maps all the maps of 12 months one for each month of a year were then summed up and the value of hp ranges from 0 to 12 hp value 12 means the wetland is perennial eq 13 was used for developing hp for pre and post dam periods 13 h p i 1 n x i where hp hydro period xi monthly binary rmndwi image representing water and non water pixels the status of hydrological parameters for both pre and post dam is represented in fig 2 multicollinearity test was carried out to know whether there is a co linearity problem among the applied parameters variance inflation factor vif statistics was worked out for this vörösmarty and dobos 2020 reported that vif value 5 does mean there is no collinearity problem table 2 confirms that all the vif score are 1 727 and therefore all the factors could be used for building hs model 3 2 3 2 machine learning models used for hs modelling three hydrological parameters such as water presence frequency hydro period and water depth were used to develop hydrological state modelling using four advanced machine learning algorithms the hydrological parameters were used for identifying the evidences of good and poor hydrological states the area having high water depth 2 0 meters high hp 6 months directly and indirectly connected with river or through tie channels relatively away from the human landscape like built up land agricultural land etc considered as good hydrological state indicating areas whereas the areas having low depth 0 50 meters low hp 3 months located at very proximity to the human landscape and isolated in nature were considered poor hydrological state areas a total of 500 250 sites from good and 250 sites from poor hydrological states training and testing sites were considered to develop hydrological state models total sample sites were sub divided into the training and testing data following 80 20 ratio following rashid and louis 2019 zhou et al 2020a based on training sites artificial neural network ann additive regression ar random subspace rs and support vector machine svm models were developed showing wetland hydrological state the model performances were tested based on the 20 testing sample sites 3 2 3 2 1 artificial neural network the interconnected neurons that operate the data and interact with other components are the main characteristics of ann svozil et al 1997 the independent statistical distribution of the data sets self learning and associative memory are the main characteristics of the ann model ann can handle some unknown information hidden in the data sets ann model provides linear or non linear models and single multi layer networks dou et al 2015 the ann model has frequently been used in classification regression recognition autocorrelation prediction and many other fields ann is a very popular ml algorithm and has been widely used to identify and solve various environmental problems such as landslides floods wetland prediction gully erosion etc garosi et al 2018 dtissibe et al 2020 debanshi and pal 2020a saha et al 2020 to improve the network performance trial and error was done alternating seed size batch size learning rate momentum etc 3 2 3 2 2 additive regression the additive regression has been usually applied for different natural hazards modelling like flood susceptibility landslide susceptibility and gully erosion hazard modelling shirzadi et al 2017 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 the ar model can easily handle the complex non linear relationship data structure between environmental problems and their conditioning parameters the ar model is the modified version of glm generalized additive model this model is best fitted when the dependent variable is not normally distributed even in the case of non linear relationships hastie and tibshirani 1990 ar models provide the scope to linear and non linear forms of modelling goetz et al 2011 the ar model is so popular due to its three major characteristics like flexibility forecast supremacy and interpretability etc zhang and batterman 2010 the ar model was frequently used in various fields including modelling flood susceptibility shafizadeh et al 2018 modelling landslide susceptibility bartelletti et al 2018 modelling groundwater potentiality khosravi et al 2021 modelling ecological security feng et al 2018 etc 3 2 3 2 3 random subspace in 1998 ho first developed the rs classifier which is defined as a classic integrated ensemble algorithm ho 1998 the rs model was widely used in environmental science for solving environmental problems rashid et al 2021 trong et al 2021 rs is a well known ensemble ml algorithm that offers a pseudo randomly chosen subsets to each and every classifier and outputs are combined by voting rs classifiers improve the weak classifier efficiency wang and tang 2006 and improve the accuracy of the classification of individual classifiers trong et al 2021 the training data is also modified by rs classifier however this modification is carried out in the features space handling large data sets and solving the over fitting problems become more popular in the rs model talukdar et al 2021 this method may be beneficial from using random subspace for both constructive and aggregation of the classifier small sample sized issues can easily be handled by rs algorithms yaman et al 2018 3 2 3 2 4 support vector machine svm is well known as a supervised non parametric statistical ml technique the concept of svm is based on decision planes which is defined as the plane of separation of different objectives or different class membership choubin et al 2019 it can work with different types of variables like continuous categorical as well as linear and non linear data sets in different class members the basis of this technique is separating hyper plane creation in the training dataset the mathematical function used to transform data is known as the kernel function tehrany et al 2015 in the svm model to separate the original input space an optimal hyper plane is used for this purpose identification of proper kernel function shows the ability of the svm model the kernel functions of svm models were classified into four classes such as radial basis kernel rbf sigmoid kernel sg linear kernel ln and polynomial kernel pl commonly in remote sensing environments pl and rbf kernels have been used maxwell et al 2018 rbf kernel is commonly used in svm techniques for the higher performance and higher level of accuracy of the model than the other traditional methods knorn et al 2009 zheng et al 2019 detailed information of the model optimization process is mentioned in table 3 the output ml value ranges between 0 1 based on this the final hs models were subdivided into five categories very good good moderate poor and very poor hydrological states very high hs was categorized as those pixels having very high consistency 67 of water appearances greater water depth 2 0 meters and longer hydro period 6 months 3 2 4 importance of the factors based on ingr for developing hydrological state model the importance of each contributing parameter could be derived on the basis of their statistical properties and such information would be very helpful for source control based wetland management information of gain ratio ingr for each parameter was computed in order to achieve this objective a higher ingr value signifies the greater importance of an individual parameter the ingr is calculated using eq 14 14 g a i n r a t i o x z e n t r o p y z 1 n i 1 n z i z e n t r o p y z i i 1 n z i z log z i z where the attribute x belongs to a training point z with subsets zi 1 1 2 3 n 4 validation of hs model 4 1 statistical approaches for analyzing the performances of the applied ml models five statistical techniques including receiver operating characteristics roc of the area under the curve auc precision sensitivity f1 score and matthew s correlation coefficient mcc were applied all these were computed based on 300 testing sites true positive tp false negative fn true negative tn and false positive fp were taken for computing the statistics tp signifies that the sample was correctly classified predicted as positive fn signifies the sample incorrectly classified as negative fp means the samples were incorrectly classified as positive and fp refers to the samples were correctly classified as negative the auc roc was computed based on 300 references sites collected from field and google earth images equations for calculating other statistical measures as mentioned are given in eqs 15 18 in sensitivity and precision the true positive false negative and false positive values of the predicted data are used for calculation whereas in mcc all four matrices is used for better reliability and performance chicco et al 2021 the mcc value ranges from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates least accuracy in the prediction and vice versa the f1 score is computed against the value of precision and sensitivity therefore it offers a bit better product which is even better in uneven classes chicco and jurman 2020 the value of roc auc precision and f1 score varies from 0 1 and value near to 0 indicates poor performance as well as less reliability of a model and value near to 1 signifies higher reliability yao and shepperd 2020 since different measures possess some strengths and flaws instead of one multiple measures can help to infer the reliability of the model considering this issue all the measures were applied using eqs 15 18 15 r e c a l l s e n s i t i v i t y t p t p f n 16 p r e c i s i o n t p t p f p 17 m c c t p t n f p f n t p f p t p f n t n f p t n f n 18 f 1 s c o r e 2 p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l 4 2 linkage between hs and tsi using ordinary least squares regression ols for making spatial linkage between hs and tsi ols regression was used osl is a widely used technique for estimating coefficients of linear regression equations which depict the association between one or multiple numbers of independent variables and a dependent variable it can be applied for both numerical and spatial point data sets in this case wetland pixels were converted into point data and those were used to retrieve data from hs and tsi layers to continue the ols method hs was treated as an independent and tsi was selected as a dependent variable for running ols regression standard regression residual was mapped for showing the degree of control of hs on the trophic state low value of residual signifies high control of independent variable on the dependent variable eq 19 19 β x t x 1 x t y where β is the ordinary least square estimation x is the matrix regression variable x t is the matrix transpose and y are the vector of the value of the response variable the whole work was summarized in fig 3 5 results 5 1 time series wetland conditions rmndwi representing wetland maps of some pre and post dam years are furnished in fig 4 in order to visualize the change of wetland area after the dam induces hydrological transformation fig 4 displays that there was a significant decrease in wetland areas over time in the year 1987 pre dam period the wetland area was 53 38 km2 and in 2020 post dam period it was only 21 06 km2 this trend of wetland loss was also reported by chakraborty et al 2018 khatun and pal 2021 kundu et al 2022 in their works moreover continuous wetlands were fragmented into patchy wetland after damming 5 2 hydrological state figure 5 displays the hydrological state models of pre and post dam periods each hs map was classified into five categories i e very poor poor moderate good and very good hydrological state all the models envisaged that wide parts of the wetland under poor hs during the pre dam period were lost after hydrological modification post dam as a result only those parts of the wetland retained their identity who were hydrologically in good state therefore when areas under different hs categories were accounted for the absolute area was substantially reduced during the post dam period but the relative area was found increased the areal change is not similar for all the applied ml models but their trend of change is quite uniform for instance in case of svm model the absolute area under very good and very poor zones were respectively 21 47 km2 and 5 01 km2 in the pre dam period and during the post dam period it was 6 18 km2 and 0 86 km2 in same order but in terms of percentage very good and good hs areas in the post dam period were increased respectively by 3 56 and 21 68 table 4 the spatial pattern of hs categories exhibited that very poor zone was not only found in the fringe zone and upper reach of the main river but also in the interior part of the main wetland tract during the pre dam period in the post dam period such poor wetland patches were mostly obliterated it is caused for less wetland areas under poor hs zone at the confluence segment very good hs was found in a continuous stretch during the pre dam period but it was found fragmented and sparse after damming among the used hydrological components when the role of each component of hs model was assessed using information gain ratio water depth was found as the most dominant factor followed by hydro period and wpf both during pre and post dam periods fig 6 water depth is really very important since it determines the niche and associated ecosystem diversity lantz et al 2011 asher et al 2017 5 2 1 validation of hs models since the predicted area under different hs classes of all models show some variation and it demands validation of the applied models in order to find out the best suited model so the predictive model requires validation before recommendation auc roc was computed for each and the values for all the cases show excellent agreement between the model and ground reality state and therefore be accepted fig 7 auc values range from 0 931 to 0 961 and 0 889 to 0 947 during pre and post dam periods respectively table 5 the svm model exhibited maximum auc values in both the periods and therefore be taken as the most representative apart from auc value precision sensitivity f1 score and mcc also show high performance table 5 in case of svm models and therefore could be treated as the best suited 5 3 trophic state index figure 8 depicts the tsi of the flood plain wetland tract of the study area and associated factors both during pre and post dam periods tsi value ranged from 18 96 to 21 23 during the pre dam period and 45 06 to 53 95 during the post dam period as per carlson s tsi reference limits water quality was good during the pre dam period since value 40 signifies good water quality oligotrophic state it also indicates ample oxygen availability in wetlands ensuring relatively comfortable conditions for species growth after damming not only wetland area was squeezed but its quality was degraded considerably the computed tsi value of the post dam period indicates the transformation of oligotrophic to mesotrophic and eutrophic states in terms of contributing tsi factors there were not any significant changes in the range of chlorophyll a sdd and tp however the average concentration of all those components was found to be high in wider parts of the study region in the pre dam period the fringe wetland part experienced relatively higher tsi value but this was within the oligotrophic limit in post dam condition not only the fringe wetlands the wider part of the main wetland tract some core areas witnessed mesotrophic and eutrophic states notably a large patch of confluence wetland tract also experienced significant trophic state transformation some parts transformed into eutrophic state this trend of tsi change due to hydrological modification was also reported by talukdar et al 2020 khatun et al 2021 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 sarkar et al 2020 reported the degradation of tsi in the agriculturally dominated floodplain region of china and india 5 4 spatial relation between hs and tsi from the ols between hs and tsi a wide part of the study area during the pre dam period was identified with high control of hs on tsi the continuous wetland tract at the confluence segment of tangon river fell under this with a low standard regression residual 0 5 to 0 5 in the post dam period some patches were identified within the major wetland tract where the standard regression residual was very high signifying poor control of hs on tsi fig 9 table 6 demonstrated that the area under very low regression residual was decreased from 51 22 km2 to 14 29 km2 as per the svm model which was found as the best other models also reported the same trend table 7 shows the coefficient of determination r2 computed in ols performed between hs and tsi r2 value varies from 0 48 to 0 57 in case of the pre dam and 0 42 to 0 59 in case of the post dam period in reference to all the models probability values p were found 0 028 in all the cases it was found 0 001 in the svm model best representative of both pre and post dam periods f statistics also found the lowest in case of the svm model it clearly proved that the hydrological state can significantly control the trophic state of a wetland 5 5 some case specific analysis twenty wetlands from the study region were selected from different hs zones in order to reveal the case specific hydrological state and water quality sites 1 20 are located at very good good poor and very poor hs zones respectively table 8 agricultural neighbourhoods were found in all the cases but the invasion is less active in case of the wetlands located at very good and good hs zones the situation was found quite reverse in the case of poor and very poor hs zones wetlands within good and very good hs zones were found to be hydrologically consistent having greater water depth the existence of active tie channels and river flood connectivity the wetlands with better hydrological states were characterized by relatively good water quality less presence of exotic species like water hyacinth influx of agricultural residues from surrounding agricultural lands in all the cases are not so less still the contamination level is comparatively poor because of high water availability exchange of river and wetland water flood swash and backwash etc on the other hand wetlands at the poor and very poor hs zones were characterized by poor water quality and moderate to high presence of endemic and exotic species these wetlands are quite isolated from the main river and possess very little chance of swishing continuous accretion of fertilizer within such a water body hyper fertilization insists eutrophication like situation it is highly responsible for the qualitative degradation of water and ecological efficiency 6 discussion from the study 32 32 km2 of wetland area were lost in the post dam period it doesn t always signify that the dam is the sole factor responsible for wetland loss apart from wetland loss existing wetlands also witnessed hydrological transformations like lowering wetland water depth the wetland loss was identified in the fringe area and the main wetland tract shallow wetlands near agriculture and built up areas were transformed quickly as prominent from time series wetland mapping the continuous wetland tract was broken down into multiple patches it does mean it is because of the reclamation of wetlands by other cultural landscapes like agricultural land built areas or drying out some parts of the wetland both situations were identified in the present study area due to the dwindling of flow 63 in river triggered by damming not only river hydrology was affected but also the riparian wetland directly depends on river water as a water source pal et al 2019 due to the lowering of maximum water level wetlands located away from the main river and at a relatively elevated area in the flood plain do not regularly receive inundation water saha and pal 2019 reported that after damming the average active flood plain was reduced by 25 80 and the wetland beyond the current active flood plain witnessed water scarcity due to a lack of lateral inundation spread it also causes limited backwashing of pollutants from the wetlands and surrounding areas besides water scarcity in the wetland promoted land use conversion zhou et al 2020a eskandari damaneh et al 2020 and consequent landscape fragmentation haque 2020 pal and debanshi 2021a islam et al 2021 conversion of wetland from deep to shallow or shallow to saturated land facilitated land use conversion specifically conversion to agricultural land saha and pal 2019 rightly reported growing man and wetland conflict through agriculturalization which is very prominent in the present study area a good many previous literatures like zhang et al 2021 basu et al 2021 dar et al 2022 also reported wetland loss due to land reclamation so the present finding is in parity with previous works to assess the wetland s hydrological state the present study developed hydrological state models using multiple satellite image driven hydrological parameters like wpf wd and hp such data was not usually monitored from the field so as an alternative this approach of hydrological data derivation was adopted following pal and debanshi 2021b khatun and pal 2021 pal and khatun 2022 kundu et al 2022 this approach filled the gap of spatial data scarcity and the components were successfully used for hs modelling for finding out the best representative model a multi model approach is always recommended talukdar et al 2021 pal and singha 2021 norallahi et al 2021 since it provides the option to select the most suitable one the present study also did this and selected svm as the best suited hs model ghosh and das 2020 and khatun et al 2021 also applied similar models for wetland habitat risk modelling and spatially segregated the situation from the hs model it was found that the absolute area under better hs state was increased and the poor hs state was declined in the post dam period in reference to the relative area the reverse situation was recorded complete obliteration of wetlands with poor or very poor hs is the primary reason behind such a paradox in absolute and relative areas under different hs states in reference to the modelling aspect the present study did not explore anything new but the gradual deletion of poor hs over the phases is a good insight of this study in reference to the tsi wide part of the wetland was converted from oligotrophic to mesoeutrophic and eutrophic state some main wetland tracts at its confluence segment also witnessed increasing tsi values makri et al 2019 talukdar and pal 2020 ran et al 2022 also showed the degradation of the trophic state due to agricultural intensification here also agricultural intensification seasonal agriculture within wetland beds in such patches is mainly responsible for degrading trophic state in all parts of the study area agricultural land was found at very proximity to the wetland and therefore the deposition of fertilizer residues to the wetland is very common so the degradation of tsi due to agricultural effects is not any new finding but the influence of water curtailing due to damming and tsi intensification is a new contribution of this present study hydrologically isolated wetlands smaller wetlands and wetlands with higher edge area ratios were highly prone to high tsi values case studies also clarified that in monsoon season due to high rainfall tsi is relatively better than in non monsoon season indicating hydrological influence increasing tsi after damming also proved the same hydrologically connected wetlands through flood and tie channels refresh the fertilizers residues and lower tsi but an isolated wetland is highly susceptible to gradual deposition of more amounts of such residues and it promotes high tsi fringe wetlands are more prone to high tsi because of the higher agriculture intensity at its proximate areas and low hydrological strength khatun et al 2021 linear but hydrologically poor wetlands having higher human landscape exposition were also recorded with higher tsi due to enhanced human interference a higher concentration of exotic plants within wetlands is caused for hypo oxygenated water which resists endemic plant growth and the survival of other valuable faunal species from the field observation and peoples view the eutrophicated wetland is ecologically inefficient and such an environment withstands against the growth of fish species interruption in catchment hydrological processes caused by damming and other forms of human interventions like an embanking river water lifting for irrigation etc reduce the discharge volume in the river these are caused for the reduction of flood intensity and the hydrological connection between river and wetland carlson mazur et al 2022 pal and singha 2022b poor water supply from river is caused for hydrological worsening talukdar and pal 2019 rightly established this issue in pursuance of damming in the punarbhaba river of india and bangladesh linkage between the hydrological state and trophic state established the fact that poor hydrological state indulges poorer tsi and good hs encourages tsi this linkage was found across a wider part of the study unit so managing hydrological conditions can restore the existing wetland s water quality and ecological efficiency river flow management would be a good step for restoring and reviving the wetlands that are about to decay estimation of environmental river flow could revive wider parts of the wetland intensive research is needed for this simulation of river flow with different discharge volumes can help to identify the flow requirement for the survival and restoration of a particular part of the wetland the present study successfully explored the spatial linkage between hs and tsi however to make the work more authentic further research is required for adding more relevant hydrological parameters like flood prone area ground water linkage spatial data availability and inclusion of these in the hs model could enhance the accuracy of the model 7 conclusion the study revealed that damming not only dwindled the flow volume in the river but also dried out 32 32 km2 wetland and hydrologically weakened the existing wetland in the pre dam period 13 93 and 5 01 km2 areas were identified as poor and very poor hydrological states but these were reduced to only 1 14 and 0 86 km2 in the post dam period most of the cases these areas were converted into agricultural land hydrological weakening and agricultural intensification enhanced tsi over a wider part of the study unit after hydrological modification tsi value ranged from 18 96 to 21 23 during the pre dam period and 45 06 to 53 95 during the post dam period indicating degradation of water quality and ecological efficiency a very good linkage was found between the hydrological and trophic states of the existing wetlands the poor hydrological state promotes agricultural intensification even within the wetland and the gradual accretion of fertilizer and other agricultural residues are caused for increasing eutrophication this incident was found strong in fringe wetlands away from main river and hydrologically isolated wetlands hydrological connectivity additionally supports water service to the wetland apart from rainfall previous researches focused largely on the hydrological richness habitat state and trophic state of the wetland but rarely focused on the hydrological state using image driven direct hydrological components linking hydrological and trophic conditions water quality is very essential for understanding the influence of hydrological regimes on water quality and ecological efficiency but a very little attention was paid so far the present study explored this this work clearly figured out how the increasing hydrological degradation insisted on the worsening of water quality in reference to tsi here lies the novelty of this work apart from the novelty there is some further scope of improvement of the work including more hydrological parameters like flood spread at different discharge levels groundwater state may strengthen the result similarly other physio chemical parameters of water could be included for integrated water quality evaluation moreover use of post dam sample water quality data for calibrating pre dam conditions is not so justified real time data of the concerned period would make the result more robust the finding of the result at the spatial level is instrumental for managing the hydrological state of the wetland as well as the trophic state since the study clearly revealed that damming is a major reason behind the hydrological and consequent ecological transformation so discharge management would be a good step for wetland restoration and management hydrological regularization could help to restore the trophic state of the wetland declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exists 
924,a good many research works focused on investigating wetland habitat state and trophic state ts but as far the knowledge is concerned very little attention was paid to the hydrological state hs modelling of wetlands and no such attention was paid on exploring the linkage between hs and ts but it is very essential to explore the role of hydrological characters on ts in order to frame hydrological management strategies considering this the present study intended to build hs models using image driven hydrological components like water presence frequency hydro period water depth to estimate trophic state index tsi using field driven water samples and finally linking hs and tsi of the wetland successful results can open up a new approach to improve the strategies for water quality and ecological efficiency management machine learning models were applied for building the hs model and carlson s tsi method was applied to explore water quality and ecological state the ordinary least square regression was applied for linking hs and tsi results showed that hydrological modification and associated causes obliterated 32 32 km2 of wetland between the pre dam and post dam periods the support vector machine model was found as the best suited hs model to all the applied models tsi was found poor over a wider part of the wetland especially over the hydrologically poor patches of the wetland the hydrological worsening is a cause for the worsening of ts so it can be stated that managing hydrological components is a good way to manage ts keywords hydrological modification hydrological state of wetland machine learning trophic state linking hydrological and trophic state and ordinary least square regression 1 introduction along with wetland reclamation

it covers only 6 8 geographical area but it supports 40 50 ecological return janse et al 2019 zhang et al 2020a keesstra et al 2021 jang et al 2022 different issues were reported as the reasons behind the hydrological transformation of wetlands like irrigation water draft pool et al 2021 jouma and dadaser celik 2021 industrial municipal and domestic water harvesting kumar et al 2021 dar et al 2021a ground water lowering and transformation of influent wetland to effluent wetland dwire et al 2018 neff et al 2020 climate change induced rainfall scarcity adeleke et al 2019 rahman et al 2020 lack of flood water supply yu et al 2018 o keeffe et al 2019 berkowitz et al 2019 however in seasonally inundated flood plain wetland discharge control in rivers through damming was found very vital it directly and indirectly poses pressure on the wetland in the one hand it curtails water supply to the wetland and reduction of water availability in rivers exerts extra pressure on wetlands for water harvesting dar et al 2021b sibanda and ahmed 2021 a good many researchers like murshed et al 2019 akbarzadeh et al 2019 de jalón et al 2019 best 2019 zhou et al 2020a zhou et al 2020b swarnkar et al 2021 mezger et al 2021 sarathi and pani 2022 reported dwindling of flow in river ganga barakar jialing duero ebro tajo basins due to damming a few studies also investigated the role of flow attenuation of rivers on the active floodplain of tangon atreyee punarbhaba river basins and flood plain wetlands talukdar and pal 2020 kundu et al 2021 khatun and pal 2021 pal and singha 2022a the previous studies explored the direct linkage between flow attenuation and adverse hydrological transformation in wetlands of late debanshi and pal 2020a khatun et al 2021 pal and sarda 2021a applied water richness models for exploring the integrated hydrological transformation of wetlands and they reported worsening of hydrological richness over a wider part of the natural riverine wetland while developing such models proxy parameters like water cover area its shape size fragmentation consistency of water appearance relative values of water indices as a representative of water depth were considered debanshi and pal 2020b khatun et al 2021 added hydro period and absolute water depth data as new indicators for deriving water depth data they calibrated image driven water indices with field measured depth data they rightly mentioned water depth and hydro period are strongly linked with ecological niche and species phenology but lack of such data at spatial level often restricts researchers to do away from this debanshi and pal 2020a khatun et al 2021 pal and sarda 2021a kundu et al 2022 developed an acceptable method for developing hydro period maps of each year using satellite images at pixel level certainly these are some remarkable advancements towards working with wetland surface hydrology integration of such relevant hydrological components can build a good hydrological state hs model the hydrological state of wetlands mainly focused on consistency in water appearance in seasonally inundated wetlands duration of water in a year and depth of water developing such hs models in pre and post dam periods can portray a picture of integrated hydrological transformation while modelling wetland habitat water richness using proxy parameters bivariate statistical models geo statistical modelling approach data mining approaches were used by the previous literatures and they recommended machine learning ml hybrid machine learning hml approach for such modelling since these are capable to resolve the intricate non linear relationship among the contributing parameters in very robust manner pal and paul 2020 pal and debanshi 2021b pal and sarda 2021a considering this the present study adopted the ml approach for hs modelling physical hydrological state and its dynamics can control the water quality and ecological productivity of the river and riparian wetlands carlson 1977 developed a trophic state index tsi in order to explore the water quality and ecological condition based on some parameters like chlorophyll a chl a total phosphorus tp and secchi disk depth sdd in the agriculture dominated flood plain wetlands where agriculture residues dominated eutrophication is a major problem zhang et al 2020b dar et al 2021c datta et al 2022 tsi is a very efficient method since the study area is highly populated and agriculturally rich tsi was used for water quality and ecological efficiency mapping hydrological richness is linked with water quality and ecological efficiency of the wetland bolpagni et al 2020 day et al 2021 a given volume of pollutants or agricultural residues when mixed with a very little amount of water its degree of contamination will be much greater than if it s mixed with a greater volume of water moreover flow continuity in form of flood wash and backwash not only caused for dynamics of water volume in wetland lane et al 2018 chaparro et al 2019 but it also refreshes the wetland pollutants supplies fish seeds and seeds of some other economically viable species nutrients supplements etc li et al 2019 jakubínský et al 2021 moreover timing of influx whether the total amount of pollutant mixed in a certain time or over a longer period of time is also a crucial determinant of water quality in this perspective characterizing the hydrological condition of seasonally inundated flood plain wetlands and analyzing the role of it on tsi is very vital if such analysis can establish the fact that hydrological condition is the major determinant of tsi management of hydrological condition would be an acceptable alternative option of trophic state management considering this issue the present work tried to explore the hydrological condition of the wetland and assessed the role of hydrological condition on determining trophic state of the flood plain wetland since tangon river basin of barind plain of india and bangladesh has experienced remarkable hydrological modification due to damming over it the wetland rich lower part of this river basin was taken as a case 2 study area tangon river basin of india and bangladesh fig 1 traversing the older alluvium barind tract was hydrologically intervened majorly through damming over it in 1989 pal et al 2019 pal and singha 2021 in consequence of this flow volume has declined significantly leading to rapid hydrological transformation in riparian wetlands since the wetlands are majorly fed by rain and flood water seasonal rainfall disparity itself is a major reason behind the hydrological and morphological dynamics of the wetland pal et al 2019 khatun and pal 2021 kundu et al 2022 since out of total annual average rainfall 1257 mm to 1508 mm 80 happens during monsoon season june to september seasonally inundated wetlands expand maximally during monsoon time and squeezes maximally during pre monsoon season march to may due to rain scarcity 3 materials and methods 3 1 materials time series landsat 4 5 tm and landsat 8 oli satellite images with 30 meters spatial resolution were used for mapping water presence frequency hydro period and water depth from 1987 to 2020 the satellite images were downloaded from the united states geological survey usgs earth explorer portal https earthexplorer usgs gov field specific water depth data were successfully used for calibration of wetland depth using satellite images field based water samples were collected for laboratory analysis for deriving chlorophyll a total phosphorus a digital elevation model dem was used for study area map preparation google earth reference sites and ground truths were used to validate wetland areas 3 2 methods 3 2 1 wetland mapping and validation separation of wetland and non wetland pixels using water indices is a very challenging issue using a frequently used threshold due to the spectral nearness of some land use features ngoc et al 2019 wetland mapping using remote sensing spectral indices is very common practice in the field of environmental research pal and paul 2020 singha and pal 2022 spectral indices like normalized difference water index ndwi mcfeeters 1996 modified normalized difference water index mndwi xu 2006 re modified normalized difference water index rmndwi debanshi and pal 2020b automated water extraction index awei feyisa et al 2014 water ration index wri shen and li 2010 new water index nwi ding 2009 etc are frequently used for water body extraction all across the world the multiple water indices ndwi mndwi and rmndwi eqs 1 3 were used for wetland mapping in this present study in order to obtain scope for selecting suitable index 1 n d w i b g r e e n b n i r b g r e e n b n i r 2 m n d w i b g r e e n b m i r b g r e e n b m i r 3 r m n d w i b re d b m i r b r e n b m i r where bgreen bnir bmir bred refer to green near infrared middle infrared and red bands of landsat imagery the spectral indices value ranges from 0 to 1 where value near to 0 signifies saturated water body having low thickness of water and close to 1 value shows water body with higher depth gao 1996 the spectral indices values below 0 are not identified as water bodies kaplan et al 2019 the kappa coefficient k is a frequently used statistical test to evaluate the accuracy of the classification the k value ranges from 0 to 1 where 0 indicates the least accuracy and 1 indicates an excellent accuracy the k value of 0 75 or more indicates very good to excellent classification performance monserud and leemans 1992 the k value were computed as 0 833 0 925 0 782 0 834 and 0 834 0 928 in the cases of ndwi mndwi and rmndwi respectively hence ndwi and rmndwi could be treated as the representative water indices and any one of them could be taken for further work for areal extent representation rmndwi was taken as a representative water index 3 2 2 methods for developing water quality indicating trophic state index 3 2 2 1 water samples collection water samples from 20 wetland sites were collected in the months of october 2019 and 2020 and tested tp and chl a from the laboratory sdd was measured directly from the field using secchi disk instrument the american water works association awwa apha awwa wef 1998 and american public health association apha apha awwa wef 1998 recommended standard procedure to preserve transport and test the water samples garmin global positioning system gps driven coordinates of the sample sites were used for positioning sample sites on the map 3 2 2 2 chl a sdd and tp estimation from satellite images using regression model tested and measured results of chl a sdd and tp of the concerned sample sites were correlated with the spectral water indices values ndwi mndwi and rmndwi of those coordinates pearson s correlation coefficient r was used to select the best representative spectral water index to correspond to the water quality table 1 there was no sample data for pre dam period the present sample test results of chl a sdd and tp were used for calibrating the indices of the pre dam period it is not the right method however due to lack of data of that period it was done however the study suggested that it is better to use field data of a specific time for calibrating the image of that period of time ndwi was found to be the best fitted spectral index that can be taken for calibrating the tsi constituting parameters it is to be mentioned that rmndwi and ndwi both were selected to represent the wetland inventory map and accuracy of the former method was slightly better still it was not taken for the calibration process since the correlation value table 1 was very unacceptable linear regression equations of different quality parameters for both pre and post dam periods were computed and used for calibrating the concerned ndwi image in order to build chl a sdd and tp eqs 4 6 and 7 9 are the computed regression equations for pre and post dam periods respectively and these were applied for the modelling of chl a sdd and tp 4 i n c h l a 0 22 i n n d w i 0 069 5 i n s d d 0 161 i n n d w i

tsi based on the measured value of three water quality parameters tsi effectively measures the water quality biological response and ecosystem health of a water body carlson 1977 many researchers jally et al 2016 membrillo abad et al 2016 patra et al 2017 calculated tsi based on only the chl a or sdd or tp while very few researchers saluja and garg 2017 wen et al 2019 calculated average tsi based on these three parameters in the present study we used chl a sdd and tp for computing average tsi as the actual trophic state can be explored if these three parameters are applied together carlson 1977 exhibited a continuous scale 0 to 100 integrating chl a sdd and tp tsi was categorized into four classes with this scale i e oligotrophic 40 meso trophic 40 60 eutrophic 60 80 and hypereutrophic 80 eq 10 was used for computing tsi averaging tsi of the constituting parameters image driven components were validated with the data from secondary sources for the pre dam phase and field driven data for the post dam phase 10 t s i t s i c h l a t s i s d d t s i t p 3 where tsi average tsi for all three parameters tsi chl a tsi sdd and tsi tp represent trophic state reference to total phosphorus chlorophyll a secchi disk depth respectively 3 2 3 methods for developing hydrological state 3 2 3 1 parameter selection for hs modelling and multi collinearity test modelling the hydrological state is very difficult due to the scarcity of spatial hydrological data across the wetlands sometimes a few hydrological data monitoring stations are installed in some strategically important wetlands recently debanshi and pal 2020a pal and sarda 2021b khatun et al 2021 kundu et al 2022 attempted to develop pixel scale spatial hydrological data particularly from satellite images with adequate credit inspired by their success the present work also derived hydrological data like water presence frequency wpf water depth wd and hydro period hp from multi date time series satellite images these parameters were used for building hs models wpf refers to the frequency of water presence in a pixel in a defined period of time borro et al 2014 debanshi and pal 2020a and it is used for measuring the consistency of water appearance in the seasonally inundated wetlands the time series water index maps used for wetland mapping were converted into binary maps assigning 1 to the water and 0 to non water pixels binary maps of all the selected years were summed and divided by the number of years considered eq 11 it can be expressed in decimal 0 1 or in percentage 0 100 wpf value near to 1 or 100 indicates that water appearance in a pixel is regular this method was successfully applied by many scholars like pal and saha 2018 saha and pal 2019 pal and sarda 2021b khatun and pal 2021 kundu et al 2022 11 w p f p i 1 n x j n where wpfp is calculated water presence frequency for p pixel xj is the frequency of jth pixel in image x having water appearance and n is the number of years taken water depth data derived from satellite images is really very difficult following the line of thinking of gao 1996 lee et al 1999 tried to develop water depth data layers from image data gao 1996 stated that the greater value of the water index ndwi reflects the greater thickness of water although many factors control the water indices value proper field data driven calibration can help to build a reliable water depth layer following the predecessors the present study also measured water depth from a field at 33 sites and those data were used for developing a regression model with water indices values of the respective field sites the computed regression model was used for calibrating ndwi map for developing water depth layer eq 12 12 y 0 279 14 105 x where y is the water depth and x is the ndwi value of a specific pixel hydro period means the duration of water stagnation in a wetland pixel in a year bertassello et al 2019 atta darkwa et al 2020 based on this wetland can be classified into perennial water retains all through the year seasonal water retains part of a year or ephemeral water retains in a very short period of time this layer was composed using monthly binary rmndwi maps all the maps of 12 months one for each month of a year were then summed up and the value of hp ranges from 0 to 12 hp value 12 means the wetland is perennial eq 13 was used for developing hp for pre and post dam periods 13 h p i 1 n x i where hp hydro period xi monthly binary rmndwi image representing water and non water pixels the status of hydrological parameters for both pre and post dam is represented in fig 2 multicollinearity test was carried out to know whether there is a co linearity problem among the applied parameters variance inflation factor vif statistics was worked out for this vörösmarty and dobos 2020 reported that vif value 5 does mean there is no collinearity problem table 2 confirms that all the vif score are 1 727 and therefore all the factors could be used for building hs model 3 2 3 2 machine learning models used for hs modelling three hydrological parameters such as water presence frequency hydro period and water depth were used to develop hydrological state modelling using four advanced machine learning algorithms the hydrological parameters were used for identifying the evidences of good and poor hydrological states the area having high water depth 2 0 meters high hp 6 months directly and indirectly connected with river or through tie channels relatively away from the human landscape like built up land agricultural land etc considered as good hydrological state indicating areas whereas the areas having low depth 0 50 meters low hp 3 months located at very proximity to the human landscape and isolated in nature were considered poor hydrological state areas a total of 500 250 sites from good and 250 sites from poor hydrological states training and testing sites were considered to develop hydrological state models total sample sites were sub divided into the training and testing data following 80 20 ratio following rashid and louis 2019 zhou et al 2020a based on training sites artificial neural network ann additive regression ar random subspace rs and support vector machine svm models were developed showing wetland hydrological state the model performances were tested based on the 20 testing sample sites 3 2 3 2 1 artificial neural network the interconnected neurons that operate the data and interact with other components are the main characteristics of ann svozil et al 1997 the independent statistical distribution of the data sets self learning and associative memory are the main characteristics of the ann model ann can handle some unknown information hidden in the data sets ann model provides linear or non linear models and single multi layer networks dou et al 2015 the ann model has frequently been used in classification regression recognition autocorrelation prediction and many other fields ann is a very popular ml algorithm and has been widely used to identify and solve various environmental problems such as landslides floods wetland prediction gully erosion etc garosi et al 2018 dtissibe et al 2020 debanshi and pal 2020a saha et al 2020 to improve the network performance trial and error was done alternating seed size batch size learning rate momentum etc 3 2 3 2 2 additive regression the additive regression has been usually applied for different natural hazards modelling like flood susceptibility landslide susceptibility and gully erosion hazard modelling shirzadi et al 2017 shafizadeh moghadam et al 2018 the ar model can easily handle the complex non linear relationship data structure between environmental problems and their conditioning parameters the ar model is the modified version of glm generalized additive model this model is best fitted when the dependent variable is not normally distributed even in the case of non linear relationships hastie and tibshirani 1990 ar models provide the scope to linear and non linear forms of modelling goetz et al 2011 the ar model is so popular due to its three major characteristics like flexibility forecast supremacy and interpretability etc zhang and batterman 2010 the ar model was frequently used in various fields including modelling flood susceptibility shafizadeh et al 2018 modelling landslide susceptibility bartelletti et al 2018 modelling groundwater potentiality khosravi et al 2021 modelling ecological security feng et al 2018 etc 3 2 3 2 3 random subspace in 1998 ho first developed the rs classifier which is defined as a classic integrated ensemble algorithm ho 1998 the rs model was widely used in environmental science for solving environmental problems rashid et al 2021 trong et al 2021 rs is a well known ensemble ml algorithm that offers a pseudo randomly chosen subsets to each and every classifier and outputs are combined by voting rs classifiers improve the weak classifier efficiency wang and tang 2006 and improve the accuracy of the classification of individual classifiers trong et al 2021 the training data is also modified by rs classifier however this modification is carried out in the features space handling large data sets and solving the over fitting problems become more popular in the rs model talukdar et al 2021 this method may be beneficial from using random subspace for both constructive and aggregation of the classifier small sample sized issues can easily be handled by rs algorithms yaman et al 2018 3 2 3 2 4 support vector machine svm is well known as a supervised non parametric statistical ml technique the concept of svm is based on decision planes which is defined as the plane of separation of different objectives or different class membership choubin et al 2019 it can work with different types of variables like continuous categorical as well as linear and non linear data sets in different class members the basis of this technique is separating hyper plane creation in the training dataset the mathematical function used to transform data is known as the kernel function tehrany et al 2015 in the svm model to separate the original input space an optimal hyper plane is used for this purpose identification of proper kernel function shows the ability of the svm model the kernel functions of svm models were classified into four classes such as radial basis kernel rbf sigmoid kernel sg linear kernel ln and polynomial kernel pl commonly in remote sensing environments pl and rbf kernels have been used maxwell et al 2018 rbf kernel is commonly used in svm techniques for the higher performance and higher level of accuracy of the model than the other traditional methods knorn et al 2009 zheng et al 2019 detailed information of the model optimization process is mentioned in table 3 the output ml value ranges between 0 1 based on this the final hs models were subdivided into five categories very good good moderate poor and very poor hydrological states very high hs was categorized as those pixels having very high consistency 67 of water appearances greater water depth 2 0 meters and longer hydro period 6 months 3 2 4 importance of the factors based on ingr for developing hydrological state model the importance of each contributing parameter could be derived on the basis of their statistical properties and such information would be very helpful for source control based wetland management information of gain ratio ingr for each parameter was computed in order to achieve this objective a higher ingr value signifies the greater importance of an individual parameter the ingr is calculated using eq 14 14 g a i n r a t i o x z e n t r o p y z 1 n i 1 n z i z e n t r o p y z i i 1 n z i z log z i z where the attribute x belongs to a training point z with subsets zi 1 1 2 3 n 4 validation of hs model 4 1 statistical approaches for analyzing the performances of the applied ml models five statistical techniques including receiver operating characteristics roc of the area under the curve auc precision sensitivity f1 score and matthew s correlation coefficient mcc were applied all these were computed based on 300 testing sites true positive tp false negative fn true negative tn and false positive fp were taken for computing the statistics tp signifies that the sample was correctly classified predicted as positive fn signifies the sample incorrectly classified as negative fp means the samples were incorrectly classified as positive and fp refers to the samples were correctly classified as negative the auc roc was computed based on 300 references sites collected from field and google earth images equations for calculating other statistical measures as mentioned are given in eqs 15 18 in sensitivity and precision the true positive false negative and false positive values of the predicted data are used for calculation whereas in mcc all four matrices is used for better reliability and performance chicco et al 2021 the mcc value ranges from 1 to 1 where 1 indicates least accuracy in the prediction and vice versa the f1 score is computed against the value of precision and sensitivity therefore it offers a bit better product which is even better in uneven classes chicco and jurman 2020 the value of roc auc precision and f1 score varies from 0 1 and value near to 0 indicates poor performance as well as less reliability of a model and value near to 1 signifies higher reliability yao and shepperd 2020 since different measures possess some strengths and flaws instead of one multiple measures can help to infer the reliability of the model considering this issue all the measures were applied using eqs 15 18 15 r e c a l l s e n s i t i v i t y t p t p f n 16 p r e c i s i o n t p t p f p 17 m c c t p t n f p f n t p f p t p f n t n f p t n f n 18 f 1 s c o r e 2 p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l p r e c i s i o n r e c a l l 4 2 linkage between hs and tsi using ordinary least squares regression ols for making spatial linkage between hs and tsi ols regression was used osl is a widely used technique for estimating coefficients of linear regression equations which depict the association between one or multiple numbers of independent variables and a dependent variable it can be applied for both numerical and spatial point data sets in this case wetland pixels were converted into point data and those were used to retrieve data from hs and tsi layers to continue the ols method hs was treated as an independent and tsi was selected as a dependent variable for running ols regression standard regression residual was mapped for showing the degree of control of hs on the trophic state low value of residual signifies high control of independent variable on the dependent variable eq 19 19 β x t x 1 x t y where β is the ordinary least square estimation x is the matrix regression variable x t is the matrix transpose and y are the vector of the value of the response variable the whole work was summarized in fig 3 5 results 5 1 time series wetland conditions rmndwi representing wetland maps of some pre and post dam years are furnished in fig 4 in order to visualize the change of wetland area after the dam induces hydrological transformation fig 4 displays that there was a significant decrease in wetland areas over time in the year 1987 pre dam period the wetland area was 53 38 km2 and in 2020 post dam period it was only 21 06 km2 this trend of wetland loss was also reported by chakraborty et al 2018 khatun and pal 2021 kundu et al 2022 in their works moreover continuous wetlands were fragmented into patchy wetland after damming 5 2 hydrological state figure 5 displays the hydrological state models of pre and post dam periods each hs map was classified into five categories i e very poor poor moderate good and very good hydrological state all the models envisaged that wide parts of the wetland under poor hs during the pre dam period were lost after hydrological modification post dam as a result only those parts of the wetland retained their identity who were hydrologically in good state therefore when areas under different hs categories were accounted for the absolute area was substantially reduced during the post dam period but the relative area was found increased the areal change is not similar for all the applied ml models but their trend of change is quite uniform for instance in case of svm model the absolute area under very good and very poor zones were respectively 21 47 km2 and 5 01 km2 in the pre dam period and during the post dam period it was 6 18 km2 and 0 86 km2 in same order but in terms of percentage very good and good hs areas in the post dam period were increased respectively by 3 56 and 21 68 table 4 the spatial pattern of hs categories exhibited that very poor zone was not only found in the fringe zone and upper reach of the main river but also in the interior part of the main wetland tract during the pre dam period in the post dam period such poor wetland patches were mostly obliterated it is caused for less wetland areas under poor hs zone at the confluence segment very good hs was found in a continuous stretch during the pre dam period but it was found fragmented and sparse after damming among the used hydrological components when the role of each component of hs model was assessed using information gain ratio water depth was found as the most dominant factor followed by hydro period and wpf both during pre and post dam periods fig 6 water depth is really very important since it determines the niche and associated ecosystem diversity lantz et al 2011 asher et al 2017 5 2 1 validation of hs models since the predicted area under different hs classes of all models show some variation and it demands validation of the applied models in order to find out the best suited model so the predictive model requires validation before recommendation auc roc was computed for each and the values for all the cases show excellent agreement between the model and ground reality state and therefore be accepted fig 7 auc values range from 0 931 to 0 961 and 0 889 to 0 947 during pre and post dam periods respectively table 5 the svm model exhibited maximum auc values in both the periods and therefore be taken as the most representative apart from auc value precision sensitivity f1 score and mcc also show high performance table 5 in case of svm models and therefore could be treated as the best suited 5 3 trophic state index figure 8 depicts the tsi of the flood plain wetland tract of the study area and associated factors both during pre and post dam periods tsi value ranged from 18 96 to 21 23 during the pre dam period and 45 06 to 53 95 during the post dam period as per carlson s tsi reference limits water quality was good during the pre dam period since value 40 signifies good water quality oligotrophic state it also indicates ample oxygen availability in wetlands ensuring relatively comfortable conditions for species growth after damming not only wetland area was squeezed but its quality was degraded considerably the computed tsi value of the post dam period indicates the transformation of oligotrophic to mesotrophic and eutrophic states in terms of contributing tsi factors there were not any significant changes in the range of chlorophyll a sdd and tp however the average concentration of all those components was found to be high in wider parts of the study region in the pre dam period the fringe wetland part experienced relatively higher tsi value but this was within the oligotrophic limit in post dam condition not only the fringe wetlands the wider part of the main wetland tract some core areas witnessed mesotrophic and eutrophic states notably a large patch of confluence wetland tract also experienced significant trophic state transformation some parts transformed into eutrophic state this trend of tsi change due to hydrological modification was also reported by talukdar et al 2020 khatun et al 2021 song et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 sarkar et al 2020 reported the degradation of tsi in the agriculturally dominated floodplain region of china and india 5 4 spatial relation between hs and tsi from the ols between hs and tsi a wide part of the study area during the pre dam period was identified with high control of hs on tsi the continuous wetland tract at the confluence segment of tangon river fell under this with a low standard regression residual 0 5 to 0 5 in the post dam period some patches were identified within the major wetland tract where the standard regression residual was very high signifying poor control of hs on tsi fig 9 table 6 demonstrated that the area under very low regression residual was decreased from 51 22 km2 to 14 29 km2 as per the svm model which was found as the best other models also reported the same trend table 7 shows the coefficient of determination r2 computed in ols performed between hs and tsi r2 value varies from 0 48 to 0 57 in case of the pre dam and 0 42 to 0 59 in case of the post dam period in reference to all the models probability values p were found 0 028 in all the cases it was found 0 001 in the svm model best representative of both pre and post dam periods f statistics also found the lowest in case of the svm model it clearly proved that the hydrological state can significantly control the trophic state of a wetland 5 5 some case specific analysis twenty wetlands from the study region were selected from different hs zones in order to reveal the case specific hydrological state and water quality sites 1 20 are located at very good good poor and very poor hs zones respectively table 8 agricultural neighbourhoods were found in all the cases but the invasion is less active in case of the wetlands located at very good and good hs zones the situation was found quite reverse in the case of poor and very poor hs zones wetlands within good and very good hs zones were found to be hydrologically consistent having greater water depth the existence of active tie channels and river flood connectivity the wetlands with better hydrological states were characterized by relatively good water quality less presence of exotic species like water hyacinth influx of agricultural residues from surrounding agricultural lands in all the cases are not so less still the contamination level is comparatively poor because of high water availability exchange of river and wetland water flood swash and backwash etc on the other hand wetlands at the poor and very poor hs zones were characterized by poor water quality and moderate to high presence of endemic and exotic species these wetlands are quite isolated from the main river and possess very little chance of swishing continuous accretion of fertilizer within such a water body hyper fertilization insists eutrophication like situation it is highly responsible for the qualitative degradation of water and ecological efficiency 6 discussion from the study 32 32 km2 of wetland area were lost in the post dam period it doesn t always signify that the dam is the sole factor responsible for wetland loss apart from wetland loss existing wetlands also witnessed hydrological transformations like lowering wetland water depth the wetland loss was identified in the fringe area and the main wetland tract shallow wetlands near agriculture and built up areas were transformed quickly as prominent from time series wetland mapping the continuous wetland tract was broken down into multiple patches it does mean it is because of the reclamation of wetlands by other cultural landscapes like agricultural land built areas or drying out some parts of the wetland both situations were identified in the present study area due to the dwindling of flow 63 in river triggered by damming not only river hydrology was affected but also the riparian wetland directly depends on river water as a water source pal et al 2019 due to the lowering of maximum water level wetlands located away from the main river and at a relatively elevated area in the flood plain do not regularly receive inundation water saha and pal 2019 reported that after damming the average active flood plain was reduced by 25 80 and the wetland beyond the current active flood plain witnessed water scarcity due to a lack of lateral inundation spread it also causes limited backwashing of pollutants from the wetlands and surrounding areas besides water scarcity in the wetland promoted land use conversion zhou et al 2020a eskandari damaneh et al 2020 and consequent landscape fragmentation haque 2020 pal and debanshi 2021a islam et al 2021 conversion of wetland from deep to shallow or shallow to saturated land facilitated land use conversion specifically conversion to agricultural land saha and pal 2019 rightly reported growing man and wetland conflict through agriculturalization which is very prominent in the present study area a good many previous literatures like zhang et al 2021 basu et al 2021 dar et al 2022 also reported wetland loss due to land reclamation so the present finding is in parity with previous works to assess the wetland s hydrological state the present study developed hydrological state models using multiple satellite image driven hydrological parameters like wpf wd and hp such data was not usually monitored from the field so as an alternative this approach of hydrological data derivation was adopted following pal and debanshi 2021b khatun and pal 2021 pal and khatun 2022 kundu et al 2022 this approach filled the gap of spatial data scarcity and the components were successfully used for hs modelling for finding out the best representative model a multi model approach is always recommended talukdar et al 2021 pal and singha 2021 norallahi et al 2021 since it provides the option to select the most suitable one the present study also did this and selected svm as the best suited hs model ghosh and das 2020 and khatun et al 2021 also applied similar models for wetland habitat risk modelling and spatially segregated the situation from the hs model it was found that the absolute area under better hs state was increased and the poor hs state was declined in the post dam period in reference to the relative area the reverse situation was recorded complete obliteration of wetlands with poor or very poor hs is the primary reason behind such a paradox in absolute and relative areas under different hs states in reference to the modelling aspect the present study did not explore anything new but the gradual deletion of poor hs over the phases is a good insight of this study in reference to the tsi wide part of the wetland was converted from oligotrophic to mesoeutrophic and eutrophic state some main wetland tracts at its confluence segment also witnessed increasing tsi values makri et al 2019 talukdar and pal 2020 ran et al 2022 also showed the degradation of the trophic state due to agricultural intensification here also agricultural intensification seasonal agriculture within wetland beds in such patches is mainly responsible for degrading trophic state in all parts of the study area agricultural land was found at very proximity to the wetland and therefore the deposition of fertilizer residues to the wetland is very common so the degradation of tsi due to agricultural effects is not any new finding but the influence of water curtailing due to damming and tsi intensification is a new contribution of this present study hydrologically isolated wetlands smaller wetlands and wetlands with higher edge area ratios were highly prone to high tsi values case studies also clarified that in monsoon season due to high rainfall tsi is relatively better than in non monsoon season indicating hydrological influence increasing tsi after damming also proved the same hydrologically connected wetlands through flood and tie channels refresh the fertilizers residues and lower tsi but an isolated wetland is highly susceptible to gradual deposition of more amounts of such residues and it promotes high tsi fringe wetlands are more prone to high tsi because of the higher agriculture intensity at its proximate areas and low hydrological strength khatun et al 2021 linear but hydrologically poor wetlands having higher human landscape exposition were also recorded with higher tsi due to enhanced human interference a higher concentration of exotic plants within wetlands is caused for hypo oxygenated water which resists endemic plant growth and the survival of other valuable faunal species from the field observation and peoples view the eutrophicated wetland is ecologically inefficient and such an environment withstands against the growth of fish species interruption in catchment hydrological processes caused by damming and other forms of human interventions like an embanking river water lifting for irrigation etc reduce the discharge volume in the river these are caused for the reduction of flood intensity and the hydrological connection between river and wetland carlson mazur et al 2022 pal and singha 2022b poor water supply from river is caused for hydrological worsening talukdar and pal 2019 rightly established this issue in pursuance of damming in the punarbhaba river of india and bangladesh linkage between the hydrological state and trophic state established the fact that poor hydrological state indulges poorer tsi and good hs encourages tsi this linkage was found across a wider part of the study unit so managing hydrological conditions can restore the existing wetland s water quality and ecological efficiency river flow management would be a good step for restoring and reviving the wetlands that are about to decay estimation of environmental river flow could revive wider parts of the wetland intensive research is needed for this simulation of river flow with different discharge volumes can help to identify the flow requirement for the survival and restoration of a particular part of the wetland the present study successfully explored the spatial linkage between hs and tsi however to make the work more authentic further research is required for adding more relevant hydrological parameters like flood prone area ground water linkage spatial data availability and inclusion of these in the hs model could enhance the accuracy of the model 7 conclusion the study revealed that damming not only dwindled the flow volume in the river but also dried out 32 32 km2 wetland and hydrologically weakened the existing wetland in the pre dam period 13 93 and 5 01 km2 areas were identified as poor and very poor hydrological states but these were reduced to only 1 14 and 0 86 km2 in the post dam period most of the cases these areas were converted into agricultural land hydrological weakening and agricultural intensification enhanced tsi over a wider part of the study unit after hydrological modification tsi value ranged from 18 96 to 21 23 during the pre dam period and 45 06 to 53 95 during the post dam period indicating degradation of water quality and ecological efficiency a very good linkage was found between the hydrological and trophic states of the existing wetlands the poor hydrological state promotes agricultural intensification even within the wetland and the gradual accretion of fertilizer and other agricultural residues are caused for increasing eutrophication this incident was found strong in fringe wetlands away from main river and hydrologically isolated wetlands hydrological connectivity additionally supports water service to the wetland apart from rainfall previous researches focused largely on the hydrological richness habitat state and trophic state of the wetland but rarely focused on the hydrological state using image driven direct hydrological components linking hydrological and trophic conditions water quality is very essential for understanding the influence of hydrological regimes on water quality and ecological efficiency but a very little attention was paid so far the present study explored this this work clearly figured out how the increasing hydrological degradation insisted on the worsening of water quality in reference to tsi here lies the novelty of this work apart from the novelty there is some further scope of improvement of the work including more hydrological parameters like flood spread at different discharge levels groundwater state may strengthen the result similarly other physio chemical parameters of water could be included for integrated water quality evaluation moreover use of post dam sample water quality data for calibrating pre dam conditions is not so justified real time data of the concerned period would make the result more robust the finding of the result at the spatial level is instrumental for managing the hydrological state of the wetland as well as the trophic state since the study clearly revealed that damming is a major reason behind the hydrological and consequent ecological transformation so discharge management would be a good step for wetland restoration and management hydrological regularization could help to restore the trophic state of the wetland declaration of competing interest no conflict of interest exists
