3290,the rivers in taiwan are fast flowing with high discharge rates especially following heavy rain thus riverbeds suffer from severe erosion during the typhoon season and sometimes flash floods caused by the rapid rising of the river stage and massive sediment yield such events can not only damage hydraulic structures and people s property but can even lead to the loss of human life to further understand the scouring problem in taiwan the study utilizes multiple downscaling simulations with continuous in situ monitoring to assess riverbed scouring first the hec hms hydrologic modeling system is used to simulate the runoff on the watershed scale then the wash123d model is utilized to understand hydraulic routing on the river scale finally the srh 2d and cche3d mobile bed models are applied to simulate the local scouring of the riverbed on a local scale in situ monitoring at fengshan creek in taiwan started in june 2018 including the installation of the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp and float out devices in the riverbed here numerical simulations are integrated with field monitoring to study local scouring the results reveal consistency between the adcp and float out device monitoring results for water level flow velocity and scouring depth with the multiple downscaling simulations furthermore this study found that most erosion was generated at peak times and that more obvious down scouring occurred during flood recession when the lessening of the flow velocity along the river generated a more substantial down erosive kinetic energy that usually happens in the turbid rivers in taiwan when the riverbed has been severely disturbed inevitably resulting in severe scouring the study also confirms that multiple downscaling simulations can dramatically reduce the computational resources needed while effectively maintaining simulation accuracy in addition integrating numerical simulations with field monitoring is an effective way to evaluate riverbed erosion keywords multiple downscaling simulations wash123d srh 2d cche3d acoustic doppler current profiler float out devices 1 introduction in recent years with global climate change natural disasters have occurred more frequently in taiwan according to world bank annual report gagnet 2005 taiwan is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to natural hazards the report also points out that more than 90 of the population in taiwan face the threat of at least two natural disasters and as much as 73 of the population face more than three kinds one of the most destructive examples is typhoon morakot which made landfall in taiwan in 2009 it brought more than 3 000 mm of rainfall in less than 4 days lee et al 2011 leading to landslides in 12 697 regions with a cumulative area of 183 1 km2 wu et al 2011 the deaths of 652 people and 47 reported missing lin et al 2011 taiwan is an island surrounded by ocean situated in the monsoon region of the western pacific it received about 80 of its annual average 2 500 mm of precipitation from may to october however the rainfall s uneven temporal and spatial distribution ends up causing both water shortages and floods alternating between the two in addition taiwan s location on several seismically active plate boundaries has produced its rugged topography steep slopes and short fast moving rivers almost 70 of the land area consists of hills and mountains over 100 m in height thus the water level in rivers often rises to dangerous levels very rapidly resulting in scouring problems when a typhoon hits local scouring caused by sediment transport can lead to catastrophic damage to in river structures and general scouring may also bring about excessive river meandering and dike collapse problems with the increasing computational power of computers in recent years it has become common to use them to assess sediment yield problems one dimensional 1 d steady flow models such as hec 6 usace 1993 and sedicoup holly and rahuel 1990a b using energy equations for hydraulics routing are allowing the assessment of long term general scouring and sediment problems the hydrodynamic 1 d models such as cche1d wu and vieira 2002 and telemac 1d goutal and maurel 2002 are used to simulate unsteady flows and transient sediments two dimensional 2 d conceptual models e g netstars lee et al 1996 and gstars molinas and yang 1986 have been developed for the analysis of the variation in general scouring and sedimentation with uneven horizontal flows other widely used 2 d dynamic wave models have applied the shallow water equations for modeling these include rma 2 usace 1996 srh 2d lai 2008 telemac 2d jones and davies 2005 bri√®re et al 2007 and cche2d jia and wang 2001 the models aimed at describing fluvial behavior along the transverse direction have demonstrated high value in practical applications for understanding scouring across channels the limitations of the above models can be easily improved upon by three dimensional 3 d modeling using the conservation of mass navier stokes equations and physical transport equations to simulate the mobile beds with a free surface such as srh 3d lai and wu 2019 cche3d jia et al 2013 and telemac 3d smolders et al 2016 three dimensional models can effectively handle the vertical velocity component and secondary flows and are more than adequate to simulate the overall features of fluvial sediment transport in rivers although the three dimensional models can describe water flow and sediment transport more accurately they often require more complicated inputs longer calculation times and higher computational resources which limits their applications during the past decade the taiwan water resources planning institute cooperated with the us bureau of reclamation usbr and the national center for computational hydroscience and engineering cche to introduce their models srh 2d and cche2d to taiwan to apply to many local rivers wang 2010 applied srh 2d to model the scenario where the no 1 chijiawan check dam in southern taiwan is removed they also used in situ measurement data to evaluate the applicability of the modeling lai and wu 2013 applied the srh 2d model to the complicated reaches of the zhuoshui river and carried out calibration and verification for up to 7 years based on actual measurement data the simulation results showed that the locations of significant erosion and deposition and the trend of the scouring had been successfully captured lee et al 2018 applied srh 2d to simulate general scouring around minchu bridge on the zhuoshui river the modeling results indicated the depth of local scouring and deposition behavior in this gravel bed river afterward to improve the local application of srh 2d yeh et al 2015 added an empirical formula especially for taiwan to the srh 2d model to estimate general scouring cche2d is another tool generally used for simulating sediment transport and the scouring problem in taiwan for instance lee 2012 applied the model to study the effects of the failure of the barlin dam and the removal of qijiawan river dam through analysis of their hydraulic properties and sediment transport lu 2012 used cche2d to discuss the general scouring problem related to the shigang dam one of the most controversial issues in taiwan chiue 2013 analyzed and proposed sediment dredging in the lai she river in pingtung county taiwan chao et al 2015 discussed local scouring near the bridge over the gaoping river caused by extreme climatic events finally jia et al 2005 utilized a 3 d simulation to analyze the effects of submerged weirs in the backflow zone on the functionality of hydraulic structures it can be seen from the above that a model s applicability depends on the characteristics of the simulated area adopting an appropriate empirical scouring formula is essential to obtaining good simulation results and the most challenging aspect is the need for extensive local in situ measurement data as input for the mathematical regression chang et al 2014 integrated monitoring devices installed on a bridge deck and piers to build an intelligent sensor network they proposed using four kinds of monitoring systems to conduct real time monitoring of the water level local scouring depth and daily safety situation su and lu 2013 and hsu 2016 utilized numbered erosion devices set up near the target bridge piers before floods to monitor local scouring data on the maximum scouring depth after floods is obtained from the remaining numbered devices the water resources agency wra of taiwan has conducted a specialized monitoring plan of local scours on the dajia and zhuoshui rivers in central taiwan since 2013 the devices in the rivers successfully monitored dynamic scouring during typhoon nesat in 2017 su and yang 2017 used wireless floating devices to monitor the local scour depth in real time during typhoons lee et al 2018 developed a globular metal flood monitoring device for watching acceleration response affected by water flow this study tries to address the riverbed scouring problem by integrating multiple down scaling simulations with continuous in situ monitoring first we conducted a downscaling simulation from the watershed scale to the scale of local channels with various models then verified the simulation results with field monitoring experiments using acoustic doppler current profiler adcp float out devices finally the results are discussed in greater detail below 2 multiple downscaling simulations although one might obtain more accurate results with a whole 3 d mobile bed simulation it is also costly and time consuming therefore we linked various dimensional models to conduct hydraulic simulations to find the balance between simulation accuracy and computational cost the simulation strategy is to implement the catchment runoff calculation which is then downscaled to local 3 d mobile bed modeling as illustrated in fig 1 firstly the hec hms model usace 2008 usace 2010 is used to estimate rainfall runoff over the entire watershed scale the wash123d shih and yeh 2018 is then employed to conduct hydraulic routing on the river scale in which the hec hms estimated runoffs comprise the upstream inflow next srh 2d is applied to simulate the lower reaches with the wash123d modeling results adopted as the boundary conditions for the upstream discharge and downstream depth after that a cche3d mobile bed model is utilized for a local 3 d mobile bed simulation based on the inputs from the srh 2d rainfall induced surface runoff obtained from the hec hms model developed by the hydrologic engineering center us army corps of engineering usace 2000 usace 2008 is applied three major modules are included in the hec hms routing the basin meteorological and control specification modules usace 2000 first the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method calculates the sub basin loss in the basin module then the initial loss cn value and impervious percentage parameters are evaluated based on the land use types in the study area next the scs unit hydrograph method is applied to calculate sub basin routings using data from historical records to calculate the discharge lag time for the meteorological module the hec hms provides multiple options to obtain the regional rainfall distribution finally the rainfall station weighting method is adopted to determine the areal weights for various sub watersheds based on the thiessen polygons method therefore the hec hms is applied to simulate the runoff and its results are for the subsequent channel routing for the hydrodynamic model this study used wash123d shih and yeh 2018 for river routing which the governing equation of the model based on the mass and momentum equilibrium expressed as 1 a t q x s i 2 v t v v t g h x g s 0 s f 0 where t is time x represents the axis along the flow direction g is gravity a is the cross sectional area of the river stream v and q are velocity and flow rate of the river respectively s i is the source sink terms h is water depth s 0 and s f are the slope of elevation and energy respectively wash123d uses the lagrangian eulerian formulation to solve the above equations over unstructured finite element meshes thus eqs 1 and 2 is further rearranged as 3 d v c v œâ d œÑ k v s 4 d v c v œâ d œÑ k v s where k and k are decay coefficient of the positive and negative gravity wave respectively s are source sink terms of the positive and negative wave and k k s and s can be expressed as 5 k g bc a x k g bc a x s s g z o x where z 0 is the bottom elevation a is a function of water depth h x t and the axis along river direction x and b a h is the top width of the cross section next eqs 3 and 4 are combined along their respective characteristic lines from x i the coordinate of node i at the new time level to x i 1 and x i 2 with a backward track the x i 1 and x i 2 are the location of a fictitious particle tracked backward from x i along the first and second characteristics respectively more details of calculation can be referred to the shih and yeh 2018 the governing equation of srh 2d holds the assumption of the above 1 d derivation except for two momentum equations along the x and y directions are applied to assume the flows are relatively shallow and neglect the effects of vertical motions hence 2 d depth averaged saint venant equations are 6 h t h u x u v x 0 7 h u t h u u x h v u y h t xx x h t xy y g h z x œÑ bx œÅ d xx d xy 8 h v t

between the suspended load and bedload d x and d y are the mud sand migration mixing coefficients in the and y directions and v k is the mud sand exchange coefficient between the water and active

adaptation length which can be obtained by experimental data for sediment sizes greimann et al 2008 z b riverbed elevation which is affected by the scouring and sediment thus z b k can be calculated by the following equation 11 Œ∑ ak z b k t v k srh 2d is solved by the finite volume numerical method and utilized unstructured grids with implicit algorithms for dealing with dry wet mesh in addition the segregated calculation for a free surface is applied in srh 2d thus eq 9 can be further discretized as 12 h c k int h c k m Œ¥ t cos Œ± k Œ≤ k v t h c k int x cos Œ± k Œ≤ k v t h h c k int y x f k

initial value problem in eq 13 is solved analytically to obtain the solution at next time level t m 1 then the cche3d developed by national center for computational hydroscience and engineering ncche is used for 3 d calculation of sediment transport the model simulates free surface turbulent flows with finite elements and the process of non uniform sediment transport can differentiate varied

can be increased steadily to obtain the best simulating result in the end any flow dominated by the bed load or suspended load should satisfy the equation of conservation of sediment mass as listed

sediment concentration exists a simple proportional relation with depth averaged sediment concentration in addition the adaptation coefficient affects many factors such as sedimentation velocity turbulence bedforms and section forms during sediment transport therefore these parameters rely on further adjustment during application 3 study site and modeling configurations 3 1 study site the fengshan creek basin in northern taiwan was selected as the study site the hsinchu science park the first and most important science park in taiwan is also located there flood mitigation is particularly crucial in this region because of the many semiconductor factories in the park the catchment area of fengshan creek is 250 1 km2 it originates from najie mountain at an altitude of 1 320 m the mainstream is approximately 45 45 km2 long and the longitudinal profile of the river is about 1 250 its surface elevation and terrain slope are sketched in fig 2 a and b fig 2 c illustrates land usage in the fengshan creek basin which is mainly occupied by forestry lands with the agricultural and industrial areas located in the downstream watershed the map is provided by the national land surveying and mapping center ministry of interior taiwan nlsc in addition there are 2 official rainfall stations 1 flow station and 5 groundwater stations at the site as shown in fig 2 d the study area has a temperate climate with an average temperature of 23 c based on historical statistics from these monitoring stations the average annual rainfall is 1 608 mm with 167 rainy days precipitation mainly falls from july to september during the typhoon and monsoon seasons the annual base flow is 9 81 m3 s according to over 50 years of stream gauge statistics the maximum flow rate during typhoon toraji in 2001 was 3 860 m3 s and the annual runoff in this basin is 376 million tons 3 2 modeling configuration a multiple downscaling simulation procedure was applied to alleviate the computational burden while preserving the accuracy of a mobile bed simulation for estimation of the rainfall induced runoff we used the hec hms module parameters based on fengshan creek basin data to precisely estimate rainfall runoff for the fengshan creek the basin was divided into 10 sub catchment areas as shown in fig 3 the soil conservation service scs unit hydrograph method was adopted to implement the sub basin routing in the basin model the parameters for the initial loss basin length average slope impervious land cover rate and lag time were set based on basin geography as listed in table 1 the rainfall runoff from the hec hms calculation was used as the input for wash123d to conduct 1 d hydraulic routing according to the in situ cross sectional investigation a total of 82 cross sections were adopted for channel routing the manning roughness coefficient value of each river cross section is shown in table 2 the 2nd river management office water resources agency wra 2014 among the 82 cross sections of fengshan creek no 27 34 were selected for the mobile bed simulation the latest land cover map completed at the beginning of 2018 using unmanned aerial vehicles uav of the middle reaches of the fengshan creek is used in this study as shown in fig 4 a the aerial uav photos were applied to show the roughness of the channels and for vegetation classification the 2 d mobile bed simulation was conducted using the srh 2d model in which the mesh grid using 1 m elevation data interpolated to produce a quadrilateral mesh grid size of around 5 m the modeling range cross sections of fengshan creek no 27 34 and surface altitude are illustrated in fig 4 b where wash123d simulations provide the upstream inflow and downstream stage boundary conditions then data from in situ monitoring conducted at the river bend between sections 29 30 was supplemented with the 3 d mobile bed simulation results calculated by cche3d the boundary and initial conditions of cche3d were based on the results of the srh 2d s simulation the grid construction is shown in fig 4 c more details show in fig 5 to illustrate the computational domain of the multiple downscaling models examined in this study regarding the settings of mobile bed simulations the specific gravity of the soil grains in the mobile bed model for sediment transport calculation is 2 65 the grain sampling data are based on the official grain size accumulation and distribution curves of the 2nd river management office wra 2014 table 3 lists the particle size survey retrieved from the report where the particle samples numbered ha15 ha16 and ha17 were gathered from cross sections 28 30 and 32 respectively on the fengshan creek study sites the average particle diameter was around 56 3 mm 56 5 mm which produces a low suspended load transport rate in this simulation range thus the calculation for the mobile bed simulation is mainly based on the bedload since there are no sediment yield records for the middle reaches of fengshan creek this study used the non equilibrium srh 2d sediment transport model to estimate the bed material load of sediment inflows the study applied blench s formula 1969 to calculate the average erodible depth for the section the value was 4 83 m and assumed uniformly distributed vertically in addition we adopted the setting from following some local applications wang 2010 lai and wu 2013 lee et al 2018a yeh et al 2015 which the parabolic equation in the turbulence model included a turbulence coefficient of 0 7 and active layer thickness of 1 0 m for the cche3d simulation the average river width was 36 m the mixing layer thickness was 0 1 m for a bed load of d50 and the layer thickness was 5 m based on the blench 1969 formulation of a 5 year recurrence interval with the in situ particle diameter and river width then the parabolic eddy viscosity model was adopted because of its stabilization and efficiency to examine the four layer turbulence model configuration in the simulation finally based on the above investigation and embedded sediment transport formula tests the empirical formulation of wu et al 2000 was adopted for the mobile bed simulation 3 3 in situ monitoring work in this study in situ monitoring was conducted to provide more detailed hydraulic data for the selected area the in situ monitoring spot was set around the middle downstream confluence between fengshan creek and xiaoli creek the embankments along these reaches have been severely affected by several typhoons and flash floods causing some inundation in low lying areas e g by typhoons nari 2001 matsa 2005 krosa 2007 sinlaku 2008 jangmi 2008 morakot 2009 and saola 2012 in addition there is a factory located on the left bank adjoining the drainage lines which needs to be protected from flood damage it is thus essential to improve our understanding of the hydraulic mechanisms in this area we utilized an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp to measure the fluid current during flooding the sl500 side looking doppler current meter sontek corporation was used to continuously measure flow level and the transient velocity profile of the channel the instrumental acoustic detection ranges of the horizontal and vertical beams are 1 4 and 3 8 degrees respectively delivering a horizontal sampling range from 1 5 m to 120 m velocity profiling for up to 10 cells can be detected with a maximum designed velocity range of 6 m s velocities we selected this instrument for use in this study because of its reliability lightweight and ease of mounting either on piers or shoreside without requiring divers or boats since the adcp must be mounted beneath the water surface to measure fluvial velocity we designed tracks installed on the embankment for a trolley to slide the adcp into the water the fluid velocity of the river was then monitored consecutively during typhoons a schematic diagram of the erected adcp and the monitoring setup are shown in fig 6 in addition we set out automatic float out devices to observe the maximum scouring depth during flooding soil bricks and float out devices which the instruments were embedded inside a canister were alternately buried under the riverbed before the event each module was 22 cm in height when the sand bearing cans fall off due to scouring the float out device is affected by buoyancy which causes it to float to the water surface the movement of particles affects the transmission of the signal to the terminal as the float out device sends out signals to the receiver station a battery powers the device if the equipment is not washed out and still has electricity it can be reused during the next event a signal receiver station was built on the embankment which allowed real time monitoring of scour depths over the internet in addition a rough estimate of the flow velocity could be obtained by tracking the signal time as the float out devices became operational fig 7 a shows the configuration of the system for monitoring the float out devices the devices were buried every 0 11 m below a soil can when the floods wash away the sand surrounding the float out devices the real time signal is captured as the devices float to the surface fig 7 b shows the construction of the in situ monitoring devices according to a prior field investigation and preliminary numerical simulation the spots with severe erosion were selected as in situ monitoring locations the investigation determined that the maximum flow velocity occurred at a concave bank along sections 28 to 29 of the fengshan creek therefore these sections 28 to 29 were chosen as the in situ site to set up the monitoring devices fig 8 shows the site a solar panel powered signal receiving station was built on the bank and a trolley and tracks were embedded in the embankment we installed the float out devices at locations a and b 11 m and 27 m away from the toe of the embankment a device was also buried at point c at the upstream concave bank away from the tracks information about the locations is presented in table 4 4 in situ monitoring modeling discussion 4 1 model calibration and in situ monitoring this study selected typhoon dujuan sep 27 30 2015 as an example to verify the proposed multiple downscaling simulations this study used a processor of intel r core tm i5 6200u cpu 2 30 ghz 2 40 ghz to implement the simulations measurement data from the gauge station at xinpu bridge located on section no 30 were examined for calibration fig 9 presents the simulation results obtained with wash123d srh 2d and cche3d respectively compared to the observation records we used digital elevation model dem data with a 5 m by 5 m quadrilateral mesh grid a manning s coefficient of 0 035 to 0 040 and a calculation time interval of 1 sec in the simulation the srhd 2d and cche3d simulation results for the flow peak and the overall hydrographic results agree well with the observations the quantitative comparisons of root mean square errors rmse between observations and wash123d srhd 2d and cche3d simulations are 0 36 0 18 and 0 27 respectively moreover the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is 0 74 0 93 and 0 85 the comparisons also show that the simulated and real peak times coincide with the three individual model simulations with a maximum peak error of underestimating 0 42 0 41 and 0 65 m the maximum surface velocity calculated by the cche3d mobile bed model was around 4 08 m s which is consistent with the measured flow velocity e g between 3 47 and 5 90 m s of significant rivers in taiwan during a typhoon lai and wu 2013 yeh et al 2015 su and lu 2013 su and yang 2017 in conclusion the results of multiple downscaling simulations whether the simulated trend or the peak hydrograph values are highly credible moreover individual 3 d simulations cche3d from cross sections of no 27 34 cost 201 min of calculation time on the other hand the multiple downscaling simulations took 42 min the results show that using multiple simulations reduces the computational burden and preserves the hydraulic characteristics of wave transport 4 2 verification of velocity between simulations and in situ monitoring several extreme rainfall events have occurred since the site was built in june 2018 see table 5 on 18 july 2018 as fengshan creek was impacted by typhoon maria 2018 the highest water level monitored at the xinpu bridge gauge station was 43 05 m on 25 august 2018 heavy rain occurred in this area and the water level reached 43 30 m following another meiyu event in april 2019 the water level reached 42 96 m the water level of these three events exceeded the official level 3 alert benchmark 42 5 m but was still below the level 2 alert 44 4 m level no float out devices were swept away by the flood the results demonstrated that riverbed scouring was minor less than 22 cm however heavy rain on 17 may 2019 resulted in a higher water level of 44 09 m almost reaching the level 2 alert level more importantly a float out device was triggered and washed away at location b the results of multiple downscaling simulations for typhoon maria 2018 revealed good agreement with the xinpu bridge observations as shown in fig 10 a where the black line indicates the simulated water stage for wash123d srh2d and the cche3d coupling system and the blue crosses represent the measured values the errors of observed water stage and multiple downscaling simulations are 0 19 m in rmse and 0 89 in nse besides the simulated flow peak hits the measured peak time but a maximum peak error of underestimating 0 31 m fig 10 b presents the in situ monitoring results from the adcp location because the adcp instrument only functions when submerged underwater it only recorded measurements from 06 00 to 08 15 on 11 july due to the restriction of the water stage the data output was every 15 min for a total of 9 recorded datasets the multiple downscaling simulations of the water stage shown in fig 10 b reveal almost identical to the measured data the simulated flow peak reached its maximum at 07 15 on 11 july which coincided with the measurement results a comparison of the simulated cross sectional flow velocity with the adcp monitoring results for the period from 6 00 to 8 00 on 11 july is shown in fig 11 the simulation results reveal a maximum flow velocity of 4 03 m s slightly higher than the field observation of 2 78 m s it turns out that the flow conditions on site are quite chaotic so the actual flow velocity is not as high as the model simulation the monitoring results reveal the velocity distribution to be higher in the middle part of the river and lower on both the right and left banks there is some interference because of signal decay for the left bank with the lower velocity there was consistency with the in situ monitoring results with the high velocity flow centered in the middle of the river and velocity distribution was similar the highest flood peak value was obtained between 08 05 08 10 on 11 july the maximum velocity occurred slightly behind the flow peak related to taiwan s riverbeds being vulnerable to erosion in short the above results confirm that the multiple downscaling simulations are feasible and can successfully capture the fluvial mechanism in the channel the simulation results for water depth and scouring are shown in fig 12 the amount of scoring at point a is almost 50 cm as shown in fig 12 a however there was no float out device to be activated at this time the simulation revealed relatively more severe scouring than the in situ monitoring at location a fig 12 b and 12 c show the simulation results for points b and c respectively at these two points the simulation results reveal minor scouring which agrees with the observations scouring of the riverbed occurred at the toe of the embankment where the adcp was installed from 11 july around 5 30 fig 12 d reaching the maximum depth around 10 15 then the erosion tended to stabilize the overall scouring depth was less than 10 cm indicative of slight erosion at the toe that also agrees with observations in brief riverbed scouring was shown to be minor in this case both the overall simulation and in situ monitoring obtained acceptable results considering the overall stream scale the simulation modeled scouring process coincides with in situ monitoring in the above case furthermore the multiple downscaling simulations spent 28 min to finish the calculation superior to individual 3 d model calculation time 106 min implying a balance between simulation accuracy and computational cost is achieved the study found that erosion was usually generated at peak times and then triggered more obvious down scouring during flood recession the results suggest that severe scouring occurred because of the effects of hysteresis and bottom shear stress which lowered the flow velocity along the river and then generated a stronger down erosive kinetic energy during the recession period that usually happens when the bottom bed of the river has been more disturbed and inevitably produces more severe scouring in actuality that phenomenon is often observed in taiwan s turbid rivers 4 3 verification of scouring by comparison between the simulations and in situ monitoring later the site successively faced a tropical cyclone 2018 08 25 and a meiyu event 2019 04 29 although the events induced level 3 water level warnings at the xinpu bridge 42 5 m none of the float out devices were triggered the multiple downscaling simulation results also revealed slight scouring and silting of the riverbed however no apparent erosion was generated at the footing due to the slow velocity of flow on the concave side of the channel the simulation implied that the erosion was shallower than the buried position of the first float out device less than 22 cm which was consistent with the observational results then a heavy rainfall event on 17 may 2019 resulted in the water level reaching 44 09 m at the xinpu bridge close to a level 2 alert this was the highest water level recorded since the construction of our monitoring station additionally in situ monitoring revealed a severe erosion occurred at location b because riverbed scouring triggered a float out device however in this event due to the effects of floating stones and branches the adcp did not measure valid data for water depth and cross section velocity therefore a comparison was made using xinpu bridge gauge station data again the multiple downscaling simulations showed a superior computational consumption to individual 3 d model calculations 19 vs 48 min fig 13 shows the results of multiple downscaling simulations and observations at the xinpu bridge in which rmse is 0 29 m and nse is 0 91 the simulated flow peak 43 91 m was close to the gauge measurement 44 09 m and the peak time was around 11 00 which coincided with the observations the result indicates that the multiple downscaling simulations are able to obtain good agreement as to the water stage fig 14 presents the scouring at location b the bottom of riverbed was 37 60 m highest water level was 39 70 m at noon and the highest velocity predicted by multiple downscaling simulations was 5 33 m s at 11 00 the figure also shows that the scouring at location b started at 11 00 am and reached equivalence approximately 37 30 m around 3 00 pm after which the erosion tended towards stability in terms of the monitoring results a float out device was washed away at 11 21 this means that the float out device was triggered around the flood peak and that down scouring continued during the falling limb field measurements of the sediment load and riverbed scouring from 2003 to 2013 in taiwan su and lu 2016 indicate that the potential for riverbed scouring in the bimodal gravel bed reach is high during the fast rising stage of a large flood by contrast the scouring rate is typically lower in the unimodal sand bed reach with its higher suspended load although it is still higher than in a perennial river furthermore the collision of particles is intensified with an increase in the turbidity of the water flow this flow conditions tend to change the critical shear stress on the riverbed during flooding which was more likely to increase the scouring as demonstrated by the occurrence of maximum scouring after the flood peak in addition short term general scouring such as due to a typhoon usually occurs in the river during the rising limb of a flood due to the transitory sediment imbalance and the steep slope gradient in taiwan su and lu 2013 therefore based on the results of this study it can be deduced that the occurrence of severe scouring is relevant to the effect of hysteresis at the beginning of the falling limb flash flood induced flow velocity was slightly lowered along the river generating a more substantial erosive kinetic energy when the high velocity tends to exceed the critical shear stress on the bottom of the riverbed to conclude the fast flowing rivers in taiwan often contain much sand and demonstrate notable erosion and deposition behaviors based on a comparison of modeling and in situ monitoring results it can be seen that multiple downscaling simulations successfully captured the characteristics of the hydraulics such as the water depth flow velocity and even erosion this method maintains the accuracy of a more extensive simulation but sharply reduces the computational resource and time 5 conclusion overall the complex behaviors of the scouring process and sediment transport leading to severe erosion of the riverbeds in taiwan can be studies using multiple downscaling simulations and continuous in situ monitoring multiple downscaling simulations were conducted starting from a rainfall runoff model with a regional scale which were eventually downscaled to 3d reach scale mobile bed modeling we applied hec hms to simulate the watershed scale hydrologic process wash123d to implement the hydraulic routing and srh 2d and cche3d for local mobile bed simulations this method not only maintains the simulation accuracy but sharply reduces the computational resources and time needed in addition automatic monitoring through the use of float out devices and in situ velocity monitoring was carried out in situ monitoring by adcp utilized a trolley and tracks to estimate the scouring depth and the flow velocity the simulation results were validated by comparison with continuous monitoring data in a case study the results indicated that the collision of particles intensified with an increase in the turbidity of the water flow this is because the critical shear stress on the riverbed changes with the passage of the flood this is why the observations from field monitoring indicate that the maximum scouring occurred after the flood peak the methods presented in the study can be taken as a reference for further research on automatic monitoring in addition combining simulation and field monitoring data is beneficial for the assessment of riverbed scouring credit authorship contribution statement wei cheng lo

3290,the rivers in taiwan are fast flowing with high discharge rates especially following heavy rain thus riverbeds suffer from severe erosion during the typhoon season and sometimes flash floods caused by the rapid rising of the river stage and massive sediment yield such events can not only damage hydraulic structures and people s property but can even lead to the loss of human life to further understand the scouring problem in taiwan the study utilizes multiple downscaling simulations with continuous in situ monitoring to assess riverbed scouring first the hec hms hydrologic modeling system is used to simulate the runoff on the watershed scale then the wash123d model is utilized to understand hydraulic routing on the river scale finally the srh 2d and cche3d mobile bed models are applied to simulate the local scouring of the riverbed on a local scale in situ monitoring at fengshan creek in taiwan started in june 2018 including the installation of the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp and float out devices in the riverbed here numerical simulations are integrated with field monitoring to study local scouring the results reveal consistency between the adcp and float out device monitoring results for water level flow velocity and scouring depth with the multiple downscaling simulations furthermore this study found that most erosion was generated at peak times and that more obvious down scouring occurred during flood recession when the lessening of the flow velocity along the river generated a more substantial down erosive kinetic energy that usually happens in the turbid rivers in taiwan when the riverbed has been severely disturbed inevitably resulting in severe scouring the study also confirms that multiple downscaling simulations can dramatically reduce the computational resources needed while effectively maintaining simulation accuracy in addition integrating numerical simulations with field monitoring is an effective way to evaluate riverbed erosion keywords multiple downscaling simulations wash123d srh 2d cche3d acoustic doppler current profiler float out devices 1 introduction in recent years with global climate change natural disasters have occurred more frequently in taiwan according to world bank annual report gagnet 2005 taiwan is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to natural hazards the report also points out that more than 90 of the population in taiwan face the threat of at least two natural disasters and as much as 73 of the population face more than three kinds one of the most destructive examples is typhoon morakot which made landfall in taiwan in 2009 it brought more than 3 000 mm of rainfall in less than 4 days lee et al 2011 leading to landslides in 12 697 regions with a cumulative area of 183 1 km2 wu et al 2011 the deaths of 652 people and 47 reported missing lin et al 2011 taiwan is an island surrounded by ocean situated in the monsoon region of the western pacific it received about 80 of its annual average 2 500 mm of precipitation from may to october however the rainfall s uneven temporal and spatial distribution ends up causing both water shortages and floods alternating between the two in addition taiwan s location on several seismically active plate boundaries has produced its rugged topography steep slopes and short fast moving rivers almost 70 of the land area consists of hills and mountains over 100 m in height thus the water level in rivers often rises to dangerous levels very rapidly resulting in scouring problems when a typhoon hits local scouring caused by sediment transport can lead to catastrophic damage to in river structures and general scouring may also bring about excessive river meandering and dike collapse problems with the increasing computational power of computers in recent years it has become common to use them to assess sediment yield problems one dimensional 1 d steady flow models such as hec 6 usace 1993 and sedicoup holly and rahuel 1990a b using energy equations for hydraulics routing are allowing the assessment of long term general scouring and sediment problems the hydrodynamic 1 d models such as cche1d wu and vieira 2002 and telemac 1d goutal and maurel 2002 are used to simulate unsteady flows and transient sediments two dimensional 2 d conceptual models e g netstars lee et al 1996 and gstars molinas and yang 1986 have been developed for the analysis of the variation in general scouring and sedimentation with uneven horizontal flows other widely used 2 d dynamic wave models have applied the shallow water equations for modeling these include rma 2 usace 1996 srh 2d lai 2008 telemac 2d jones and davies 2005 bri√®re et al 2007 and cche2d jia and wang 2001 the models aimed at describing fluvial behavior along the transverse direction have demonstrated high value in practical applications for understanding scouring across channels the limitations of the above models can be easily improved upon by three dimensional 3 d modeling using the conservation of mass navier stokes equations and physical transport equations to simulate the mobile beds with a free surface such as srh 3d lai and wu 2019 cche3d jia et al 2013 and telemac 3d smolders et al 2016 three dimensional models can effectively handle the vertical velocity component and secondary flows and are more than adequate to simulate the overall features of fluvial sediment transport in rivers although the three dimensional models can describe water flow and sediment transport more accurately they often require more complicated inputs longer calculation times and higher computational resources which limits their applications during the past decade the taiwan water resources planning institute cooperated with the us bureau of reclamation usbr and the national center for computational hydroscience and engineering cche to introduce their models srh 2d and cche2d to taiwan to apply to many local rivers wang 2010 applied srh 2d to model the scenario where the no 1 chijiawan check dam in southern taiwan is removed they also used in situ measurement data to evaluate the applicability of the modeling lai and wu 2013 applied the srh 2d model to the complicated reaches of the zhuoshui river and carried out calibration and verification for up to 7 years based on actual measurement data the simulation results showed that the locations of significant erosion and deposition and the trend of the scouring had been successfully captured lee et al 2018 applied srh 2d to simulate general scouring around minchu bridge on the zhuoshui river the modeling results indicated the depth of local scouring and deposition behavior in this gravel bed river afterward to improve the local application of srh 2d yeh et al 2015 added an empirical formula especially for taiwan to the srh 2d model to estimate general scouring cche2d is another tool generally used for simulating sediment transport and the scouring problem in taiwan for instance lee 2012 applied the model to study the effects of the failure of the barlin dam and the removal of qijiawan river dam through analysis of their hydraulic properties and sediment transport lu 2012 used cche2d to discuss the general scouring problem related to the shigang dam one of the most controversial issues in taiwan chiue 2013 analyzed and proposed sediment dredging in the lai she river in pingtung county taiwan chao et al 2015 discussed local scouring near the bridge over the gaoping river caused by extreme climatic events finally jia et al 2005 utilized a 3 d simulation to analyze the effects of submerged weirs in the backflow zone on the functionality of hydraulic structures it can be seen from the above that a model s applicability depends on the characteristics of the simulated area adopting an appropriate empirical scouring formula is essential to obtaining good simulation results and the most challenging aspect is the need for extensive local in situ measurement data as input for the mathematical regression chang et al 2014 integrated monitoring devices installed on a bridge deck and piers to build an intelligent sensor network they proposed using four kinds of monitoring systems to conduct real time monitoring of the water level local scouring depth and daily safety situation su and lu 2013 and hsu 2016 utilized numbered erosion devices set up near the target bridge piers before floods to monitor local scouring data on the maximum scouring depth after floods is obtained from the remaining numbered devices the water resources agency wra of taiwan has conducted a specialized monitoring plan of local scours on the dajia and zhuoshui rivers in central taiwan since 2013 the devices in the rivers successfully monitored dynamic scouring during typhoon nesat in 2017 su and yang 2017 used wireless floating devices to monitor the local scour depth in real time during typhoons lee et al 2018 developed a globular metal flood monitoring device for watching acceleration response affected by water flow this study tries to address the riverbed scouring problem by integrating multiple down scaling simulations with continuous in situ monitoring first we conducted a downscaling simulation from the watershed scale to the scale of local channels with various models then verified the simulation results with field monitoring experiments using acoustic doppler current profiler adcp float out devices finally the results are discussed in greater detail below 2 multiple downscaling simulations although one might obtain more accurate results with a whole 3 d mobile bed simulation it is also costly and time consuming therefore we linked various dimensional models to conduct hydraulic simulations to find the balance between simulation accuracy and computational cost the simulation strategy is to implement the catchment runoff calculation which is then downscaled to local 3 d mobile bed modeling as illustrated in fig 1 firstly the hec hms model usace 2008 usace 2010 is used to estimate rainfall runoff over the entire watershed scale the wash123d shih and yeh 2018 is then employed to conduct hydraulic routing on the river scale in which the hec hms estimated runoffs comprise the upstream inflow next srh 2d is applied to simulate the lower reaches with the wash123d modeling results adopted as the boundary conditions for the upstream discharge and downstream depth after that a cche3d mobile bed model is utilized for a local 3 d mobile bed simulation based on the inputs from the srh 2d rainfall induced surface runoff obtained from the hec hms model developed by the hydrologic engineering center us army corps of engineering usace 2000 usace 2008 is applied three major modules are included in the hec hms routing the basin meteorological and control specification modules usace 2000 first the soil conservation service scs curve number cn method calculates the sub basin loss in the basin module then the initial loss cn value and impervious percentage parameters are evaluated based on the land use types in the study area next the scs unit hydrograph method is applied to calculate sub basin routings using data from historical records to calculate the discharge lag time for the meteorological module the hec hms provides multiple options to obtain the regional rainfall distribution finally the rainfall station weighting method is adopted to determine the areal weights for various sub watersheds based on the thiessen polygons method therefore the hec hms is applied to simulate the runoff and its results are for the subsequent channel routing for the hydrodynamic model this study used wash123d shih and yeh 2018 for river routing which the governing equation of the model based on the mass and momentum equilibrium expressed as 1 a t q x s i 2 v t v v t g h x g s 0 s f 0 where t is time x represents the axis along the flow direction g is gravity a is the cross sectional area of the river stream v and q are velocity and flow rate of the river respectively s i is the source sink terms h is water depth s 0 and s f are the slope of elevation and energy respectively wash123d uses the lagrangian eulerian formulation to solve the above equations over unstructured finite element meshes thus eqs 1 and 2 is further rearranged as 3 d v c v œâ d œÑ k v s 4 d v c v œâ d œÑ k v s where k and k are decay coefficient of the positive and negative gravity wave respectively s are source sink terms of the positive and negative wave and k k s and s can be expressed as 5 k g bc a x k g bc a x s s g z o x where z 0 is the bottom elevation a is a function of water depth h x t and the axis along river direction x and b a h is the top width of the cross section next eqs 3 and 4 are combined along their respective characteristic lines from x i the coordinate of node i at the new time level to x i 1 and x i 2 with a backward track the x i 1 and x i 2 are the location of a fictitious particle tracked backward from x i along the first and second characteristics respectively more details of calculation can be referred to the shih and yeh 2018 the governing equation of srh 2d holds the assumption of the above 1 d derivation except for two momentum equations along the x and y directions are applied to assume the flows are relatively shallow and neglect the effects of vertical motions hence 2 d depth averaged saint venant equations are 6 h t h u x u v x 0 7 h u t h u u x h v u y h t xx x h t xy y g h z x œÑ bx œÅ d xx d xy 8 h v t

adaptation length which can be obtained by experimental data for sediment sizes greimann et al 2008 z b riverbed elevation which is affected by the scouring and sediment thus z b k can be calculated by the following equation 11 Œ∑ ak z b k t v k srh 2d is solved by the finite volume numerical method and utilized unstructured grids with implicit algorithms for dealing with dry wet mesh in addition the segregated calculation for a free surface is applied in srh 2d thus eq 9 can be further discretized as 12 h c k int h c k m Œ¥ t cos Œ± k Œ≤ k v t h c k int x cos Œ± k Œ≤ k v t h h c k int y x f k

initial value problem in eq 13 is solved analytically to obtain the solution at next time level t m 1 then the cche3d developed by national center for computational hydroscience and engineering ncche is used for 3 d calculation of sediment transport the model simulates free surface turbulent flows with finite elements and the process of non uniform sediment transport can differentiate varied

sediment concentration exists a simple proportional relation with depth averaged sediment concentration in addition the adaptation coefficient affects many factors such as sedimentation velocity turbulence bedforms and section forms during sediment transport therefore these parameters rely on further adjustment during application 3 study site and modeling configurations 3 1 study site the fengshan creek basin in northern taiwan was selected as the study site the hsinchu science park the first and most important science park in taiwan is also located there flood mitigation is particularly crucial in this region because of the many semiconductor factories in the park the catchment area of fengshan creek is 250 1 km2 it originates from najie mountain at an altitude of 1 320 m the mainstream is approximately 45 45 km2 long and the longitudinal profile of the river is about 1 250 its surface elevation and terrain slope are sketched in fig 2 a and b fig 2 c illustrates land usage in the fengshan creek basin which is mainly occupied by forestry lands with the agricultural and industrial areas located in the downstream watershed the map is provided by the national land surveying and mapping center ministry of interior taiwan nlsc in addition there are 2 official rainfall stations 1 flow station and 5 groundwater stations at the site as shown in fig 2 d the study area has a temperate climate with an average temperature of 23 c based on historical statistics from these monitoring stations the average annual rainfall is 1 608 mm with 167 rainy days precipitation mainly falls from july to september during the typhoon and monsoon seasons the annual base flow is 9 81 m3 s according to over 50 years of stream gauge statistics the maximum flow rate during typhoon toraji in 2001 was 3 860 m3 s and the annual runoff in this basin is 376 million tons 3 2 modeling configuration a multiple downscaling simulation procedure was applied to alleviate the computational burden while preserving the accuracy of a mobile bed simulation for estimation of the rainfall induced runoff we used the hec hms module parameters based on fengshan creek basin data to precisely estimate rainfall runoff for the fengshan creek the basin was divided into 10 sub catchment areas as shown in fig 3 the soil conservation service scs unit hydrograph method was adopted to implement the sub basin routing in the basin model the parameters for the initial loss basin length average slope impervious land cover rate and lag time were set based on basin geography as listed in table 1 the rainfall runoff from the hec hms calculation was used as the input for wash123d to conduct 1 d hydraulic routing according to the in situ cross sectional investigation a total of 82 cross sections were adopted for channel routing the manning roughness coefficient value of each river cross section is shown in table 2 the 2nd river management office water resources agency wra 2014 among the 82 cross sections of fengshan creek no 27 34 were selected for the mobile bed simulation the latest land cover map completed at the beginning of 2018 using unmanned aerial vehicles uav of the middle reaches of the fengshan creek is used in this study as shown in fig 4 a the aerial uav photos were applied to show the roughness of the channels and for vegetation classification the 2 d mobile bed simulation was conducted using the srh 2d model in which the mesh grid using 1 m elevation data interpolated to produce a quadrilateral mesh grid size of around 5 m the modeling range cross sections of fengshan creek no 27 34 and surface altitude are illustrated in fig 4 b where wash123d simulations provide the upstream inflow and downstream stage boundary conditions then data from in situ monitoring conducted at the river bend between sections 29 30 was supplemented with the 3 d mobile bed simulation results calculated by cche3d the boundary and initial conditions of cche3d were based on the results of the srh 2d s simulation the grid construction is shown in fig 4 c more details show in fig 5 to illustrate the computational domain of the multiple downscaling models examined in this study regarding the settings of mobile bed simulations the specific gravity of the soil grains in the mobile bed model for sediment transport calculation is 2 65 the grain sampling data are based on the official grain size accumulation and distribution curves of the 2nd river management office wra 2014 table 3 lists the particle size survey retrieved from the report where the particle samples numbered ha15 ha16 and ha17 were gathered from cross sections 28 30 and 32 respectively on the fengshan creek study sites the average particle diameter was around 56 3 mm 56 5 mm which produces a low suspended load transport rate in this simulation range thus the calculation for the mobile bed simulation is mainly based on the bedload since there are no sediment yield records for the middle reaches of fengshan creek this study used the non equilibrium srh 2d sediment transport model to estimate the bed material load of sediment inflows the study applied blench s formula 1969 to calculate the average erodible depth for the section the value was 4 83 m and assumed uniformly distributed vertically in addition we adopted the setting from following some local applications wang 2010 lai and wu 2013 lee et al 2018a yeh et al 2015 which the parabolic equation in the turbulence model included a turbulence coefficient of 0 7 and active layer thickness of 1 0 m for the cche3d simulation the average river width was 36 m the mixing layer thickness was 0 1 m for a bed load of d50 and the layer thickness was 5 m based on the blench 1969 formulation of a 5 year recurrence interval with the in situ particle diameter and river width then the parabolic eddy viscosity model was adopted because of its stabilization and efficiency to examine the four layer turbulence model configuration in the simulation finally based on the above investigation and embedded sediment transport formula tests the empirical formulation of wu et al 2000 was adopted for the mobile bed simulation 3 3 in situ monitoring work in this study in situ monitoring was conducted to provide more detailed hydraulic data for the selected area the in situ monitoring spot was set around the middle downstream confluence between fengshan creek and xiaoli creek the embankments along these reaches have been severely affected by several typhoons and flash floods causing some inundation in low lying areas e g by typhoons nari 2001 matsa 2005 krosa 2007 sinlaku 2008 jangmi 2008 morakot 2009 and saola 2012 in addition there is a factory located on the left bank adjoining the drainage lines which needs to be protected from flood damage it is thus essential to improve our understanding of the hydraulic mechanisms in this area we utilized an acoustic doppler current profiler adcp to measure the fluid current during flooding the sl500 side looking doppler current meter sontek corporation was used to continuously measure flow level and the transient velocity profile of the channel the instrumental acoustic detection ranges of the horizontal and vertical beams are 1 4 and 3 8 degrees respectively delivering a horizontal sampling range from 1 5 m to 120 m velocity profiling for up to 10 cells can be detected with a maximum designed velocity range of 6 m s velocities we selected this instrument for use in this study because of its reliability lightweight and ease of mounting either on piers or shoreside without requiring divers or boats since the adcp must be mounted beneath the water surface to measure fluvial velocity we designed tracks installed on the embankment for a trolley to slide the adcp into the water the fluid velocity of the river was then monitored consecutively during typhoons a schematic diagram of the erected adcp and the monitoring setup are shown in fig 6 in addition we set out automatic float out devices to observe the maximum scouring depth during flooding soil bricks and float out devices which the instruments were embedded inside a canister were alternately buried under the riverbed before the event each module was 22 cm in height when the sand bearing cans fall off due to scouring the float out device is affected by buoyancy which causes it to float to the water surface the movement of particles affects the transmission of the signal to the terminal as the float out device sends out signals to the receiver station a battery powers the device if the equipment is not washed out and still has electricity it can be reused during the next event a signal receiver station was built on the embankment which allowed real time monitoring of scour depths over the internet in addition a rough estimate of the flow velocity could be obtained by tracking the signal time as the float out devices became operational fig 7 a shows the configuration of the system for monitoring the float out devices the devices were buried every 0 11 m below a soil can when the floods wash away the sand surrounding the float out devices the real time signal is captured as the devices float to the surface fig 7 b shows the construction of the in situ monitoring devices according to a prior field investigation and preliminary numerical simulation the spots with severe erosion were selected as in situ monitoring locations the investigation determined that the maximum flow velocity occurred at a concave bank along sections 28 to 29 of the fengshan creek therefore these sections 28 to 29 were chosen as the in situ site to set up the monitoring devices fig 8 shows the site a solar panel powered signal receiving station was built on the bank and a trolley and tracks were embedded in the embankment we installed the float out devices at locations a and b 11 m and 27 m away from the toe of the embankment a device was also buried at point c at the upstream concave bank away from the tracks information about the locations is presented in table 4 4 in situ monitoring modeling discussion 4 1 model calibration and in situ monitoring this study selected typhoon dujuan sep 27 30 2015 as an example to verify the proposed multiple downscaling simulations this study used a processor of intel r core tm i5 6200u cpu 2 30 ghz 2 40 ghz to implement the simulations measurement data from the gauge station at xinpu bridge located on section no 30 were examined for calibration fig 9 presents the simulation results obtained with wash123d srh 2d and cche3d respectively compared to the observation records we used digital elevation model dem data with a 5 m by 5 m quadrilateral mesh grid a manning s coefficient of 0 035 to 0 040 and a calculation time interval of 1 sec in the simulation the srhd 2d and cche3d simulation results for the flow peak and the overall hydrographic results agree well with the observations the quantitative comparisons of root mean square errors rmse between observations and wash123d srhd 2d and cche3d simulations are 0 36 0 18 and 0 27 respectively moreover the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse is 0 74 0 93 and 0 85 the comparisons also show that the simulated and real peak times coincide with the three individual model simulations with a maximum peak error of underestimating 0 42 0 41 and 0 65 m the maximum surface velocity calculated by the cche3d mobile bed model was around 4 08 m s which is consistent with the measured flow velocity e g between 3 47 and 5 90 m s of significant rivers in taiwan during a typhoon lai and wu 2013 yeh et al 2015 su and lu 2013 su and yang 2017 in conclusion the results of multiple downscaling simulations whether the simulated trend or the peak hydrograph values are highly credible moreover individual 3 d simulations cche3d from cross sections of no 27 34 cost 201 min of calculation time on the other hand the multiple downscaling simulations took 42 min the results show that using multiple simulations reduces the computational burden and preserves the hydraulic characteristics of wave transport 4 2 verification of velocity between simulations and in situ monitoring several extreme rainfall events have occurred since the site was built in june 2018 see table 5 on 18 july 2018 as fengshan creek was impacted by typhoon maria 2018 the highest water level monitored at the xinpu bridge gauge station was 43 05 m on 25 august 2018 heavy rain occurred in this area and the water level reached 43 30 m following another meiyu event in april 2019 the water level reached 42 96 m the water level of these three events exceeded the official level 3 alert benchmark 42 5 m but was still below the level 2 alert 44 4 m level no float out devices were swept away by the flood the results demonstrated that riverbed scouring was minor less than 22 cm however heavy rain on 17 may 2019 resulted in a higher water level of 44 09 m almost reaching the level 2 alert level more importantly a float out device was triggered and washed away at location b the results of multiple downscaling simulations for typhoon maria 2018 revealed good agreement with the xinpu bridge observations as shown in fig 10 a where the black line indicates the simulated water stage for wash123d srh2d and the cche3d coupling system and the blue crosses represent the measured values the errors of observed water stage and multiple downscaling simulations are 0 19 m in rmse and 0 89 in nse besides the simulated flow peak hits the measured peak time but a maximum peak error of underestimating 0 31 m fig 10 b presents the in situ monitoring results from the adcp location because the adcp instrument only functions when submerged underwater it only recorded measurements from 06 00 to 08 15 on 11 july due to the restriction of the water stage the data output was every 15 min for a total of 9 recorded datasets the multiple downscaling simulations of the water stage shown in fig 10 b reveal almost identical to the measured data the simulated flow peak reached its maximum at 07 15 on 11 july which coincided with the measurement results a comparison of the simulated cross sectional flow velocity with the adcp monitoring results for the period from 6 00 to 8 00 on 11 july is shown in fig 11 the simulation results reveal a maximum flow velocity of 4 03 m s slightly higher than the field observation of 2 78 m s it turns out that the flow conditions on site are quite chaotic so the actual flow velocity is not as high as the model simulation the monitoring results reveal the velocity distribution to be higher in the middle part of the river and lower on both the right and left banks there is some interference because of signal decay for the left bank with the lower velocity there was consistency with the in situ monitoring results with the high velocity flow centered in the middle of the river and velocity distribution was similar the highest flood peak value was obtained between 08 05 08 10 on 11 july the maximum velocity occurred slightly behind the flow peak related to taiwan s riverbeds being vulnerable to erosion in short the above results confirm that the multiple downscaling simulations are feasible and can successfully capture the fluvial mechanism in the channel the simulation results for water depth and scouring are shown in fig 12 the amount of scoring at point a is almost 50 cm as shown in fig 12 a however there was no float out device to be activated at this time the simulation revealed relatively more severe scouring than the in situ monitoring at location a fig 12 b and 12 c show the simulation results for points b and c respectively at these two points the simulation results reveal minor scouring which agrees with the observations scouring of the riverbed occurred at the toe of the embankment where the adcp was installed from 11 july around 5 30 fig 12 d reaching the maximum depth around 10 15 then the erosion tended to stabilize the overall scouring depth was less than 10 cm indicative of slight erosion at the toe that also agrees with observations in brief riverbed scouring was shown to be minor in this case both the overall simulation and in situ monitoring obtained acceptable results considering the overall stream scale the simulation modeled scouring process coincides with in situ monitoring in the above case furthermore the multiple downscaling simulations spent 28 min to finish the calculation superior to individual 3 d model calculation time 106 min implying a balance between simulation accuracy and computational cost is achieved the study found that erosion was usually generated at peak times and then triggered more obvious down scouring during flood recession the results suggest that severe scouring occurred because of the effects of hysteresis and bottom shear stress which lowered the flow velocity along the river and then generated a stronger down erosive kinetic energy during the recession period that usually happens when the bottom bed of the river has been more disturbed and inevitably produces more severe scouring in actuality that phenomenon is often observed in taiwan s turbid rivers 4 3 verification of scouring by comparison between the simulations and in situ monitoring later the site successively faced a tropical cyclone 2018 08 25 and a meiyu event 2019 04 29 although the events induced level 3 water level warnings at the xinpu bridge 42 5 m none of the float out devices were triggered the multiple downscaling simulation results also revealed slight scouring and silting of the riverbed however no apparent erosion was generated at the footing due to the slow velocity of flow on the concave side of the channel the simulation implied that the erosion was shallower than the buried position of the first float out device less than 22 cm which was consistent with the observational results then a heavy rainfall event on 17 may 2019 resulted in the water level reaching 44 09 m at the xinpu bridge close to a level 2 alert this was the highest water level recorded since the construction of our monitoring station additionally in situ monitoring revealed a severe erosion occurred at location b because riverbed scouring triggered a float out device however in this event due to the effects of floating stones and branches the adcp did not measure valid data for water depth and cross section velocity therefore a comparison was made using xinpu bridge gauge station data again the multiple downscaling simulations showed a superior computational consumption to individual 3 d model calculations 19 vs 48 min fig 13 shows the results of multiple downscaling simulations and observations at the xinpu bridge in which rmse is 0 29 m and nse is 0 91 the simulated flow peak 43 91 m was close to the gauge measurement 44 09 m and the peak time was around 11 00 which coincided with the observations the result indicates that the multiple downscaling simulations are able to obtain good agreement as to the water stage fig 14 presents the scouring at location b the bottom of riverbed was 37 60 m highest water level was 39 70 m at noon and the highest velocity predicted by multiple downscaling simulations was 5 33 m s at 11 00 the figure also shows that the scouring at location b started at 11 00 am and reached equivalence approximately 37 30 m around 3 00 pm after which the erosion tended towards stability in terms of the monitoring results a float out device was washed away at 11 21 this means that the float out device was triggered around the flood peak and that down scouring continued during the falling limb field measurements of the sediment load and riverbed scouring from 2003 to 2013 in taiwan su and lu 2016 indicate that the potential for riverbed scouring in the bimodal gravel bed reach is high during the fast rising stage of a large flood by contrast the scouring rate is typically lower in the unimodal sand bed reach with its higher suspended load although it is still higher than in a perennial river furthermore the collision of particles is intensified with an increase in the turbidity of the water flow this flow conditions tend to change the critical shear stress on the riverbed during flooding which was more likely to increase the scouring as demonstrated by the occurrence of maximum scouring after the flood peak in addition short term general scouring such as due to a typhoon usually occurs in the river during the rising limb of a flood due to the transitory sediment imbalance and the steep slope gradient in taiwan su and lu 2013 therefore based on the results of this study it can be deduced that the occurrence of severe scouring is relevant to the effect of hysteresis at the beginning of the falling limb flash flood induced flow velocity was slightly lowered along the river generating a more substantial erosive kinetic energy when the high velocity tends to exceed the critical shear stress on the bottom of the riverbed to conclude the fast flowing rivers in taiwan often contain much sand and demonstrate notable erosion and deposition behaviors based on a comparison of modeling and in situ monitoring results it can be seen that multiple downscaling simulations successfully captured the characteristics of the hydraulics such as the water depth flow velocity and even erosion this method maintains the accuracy of a more extensive simulation but sharply reduces the computational resource and time 5 conclusion overall the complex behaviors of the scouring process and sediment transport leading to severe erosion of the riverbeds in taiwan can be studies using multiple downscaling simulations and continuous in situ monitoring multiple downscaling simulations were conducted starting from a rainfall runoff model with a regional scale which were eventually downscaled to 3d reach scale mobile bed modeling we applied hec hms to simulate the watershed scale hydrologic process wash123d to implement the hydraulic routing and srh 2d and cche3d for local mobile bed simulations this method not only maintains the simulation accuracy but sharply reduces the computational resources and time needed in addition automatic monitoring through the use of float out devices and in situ velocity monitoring was carried out in situ monitoring by adcp utilized a trolley and tracks to estimate the scouring depth and the flow velocity the simulation results were validated by comparison with continuous monitoring data in a case study the results indicated that the collision of particles intensified with an increase in the turbidity of the water flow this is because the critical shear stress on the riverbed changes with the passage of the flood this is why the observations from field monitoring indicate that the maximum scouring occurred after the flood peak the methods presented in the study can be taken as a reference for further research on automatic monitoring in addition combining simulation and field monitoring data is beneficial for the assessment of riverbed scouring credit authorship contribution statement wei cheng lo

3291,for the wide distribution and huge amount of water a series of carbon related water rock interactions in groundwater recharge runoff and discharge have an important impact on the global carbon cycle however the current research on carbon cycle of groundwater mainly focuses on its emission to surface water there are few reports on the carbon balance of groundwater system hongjiannao basin was taken as an example in this paper the carbon balance equation of groundwater system was constructed by using mass balance principle and hydrogeochemical simulation method to analyze the carbon budget in groundwater the result showed that hongjiannao basin was a carbon sink with an annual carbon sink of 754 26 t 0 52 t km2 dissolution of dolomite and precipitation of calcite were the main hydrochemical reactions affecting carbon balance of groundwater hco3 in atmospheric precipitation and carbon dioxide co2 in vadose zone were the main sources of carbon in groundwater the co2 recharged by the vadose zone to groundwater was 1441 9 tons a most of them had hydration and ionization reactions with water artificial exploitation and runoff discharge were the main ways of carbon discharge from groundwater in this area carbon emissions from artificial exploitation reached 414 16 t a accounting for 58 of the total carbon emissions from runoff keywords groundwater carbon balance model water rock interaction carbon cycle dissolved inorganic carbon dic 1 introduction the increase of co2 concentration in atmosphere is one of the main causes of global warming and climate change huang et al 2015 wei et al 2020 prabir 2021 study on the circulation mechanism of co2 in atmosphere biosphere hydrosphere and lithosphere is necessary to reveal the global carbon cycle fang et al 2001 vinnarasi et al 2020 sadat noori et al 2021 among them surface water rivers and lakes is considered to make an important contribution to the increase of co2 concentration in atmosphere bastviken et al 2011 wehrli 2013 for example freshwater lakes account for only about 2 of the land area lehner and d√∂ll 2004 raymond et al 2013 yet they contribute around 10 of the total global co2 emissions to the atmosphere deng and chen 2011 groundwater is often regarded as an important carbon source for surface water xu et al 2021 sadat noori et al 2021 because groundwater discharges high concentrations of dissolved carbon into lakes and rivers some of which are converted into co2 and emitted into atmosphere nydahl et al 2020 xu et al 2021 in fact there are complex hydrogeochemical reactions in the process of groundwater flowing in rock pores many of which involve carbon fixation and emission vinnarasi et al 2020 liu et al 2020 generally weathering dissolution of carbonatite and silico aluminate in recharge area of groundwater consumes co2 from atmosphere and vadose zone decarbonization in discharge area will release co2 to atmosphere and surface water li et al 2018 dong et al 2020 many lakes and rivers are recharged by groundwater runoff so the carbon emission co2 dic from groundwater to surface water is the inevitable result of hydrological cycle deirmendjian and abril 2018 wang et al 2021 however for a complete groundwater system only by revealing the transformation and migration of carbon in the whole process of recharge runoff and discharge can we determine whether it is a carbon source or sink most of the earth s land surface is covered by shallow groundwater which is actively involved in the global water cycle it will have a series of water rock interactions with co2 in the atmosphere and soil and carbon content mineral such as calcite dolomite in water bearing medium jeong et al 2020 liu et al 2020 it is estimated that the amount of dic in groundwater in the form of hco3 reaches 0 2 0 36 pg c y on a global scale it can last as long as groundwater possibly hundreds to thousands of years nordt et al 2000 kessler and harvey 2001 especially in arid and semi arid regions dic non biological accumulation in groundwater plays an important role in regional and global carbon cycle li et al 2017 therefore it is particularly urgent to reveal the migration and transformation mechanism of carbon organic carbon inorganic carbon in groundwater establish the carbon balance equation of groundwater system and quantitatively calculate its role in the global carbon cycle 2 study area description hongjiannao basin is located at 109 42 110 54 e 39 13 39 27 n it s in the transition zone of loess plateau and inner mongolia plateau in the maowusu desert with an area

groundwater carbon the carbon balance in groundwater is to analyze how much carbon is absorbed and discharged by a groundwater system in a certain period of time the difference between the two is the

system the water rock interaction of groundwater flowing from the same recharge area to the same discharge area is similar zijl and el rawy 2020 the study area was divided to 6 calculation regions based on the recharge runoff discharge feature fig 1 combined with the groundwater flow path and the distribution of monitoring points a representative path was selected for water chemical reaction analysis in each zone using phreeqc to simulate the groundwater hydrochemical action between two adjacent points such as point n1 upstream point n2 downstream on each path and the carbon budget i per unit mass kg of groundwater was calculated the carbon budget of all groundwater participating in the reaction per unit time 1 year in the region represented by the two monitoring sites was then calculated in the inverse hydrogeochemical modeling a hydrochemical reaction occurred between the two sites during groundwater flow from n1 to n2 the actual velocity of groundwater was calculated by

is necessary to determine the mineral phase that may participate in the reaction the following two points were considered to select possible minerals 1 phreatic water in hongjiannao catchment is an open system with material exchange with atmosphere 2 the aquifer in this area is mainly composed of loose conglomerate and clasolite the main component is feldspar and carbonatite therefore albite potash feldspar anorthite calcite dolomite salt rock anhydrite fluorite and co2 g were selected as possible reaction mineral phases based on the characteristics of aquifer system and combined with the regional geological survey results using k na ca2 mg2 cl as constrained variables to balancing the charge number in the model the model uncertainty was set to 0 05 4 4 result 4 1 effect of hydrochemical reaction on dic in groundwater from the results of inverse hydrogeochemical modeling table 1 in different paths even in different sections of the same path the hydrochemical reactions of minerals were different to understand the effect of various mineral reactions on dic content in groundwater throughout the basin the dissolution and precipitation of minerals and the exchange of co2 between atmosphere and groundwater were calculated in one year in each path according to eq 10 and 11 table 2 the calculated results show that the total dissolved amount of dolomite albite and potassium feldspar in the whole basin was greater than the precipitation amount in one year tables 1 and 2 its net dissolved amount total dissolved amount total precipitation amount were 2455 1 t 196 9 t and 3 6 t respectively the precipitation amount of calcite and anorthite was larger than that of dissolution and the net precipitation amount were 2186 9 t and 116 5 t respectively groundwater absorbed 1441 9 t of co2 from atmosphere or vadose zone table 2 the total amount of carbon dioxide calculated by simulation is the final result of carbon dioxide consumption or generation in hydrochemical reaction accordingly cwi carbon increased by dolomite dissolution carbon removed by calcite precipitation carbon in atmospheric co2 recharge 12 the calculated result was that the amount of carbon in groundwater increased by water rock reaction is 451 05 t 4 2 effects of recharge and discharge on dic in groundwater the effects of groundwater runoff recharge or discharge precipitation and artificial exploitation on groundwater carbon balance were shown in table 4 in the recharge item the carbon amount of lateral recharge and irrigation were 388 04 t and 125 73 t respectively the precipitation was 502 76 t and the total amount was 1016 53 t evaporation discharged groundwater is not directly releasing dic therefore the main discharged pathway of dic is flowing into hongjiannao lake and manual exploitation according to statistics the groundwater exploitation in this area was only 776 81 104m3 a but the carbon emission reached 414 16 t a the carbon emission from groundwater to hongjiannao lake was 299 16 t a the total carbon emission of both was 713 32 t table 4 according to the water quality monitoring the dic contents of two water samples from the vadose zones in farmland were 180 9 mg l and 210 9 mg l respectively with an average value of 195 9 mg l it was 16 5 times of the atmospheric precipitation although the recharge of irrigation water to groundwater was far less than precipitation it also contributed a lot to dic because of the high content of dic in irrigation water 4 3 carbon balance of groundwater system based on the amount of carbon migration and transformation of each source and sink in the groundwater system the carbon balance of the basin was calculated to be 754 26 t according to eq 1 m r d s 1016 53 713 32 451 05 754 26 t overall the basin was a carbon sink with an annual carbon sequestration of about 754 26 t averaging about 0 52 t km2 5 discussion 5 1 water rock reaction chemical weathering in a groundwater basin is a key to understanding global climate change for a long term scale due to its association with carbon sequestration vinnarasi et al 2020 carbonatite is widely distributed on the earth s surface in the process of weathering co2 absorbed from atmosphere can be converted into hco3 and stored in water thus it becomes an important carbon sink for terrestrial ecosystems liu and zhao 2000 sba et al 2020 the co2 consumed by chemical weathering of feldspar minerals accounts for about 50 75 of the co2 consumed by global weathering berner et al 1983 the weathering dissolution of dolomite albite potassium feldspar and the precipitation of calcite and anorthosite mainly occurred in groundwater of hongjiannao basin co2 entering groundwater participated in the weathering and dissolution of dolomite albite potassium feldspar and other minerals the chemical equation for dissolution and precipitation of these minerals are wang 2014 dong et al 2020 13 camg co3 2 2co2 2h2o ca2 2mg2 4hco3 14 ca2 2hco3 caco3

dissolved 2 mol carbon was released from minerals into groundwater and 2 mol co2 was consumed l mol calcite precipitation 1 mol carbon was removed from groundwater and 1 mol co2 was discharged into atmosphere l mol anorthite precipitation 2 mol carbon was discharged into atmosphere from water l mol albite dissolution 1 mol co2 was consumed l mol potassium feldspar dissolved 2 3 mol co2 was consumed based on the above chemical reaction equation the carbon amount removed from water or absorbed from atmosphere by each mineral could be calculated table 3 according to table 3 the total net consumption of co2 in all reactions was 208 11 t much lower than 1441 90 t of net atmospheric vadose zone recharge to groundwater therefore a part of co2 entering groundwater from the vadose zone didn t participate in the weathering and dissolution of rocks it mainly participated in hydration and ionization with water increasing the hco3 concentration in groundwater eq 18 18 co2 h2o h2co3 h hco3 hydrogeochemical modeling is an important way to reveal water rock interaction mechanism ibrahim et al 2018 however how to select reasonable calculation results is a major test for researchers due to the multi solution of inverse hydrogeochemical modeling if there are many years of water quality monitoring data to test the calculation results in regional research it will be of great significance to ensure its accuracy in addition human activities may change the hydrochemical characteristics of regional groundwater in a short time it will also have a significant impact on the reliability of the simulation results dong et al 2020 5 2 hco3 in atmospheric precipitation and co2 recharge in vadose zone desert area is a part of terrestrial carbon sink and its co2 absorbed from atmosphere is about 100 g cm 2a 1 stone 2008 xie et al 2009 ma et al 2014 it is estimated that the global dic content of groundwater in desert areas is as high as 1000 pgc which plays an important role in terrestrial carbon cycle li et al 2015 hongjiannao basin is located in desert and the main recharge source of groundwater is atmospheric precipitation accounting for 95 of total recharge usually in the process of groundwater recharge by precipitation biochemical reaction will occur in the vadose zone due to the influence of soil properties which will change the chemical characteristics of recharge water szikszay et al 1990 makoto et al 2021 according to the monitoring the dic content of the four rainwater samples in the basin were 0 45 mg l 0 56 mg l 0 52 mg l 0 68 mg l the average was 0 55 mg l the dic content of the four vadose zone water samples in the basin were 12 7 mg l 9 8 mg l 13 5 mg l 11 6 mg l the average was 11 9 mg l the dic content in vadose zone water was significantly higher than that in rainwater it may be due to the higher concentration of co2 in vadose zone than that in atmosphere and part of co2 was dissolved in water ma et al 2014 the dic content in atmospheric precipitation and desert vadose zone water 11 9 mg l was lower than groundwater but atmospheric precipitation was the main recharge source of groundwater in this area it has become the main source of inorganic carbon in groundwater the difference between co2 partial pressure in groundwater and that in vadose zone determines the relationship and rate of co2 recharge and discharge between groundwater and vadose zone kut√≠lek 2003 for each groundwater sampling point the corresponding logarithm of carbon dioxide partial pressure log pco2 atm was obtained from eq 19 appelo and postma 1993 19 logpco2 atm log hco3 7 8 ph the partial pressure of co2 in groundwater in this area calculated by 43 groundwater samples was 26 671pa with an average of 241 pa usually the partial pressure of co2 in soil is about 1000pa much higher than that in atmosphere romero mujalli et al 2019 co2 in soil mainly comes from the respiration of plant roots and the decomposition of soil humus by microorganisms in summer with high temperature and heavy precipitation plant root respiration and microbial activities are strengthened resulting in a large amount of co2 and increasing soil pco2 low temperature and dry climate in winter reduce pco2 in soil li and li 2018 the vadose zone in hongjiannao basin is mainly composed of fine sand with sparse vegetation and low content of organic matter the partial pressure of co2 measured at four monitoring points in the area were 526 pa 632 pa 646 pa and 774 pa with an average of 664 5 pa the partial pressure of co2 in desert vadose zone was much higher than that in groundwater although it was lower than that in soil the co2 in vadose zone will continue to recharge to groundwater which becomes one of the main sources of carbon in groundwater among all recharge items atmospheric precipitation and vadose zone recharge were the main sources of dic in groundwater in this area precipitation mainly recharged carbon to groundwater in the form of hco3 and the atmosphere recharged carbon to groundwater in the form of co2 the change of precipitation will significantly affect the carbon balance of groundwater because precipitation is easily affected by climate and has large interannual variation 5 3 artificial exploitation and runoff discharge the runoff discharge of groundwater under natural conditions can be used as a hidden way to transport doc or dic to inland and aquatic system sadat noori et al 2016 lupon et al 2019 the runoff recharge of groundwater to rivers lakes is an important carbon source of surface water sadat noori et al 2021 wang et al 2021 hongjiannao lake is the final discharge area of groundwater in the whole basin carbon emission occurred mainly after groundwater flowed into lake due to environmental changes for example after groundwater enters the lake decarbonization occurs due to pressure reduction eq 20 which will emit co2 to atmosphere li et al 2018 the ph of lake water 9 in this area was higher than that of groundwater it led to precipitation reaction between ca2 mg2 which entering the lake with groundwater and hco3 and also emitted co2 to atmosphere eq 21 this is one of the reasons why groundwater is usually considered as an important carbon source of lakes deirmendjian and abril 2018 martinez cruz et al 2020 20 ca2 2hco3 caco3 h2o co2 21 mg2 2hco3 mgco3 h2o co2 in arid and semi arid areas groundwater is the main source of water for industry agriculture life and production scott and shah 2007 shah 2009 pumping out groundwater for irrigation will produce large amounts of greenhouse gas lal 2004 the research on groundwater exploitation by kaur et al showed that the increase of carbon emission from pumping was 0 019 t ha when groundwater level dropped one meter in punjab kaur et al 2016 in china the amount of co2 released by groundwater exploitation accounts for 61 of its total carbon emission to outside zou et al 2015 in the united states 1 7 mmt million metric tons of co2 is emitted into atmosphere every year due to the exploitation of groundwater wood and hyndman 2017 hongjiannao basin is a desert area with sparse population and small farmland distribution area the exploitation of groundwater is not the main way of discharging however as the carbon emission mode of groundwater exploitation belongs to runoff discharge a large amount of dic entered the surface environment with water its carbon emission accounted for 58 of the annual carbon emission of groundwater runoff in the basin the influence of precipitation and exploitation on groundwater carbon cycle has been in dynamic change li et al 2021 which will affect the accuracy of model the change of rainfall frequency and precipitation will affect the water and salt content in vadose zone resulting in the change of carbon amount recharged to groundwater wei et al 2021 the groundwater exploitation is affected by the change of climate industrial and agricultural production mode the exploitation of groundwater increases year by year in developed areas of industry and agriculture and the resulting carbon emission will also increase significantly kaur et al 2016 in general it s necessary to clarify the hydrogeochemical effects in groundwater and the effects of groundwater recharge runoff and discharge on carbon migration and transformation in the analysis of groundwater carbon balance the migration and transformation of carbon in groundwater has an important impact on the global carbon cycle due to its wide distribution and large amount of water the study on the carbon sequestration potential of groundwater surface coupling system in inland river and lake basin is of great significance to reveal the carbon cycle mechanism of terrestrial ecosystem 6 conclusion based on the mass balance principle and hydrogeochemical model the carbon balance equation of groundwater system was constructed and the carbon balance in groundwater in hongjiannao basin was calculated the result showed that the groundwater in the basin belonged to carbon sink rather than carbon source according to the inverse hydrogeochemical simulation results the main water rock interactions that obviously affected the groundwater carbon balance of watershed were the dissolution of dolomite and the precipitation of calcite the average carbon sequestration was about 0 52 t km2 and the total carbon sequestration was about 754 26 t in 2018 hco3 in atmospheric precipitation and co2 in vadose zone were the main recharge sources of carbon in groundwater in this area there are 1441 9 t of co2 that vadose zone recharged to groundwater however most of them had hydration and dissociation reactions with water and didn t participate in the weathering and dissolution of minerals artificial exploitation and runoff discharge were the main ways of carbon emission in groundwater in this area 414 16 t carbon were emitted by artificial exploitation accounting for 58 of the runoff carbon emission shallow groundwater exchanges carbon with external environment in many ways but there is a lack of data on its impact on the global carbon cycle we recommend quantifying the carbon migration and transformation in groundwater from the whole process of recharge runoff and discharge in basins or complete groundwater flow systems to better understand the role of groundwater in global carbon cycle this is of great significance for scientific and reasonable groundwater resource planning and management and effectively suppressing global warming in the future credit authorship

3291,for the wide distribution and huge amount of water a series of carbon related water rock interactions in groundwater recharge runoff and discharge have an important impact on the global carbon cycle however the current research on carbon cycle of groundwater mainly focuses on its emission to surface water there are few reports on the carbon balance of groundwater system hongjiannao basin was taken as an example in this paper the carbon balance equation of groundwater system was constructed by using mass balance principle and hydrogeochemical simulation method to analyze the carbon budget in groundwater the result showed that hongjiannao basin was a carbon sink with an annual carbon sink of 754 26 t 0 52 t km2 dissolution of dolomite and precipitation of calcite were the main hydrochemical reactions affecting carbon balance of groundwater hco3 in atmospheric precipitation and carbon dioxide co2 in vadose zone were the main sources of carbon in groundwater the co2 recharged by the vadose zone to groundwater was 1441 9 tons a most of them had hydration and ionization reactions with water artificial exploitation and runoff discharge were the main ways of carbon discharge from groundwater in this area carbon emissions from artificial exploitation reached 414 16 t a accounting for 58 of the total carbon emissions from runoff keywords groundwater carbon balance model water rock interaction carbon cycle dissolved inorganic carbon dic 1 introduction the increase of co2 concentration in atmosphere is one of the main causes of global warming and climate change huang et al 2015 wei et al 2020 prabir 2021 study on the circulation mechanism of co2 in atmosphere biosphere hydrosphere and lithosphere is necessary to reveal the global carbon cycle fang et al 2001 vinnarasi et al 2020 sadat noori et al 2021 among them surface water rivers and lakes is considered to make an important contribution to the increase of co2 concentration in atmosphere bastviken et al 2011 wehrli 2013 for example freshwater lakes account for only about 2 of the land area lehner and d√∂ll 2004 raymond et al 2013 yet they contribute around 10 of the total global co2 emissions to the atmosphere deng and chen 2011 groundwater is often regarded as an important carbon source for surface water xu et al 2021 sadat noori et al 2021 because groundwater discharges high concentrations of dissolved carbon into lakes and rivers some of which are converted into co2 and emitted into atmosphere nydahl et al 2020 xu et al 2021 in fact there are complex hydrogeochemical reactions in the process of groundwater flowing in rock pores many of which involve carbon fixation and emission vinnarasi et al 2020 liu et al 2020 generally weathering dissolution of carbonatite and silico aluminate in recharge area of groundwater consumes co2 from atmosphere and vadose zone decarbonization in discharge area will release co2 to atmosphere and surface water li et al 2018 dong et al 2020 many lakes and rivers are recharged by groundwater runoff so the carbon emission co2 dic from groundwater to surface water is the inevitable result of hydrological cycle deirmendjian and abril 2018 wang et al 2021 however for a complete groundwater system only by revealing the transformation and migration of carbon in the whole process of recharge runoff and discharge can we determine whether it is a carbon source or sink most of the earth s land surface is covered by shallow groundwater which is actively involved in the global water cycle it will have a series of water rock interactions with co2 in the atmosphere and soil and carbon content mineral such as calcite dolomite in water bearing medium jeong et al 2020 liu et al 2020 it is estimated that the amount of dic in groundwater in the form of hco3 reaches 0 2 0 36 pg c y on a global scale it can last as long as groundwater possibly hundreds to thousands of years nordt et al 2000 kessler and harvey 2001 especially in arid and semi arid regions dic non biological accumulation in groundwater plays an important role in regional and global carbon cycle li et al 2017 therefore it is particularly urgent to reveal the migration and transformation mechanism of carbon organic carbon inorganic carbon in groundwater establish the carbon balance equation of groundwater system and quantitatively calculate its role in the global carbon cycle 2 study area description hongjiannao basin is located at 109 42 110 54 e 39 13 39 27 n it s in the transition zone of loess plateau and inner mongolia plateau in the maowusu desert with an area

groundwater carbon the carbon balance in groundwater is to analyze how much carbon is absorbed and discharged by a groundwater system in a certain period of time the difference between the two is the

based on the recharge runoff discharge feature fig 1 combined with the groundwater flow path and the distribution of monitoring points a representative path was selected for water chemical reaction analysis in each zone using phreeqc to simulate the groundwater hydrochemical action between two adjacent points such as point n1 upstream point n2 downstream on each path and the carbon budget i per unit mass kg of groundwater was calculated the carbon budget of all groundwater participating in the reaction per unit time 1 year in the region represented by the two monitoring sites was then calculated in the inverse hydrogeochemical modeling a hydrochemical reaction occurred between the two sites during groundwater flow from n1 to n2 the actual velocity of groundwater was calculated by

is necessary to determine the mineral phase that may participate in the reaction the following two points were considered to select possible minerals 1 phreatic water in hongjiannao catchment is an open system with material exchange with atmosphere 2 the aquifer in this area is mainly composed of loose conglomerate and clasolite the main component is feldspar and carbonatite therefore albite potash feldspar anorthite calcite dolomite salt rock anhydrite fluorite and co2 g were selected as possible reaction mineral phases based on the characteristics of aquifer system and combined with the regional geological survey results using k na ca2 mg2 cl as constrained variables to balancing the charge number in the model the model uncertainty was set to 0 05 4 4 result 4 1 effect of hydrochemical reaction on dic in groundwater from the results of inverse hydrogeochemical modeling table 1 in different paths even in different sections of the same path the hydrochemical reactions of minerals were different to understand the effect of various mineral reactions on dic content in groundwater throughout the basin the dissolution and precipitation of minerals and the exchange of co2 between atmosphere and groundwater were calculated in one year in each path according to eq 10 and 11 table 2 the calculated results show that the total dissolved amount of dolomite albite and potassium feldspar in the whole basin was greater than the precipitation amount in one year tables 1 and 2 its net dissolved amount total dissolved amount total precipitation amount were 2455 1 t 196 9 t and 3 6 t respectively the precipitation amount of calcite and anorthite was larger than that of dissolution and the net precipitation amount were 2186 9 t and 116 5 t respectively groundwater absorbed 1441 9 t of co2 from atmosphere or vadose zone table 2 the total amount of carbon dioxide calculated by simulation is the final result of carbon dioxide consumption or generation in hydrochemical reaction accordingly cwi carbon increased by dolomite dissolution carbon removed by calcite precipitation carbon in atmospheric co2 recharge 12 the calculated result was that the amount of carbon in groundwater increased by water rock reaction is 451 05 t 4 2 effects of recharge and discharge on dic in groundwater the effects of groundwater runoff recharge or discharge precipitation and artificial exploitation on groundwater carbon balance were shown in table 4 in the recharge item the carbon amount of lateral recharge and irrigation were 388 04 t and 125 73 t respectively the precipitation was 502 76 t and the total amount was 1016 53 t evaporation discharged groundwater is not directly releasing dic therefore the main discharged pathway of dic is flowing into hongjiannao lake and manual exploitation according to statistics the groundwater exploitation in this area was only 776 81 104m3 a but the carbon emission reached 414 16 t a the carbon emission from groundwater to hongjiannao lake was 299 16 t a the total carbon emission of both was 713 32 t table 4 according to the water quality monitoring the dic contents of two water samples from the vadose zones in farmland were 180 9 mg l and 210 9 mg l respectively with an average value of 195 9 mg l it was 16 5 times of the atmospheric precipitation although the recharge of irrigation water to groundwater was far less than precipitation it also contributed a lot to dic because of the high content of dic in irrigation water 4 3 carbon balance of groundwater system based on the amount of carbon migration and transformation of each source and sink in the groundwater system the carbon balance of the basin was calculated to be 754 26 t according to eq 1 m r d s 1016 53 713 32 451 05 754 26 t overall the basin was a carbon sink with an annual carbon sequestration of about 754 26 t averaging about 0 52 t km2 5 discussion 5 1 water rock reaction chemical weathering in a groundwater basin is a key to understanding global climate change for a long term scale due to its association with carbon sequestration vinnarasi et al 2020 carbonatite is widely distributed on the earth s surface in the process of weathering co2 absorbed from atmosphere can be converted into hco3 and stored in water thus it becomes an important carbon sink for terrestrial ecosystems liu and zhao 2000 sba et al 2020 the co2 consumed by chemical weathering of feldspar minerals accounts for about 50 75 of the co2 consumed by global weathering berner et al 1983 the weathering dissolution of dolomite albite potassium feldspar and the precipitation of calcite and anorthosite mainly occurred in groundwater of hongjiannao basin co2 entering groundwater participated in the weathering and dissolution of dolomite albite potassium feldspar and other minerals the chemical equation for dissolution and precipitation of these minerals are wang 2014 dong et al 2020 13 camg co3 2 2co2 2h2o ca2 2mg2 4hco3 14 ca2 2hco3 caco3

dissolved 2 mol carbon was released from minerals into groundwater and 2 mol co2 was consumed l mol calcite precipitation 1 mol carbon was removed from groundwater and 1 mol co2 was discharged into atmosphere l mol anorthite precipitation 2 mol carbon was discharged into atmosphere from water l mol albite dissolution 1 mol co2 was consumed l mol potassium feldspar dissolved 2 3 mol co2 was consumed based on the above chemical reaction equation the carbon amount removed from water or absorbed from atmosphere by each mineral could be calculated table 3 according to table 3 the total net consumption of co2 in all reactions was 208 11 t much lower than 1441 90 t of net atmospheric vadose zone recharge to groundwater therefore a part of co2 entering groundwater from the vadose zone didn t participate in the weathering and dissolution of rocks it mainly participated in hydration and ionization with water increasing the hco3 concentration in groundwater eq 18 18 co2 h2o h2co3 h hco3 hydrogeochemical modeling is an important way to reveal water rock interaction mechanism ibrahim et al 2018 however how to select reasonable calculation results is a major test for researchers due to the multi solution of inverse hydrogeochemical modeling if there are many years of water quality monitoring data to test the calculation results in regional research it will be of great significance to ensure its accuracy in addition human activities may change the hydrochemical characteristics of regional groundwater in a short time it will also have a significant impact on the reliability of the simulation results dong et al 2020 5 2 hco3 in atmospheric precipitation and co2 recharge in vadose zone desert area is a part of terrestrial carbon sink and its co2 absorbed from atmosphere is about 100 g cm 2a 1 stone 2008 xie et al 2009 ma et al 2014 it is estimated that the global dic content of groundwater in desert areas is as high as 1000 pgc which plays an important role in terrestrial carbon cycle li et al 2015 hongjiannao basin is located in desert and the main recharge source of groundwater is atmospheric precipitation accounting for 95 of total recharge usually in the process of groundwater recharge by precipitation biochemical reaction will occur in the vadose zone due to the influence of soil properties which will change the chemical characteristics of recharge water szikszay et al 1990 makoto et al 2021 according to the monitoring the dic content of the four rainwater samples in the basin were 0 45 mg l 0 56 mg l 0 52 mg l 0 68 mg l the average was 0 55 mg l the dic content of the four vadose zone water samples in the basin were 12 7 mg l 9 8 mg l 13 5 mg l 11 6 mg l the average was 11 9 mg l the dic content in vadose zone water was significantly higher than that in rainwater it may be due to the higher concentration of co2 in vadose zone than that in atmosphere and part of co2 was dissolved in water ma et al 2014 the dic content in atmospheric precipitation and desert vadose zone water 11 9 mg l was lower than groundwater but atmospheric precipitation was the main recharge source of groundwater in this area it has become the main source of inorganic carbon in groundwater the difference between co2 partial pressure in groundwater and that in vadose zone determines the relationship and rate of co2 recharge and discharge between groundwater and vadose zone kut√≠lek 2003 for each groundwater sampling point the corresponding logarithm of carbon dioxide partial pressure log pco2 atm was obtained from eq 19 appelo and postma 1993 19 logpco2 atm log hco3 7 8 ph the partial pressure of co2 in groundwater in this area calculated by 43 groundwater samples was 26 671pa with an average of 241 pa usually the partial pressure of co2 in soil is about 1000pa much higher than that in atmosphere romero mujalli et al 2019 co2 in soil mainly comes from the respiration of plant roots and the decomposition of soil humus by microorganisms in summer with high temperature and heavy precipitation plant root respiration and microbial activities are strengthened resulting in a large amount of co2 and increasing soil pco2 low temperature and dry climate in winter reduce pco2 in soil li and li 2018 the vadose zone in hongjiannao basin is mainly composed of fine sand with sparse vegetation and low content of organic matter the partial pressure of co2 measured at four monitoring points in the area were 526 pa 632 pa 646 pa and 774 pa with an average of 664 5 pa the partial pressure of co2 in desert vadose zone was much higher than that in groundwater although it was lower than that in soil the co2 in vadose zone will continue to recharge to groundwater which becomes one of the main sources of carbon in groundwater among all recharge items atmospheric precipitation and vadose zone recharge were the main sources of dic in groundwater in this area precipitation mainly recharged carbon to groundwater in the form of hco3 and the atmosphere recharged carbon to groundwater in the form of co2 the change of precipitation will significantly affect the carbon balance of groundwater because precipitation is easily affected by climate and has large interannual variation 5 3 artificial exploitation and runoff discharge the runoff discharge of groundwater under natural conditions can be used as a hidden way to transport doc or dic to inland and aquatic system sadat noori et al 2016 lupon et al 2019 the runoff recharge of groundwater to rivers lakes is an important carbon source of surface water sadat noori et al 2021 wang et al 2021 hongjiannao lake is the final discharge area of groundwater in the whole basin carbon emission occurred mainly after groundwater flowed into lake due to environmental changes for example after groundwater enters the lake decarbonization occurs due to pressure reduction eq 20 which will emit co2 to atmosphere li et al 2018 the ph of lake water 9 in this area was higher than that of groundwater it led to precipitation reaction between ca2 mg2 which entering the lake with groundwater and hco3 and also emitted co2 to atmosphere eq 21 this is one of the reasons why groundwater is usually considered as an important carbon source of lakes deirmendjian and abril 2018 martinez cruz et al 2020 20 ca2 2hco3 caco3 h2o co2 21 mg2 2hco3 mgco3 h2o co2 in arid and semi

distribution area the exploitation of groundwater is not the main way of discharging however as the carbon emission mode of groundwater exploitation belongs to runoff discharge a large amount of dic entered the surface environment with water its carbon emission accounted for 58 of the annual carbon emission of groundwater runoff in the basin the influence of precipitation and exploitation on groundwater carbon cycle has been in dynamic change li et al 2021 which will affect the accuracy of model the change of rainfall frequency and precipitation will affect the water and salt content in vadose zone resulting in the change of carbon amount recharged to groundwater wei et al 2021 the groundwater exploitation is affected by the change of climate industrial and agricultural production mode the exploitation of groundwater increases year by year in developed areas of industry and agriculture and the resulting carbon emission will also increase significantly kaur et al 2016 in general it s necessary to clarify the hydrogeochemical effects in groundwater and the effects of groundwater recharge runoff and discharge on carbon migration and transformation in the analysis of groundwater

constant h is a radon air soil transfer coefficient in m s 1 background the transport equation of scalar quantities such as mass concentration appears in many engineering chemistry applied mathematics and physics applications among transport of scalar quantities is the transport of radon 222rn from the subsurface soils to the ground surface which is very important this is because of the major health hazardous such as lung cancer that may occur due to exposure to 222rn emanating from the deep soils into the ground surface and floor cracks of building basements radon 222rn is a natural radioactive gas invisible with no odour and no taste originating from the uranium 238u decay series in the outdoor environment activity concentration of radon is not considered a health risk because the radon that diffuses into the atmosphere normally disperses rapidly however accumulation of radon indoors gives rise to high radon activity concentration which can lead to health problems in the respiratory system fuente et al 2020 radon is identified as a carcinogen agent by the world health organization who considered the second greatest cause of lung cancer disease after smoking inhalation of the short lived alpha decay products of radon e g 218po and 214po is shown to induce pulmonary cell dna damage who 2009 although radon is natural elevated radon levels indoors are not natural but a direct consequence of the building practices the world average radon activity concentration in becquerels per cubic meter bq m3 in the outdoor environment is estimated between 5 and 15 bq m3 who 2016 however indoor radon activity concentrations vary widely depending on different factors such as the underlying geology water atmospheric conditions or the building type therefore levels of indoor radon vary widely both within countries and among countries with geometric mean activity concentrations of radon ranging from less than 10 bq m3 for middle east to more than 100 bq m3 for several european countries unscear 2006 in canada the average radon activity concentration of 96 bq m3 population weighted is more than double the worldwide average indoor radon activity concentration chen et al 2014 average indoor radon level is estimated globally as 39 bq m3 unscear 2006 in ireland the national average indoor radon activity concentration for residential buildings is 77 bq m3 unscear 2000 dowdall et al 2017 exposure to radon in homes is responsible for approximately 20 000 lung cancer deaths each year in the european union alone and in ireland it is responsible for 14 of all the lung cancer cases i e approximately 300 lung cancers every year nrcs 2019 usikalu et al 2020 found that in covenant university nigeria the mean radon activity concentration for glass house brick house and basement house are 14 96 10 74 and 144 61 bq m3 respectively glass house radon activity concentration range is from 11 03 to 17 46 bq m3 for bricks house structure the radon activity concentration measured ranges from 6 62 to 20 85 bq m3 basement structure radon activity concentration ranges from 15 75 to 614 52 bq m3 it was observed from the study that the mean radon activity concentration measured from the basement structure was above the recommended limit by a factor of 4 in addition among geochemical precursors radon gas in groundwater and soil is considered a notable precursor used to detect chemical and physical changes during the generation of earthquakes and volcanic events morales simfors et al 2019 the movement in soil of the mass concentration of 222rn is influenced by the diffusion advection decay and generation mechanisms it can be represented to a large extent by the one dimensional transport equation for 222rn in the vertical direction the solution of 222rn transport equation enables understanding how 222rn moves from the deep soil depths up to the ground surface how the radon influencing mechanisms are interacting which mechanism is dominating and how much 222rn flux is flowing into the ground surface such understanding and estimation of 222rn movement will aid in finding mitigation solutions to the problem of 222rn exposure this study deals with the use of analytical and finite element numerical modeling of the radon transport in soil to better understand soil radon profiles and radon exhalation rate from the soil into the open air with the ultimate goal of helping in the determination of the most effective radon mitigation solutions in dwellings the newly developed finite element model is called ferm 1d finite element radon modeling in one dimension the subject is very interesting and certainly faces a still open issue despite the long term efforts carried out by past researchers to reduce radon exposure to population the study recapitulates some existing models used to simulate radon transport describes individual mechanisms of radon transport in soils introduces a newly developed 1d steady state numerical model ferm 1d and compares the accuracy of this model with known analytical solutions and with field data the 222rn transport equation is solved herein while considering all the different influencing mechanisms of diffusion advection decay and generation the finite element fe method is the numerical method used to solve the transport equation to test the fe model the numerical solution is verified against the corresponding analytical solution under different conditions a field case study dealing with soil multilayer behavior is discussed to highlight the power of mathematical and numerical models for radon investigations several past researchers dealt with the phenomenon of radon transport in a theoretical fashion in which they compared their numerical models predictions to analytical solutions without substantiating their results or testing their models against field data examples of this type are the works of kohl et al 1994 andersen 2001 rabi and mohamad 2006 yakovleva and parovik 2010 savovic et al 2012 and ajayi et al 2018 font and baixeras 2003 and mu√±oz et al 2017 compared their models to radon experimental data but for soils without multi layer behavior and they focused on indoor radon calculation on the other hand hafez and awad 2016 compared their fe model with multi layer soil field data but without testing their model to the analytical solution of the radon differential transport equation in addition most of these studies presented merely the solution to the radon transport equation without making thorough or in depth analysis of the mechanics by which each mechanism is working kohl et al 1994 added a radioactive decay term to the finite element code fracture which was conceived for the simulation of forced fluid flow in fractured rocks however they verified their code to the steady state one dimensional radon transport analytical solution eq 12 hereinafter solved by telford 1983 they compared their numerical solutions to the analytical solution for three cases each with differently activated mechanisms diffusion advection decay diffusion advection and diffusion decay non zero radon surface soil boundary condition was used they then applied their model to a two dimensional 2d cylindrical building they considered five different material sets undisturbed underground compressed soil air in the building vegetable soil and wall foundation they found that the radon transport by advection and by diffusion strongly depends on the gas permeability of the underground however their finding which is very useful was not verified with experimental or field data andersen 1992 solved the 2d radon transport equation for a standard slab on grade house using the finite volume method non zero radon surface soil boundary condition was used similar to kohl et al 1994 later on andersen 2001 presented a graph between the radon entry rate versus soil permeability for the slab and the 3 mm gap between the slab and footer although this graph is useful in showing effect of house depressurization and permeability it was not substantiated by experimental or field data rabi and mohamad 2006 adapted an existing finite volume 2d computational simulator for heat and mass transfer to predict radon exhalation rates from a phosphogypsum stack into open air they found theoretically without experimental verification that natural convective effects on typical low permeability phosphogypsum stacks proved to be of minor importance as radon transfer becomes diffusion dominant yakovleva and parovik 2010 solved the steady and unsteady diffusion advection radon transport equation in many layered geological media by integro interpolation method the peculiarity of radon transport in many layered media is taken into account in the developed numerical model especially radium content they considered the unsteady calculations showing at what time moments the distribution curves of radon activity concentration coincide with the steady regime of radon transport and considered this as the validation step of their numerical model without testing with field data antonopoulos domis et al 2009 analytically solved the radon transport equation they assumed two layer soil model total soil depth was 2 6 m with two different diffusion advection characteristics but assumed zero radon activity concentration at the soil surface in the multi layer model they applied least squares fitting of their model analytical solutions to radon measured data they later used nonzero radon soil surface boundary condition but applied least squares fitting of their model analytical solution to one layer model depth was less than 1 3 m and obtained an equation for the radon activity concentration at the soil surface savovic et al 2012 solved the radon transport equation using the explicit finite difference method and compared their results in the same manner as in kohl et al 1994 to the analytical solution of telford 1983 given in eq 12 without comparison with experimental data they used the unrealistic zero radon activity concentration soil surface boundary condition ajayi et al 2018 used a discrete fracture network dfn model for prediction of radon flux from fractured rocks they obtained the radon fluxes at the ends of a single fractured element from the analytical solution of the radon diffusion advection decay generation transport equation eq 17 hereinafter which were assembled in the network model equation 17 is valid only for specified activity concentrations at the two ends indicating it does not accommodate flux or gradient boundary condition their work provides insight into radon transport through fractured rocks but unfortunately no experimental verification was made in a way similar to that of antonopoulos domis et al 2009 but using three soil layers orabi 2018 made curve fitting of the experimental data however zero radon surface boundary condition was used this precludes accurate calculation of the radon soil outward flux which is the quantity of primary interest in radon investigations in orabi 2018 eight 8 parameters were needed to be calculated using the experimental data this approach is limited to three soil layers where in general different number of layers other than three might exist bakaeva and kalaydo 2021 have shown that sealing the building underground shell with a clay soil which has permeability less than 10 12 m2 will cause the absence of the advective radon transport flux from the soil then they used a two dimensional diffusion model of radon transport in the medium system soil walling indoor air to describe radon transport thus under the conditions of the buildings underground shell tightness the radon soil transport through underground walling could be described by a stationary diffusion model however many existing buildings are not shell tight and temperature gradients will cause depressurization and consequently a significant radon advective transport muhammad and k√ºlahcƒ± 2022 proposed a novel boundary condition for estimation of surface radon activity concentration using recorded soil radon data at a given depth they expressed the surface radon boundary condition as the product of f t 1 Œ± where f t is the recorded radon activity concentration at the monitoring depth the function f t can also be expressed as a function which represents the radon time series variation at any given time t at the radon monitoring depth z and Œ± is the attenuation coefficient which represents the fraction of radon activity concentration lost in its journey to the crustal surface similar to the cases of antonopoulos domis et al 2009 and orabi 2018 this approach also depends on existence of detailed measured data that are often not available in this paper a new and optimised fe model ferm 1d is developed and tested with analytical models solutions under different conditions in addition to verification against field data for soils with multi layer behavior the interaction between the radon 222rn different mechanisms such as diffusion advection decay and generation is explained in details transport numbers are proposed that determine conditions under which each mechanism of diffusion advection decay and generation dominates a transport similarity concept is presented to show that different combination of mechanisms and model parameters can produce the same radon activity concentration profile moreover new prospective is presented to modeling soils with multi layer radon transport characteristics and behavior 2 a finite element model for222rn transport equation when considering the unsteady radon 222r influencing mechanisms from the deep soil depths upward vertically to the soil surface it can be represented in one dimension 1d as 1 c t x d c x v c x Œª c g where c is the activity concentration of 222rn in the pore air voids of the soil bq m3 t is time s x is the vertical distance measured from the ground surface downward m d is the 222rn diffusion coefficient m2 s v is the air advection velocity of radon transport m s usually vertically upward due to the pressure difference Œª is 222rn decay constant known to be 2 1 10 6 1 s and g is the generation of 222rn due to radium content in the soil bq m3 s the term on the left hand side of eq 1 represents the rate of change of 222rn with time at any distance x due to the interaction of the different mechanisms on the right hand side of the equation under steady state conditions this term is zero and throughout this study only steady conditions will be discussed radon activity concentration is considered only in the pore air voids so the model is valid only for dry soil conditions and the effect of soil moisture and pore water saturation are not considered herein the first term on the right hand side of eq 1 is the transport of 222rn due to molecular diffusion caused by the existence of the activity concentration difference between the large radon activity concentration at the deep soil depth and the relatively small radon activity concentration at the ground surface the second term is the advective transport of radon due to a pressure gradient that drives an air flow with a velocity v given by the darcy s law which will be given in eq 2 the third term is the natural decay of 222rn half lifetime of 3 825 days and the fourth term is the generation of 222rn due to radium content in the soil column kohl et al 1994 stated that the spatial difference of radon activity concentration that exist between the surface c 0 and the underground induces a diffusive radon flow towards the surface and that an advective radon flow can be initiated if a spatial air pressure difference exists in the subsurface nazaroff 1992 concludes that the advective flux is mostly due to temperature differences between the free surface and the building due to wind or due to ventilation and heating inside the house the flow velocity m s 1 in the soil pore air can be described by the 1d darcy s law provided the reynolds number is smaller than about 4 and it could be given as 2 v 1 Œµ k Œº p x where Œµ is the soil porosity k is the permeability m2 Œº is the air dynamic viscosity pa s and p is the pressure pa iakovleva and ryzhakova 2003 used the radon transport equation to obtain the advective velocity however this requires knowing the radon activity concentration profile and the diffusion coefficient the pressure field is given by the 1d laplace equation as 3 x k Œº p x 0 it should be noted that eqs 1 2 and 3 correspond to the case in which the following assumptions limitations are made as stated by nazaroff 1992 any transport of radon that may result from the diffusion of another species in soil air is neglected any possible adsorption of radon on the surfaces of the soil grains is neglected any moisture migration and any migration of radon within the water are neglected water content in soil is negligible the superficial velocity vector is described by the darcy s law as in eq 2 the soil is isotropic and homogeneous with respect to the diffusion coefficient permeability porosity emanation coefficient radium content and bulk density however later on the finite element model formulation allows for different values of these parameters in the soil multilayers i e non homogenous soil properties can be considered soil gas is incompressible for the range of pressures of interest researchers have solved the one dimensional radon transport equation eq 1 using different methods for example kohl et al 1994 used the finite element code fracture while savovic et al 2012 used the explicit finite difference method font 1997 presented analytical solutions to the steady state version of eq 1 under diffusion dominant advection dominant and including all of the four mechanisms hafez and awad 2016 solved eq 1 using the two node linear finite elements and 4 gaussian quadrature points for numerical integration of the element matrices their model is run in unsteady mode using the implicit crank nicolson method for time integration steady state conditions are reached when the maximum difference of activity concentrations between the consecutive time steps at any given node is less than a specified tolerance it should be noted that numerical integration suits differential equations with variable coefficients and it leads to increasing in the number of arithmetic operations every arithmetic operation in the computer is carried out with finite digits and hence there would be truncation or round off errors with the increase of the number of arithmetic operations the likelihood of occurrence of significant effect due to round off errors increases also the model presented in this paper is run in steady mode directly i e the left hand side of eq 1 is equal to zero thus the 222rn transport equation adopted herein has the form 4 x d c x v c x Œª c g 0 equation 4 and eq 1 have constant coefficients d v and Œª and constant generation g which enable the integrations of the element matrices to be carried out directly without the need for numerical integration consequently significant reduction of the number of arithmetic operations occurs this technique is already known thompson 2005 however it is not often used as most fe modellers tend to use standard fe codes which automatically use numerical integration to accommodate varying coefficients as numerical integration is unnecessary herein a huge number of computations would be saved the details of using the finite element method for solving the one dimensional transport equation is found in thompson 2005 and hafez and awad 2016 the two differences between hafez and awad 2016 and ferm 1d are a the first is run in unsteady mode and b numerical integrations are done in the first to form the element matrices in the ferm 1d model which also uses the two node linear elements numerical integration of the element matrices is avoided and integration is carried out in exact form the 2 by 2 element stiffness matrix is then given following thompson 2005 as 5 d Œ¥ x v 2 Œª Œ¥ x 3 d Œ¥ x v 2 Œª Œ¥ x 6 d Œ¥ x v 2 Œª Œ¥ x 6 d Œ¥ x v 2 Œª Œ¥ x 3 where Œ¥x is the element length the right hand side element matrix for constant generation is given as 6 g Œ¥ x 2 g Œ¥ x 2 it should be noted that the finite element formulation in the ferm 1d allows the variables e g diffusion coefficient velocity porosity permeability radon generation etc to have constant values within each element therefore these variables are allowed to be different from element to element and from one soil layer to another layer this causes modeling of radon transport with inhomogeneous or multi layer soil properties to become possible and it will be done later in hafez and awad 2016 model where four quadrature points are used for numerical integrations each term in the element matrices is evaluated four times one evaluation at each quadrature point if there are 3 matrices for diffusion advection and decay and each matrix has dimension of 2 by 2 12 total terms and one column vector with two terms then there is 14 terms this means 14 4 56 evaluations per every element in ferm 1d these 56 evaluations are avoided and it can be stated that the current developed model is significantly faster i e 56 times faster and hence more efficient than that by hafez and awad 2016 this characteristic of element matrices integrated in closed form is very useful when having very large number of elements the same advantage is there in two and three dimensional extensions of the developed model where significant time is saved in forming the element matrices because usually there is large number of elements to cover the solution domain a greater advantage is also achieved when performing unsteady simulations for which a future version of this model is planned if the time step is selected as one second and the unsteady simulation is required for a month for example that means there is 2 592 million time steps if there are 1000 elements then there will be 145 152 billion more evaluations by typical finite element models such as by hafez and awad 2016 which use numerical integration than by ferm 1d if one day simulation is required the saving would be about 4 8 billion evaluations indeed avoiding numerical integration when forming the element matrices is a big saving in the computational time in the following are numerical investigations and analyses of the different radon influencing mechanisms in addition to explain the modeling of radon mechanisms some modeling details are presented to gain useful numerical lessons 3 results and discussion as stated before radon movement in soils is affected by the combined effect of diffusion advection decay and generation mechanisms to understand radon movement in soils it is necessary to first understand how different combinations of the influencing mechanisms are working and interacting which is discussed and highlighted this offers new insight and interesting observations before coming to the cases that include all the four mechanisms and multi layer behavior 3 1 diffusion and decay mechanisms if there is no pressure gradient due to for example constant temperature profile in the soil and ambient air then advection can be assumed as zero it is also possible that no generation exists due to absence of radium 226 radon source leaving diffusion and decay as the only active mechanisms the 222rn transport equation under diffusion and decay mechanisms v 0 and g 0 becomes then as 7 d d 2 c d x 2 Œª c 0 the following boundary conditions could be assumed 8 c 0 co 0 c l cl the length of the domain or soil depth l is assumed as 10 0 m which is divided into 100 elements and the diffusion coefficient is taken as 1 0 10 6 m2 s the boundary conditions are taken as c 0 0 and c l 10 59650 bq m3 the values of l d and c l 10 are taken according to kohl et al 1994 who used 20 finite elements fig 1 shows excellent match between ferm 1d and the exact solution given hereinafter by eq 12 the exact solution for the diffusion and decay case is given in eq 12 by substituting the advective velocity v 0 the maximum difference between ferm 1d and the exact solution is 19 24 bq m3 the percentage relative error is defined here as the calculated value analytical or measured value analytical or measured value 100 the value of 19 24 bq m3 amounts to a percentage relative error of 0 0899 this occurs at distance of 9 3 m below the ground surface where the radon profile is steep in that region eq 7 can be made dimensionless the subscripted variables are dimensionless as 9 d 2 c d x 2 Œª l 2 d c 0 it can be seen from eq 9 that the dimensionless number œÄdc Œª l2 d controls 222rn transport under diffusion and decay mechanisms for the above data the value of Œª l2 d is 210 as Œª and l are constants herein to study effects of variation of œÄdc the diffusion coefficient d will be changed to get different values for œÄdc such as 600 100 25 and 10 a value of zero for this dimensionless number is only possible by letting Œª equal to zero fig 2 shows as expected the activity concentration values increase with decrease of the dimensionless number œÄdc Œª l2 d due to increasing of the diffusion effect the case with œÄdc 0 would be the case of pure diffusion which exists for non decaying substances it would be a straight line connecting the two boundary activity concentrations where the exact solution is given as c x c o c l c o l x for decaying substances such as radon this can be hypothetically obtained by assuming the generation term is cancelling the decay term opposite signs while absence of a pressure gradient causes zero advective velocity v 0 it should be noted that ajayi et al 2018 presented dimensionless numbers such as œÄdc and peclet numbers however they only focused on their effects on the radon flux in this study effects of the dimensionless numbers on the radon flux are addressed in addition to their effects on the radon vertical profile 3 2 diffusion decay and generation mechanisms it is possible that no advection exists due to absence of a pressure gradient leaving diffusion decay and generation as the active mechanisms eq 4 under the diffusion decay and generation mechanisms becomes 10 x d c x Œª c g 0 the boundary conditions are as in eq 8 following kohl et al 1994 the length of the domain or soil depth l is assumed as 10 0 m and the activity concentration cl at the deep soil is assumed as 59650 bq m3 the value of g 0 1252125 bq m 3 s 1 is taken in this example assuming the radium 226 content of ara 50 bq kg as constant all over the soil depth and 100 elements are used as seen in fig 3 it is noticed that the radon activity concentration at the deep soil boundary cl 59650 bq m3 is advancing constantly up to a depth of about 4 m after which the profile is plunging to zero activity concentration at the ground surface fig 3 reveals that the decay term did not allow increase in radon activity concentration above the cl value indicating that the decay effect is felt over the entire depth in the first 4 m below the surface the effect of a boundary condition c 0 0 is felt the high difference in radon activity concentration between cl and co drives large radon flux out of the soil causing a plunging shape of the radon profile 3 3 diffusion advection and decay mechanisms when radium 226 which is the radon source is zero or very small in the soil depth down to x l but beneath that depth it exists this results in domination of the diffusion advection and decay mechanisms eq 1 under the conditions of steady no radon generation constant diffusion coefficient and constant advection velocity becomes 11 d d 2 c d x 2 v dc dx Œª c 0 equation 11 includes the diffusion and advection transport mechanisms in addition to the decay of 222rn the analytical solution to eq 11 was given by telford 1983 as 12 c x c l e l x v 2 d s i n h x v 2 4 d 2 Œª d sinh l v 2 4 d 2 Œª d where cl is the boundary radon activity concentration at x l and l is the length of the domain or the soil depth at which radon originates and at maximum activity concentration fig 4 shows ferm 1d prediction is indistinguishable from the exact solution given by eq 12 using 100 elements the maximum absolute error in predicting 222rn activity concentrations occurs fig 5 at x 9 0 m in the area of steep activity concentration gradients with value of 6 579 bq m3 the predicted 222rn is 21225 71 bq m3 while the exact solution value is 21232 29 bq m3 which results in small percentage relative error of about 0 031 the distribution of the errors in this case is shown in fig 5 where it is seen that the zone of maximum errors exists close to the deep soil side where the activity concentration at the boundary is maximum and in this zone the maximum errors lie in the interval from 7 m x 10 m however the maximum percentage relative error is seen from fig 6 to be located toward the soil surface at x 1 3 m with value of 0 257 the relatively large radon activity concentrations values near the deep soil side cause the percentage relative errors to be small over there while the small radon activity concentrations values near the soil surface cause the percentage relative errors to be high toward the soil surface side kohl et al 1994 had their deviations percentage relative error when using the fe model fracture below 1 while savovic et al 2012 had their deviations below 0 2 however savovic et al 2012 obtained the steady state numerical solution by using the explicit finite difference method in unsteady mode and made tens of thousands of numerical runs to reach steady state conditions hafez and awad 2016 fe implicit model has the same accuracy as the current model and in their model only two numerical runs are needed to reach steady state conditions only one numerical run is needed herein because ferm 1d is run directly in steady state conditions fig 7 shows comparison of the different 222rn transport mechanisms for diffusion and adevction only mechanisms assuming hypothetically the generation term is cancelling the decay term as each one has opposite sign to the other the activity concentration could be given by eq 12 with Œª 0 a measure of the transport character of this case would be the dimensionless number peclet no pe v l d which is taken as equal to 10 in fig 7 the value of pe 10 indicates advection is much more dominant than diffusion it can be noticed that the 222rn activity concentration at any point along the soil depth except the two boundaries are maximum in advection dominated conditions followed by diffusion dominated conditions while the decay diffusion dominated conditions come at last the diffusion alone straight line profile could be considered as the intermediate steady state profile high advection velocities push the advection diffusion profile higher than the diffusion line at any given point and the deep soil boundary activity concentration moves to the direction of zero activity concentration the soil surface decay domination reduces the level of radon activity concentration considerably below the diffusion line as the radon flux at the soil surface depends on the slope of the activity concentration profile at x 0 then it can be noticed according to fig 7 the radon flux to ground surface is higher in advection dominated flows than by diffusion dominated flows while it is close to zero in the other two cases for the values of the parameters given in this case the radon profile is located just above the decay dominant profile and below the diffusion line to the best of the author s knowledge past researchers have not discussed in quantitative details the conditions that makes each transport mechanism dominant a trial for doing this is made herein as follows consider the dimensionless number obtained by dividing the peclet number by the œÄdc number this process results in a new number called herein the transport number œÄ1 given as 13 œÄ 1 t h e t r a n s p o r t n u m b e r v Œª l for the values of v l and Œª used herein œÄ1 0 0476 0 05 it can be stated according to fig 8 for this value of œÄ1 that the decay transport dominates another two dimensionless numbers could be stated as well as 14 œÄ2 v2 Œª d 15 œÄ3 v Œª l3 d2 the dimensionless numbers œÄ2 and œÄ3 include the diffusion coefficient and œÄ3 includes the soil depth l where the radon activity concentration is the highest or the depth at which radon originates for the same data set above the values of œÄ2 and œÄ3 are 0 476 and 2100 respectively fig 8 shows the effect of variation of œÄ1 on the radon activity concentration profiles the dimensionless number œÄ1 has the advantage over the dimensionless numbers œÄ2 and œÄ3 in that the quantities included in it can be measured or predetermined the advective velocity appearing in œÄ1 can be directly determined through the darcy s law eq 2 while there is no generally accepted equation for the determination of the diffusion coefficient in other words the velocity decay constant and l appearing in œÄ1 can be known with high certainty while œÄ2 and œÄ3 have the diffusion coefficient which could be known with less certainty for given Œª and l in the case discussed herein the different values of œÄ1 in fig 8 were obtained by assuming different values of the advective velocity the importance of the soil column length or depth was pointed out by shitrit et al 2012 they reported that column length affects the radon exhalation rates from the soil into the air due to the effect of radon decay because radon has a short half life in longer columns more radon decays before it reaches the ground surface to determine the value of l it is suggested that the migration distance defined in font 1997 and font and baixeras 2003 could be used for l they defined the migration distance of radon gas in the soil as the distance at which radon activity concentration in the soil is the deep radon activity concentration reduced a factor 1 e 1 when both activity concentration and pressure gradients are considered the diffusion length d Œª 1 2could also be tried for l interestingly if the length scale l in œÄ1 is replaced by the diffusion length then œÄ1 v dŒª 1 2 or œÄ1 œÄ2 1 2 the migration length stated by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 as 1 a where a is given by eq 26 could also be a candidate for the characteristic length l in œÄ1 further investigation is required in this respect it should be noted that the length scale l does not reflect only radon decay and diffusion but it reflects also radon generation consequently œÄ1 includes all of the four mechanisms it is noted that for low values of œÄ1 such as 0 01 or 0 05 the decay mechanism dominates and the radon activity concentrations approach zero values almost at the mid depth of the soil column x 5 0 m i e it is not expected to have a significant radon flux out of the soil as most of the radon had decayed for relatively high values of œÄ1 such as 2 0 or 1 0 advection dominates and there is high steep radon profiles at the soil ground surface with an associated significant outward radon flux it is interesting to note that for the highly advective profiles in fig 8 there is no horizontal plateau as was seen in the pure advective flow in fig 7 at pe 10 in the absence of radon generation 222rn decay mechanism will always be there and the radon profile will have a decreasing trend in going up to the soil ground surface without a horizontal plateau the radon activity concentration profile at œÄ1 0 2 fig 8 is the profile at which the radon activity concentration profile at the soil surface appears to just touches the surface with near zero activity concentration this value of œÄ1 0 2 appears to be the dividing line or separation border line between advection and decay diffusion domination it can be stated that above œÄ1 0 2 advection dominates and below this value decay diffusion dominates the 222rn radon flux out of the soil column qx could be stated as 16 q x d dc dx v c d c 2 c 1 Œ¥ x v c 1 where Œ¥x is the distance between the first at the ground surface and second nodes i e the step length and the numbers in brackets refer to the node numbers as seen in the middle term in eq 16 the outward flux consists of that due to diffusion and advection in the right hand side of eq 16 the activity concentration gradient is calculated using the activity concentration at the first node c 1 at x 0 and the activity concentration at the second node c 2 at x Œ¥x the boundary condition at x 0 was taken as c 1 0 causing the flux due to advection to be zero and therefore the radon outward flux is only due to diffusion however advection effects on the radon outward flux could be manifested by changes in velocity and advection would be due to effects of the velocity on the radon activity concentration gradient dc dx near the soil surface thus velocity and hence advection affect dc dx which in turn affects the outward radon flux the non zero surface boundary condition will be considered later when discussing radon transport in soils with multi layer behavior table 1 shows the radon outward flux and transport classification for different values of the dimensionless numbers it is noted that the radon outward flux increases with increase in all the dimensionless numbers the increase in these dimensionless numbers is made herein by increasing the advective velocity the radon calculated surface flux by hafez and awad 2016 in different countries greece germany south africa and jordan was between 0 2 and 8 2 mbq m2 s for this range it appears according to table 1 that the values of œÄ1 of 1 0 and 2 0 produce very high radon outward flux 0 4 and 1 26 bq m2 s respectively two cases of greece data discussed in hafez and awad 2016 had œÄ1 0 18 with radon soil surface outward fluxes of 1 68 and 3 17 mbq m2 s for œÄ1 0 2 table 1 shows radon outward flux of 3 26 mbq m2 s the value of œÄ1 0 2 could be considered as the starting value for appreciable outward radon surface flux one thousand 1000 elements were needed to capture the steep radon activity concentration profiles in fig 8 because of the high advective flow table 2 shows with the increase of œÄ1 increase of advection relative to decay the point of maximum error maximum difference between the exact and fe numerical solutions moves from the deep soil side to the soil surface for decay dominant conditions the absolute error is very small and it increases with increase in advection but remain within a relative error of 0 96 table 3 shows the maximum relative errors move also toward the soil surface with increase in œÄ1 and more specifically starting from œÄ1 0 1 the maximum relative error is just right at the second node 3 4 diffusion advection decay and generation mechanisms when the four mechanisms of diffusion advection decay and generation exist the radon transport equation is expressed as by eq 4 the general solution to eq 4 i e without considering particular boundary conditions was reported by font 1997 and antonopoulos domis et al 2009 the analytical solution to eq 4 with the boundary conditions c 0 co and c l cl is given by ajayi et al 2018 as 17 c x c l g Œª c o g Œª e Œæ l e Œ≥ x c l g Œª c o g

1252125 bq m 3 s 1 corresponding to ara 50 bq kg l 10 m c 0 0 and c l 59650 bq m3 fig 9 shows the success of ferm 1d model in predicting the radon activity concentrations when compared to values from eq 17 one thousand finite elements were required to simulate the steep gradients existed near the soil surface table 4 shows that the maximum absolute difference between the numerical and analytical radon activity concentration is 0 491 bq m3 at activity concentration of approximately 33 185 bq m3 when comparing this case in fig 9 to the case in fig 4 where generation was not included the effect of existence of radon generation is significant causing the deep soil boundary activity concentration to increase up to a depth of 2 m after which it plunges to zero at the surface similarities between fig 3 fig 7 for pe 10 and fig 9 suggest a transport similarity concept a transport similarity concept is when the same vertical profile of radon exists under different combinations of the radon mechanisms 3 5 effect of pressure gradient and soil properties on radon transport for constant soil properties such as permeability and porosity eq 3 can be solved for the pressure distribution along the soil depth and eq 2 for the velcoity the pressure profile could be given from eq 3 as 19 p x p l p o l x p o where pl is the pressure at x l the deep soil and po is the pressure at x 0 the soil surface the velocity is then given using eq 2 as 20 v k Œº p l p o l for v 1 0 10 6 m s k 10 11 m2 Œº 1 8 10 6 pa s 0 4 and l 10 m which are typical values the pressure difference along the soil depth pl po becomes 0 72 pa it should be noted that kohl et al 1994 yakovleva and parovik 2010 savovic et al 2012 and hafez and awad 2016 selected advective velocity equal to v 1 0 10 6 m s in their radon model studies in addition based on radon measurements in greece in the next section a value of the advective velocity as 1 0 10 6 m s was found sufficient this velocity is given as constant along the soil depth equation 20 could be used to obtain the following form for the dimensionless number œÄ1 as 21 œÄ 1 k p l p o Œº Œª l 2 in this form effects of permeability pressure gradient porosity and air viscosity are included in œÄ1 high permeability and pressure difference increases œÄ1 and therefore increases advection while an increase in the rest of the parameters appearing in the denominator of eq 21 decreases œÄ1 and thus reduces advection effects for œÄ1 2 the pressure difference pl po 30 pa and for œÄ1 1 the pressure difference pl po 15 pa in summary with the increase in pressure difference pl po velocity increases then advection increases and eventually the radon outward surface flux increases 3 6 soil multi layer behavior and non zero soil surface radon 222r activity concentration antonopoulos domis et al 2009 stated that if the interest is in the radon activity concentration at the soil surface it is clear that the usually used boundary condition c 0 0 not only gives zero radon activity concentration at the soil surface but also neglects the contribution of advection to the radon current or flux at the surface of the soil they concluded that c 0 0 is conceptually not appropriate instead they considered the following gradient boundary condition at the surface 22 dc dx x 0 k 1 c 0 c a where k1 is a proportionality constant and ca is the radon activity concentration in the bulk of air over the soil surface the radon soil surface flux boundary condition then becomes 23 q 0 d dc dx x 0 d k 1 c 0 c a hafez and awad 2016 had similar treatment of the surface flux boundary condition such as that in eq 23 but they took the product d k1 h where h was considered as a radon air soil transfer coefficient antonopoulos domis et al 2009 used the following boundary condition at the deep soil given as 24 dc dx x 0 antonopoulos domis et al 2009 analytically solved the radon transport equation first in a one layer model mode eq 4 together with the boundary conditions as given by eq 23 and eq 24 and obtained 25 c x g Œª 1 1 a k 1 g Œª c a e a x where a is given by 26 a v 2 d v 2 d 2 Œª d 1 2 the radon activity concentration at the soil surface x 0 can be deduced from eq 25 by letting x 0 to obtain 27 c 0 g Œª 1 1 a k 1 g Œª c a radon activity concentrations of soil depth 0 2 6 m were measured by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 during the years 2002 2003 and 2003 2004 on the aristotle university campus greece they observed multi layer behavior in which the radon activity concentration profile did not follow the well known monotonous increase which levels off to a saturation value they performed least square fitting technique of eq 25 while neglecting ca to the measured data for a depth of 1 3 m this resulted in a 0 905 m 1 k1 186 m 1 and g Œª 20 000 bq m3 and a radon activity concentration at the soil surface c 0 97 bq m3 the exact calculated value is 96 841 bq m3 unfortunately for a given value of a there is a set of infinite pairs d v that satisfy eq 26 which means it is not possible to deduce the actual pair d v from the measured radon profile in a way this supports the transport similarity concept stated earlier the non uniqueness of the pair d v constituted a difficulty in comparing ferm 1d with the analytical solution as given by eq 25 because the pair d v is needed as input data in the fe numerical model ferm 1d several pairs d v have to be assumed which satisfy eq 26 for a 0 905 m 1 after several trials it was found that the pair d v 2 45 10 6 m2 s 1 0 10 6 m s gives a 0 9056 m 1 these values made the fe model profile with 100 elements to be very close to the analytical solution in eq 25 as seen in fig 10 it is noted that the advection velocity was found in this case to be 1 0 10 6 m s the activity concentration boundary condition at the deep soil was taken according to eq 25 while substituting x 2 6 m and g Œª 20 000 bq m3 yielding c l 2 6 m 18112 bq m3 it should be noted that the one layer model solution expressed in eq 25 does not simulate the greece field data which is seen in fig 13 and fig 14 the maximum difference between the ferm 1d model and the analytical activity concentrations maximum error is located near x 1 0 m as seen in fig 11 this maximum error has a value of about 300 bq m3 but its relative error is only 2 the maximum percentage relative error between ferm 1d and the analytical model given by eq 25 occurred exactly at the soil surface x 0 as seen in fig 12 gradually diminishes toward the deep soil in nearly straight line variation it has a magnitude equal to 4 3 as the fe model predicts c 0 101 bq m3 while eq 25 gives c 0 97 bq m3 the predicted ferm 1d model radon flux at the soil surface is 0 0455 bq m2 s while a very close value of 0 0442 bq m2 s is obtained from the analytical solution if pure diffusion is considered in this case v 0 then the diffusion coefficient according to eq 26 becomes 2 564 10 6m2 s for a 0 905 m 1 in this case ferm 1d and the analytical solutions are almost identical with maximum error of 0 15 bq m3 at x 0 94 m the maximum percentage relative error is still at the soil surface but with a very small magnitude of 0 0013 the predicted surface activity concentration of 96 843 97 bq m3 compares to the analytical model value of 96 841 97 bq m3 with an actual difference of 0 002 bq m3 again this confirms and supports the concept of transport similarity stated earlier the radon measured data from antonopoulos domis et al 2009 was composed of two data sets named here greece 1 and greece 2 spanning the years 2002 to 2004 as seen in fig 13 and fig 14 the measured radon activity concentration in green dots increased with soil depth but did not follow the well known monotonous increase indicating a multi layer behavior in both distributions radon activity concentration increased up to a soil depth of 0 8 m seemed to remain constant at depths of 0 8 1 3 m and then increased again after that antonopoulos domis et al 2009 assumed two layer soil model with two different diffusion advection characteristics but still assumed zero radon activity concentration at the soil surface they applied least squares fitting of their model analytical solution to the measured data the first layer had soil depths less than 1 3 m in which a was found as 1 4 m 1 and equal to 0 55 m 1 for depths higher than 1 3 m in the second layer as pointed before for fixed value of a there is no unique set of d v so the diffusion coefficient and advection velocity can not be uniquely determined they applied the non zero boundary condition eq 23 to only the soil layer with depth less than 1 3 m in the one layer model hafez and awad 2016 assumed two and three layer model with different diffusion coefficients for each layer and with constant advection velocity all over the soil depth for their three layer model the diffusion coefficients were 2 5 10 6 m2 s depths from 0 0 m to 0 9 m 4 8 10 6 m2 s depths from 0 9 m to 1 5 m and 8 5 10 6 m2 s depths from 1 5 m to 2 6 m respectively while the advection velocity was assumed constant as 1 0 10 6 m s they did not assume zero surface radon activity concentration but used the following surface boundary condition 28 q 0 h c a c 0 they found h which has dimension as velocity to have a value of 2 0 10 6 m s the radon surface activity concentration was found as 850 bq m3 and 1640 bq m3 for greece 1 and greece 2 data respectively they compared these values to the linear extrapolation of radon graphs by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 up to the soil surface the extrapolation resulted in radon activity concentrations of 550 950 bq m3 for greece 1 and 300 2 200 bq m3 for greece 2 these values are much higher than 97 bq m3 surface radon activity concentration value that was estimated by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 in this study a different approach is taken other than adopting different diffusion coefficients for each layer as was done by hafez and awad 2016 this could be justified by the transport similarity concept discussed earlier a constant diffusion coefficient is assumed in line with the practice often adopted by most researchers while the multi layer behavior of the soil layers is explained in terms of different radium content in the soil i e different ara values for each layer this is supported by the fact that the measured data show variation of the radium content different ara along the soil depth the advection velocity could be taken either as constant or variable per layer two scenarios are considered in the first scenario the diffusion coefficient is taken as 1 0 10 6 m2 s while the advection velocity is taken as 1 0 10 7 m s yielding a 1 4 for greece 1 case ara is assumed as 10 0 bq kg for soil depths less than 1 3 m and 14 25 bq kg for depths greater than 1 3 m the measured radium 226ra activity concentrations by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 ranged from 7 to 11 bq kg based on 10 measurements for soil depths less than 0 6 m but only one measurement existed at depth 1 6 m with ara ranging between 10 and 12 bq kg therefore the model assumed values for ara are very much in line with the measured values the surface boundary condition is taken as by eq 23 with k1 186 m 1 the quantity g Œª is found to be 32343 bq m3 by substituting the measured radon activity concentration of 31500 bq m3 at depth 2 6 m and k1 186 m 1 in eq 25 and solving for g Œª fig 13 shows very good agreement between the ferm 1d predictions and the greece 1 data while the one layer analytical model eq 25 activity concentrations are much too high of course the analytical model would do better if the a values from antonopoulos domis et al 2009 were used the ferm 1d radon profile where 100 elements were used is able to produce the change in the radon curvature profile as observed in the experimental data the predicted ferm 1d radon at the soil surface is 108 bq m3 compared to 97 bq m3 the value that is estimated by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 as the radon surface activity concentration for the greece 2 data the same values of the diffusion coefficient and advection velocity are taken as done in greece 1 case but different radon soil content ara s due to the observed more irregular radon profile than the greece 1 data for depths less than 0 8 m ara is taken as 10 bq kg for depths between 0 8 m and 1 5 m ara is taken as 7 bq kg and depths greater than 1 5 m ara is taken as 14 bq kg the intermediate layer having smallest value for ara is in confirmation with the less radon activity concentration there and at the deep soil boundary the value for g Œª is taken as 30802 6 bq m3 while a radon activity concentration of 30000 bq m3 is taken as the boundary condition at depth 2 6 m according to the measured data due to higher irregularity of greece 2 data compared to greece 1 data the agreement of ferm 1d predictions with greece 2 data as seen in fig 14 is less than at greece 1 however the agreement is still good the predicted ferm 1d radon at the soil surface is 100 bq m3 compared to the antonopoulos domis et al 2009 estimated value of 97 bq m3 in the second scenario the diffusion coefficient is kept constant equal to 1 0 10 6 m2 s while the radon soil content and advection velocity were allowed to vary per layer for the first layer 0 0 x 1 3 m ara is taken as 9 5 bq kg and the velocity is 1 0 10 7 m s for the second layer 1 3 x 1 6 m ara is taken as 8 1 bq kg and the velocity is 0 5 10 6 m s and for the third layer x 1 6 m ara is taken as 13 56 bq kg and the velocity is 1 0 10 6 m s the pair d v results in value of a 0 206 m 1 fig 15 shows excellent agreement is between ferm 1d predictions and greece 1 field data for the radon profile the ferm 1d soil surface radon activity concentration is 104 bq m3 versus 97 bq m3 estimated value from measurements the radon soil surface flux by the model is 0 020 bq m2 s of which 94 5 is due to diffusion and the small 4 5 is due to advection because of the small advective velocity fig 15 shows some measured data points in greece 1 data in which these points are deviating from the ferm 1d model results such as the points at distances x 1 2 1 3 1 6 and 1 7 m it is very likely that the actual radon profile is smooth due to the diffusion effect and perhaps there are unsteady effects or two three dimensional effects not accounted for in the 1d steady model the objective here is to show that the soil multi layer behavior can be simulated and modelled to an accurate degree with a one dimensional modeling approach indeed the more accurate the model parameters the more accurate the results another scenario is implemented in which the same data for the three layers as above is used but adopting hafez and awad s 2016 boundary condition eq 28 for different values of h fig 16 shows that the value of h 0 0002 2 0 e 04 m s gives the radon activity concentrations of the greece 1 data and similar results as the ferm 1d model in fig 15 in fact the value of h 0 0002 m s is equivalent to using k1 186 m 1 the radon surface activity concentrations are 97 906 and 5555 bq m3 for the different h values of 2 10 4 2 10 5 and 2 10 6 m s respectively and the surface outward radon flux are 0 01902 0 0179 and 0 0115 bq m2 s the profile with h 2 10 5 m s resembles that of hafez and awad 2016 but both models have different h diffusion and advection coefficients which highlights that different sets of parameters and different boundary conditions used in multi layer modeling give the same model results which is in line with the transport similarity concept this point requires further research as to test the uniqueness of model input data the discussion of this case highlights the importance of having a complete measured data set that includes all the relevant parameters use of numerical or analytical models should be guided by existing field data for a model calibration and verification a complete data set is however rare to find to the best of the author s knowledge it is worth to mention here that in fluid mechanics hydrology and hydraulics two well known dimensionless numbers are often used to delineate the flow characteristics through dividing the flow in open channels pipes and ducts into different flow regimes or types the first number is reynolds number re œÅ v h Œº where œÅ is the fluid density and h is a characteristic length such as the hydraulic radius or the flow depth it is well known that in pipes for re less than 2000 the flow is classified as laminar while for re greater than 3000 the flow is turbulent with a transition zone between these two limits the second number is froude number f r v gh where g is the gravitational acceleration for fr less than 1 the flow is tranquil or subcritical and for fr greater than 1 it is supercritical in spite of the wide applicability of the transport phenomenon in many science and engineering applications unfortunately there has not been in previous works transport number s that would characterize or divide the transport processes into distinct transport regimes or mechanisms it is hoped that this study provides contribution to this point by introducing dimensionless transport numbers such as œÄ1 v Œª l where it was found that value of œÄ1 0 2 appears to be the dividing line or separation border line between advection and decay domination the last column in table 1 provides also useful transport classification although this study discusses the transport of radon gas in the soils similarity exists to transport processes of other substances in various fluids for example the transport of contaminants or pollutants in water and air bears significant resemblances and similarities to transport of radon in soils this is because these transport phenomena are all governed by the same transport differential equation with the differences lying in the boundary conditions and the values of the model parameters such as the diffusion and advection coefficients based on the above several findings and conclusions in this study are also useful in the investigations of transport of other pollutants in different mediums supported by the similarity transport concept which is proposed herein for example the proposed transport numbers can be applied to water and air quality investigations to determine suitable values for the transport numbers which characterizes the transport processes future development of ferm 1d model includes adding an unsteady component introducing a convective radon transport term in the radon transport differential equation introduction of a network model which provides quasi two dimensional simulations introduction of a two phase radon transport model and application of the ferm 1d to model radon drainage systems beneath houses to divert radon away from houses 4 conclusions this study indicates that finite element numerical modeling provides a valuable tool in understanding radon transport and movement through one and multi layer soils the following points can also be concluded the transport mechanisms of diffusion advection decay and generation in different combinations can be modelled successfully using the finite element method the developed one dimensional finite element model ferm 1d in this study proved to be efficient and accurate for modeling radon transport in soils in principle transport numbers can be developed that separates the different transport mechanisms and determine conditions under which each mechanism of diffusion advection decay and generation dominates diffusion and decay and diffusion advection decay profiles have concave downward profile when all of diffusion advection decay and generation exist the radon profile could have a horizontal plateau advancing from the deep soil then it plunges down when approaching the ground surface for diffusion advection decay conditions for low values of the dimensionless number œÄ1 v Œª l such as 0 01 or 0 05 the decay mechanism dominates and the radon activity concentrations approach zero values almost at the mid depth of the soil column i e there is not a significant radon flux out of the soil for relatively high values of œÄ1 such as 2 0 or 1 0 advection dominates and there are high steep radon profiles at the soil ground surface with an associated significant outward radon flux the radon activity concentration profile at œÄ1 0 2 is the profile at which the radon activity concentration profile at the soil surface appears to just touches the surface with zero activity concentration this value of œÄ1 0 2 appears to be the dividing line or separation border line between advection and decay domination it can be stated that above œÄ1 0 2 advection dominates and below this values decay dominates multi layer soil behavior can be best described using numerical modeling such as by the finite element method ferm 1d where no restrictions on the number of layers are required it is important to note the variation of the radium soil content which explains multi layer soil behavior in the case of greece data non zero radon soil surface boundary condition must be used if a realistic radon soil surface flux out from the ground surface or through buildings foundation is required a transport similarity concept is presented in which different combinations of mechanisms and model parameters can produce the same vertical radon activity concentration profile different sets of model parameters and boundary conditions used in multi layer modeling may lead to the same radon activity concentration profile highlighting the non uniqueness of data 5 declarations ethics approval and consent to participate not applicable consent

and physics applications among transport of scalar quantities is the transport of radon 222rn from the subsurface soils to the ground surface which is very important this is because of the major health hazardous such as lung cancer that may occur due to exposure to 222rn emanating from the deep soils into the ground surface and floor cracks of building basements radon 222rn is a natural radioactive gas invisible with no odour and no taste originating from the uranium 238u decay series in the outdoor environment activity concentration of radon is not considered a health risk because the radon that diffuses into the atmosphere normally disperses rapidly however accumulation of radon indoors gives rise to high radon activity concentration which can lead to health problems in the respiratory system fuente et al 2020 radon is identified as a carcinogen agent by the world health organization who considered the second greatest cause of lung cancer disease after smoking inhalation of the short lived alpha decay products of radon e g 218po and 214po is shown to induce pulmonary cell dna damage who 2009 although radon is natural elevated radon levels indoors are not natural but a direct consequence of the building practices the world average radon activity concentration in becquerels per cubic meter bq m3 in the outdoor environment is estimated between 5 and 15 bq m3 who 2016 however indoor radon activity concentrations vary widely depending on different factors such as the underlying geology water atmospheric conditions or the building type therefore levels of indoor radon vary widely both within countries and among countries with geometric mean activity concentrations of radon ranging from less than 10 bq m3 for middle east to more than 100 bq m3 for several european countries unscear 2006 in canada the average radon activity concentration of 96 bq m3 population weighted is more than double the worldwide average indoor radon activity concentration chen et

measured from the basement structure was above the recommended limit by a factor of 4 in addition among geochemical precursors radon gas in groundwater and soil is considered a notable precursor used to detect chemical and physical changes during the generation of earthquakes and volcanic events morales simfors et al 2019 the movement in soil of the mass concentration of 222rn is influenced by the diffusion advection decay and generation mechanisms it can be represented to a large extent by the one dimensional transport equation for 222rn in the vertical direction the solution of 222rn transport equation enables understanding how 222rn moves from the deep soil depths up to the ground surface how the radon influencing mechanisms are interacting which mechanism is dominating and how much 222rn flux is flowing into the ground surface such understanding and estimation of 222rn movement will aid in finding mitigation solutions to the problem of 222rn exposure this study deals with the use of analytical and finite element numerical modeling of the radon transport in soil to better understand soil radon profiles and radon exhalation rate from the soil into the open air with the ultimate goal of helping in the determination of the most effective radon mitigation solutions in dwellings the newly developed finite element model is called ferm 1d finite element radon modeling in one dimension the subject is very interesting and certainly faces a still open issue despite the long term efforts carried out by past researchers to reduce radon exposure to population the study recapitulates some existing models used to simulate radon transport describes individual mechanisms of radon transport in soils introduces a newly developed 1d steady state numerical model ferm 1d and compares the accuracy of this model with known analytical solutions and with field data the 222rn transport equation is solved herein while considering all the different influencing mechanisms of diffusion advection decay and generation the finite element fe method is the numerical method used to solve the transport equation to test the fe model the numerical solution is verified against the corresponding analytical solution under different conditions a field case study dealing with soil multilayer behavior is discussed to highlight the power of mathematical and numerical models for radon investigations several past researchers dealt with the phenomenon of radon transport in a theoretical fashion in which they compared their numerical models predictions to analytical solutions without substantiating their results or testing their models against field data examples of this type are the works of kohl et al 1994 andersen 2001 rabi and mohamad 2006 yakovleva and parovik 2010 savovic et al 2012 and ajayi et al 2018 font and baixeras 2003 and mu√±oz et al 2017 compared their models to radon experimental data but for soils without multi layer behavior and they focused on indoor radon calculation on the other hand hafez and awad 2016 compared their fe model with multi layer soil field data but without testing their model to the analytical solution of the radon differential transport equation in addition most of these studies presented merely the solution to the radon transport equation without making thorough or in depth analysis of the mechanics by which each mechanism is working kohl et al 1994 added a radioactive decay term to the finite element code fracture which was conceived for the simulation of forced fluid flow in fractured rocks however they verified their code to the steady state one dimensional radon transport analytical solution eq 12 hereinafter solved by telford 1983 they compared their numerical solutions to the analytical solution for three cases each with differently activated mechanisms diffusion advection decay diffusion advection and diffusion decay non zero radon surface soil boundary condition was used they then applied their model to a two dimensional 2d cylindrical building they considered five different material sets undisturbed underground compressed soil air in the building vegetable soil and wall foundation they found that the radon transport by advection and by diffusion strongly depends on the gas permeability of the underground however their finding which is very useful was not verified with experimental or field data andersen 1992 solved the 2d radon transport equation for a standard slab on grade house using the finite volume method non zero radon surface soil boundary condition was used similar to kohl et al 1994 later on andersen 2001 presented a graph between the radon entry rate versus soil permeability for the slab and the 3 mm gap between the slab and footer although this graph is useful in showing effect of house depressurization and permeability it was not substantiated by experimental or field data rabi and mohamad 2006 adapted an existing finite volume 2d computational simulator for heat and mass transfer to predict radon exhalation rates from a phosphogypsum stack into open air they found theoretically without experimental verification that natural convective effects on typical low permeability phosphogypsum stacks proved to be of minor importance as radon transfer becomes diffusion dominant yakovleva and parovik 2010 solved the steady and unsteady diffusion advection radon transport equation in many layered geological media by integro interpolation method the peculiarity of radon transport in many layered media is taken into account in the developed numerical model especially radium content they considered the unsteady calculations showing at what time moments the distribution curves of radon activity concentration coincide with the steady regime of radon transport and considered this as the validation step of their numerical model without testing with field data antonopoulos domis et al 2009 analytically solved the radon transport equation they assumed two layer soil model total soil depth was 2 6 m with two different diffusion advection characteristics but assumed zero radon activity concentration at the soil surface in the multi layer model they applied least squares fitting of their model analytical solutions to radon measured data they later used nonzero radon soil surface boundary condition but applied least squares fitting of their model analytical solution to one layer model depth was less than 1 3 m and obtained an equation for the radon activity concentration at the soil surface savovic et al 2012 solved the radon transport equation using the explicit finite difference method and compared their results in the same manner as in kohl et al 1994 to the analytical solution of telford 1983 given in eq 12 without comparison with experimental data they used the unrealistic zero radon activity concentration soil surface boundary condition ajayi et al 2018 used a discrete fracture network dfn model for prediction of radon flux from fractured rocks they obtained the radon fluxes at the ends of a single fractured element from the analytical solution of the radon diffusion advection decay generation transport equation eq 17 hereinafter which were assembled in the network model equation 17 is valid only for specified activity concentrations at the two ends indicating it does not accommodate flux or gradient boundary condition their work provides insight into radon transport through fractured rocks but unfortunately no experimental verification was made in a way similar to that of antonopoulos domis et al 2009 but using three soil layers orabi 2018 made curve fitting of the experimental data however zero radon surface boundary condition was used this precludes accurate calculation of the radon soil outward flux which is the quantity of primary interest in radon investigations in orabi 2018 eight 8 parameters were needed to be calculated using the experimental data this approach is limited to three soil layers where in general different number of layers other than three might exist bakaeva and kalaydo 2021 have shown that sealing the building underground shell with a clay soil which has permeability less than 10 12 m2 will cause the absence of the advective radon transport flux from the soil then they used a two dimensional diffusion model of radon transport in the medium system soil walling indoor air to describe radon transport thus under the conditions of the buildings underground shell tightness the radon soil transport through underground walling could be described by a stationary diffusion model however many existing buildings are not shell tight and temperature gradients will cause depressurization and consequently a significant radon advective transport muhammad and k√ºlahcƒ± 2022 proposed a novel boundary condition for estimation of surface radon activity concentration using recorded soil radon data at a given depth they expressed the surface radon boundary condition as the product of f t 1 Œ± where f t is the recorded radon activity concentration at the monitoring depth the function f t can also be expressed as a function which represents the radon time series variation at any given time t at the radon monitoring depth z and Œ± is the attenuation coefficient which represents the fraction of radon activity concentration lost in its journey to the crustal surface similar to the cases of antonopoulos domis et al 2009 and orabi 2018 this approach also depends on existence of detailed measured data that are often not available in this paper a new and optimised fe model ferm 1d is developed and tested with analytical models solutions under different conditions in addition to verification against field data for soils with multi layer behavior the interaction between the radon 222rn different mechanisms such as diffusion advection decay and generation is explained in details transport numbers are proposed that determine conditions under which each mechanism of diffusion advection decay and generation dominates a transport similarity concept is presented to show that different combination of mechanisms and model parameters can produce the same radon activity concentration profile moreover new prospective is presented to modeling soils with multi layer radon transport characteristics and behavior 2 a finite element model for222rn transport equation when considering the unsteady radon 222r influencing mechanisms from the deep soil depths upward vertically to the soil surface it can be represented in one dimension 1d as 1 c t x d c x v c x Œª c g where c is the activity concentration of 222rn in the pore air voids of the soil bq m3 t is time s x is the vertical distance measured from the ground surface downward m d is the 222rn diffusion coefficient m2 s v is the air advection velocity of radon transport m s usually vertically upward due to the pressure difference Œª is 222rn decay constant known to be 2 1 10 6 1 s and g is the generation of 222rn due to radium content in the soil bq m3 s the term on the left hand side of eq 1 represents the rate of change of 222rn with time at any distance x due to the interaction of the different mechanisms on the right hand side of the equation under steady state conditions this term is zero and throughout this study only steady conditions will be discussed radon activity concentration is considered only in the pore air voids so the model is valid only for dry soil conditions and the effect of soil moisture and pore water saturation are not considered herein the first term on the right hand side of eq 1 is the transport of 222rn due to molecular diffusion caused by the existence of the activity concentration difference between the large radon activity concentration at the deep soil depth and the relatively small radon activity concentration at the ground surface the second term is the advective transport of radon due to a pressure gradient that drives an air flow with a velocity v given by the darcy s law which will be given in eq 2 the third term is the natural decay of 222rn half lifetime of 3 825 days and the fourth term is the generation of 222rn due to radium content in the soil column kohl et al 1994 stated that the spatial difference of radon activity concentration that exist between the surface c 0 and the underground induces a diffusive radon flow towards the surface and that an advective radon flow can be initiated if a spatial air pressure difference exists in the subsurface nazaroff 1992 concludes that the advective flux is mostly due to temperature differences between the free surface and the building due to wind or due to ventilation and heating inside the house the flow velocity m s 1 in the soil pore air can be described by the 1d darcy s law provided the reynolds number is smaller than about 4 and it could be given as 2 v 1 Œµ k Œº p x where Œµ is the soil porosity k is the permeability m2 Œº is the air dynamic viscosity pa s and p is the pressure pa iakovleva and ryzhakova 2003 used the radon transport equation to obtain the advective velocity however this requires knowing the radon activity concentration profile and the diffusion coefficient the pressure field is given by the 1d laplace equation as 3 x k Œº p x 0 it should be noted that eqs 1 2 and 3 correspond to the case in which the following assumptions limitations are made as stated by nazaroff 1992 any transport of radon that may result from the diffusion of another species in soil air is neglected any possible adsorption of radon on the surfaces of the soil grains is neglected any moisture migration and any migration of radon within the water are neglected water content in soil is negligible the superficial velocity vector is described by the darcy s law as in eq 2 the soil is isotropic and homogeneous with respect to the diffusion coefficient permeability porosity emanation coefficient radium content and bulk density however later on the finite element model formulation allows for different values of these parameters in the soil multilayers i e non homogenous soil properties can be considered soil gas is incompressible for the range of pressures of interest researchers have solved the one dimensional radon transport equation eq 1 using different methods for example kohl et al 1994 used the finite element code fracture while savovic et al 2012 used the explicit finite difference method font 1997 presented analytical solutions to the steady state version of eq 1 under diffusion dominant advection dominant and including all of the four mechanisms hafez and awad 2016 solved eq 1 using the two node linear finite elements and 4 gaussian quadrature points for numerical integration of the element matrices their model is run in unsteady mode using the implicit crank nicolson method for time integration steady state conditions are reached when the maximum difference of activity concentrations between the consecutive time steps at any given node is less than a specified tolerance it should be noted that numerical integration suits differential equations with variable coefficients and it leads to increasing in the number of arithmetic operations every arithmetic operation in the computer is carried out with finite digits and hence there would be truncation or round off errors with the increase of the number of arithmetic operations the likelihood of occurrence of significant effect due to round off errors increases also the model presented in this paper is run in steady mode directly i e the left hand side of eq 1 is equal to zero thus the 222rn transport equation adopted herein has the form 4 x d c x v c x Œª c g 0 equation 4 and eq 1 have constant coefficients d v and Œª and constant generation g which enable the integrations of the element matrices to be carried out directly without the need for numerical integration consequently significant reduction of the number of arithmetic operations occurs this technique is already known thompson 2005 however it is not often used as most fe modellers tend to use standard fe codes which automatically use numerical integration to accommodate varying coefficients as numerical integration is unnecessary herein a huge number of computations would be saved the details of using the finite element method for solving the one dimensional transport equation is found in thompson 2005 and hafez and awad 2016 the two differences between hafez and awad 2016 and ferm 1d are a the first is run in unsteady mode and b numerical integrations are done in the first to form the element matrices in the ferm 1d model which also uses the two node linear elements numerical integration of the element matrices is avoided and integration is carried out in exact form the 2 by 2 element stiffness matrix is then given following thompson 2005 as 5 d Œ¥ x v 2 Œª Œ¥ x 3 d Œ¥ x v 2 Œª Œ¥ x 6 d Œ¥ x v 2 Œª Œ¥ x 6 d Œ¥ x v 2 Œª Œ¥ x 3 where Œ¥x is the element length the right hand side element matrix for constant generation is given as 6 g Œ¥ x 2 g Œ¥ x 2 it should be noted that the finite element formulation in the ferm 1d allows the variables e g diffusion coefficient velocity porosity permeability radon generation etc to have constant values within each element therefore these variables are allowed to be different from element to element and from one soil layer to another layer this causes modeling of radon transport with inhomogeneous or multi layer soil properties to become possible and it will be done later in hafez and awad 2016 model where four quadrature points are used for numerical integrations each term in the element matrices is evaluated four times one evaluation at each quadrature point if there are 3 matrices for diffusion advection and decay and each matrix has dimension of 2 by 2 12 total terms and one column vector with two terms then there is 14 terms this means 14 4 56 evaluations per every element in ferm 1d these 56 evaluations are avoided and it can be stated that the current developed model is significantly faster i e 56 times faster and hence more efficient than that by hafez and awad 2016 this characteristic of element matrices integrated in closed form is very useful when having very large number of elements the same advantage is there in two and three dimensional extensions of the developed model where significant time is saved in forming the element matrices because usually there is large number of elements to cover the solution domain a greater advantage is also achieved when performing unsteady simulations for which a future version of this model is planned if the time step is selected as one second and the unsteady simulation is required for a month for example that means there is 2 592 million time steps if there are 1000 elements then there will be 145 152 billion more evaluations by typical finite element models such as by hafez and awad 2016 which use numerical integration than by ferm 1d if one day simulation is required the saving would be about 4 8 billion evaluations indeed avoiding numerical integration when forming the element matrices is a big saving in the computational time in the following are numerical investigations and analyses of the different radon influencing mechanisms in addition to explain the modeling of radon mechanisms some modeling details are presented to gain useful numerical lessons 3 results and discussion as stated before radon movement in soils is affected by the combined effect of diffusion advection decay and generation mechanisms to understand radon movement in soils it is necessary to first understand how different combinations of the influencing mechanisms are working and interacting which is discussed and highlighted this offers new insight and interesting observations before coming to the cases that include all the four mechanisms and multi layer behavior 3 1 diffusion and decay mechanisms if there is no pressure gradient due to for example constant temperature profile in the soil and ambient air then advection can be assumed as zero it is also possible that no generation exists due to absence of radium 226 radon source leaving diffusion and decay as the only active mechanisms the 222rn transport equation under diffusion and decay mechanisms v 0 and g 0 becomes then as 7 d d 2 c d x 2 Œª c 0 the following boundary conditions could be assumed 8 c 0 co 0 c l cl the length of the domain or soil depth l is assumed as 10 0 m which is divided into 100 elements and the diffusion coefficient is taken as 1 0 10 6 m2 s the boundary conditions are taken as c 0 0 and c l 10 59650 bq m3 the values of l d and c l 10 are taken according to kohl et al 1994 who used 20 finite elements fig 1 shows excellent match between ferm 1d and the exact solution given hereinafter by eq 12 the exact solution for the diffusion and decay case is given in eq 12 by substituting the advective velocity v 0 the maximum difference between ferm 1d and the exact solution is 19 24 bq m3 the percentage relative error is defined here as the calculated value analytical or measured value analytical or measured value 100 the value of 19 24 bq m3 amounts to a percentage relative error of 0 0899 this occurs at distance of 9 3 m below the ground surface where the radon profile is steep in that region eq 7 can be made dimensionless the subscripted variables are dimensionless as 9 d 2 c d x 2 Œª l 2 d c 0 it can be seen from eq 9 that the dimensionless number œÄdc Œª l2 d controls 222rn transport under diffusion and decay mechanisms for the above data the value of Œª l2 d is 210 as Œª and l are constants herein to study effects of variation of œÄdc the diffusion coefficient d will be changed to get different values for œÄdc such as 600 100 25 and 10 a value of zero for this dimensionless number is only possible by letting Œª equal to zero fig 2 shows as expected the activity concentration values increase with decrease of the dimensionless number œÄdc Œª l2 d due to increasing of the diffusion effect the case with œÄdc 0 would be the case of pure diffusion which exists for non decaying substances it would be a straight line connecting the two boundary activity concentrations where the exact solution is given as c x c o c l c o l x for decaying substances such as radon this can be hypothetically obtained by assuming the generation term is cancelling the decay term opposite signs while absence of a pressure gradient causes zero advective velocity v 0 it should be noted that ajayi et al 2018 presented dimensionless numbers such as œÄdc and peclet numbers however they only focused on their effects on the radon flux in this study effects of the dimensionless numbers on the radon flux are addressed in addition to their effects on the radon vertical profile 3 2 diffusion decay and generation mechanisms it is possible that no advection exists due to absence of a pressure gradient leaving diffusion decay and generation as the active mechanisms eq 4 under the diffusion decay and generation mechanisms becomes 10 x d c x Œª c g 0 the boundary conditions are as in eq 8 following kohl et al 1994 the length of the domain or soil depth l is assumed as 10 0 m and the activity concentration cl at the deep soil is assumed as 59650 bq m3 the value of g 0 1252125 bq m 3 s 1 is taken in this example assuming the radium 226 content of ara 50 bq kg as constant all over the soil depth and 100 elements are used as seen in fig 3 it is noticed that the radon activity concentration at the deep soil boundary cl 59650 bq m3 is advancing constantly up to a depth of about 4 m after which the profile is plunging to zero activity concentration at the ground surface fig 3 reveals that the decay term did not allow increase in radon activity concentration above the cl value indicating that the decay effect is felt over the entire depth in the first 4 m below the surface the effect of a boundary condition c 0 0 is felt the high difference in radon activity concentration between cl and co drives large radon flux out of the soil causing a plunging shape of the radon profile 3 3 diffusion advection and decay mechanisms when radium 226 which is the radon source is zero or very small in the soil depth down to x l but beneath that depth it exists this results in domination of the diffusion advection and decay mechanisms eq 1 under the conditions of steady no radon generation constant diffusion coefficient and constant advection velocity becomes 11 d d 2 c d x 2 v dc dx Œª c 0 equation 11 includes the diffusion and advection transport mechanisms in addition to the decay of 222rn the analytical solution to eq 11 was given by telford 1983 as 12 c x c l e l x v 2 d s i n h x v 2 4 d 2 Œª d sinh l v 2 4 d 2 Œª d where cl is the boundary radon activity concentration at x l and l is the length of the domain or the soil depth at which radon originates and at maximum activity concentration fig 4 shows ferm 1d prediction is indistinguishable from the exact solution given by eq 12 using 100 elements the maximum absolute error in predicting 222rn activity concentrations occurs fig 5 at x 9 0 m in the area of steep activity concentration gradients with value of 6 579 bq m3 the predicted 222rn is 21225 71 bq m3 while the exact solution value is 21232 29 bq m3 which results in small percentage relative error of about 0 031 the distribution of the errors in this case is shown in fig 5 where it is seen that the zone of maximum errors exists close to the deep soil side where the activity concentration at the boundary is maximum and in this zone the maximum errors lie in the interval from 7 m x 10 m however the maximum percentage relative error is seen from fig 6 to be located toward the soil surface at x 1 3 m with value of 0 257 the relatively large radon activity concentrations values near the deep soil side cause the percentage relative errors to be small over there while the small radon activity concentrations values near the soil surface cause the percentage relative errors to be high toward the soil surface side kohl et al 1994 had their deviations percentage relative error when using the fe model fracture below 1 while savovic et al 2012 had their deviations below 0 2 however savovic et al 2012 obtained the steady state numerical solution by using the explicit finite difference method in unsteady mode and made tens of thousands of numerical runs to reach steady state conditions hafez and awad 2016 fe implicit model has the same accuracy as the current model and in their model only two numerical runs are needed to reach steady state conditions only one numerical run is needed herein because ferm 1d is run directly in steady state conditions fig 7 shows comparison of the different 222rn transport mechanisms for diffusion and adevction only mechanisms assuming hypothetically the generation term is cancelling the decay term as each one has opposite sign to the other the activity concentration could be given by eq 12 with Œª 0 a measure of the transport character of this case would be the dimensionless number peclet no pe v l d which is taken as equal to 10 in fig 7 the value of pe 10 indicates advection is much more dominant than diffusion it can be noticed that the 222rn activity concentration at any point along the soil depth except the two boundaries are maximum in advection dominated conditions followed by diffusion dominated conditions while the decay diffusion dominated conditions come at last the diffusion alone straight line profile could be considered as the intermediate steady state profile high advection velocities push the advection diffusion profile higher than the diffusion line at any given point and the deep soil boundary activity concentration moves to the direction of zero activity concentration the soil surface decay domination reduces the level of radon activity concentration considerably below the diffusion line as the radon flux at the soil surface depends on the slope of the activity concentration profile at x 0 then it can be noticed according to fig 7 the radon flux to ground surface is higher in advection dominated flows than by diffusion dominated flows while it is close to zero in the other two cases for the values of the parameters given in this case the radon profile is located just above the decay dominant profile and below the diffusion line to the best of the author s knowledge past researchers have not discussed in quantitative details the conditions that makes each transport mechanism dominant a trial for doing this is made herein as follows consider the dimensionless number obtained by dividing the peclet number by the œÄdc number this process results in a new number called herein the transport number œÄ1 given as 13 œÄ 1 t h e t r a n s p o r t n u m b e r v Œª l for the values of v l and Œª used herein œÄ1 0 0476 0 05 it can be stated according to fig 8 for this value of œÄ1 that the decay transport dominates another two dimensionless numbers could be stated as well as 14 œÄ2 v2 Œª d 15 œÄ3 v Œª l3 d2 the dimensionless numbers œÄ2 and œÄ3 include the diffusion coefficient and œÄ3 includes the soil depth l where the radon activity concentration is the highest or the depth at which radon originates for the same data set above the values of œÄ2 and œÄ3 are 0 476 and 2100 respectively fig 8 shows the effect of variation of œÄ1 on the radon activity concentration profiles the dimensionless number œÄ1 has the advantage over the dimensionless numbers œÄ2 and œÄ3 in that the quantities included in it can be measured or predetermined the advective velocity appearing in œÄ1 can be directly determined through the darcy s law eq 2 while there is no generally accepted equation for the determination of the diffusion coefficient in other words the velocity decay constant and l appearing in œÄ1 can be known with high certainty while œÄ2 and œÄ3 have the diffusion coefficient which could be known with less certainty for given Œª and l in the case discussed herein the different values of œÄ1 in fig 8 were obtained by assuming different values of the advective velocity the importance of the soil column length or depth was pointed out by shitrit et al 2012 they reported that column length affects the radon exhalation rates from the soil into the air due to the effect of radon decay because radon has a short half life in longer columns more radon decays before it reaches the ground surface to determine the value of l it is suggested that the migration distance defined in font 1997 and font and baixeras 2003 could be used for l they defined the migration distance of radon gas in the soil as the distance at which radon activity concentration in the soil is the deep radon activity concentration reduced a factor 1 e 1 when both activity concentration and pressure gradients are considered the diffusion length d Œª 1 2could also be tried for l interestingly if the length scale l in œÄ1 is replaced by the diffusion length then œÄ1 v dŒª 1 2 or œÄ1 œÄ2 1 2 the migration length stated by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 as 1 a where a is given by eq 26 could also be a candidate for the characteristic length l in œÄ1 further investigation is required in this respect it should be noted that the length scale l does not reflect only radon decay and diffusion but it reflects also radon generation consequently œÄ1 includes all of the four mechanisms it is noted that for low values of œÄ1 such as 0 01 or 0 05 the decay mechanism dominates and the radon activity concentrations approach zero values almost at the mid depth of the soil column x 5 0 m i e it is not expected to have a significant radon flux out of the soil as most of the radon had decayed for relatively high values of œÄ1 such as 2 0 or 1 0 advection dominates and there is high steep radon profiles at the soil ground surface with an associated significant outward radon flux it is interesting to note that for the highly advective profiles in fig 8 there is no horizontal plateau as was seen in the pure advective flow in fig 7 at pe 10 in the absence of radon generation 222rn decay mechanism will always be there and the radon profile will have a decreasing trend in going up to the soil ground surface without a horizontal plateau the radon activity concentration profile at œÄ1 0 2 fig 8 is the profile at which the radon activity concentration profile at the soil surface appears to just touches the surface with near zero activity concentration this value of œÄ1 0 2 appears to be the dividing line or separation border line between advection and decay diffusion domination it can be stated that above œÄ1 0 2 advection dominates and below this value decay diffusion dominates the 222rn radon flux out of the soil column qx could be stated as 16 q x d dc dx v c d c 2 c 1 Œ¥ x v c 1 where Œ¥x is the distance between the first at the ground surface and second nodes i e the step length and the numbers in brackets refer to the node numbers as seen in the middle term in eq 16 the outward flux consists of that due to diffusion and advection in the right hand side of eq 16 the activity concentration gradient is calculated using the activity concentration at the first node c 1 at x 0 and the activity concentration at the second node c 2 at x Œ¥x the boundary condition at x 0 was taken as c 1 0 causing the flux due to advection to be zero and therefore the radon outward flux is only due to diffusion however advection effects on the radon outward flux could be manifested by changes in velocity and advection would be due to effects of the velocity on the radon activity concentration gradient dc dx near the soil surface thus velocity and hence advection affect dc dx which in turn affects the outward radon flux the non zero surface boundary condition will be considered later when discussing radon transport in soils with multi layer behavior table 1 shows the radon outward flux and transport classification for different values of the dimensionless numbers it is noted that the radon outward flux increases with increase in all the dimensionless numbers the increase in these dimensionless numbers is made herein by increasing the advective velocity the radon calculated surface flux by hafez and awad 2016 in different countries greece germany south africa and jordan was between 0 2 and 8 2 mbq m2 s for this range it appears according to table 1 that the values of œÄ1 of 1 0 and 2 0 produce very high radon outward flux 0 4 and 1 26 bq m2 s respectively two cases of greece data discussed in hafez and awad 2016 had œÄ1 0 18 with radon soil surface outward fluxes of 1 68 and 3 17 mbq m2 s for œÄ1 0 2 table 1 shows radon outward flux of 3 26 mbq m2 s the value of œÄ1 0 2 could be considered as the starting value for appreciable outward radon surface flux one thousand 1000 elements were needed to capture the steep radon activity concentration profiles in fig 8 because of the high advective flow table 2 shows with the increase of œÄ1 increase of advection relative to decay the point of maximum error maximum difference between the exact and fe numerical solutions moves from the deep soil side to the soil surface for decay dominant conditions the absolute error is very small and it increases with increase in advection but remain within a relative error of 0 96 table 3 shows the maximum relative errors move also toward the soil surface with increase in œÄ1 and more specifically starting from œÄ1 0 1 the maximum relative error is just right at the second node 3 4 diffusion advection decay and generation mechanisms when the four mechanisms of diffusion advection decay and generation exist the radon transport equation is expressed as by eq 4 the general solution to eq 4 i e without considering particular boundary conditions was reported by font 1997 and antonopoulos domis et al 2009 the analytical solution to eq 4 with the boundary conditions c 0 co and c l cl is given by ajayi et al 2018 as 17 c x c l g Œª c o g Œª e Œæ l e Œ≥ x c l g Œª c o g

1252125 bq m 3 s 1 corresponding to ara 50 bq kg l 10 m c 0 0 and c l 59650 bq m3 fig 9 shows the success of ferm 1d model in predicting the radon activity concentrations when compared to values from eq 17 one thousand finite elements were required to simulate the steep gradients existed near the soil surface table 4 shows that the maximum absolute difference between the numerical and analytical radon activity concentration is 0 491 bq m3 at activity concentration of approximately 33 185 bq m3 when comparing this case in fig 9 to the case in fig 4 where generation was not included the effect of existence of radon generation is significant causing the deep soil boundary activity concentration to increase up to a depth of 2 m after which it plunges to zero at the surface similarities between fig 3 fig 7 for pe 10 and fig 9 suggest a transport similarity concept a transport similarity concept is when the same vertical profile of radon exists under different combinations of the radon mechanisms 3 5 effect of pressure gradient and soil properties on radon transport for constant soil properties such as permeability and porosity eq 3 can be solved for the pressure distribution along the soil depth and eq 2 for the velcoity the pressure profile could be given from eq 3 as 19 p x p l p o l x p o where pl is the pressure at x l the deep soil and po is the pressure at x 0 the soil surface the velocity is then given using eq 2 as 20 v k Œº p l p o l for v 1 0 10 6 m s k 10 11 m2 Œº 1 8 10 6 pa s 0 4 and l 10 m which are typical values the pressure difference along the soil depth pl po becomes 0 72 pa it should be noted that kohl et al 1994 yakovleva and parovik 2010 savovic et al 2012 and hafez and awad 2016 selected advective velocity equal to v 1 0 10 6 m s in their radon model studies in addition based on radon measurements in greece in the next section a value of the advective velocity as 1 0 10 6 m s was found sufficient this velocity is given as constant along the soil depth equation 20 could be used to obtain the following form for the dimensionless number œÄ1 as 21 œÄ 1 k p l p o Œº Œª l 2 in this form effects of permeability pressure gradient porosity and air viscosity are included in œÄ1 high permeability and pressure difference increases œÄ1 and therefore increases advection while an increase in the rest of the parameters appearing in the denominator of eq 21 decreases œÄ1 and thus reduces advection effects for œÄ1 2 the pressure difference pl po 30 pa and for œÄ1 1 the pressure difference pl po 15 pa in summary with the increase in pressure difference pl po velocity increases then advection increases and eventually the radon outward surface flux increases 3 6 soil multi layer behavior and non zero soil surface radon 222r activity concentration antonopoulos domis et al 2009 stated that if the interest is in the radon activity concentration at the soil surface it is clear that the usually used boundary condition c 0 0 not only gives zero radon activity concentration at the soil surface but also neglects the contribution of advection to the radon current or flux at the surface of the soil they concluded that c 0 0 is conceptually not appropriate instead they considered the following gradient boundary condition at the surface 22 dc dx x 0 k 1 c 0 c a where k1 is a proportionality constant and ca is the radon activity concentration in the bulk of air over the soil surface the radon soil surface flux boundary condition then becomes 23 q 0 d dc dx x 0 d k 1 c 0 c a hafez and awad 2016 had similar treatment of the surface flux boundary condition such as that in eq 23 but they took the product d k1 h where h was considered as a radon air soil transfer coefficient antonopoulos domis et al 2009 used the following boundary condition at the deep soil given as 24 dc dx x 0 antonopoulos domis et al 2009 analytically solved the radon transport equation first in a one layer model mode eq 4 together with the boundary conditions as given by eq 23 and eq 24 and obtained 25 c x g Œª 1 1 a k 1 g Œª c a e a x where a is given by 26 a v 2 d v 2 d 2 Œª d 1 2 the radon activity concentration at the soil surface x 0 can be deduced from eq 25 by letting x 0 to obtain 27 c 0 g Œª 1 1 a k 1 g Œª c a radon activity concentrations of soil depth 0 2 6 m were measured by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 during the years 2002 2003 and 2003 2004 on the aristotle university campus greece they observed multi layer behavior in which the radon activity concentration profile did not follow the well known monotonous increase which levels off to a saturation value they performed least square fitting technique of eq 25 while neglecting ca to the measured data for a depth of 1 3 m this resulted in a 0 905 m 1 k1 186 m 1 and g Œª 20 000 bq m3 and a radon activity concentration at the soil surface c 0 97 bq m3 the exact calculated value is 96 841 bq m3 unfortunately for a given value of a there is a set of infinite pairs d v that satisfy eq 26 which means it is not possible to deduce the actual pair d v from the measured radon profile in a way this supports the transport similarity concept stated earlier the non uniqueness of the pair d v constituted a difficulty in comparing ferm 1d with the analytical solution as given by eq 25 because the pair d v is needed as input data in the fe numerical model ferm 1d several pairs d v have to be assumed which satisfy eq 26 for a 0 905 m 1 after several trials it was found that the pair d v 2 45 10 6 m2 s 1 0 10 6 m s gives a 0 9056 m 1 these values made the fe model profile with 100 elements to be very close to the analytical solution in eq 25 as seen in fig 10 it is noted that the advection velocity was found in this case to be 1 0 10 6 m s the activity concentration boundary condition at the deep soil was taken according to eq 25 while substituting x 2 6 m and g Œª 20 000 bq m3 yielding c l 2 6 m 18112 bq m3 it should be noted that the one layer model solution expressed in eq 25 does not simulate the greece field data which is seen in fig 13 and fig 14 the maximum difference between the ferm 1d model and the analytical activity concentrations maximum error is located near x 1 0 m as seen in fig 11 this maximum error has a value of about 300 bq m3 but its relative error is only 2 the maximum percentage relative error between ferm 1d and the analytical model given by eq 25 occurred exactly at the soil surface x 0 as seen in fig 12 gradually diminishes toward the deep soil in nearly straight line variation it has a magnitude equal to 4 3 as the fe model predicts c 0 101 bq m3 while eq 25 gives c 0 97 bq m3 the predicted ferm 1d model radon flux at the soil surface is 0 0455 bq m2 s while a very close value of 0 0442 bq m2 s is obtained from the analytical solution if pure diffusion is considered in this case v 0 then the diffusion coefficient according to eq 26 becomes 2 564 10 6m2 s for a 0 905 m 1 in this case ferm 1d and the analytical solutions are almost identical with maximum error of 0 15 bq m3 at x 0 94 m the maximum percentage relative error is still at the soil surface but with a very small magnitude of 0 0013 the predicted surface activity concentration of 96 843 97 bq m3 compares to the analytical model value of 96 841 97 bq m3 with an actual difference of 0 002 bq m3 again this confirms and supports the concept of transport similarity stated earlier the radon measured data from antonopoulos domis et al 2009 was composed of two data sets named here greece 1 and greece 2 spanning the years 2002 to 2004 as seen in fig 13 and fig 14 the measured radon activity concentration in green dots increased with soil depth but did not follow the well known monotonous increase indicating a multi layer behavior in both distributions radon activity concentration increased up to a soil depth of 0 8 m seemed to remain constant at depths of 0 8 1 3 m and then increased again after that antonopoulos domis et al 2009 assumed two layer soil model with two different diffusion advection characteristics but still assumed zero radon activity concentration at the soil surface they applied least squares fitting of their model analytical solution to the measured data the first layer had soil depths less than 1 3 m in which a was found as 1 4 m 1 and equal to 0 55 m 1 for depths higher than 1 3 m in the second layer as pointed before for fixed value of a there is no unique set of d v so the diffusion coefficient and advection velocity can not be uniquely determined they applied the non zero boundary condition eq 23 to only the soil layer with depth less than 1 3 m in the one layer model hafez and awad 2016 assumed two and three layer model with different diffusion coefficients for each layer and with constant advection velocity all over the soil depth for their three layer model the diffusion coefficients were 2 5 10 6 m2 s depths from 0 0 m to 0 9 m 4 8 10 6 m2 s depths from 0 9 m to 1 5 m and 8 5 10 6 m2 s depths from 1 5 m to 2 6 m respectively while the advection velocity was assumed constant as 1 0 10 6 m s they did not assume zero surface radon activity concentration but used the following surface boundary condition 28 q 0 h c a c 0 they found h which has dimension as velocity to have a value of 2 0 10 6 m s the radon surface activity concentration was found as 850 bq m3 and 1640 bq m3 for greece 1 and greece 2 data respectively they compared these values to the linear extrapolation of radon graphs by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 up to the soil surface the extrapolation resulted in radon activity concentrations of 550 950 bq m3 for greece 1 and 300 2 200 bq m3 for greece 2 these values are much higher than 97 bq m3 surface radon activity concentration value that was estimated by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 in this study a different approach is taken other than adopting different diffusion coefficients for each layer as was done by hafez and awad 2016 this could be justified by the transport similarity concept discussed earlier a constant diffusion coefficient is assumed in line with the practice often adopted by most researchers while the multi layer behavior of the soil layers is explained in terms of different radium content in the soil i e different ara values for each layer this is supported by the fact that the measured data show variation of the radium content different ara along the soil depth the advection velocity could be taken either as constant or variable per layer two scenarios are considered in the first scenario the diffusion coefficient is taken as 1 0 10 6 m2 s while the advection velocity is taken as 1 0 10 7 m s yielding a 1 4 for greece 1 case ara is assumed as 10 0 bq kg for soil depths less than 1 3 m and 14 25 bq kg for depths greater than 1 3 m the measured radium 226ra activity concentrations by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 ranged from 7 to 11 bq kg based on 10 measurements for soil depths less than 0 6 m but only one measurement existed at depth 1 6 m with ara ranging between 10 and 12 bq kg therefore the model assumed values for ara are very much in line with the measured values the surface boundary condition is taken as by eq 23 with k1 186 m 1 the quantity g Œª is found to be 32343 bq m3 by substituting the measured radon activity concentration of 31500 bq m3 at depth 2 6 m and k1 186 m 1 in eq 25 and solving for g Œª fig 13 shows very good agreement between the ferm 1d predictions and the greece 1 data while the one layer analytical model eq 25 activity concentrations are much too high of course the analytical model would do better if the a values from antonopoulos domis et al 2009 were used the ferm 1d radon profile where 100 elements were used is able to produce the change in the radon curvature profile as observed in the experimental data the predicted ferm 1d radon at the soil surface is 108 bq m3 compared to 97 bq m3 the value that is estimated by antonopoulos domis et al 2009 as the radon surface activity concentration for the greece 2 data the same values of the diffusion coefficient and advection velocity are taken as done in greece 1 case but different radon soil content ara s due to the observed more irregular radon profile than the greece 1 data for depths less than 0 8 m ara is taken as 10 bq kg for depths between 0 8 m and 1 5 m ara is taken as 7 bq kg and depths greater than 1 5 m ara is taken as 14 bq kg the intermediate layer having smallest value for ara is in confirmation with the less radon activity concentration there and at the deep soil boundary the value for g Œª is taken as 30802 6 bq m3 while a radon activity concentration of 30000 bq m3 is taken as the boundary condition at depth 2 6 m according to the measured data due to higher irregularity of greece 2 data compared to greece 1 data the agreement of ferm 1d predictions with greece 2 data as seen in fig 14 is less than at greece 1 however the agreement is still good the predicted ferm 1d radon at the soil surface is 100 bq m3 compared to the antonopoulos domis et al 2009 estimated value of 97 bq m3 in the second scenario the diffusion coefficient is kept constant equal to 1 0 10 6 m2 s while the radon soil content and advection velocity were allowed to vary per layer for the first layer 0 0 x 1 3 m ara is taken as 9 5 bq kg and the velocity is 1 0 10 7 m s for the second layer 1 3 x 1 6 m ara is taken as 8 1 bq kg and the velocity is 0 5 10 6 m s and for the third layer x 1 6 m ara is taken as 13 56 bq kg and the velocity is 1 0 10 6 m s the pair d v results in value of a 0 206 m 1 fig 15 shows excellent agreement is between ferm 1d predictions and greece 1 field data for the radon profile the ferm 1d soil surface radon activity concentration is 104 bq m3 versus 97 bq m3 estimated value from measurements the radon soil surface flux by the model is 0 020 bq m2 s of which 94 5 is due to diffusion and the small 4 5 is due to advection because of the small advective velocity fig 15 shows some measured data points in greece 1 data in which these points are deviating from the ferm 1d model results such as the points at distances x 1 2 1 3 1 6 and 1 7 m it is very likely that the actual radon profile is smooth due to the diffusion effect and perhaps there are unsteady effects or two three dimensional effects not accounted for in the 1d steady model the objective here is to show that the soil multi layer behavior can be simulated and modelled to an accurate degree with a one dimensional modeling approach indeed the more accurate the model parameters the more accurate the results another scenario is implemented in which the same data for the three layers as above is used but adopting hafez and awad s 2016 boundary condition eq 28 for different values of h fig 16 shows that the value of h 0 0002 2 0 e 04 m s gives the radon activity concentrations of the greece 1 data and similar results as the ferm 1d model in fig 15 in fact the value of h 0 0002 m s is equivalent to using k1 186 m 1 the radon surface activity concentrations are 97 906 and 5555 bq m3 for the different h values of 2 10 4 2 10 5 and 2 10 6 m s respectively and the surface outward radon flux are 0 01902 0 0179 and 0 0115 bq m2 s the profile with h 2 10 5 m s resembles that of hafez and awad 2016 but both models have different h diffusion and advection coefficients which highlights that different sets of parameters and different boundary conditions used in multi layer modeling give the same model results which is in line with the transport similarity concept this point requires further research as to test the uniqueness of model input data the discussion of this case highlights the importance of having a complete measured data set that includes all the relevant parameters use of numerical or analytical models should be guided by existing field data for a model calibration and verification a complete data set is however rare to find to the best of the author s knowledge it is worth to mention here that in fluid mechanics hydrology and hydraulics two well known dimensionless numbers are often used to delineate the flow characteristics through dividing the flow in open channels pipes and ducts into different flow regimes or types the first number is reynolds number re œÅ v h Œº where œÅ is the fluid density and h is a characteristic length such as the hydraulic radius or the flow depth it is well known that in pipes for re less than 2000 the flow is classified as laminar while for re greater than 3000 the flow is turbulent with a transition zone between these two limits the second number is froude number f r v gh where g is the gravitational acceleration for fr less than 1 the flow is tranquil or subcritical and for fr greater than 1 it is supercritical in spite of the wide applicability of the transport phenomenon in many science and engineering applications unfortunately there has not been in previous works transport number s that would characterize or divide the transport processes into distinct transport regimes or mechanisms it is hoped that this study provides contribution to this point by introducing dimensionless transport numbers such as œÄ1 v Œª l where it was found that value of œÄ1 0 2 appears to be the dividing line or separation border line between advection and decay domination the last column in table 1 provides also useful transport classification although this study discusses the transport of radon gas in the soils similarity exists to transport processes of other substances in various fluids for example the transport of contaminants or pollutants in water and air bears significant resemblances and similarities to transport of radon in soils this is because these transport phenomena are all governed by the same transport differential equation with the differences lying in the boundary conditions and the values of the model parameters such as the diffusion and advection coefficients based on the above several findings and conclusions in this study are also useful in the investigations of transport of other pollutants in different mediums supported by the similarity transport concept which is proposed herein for example the proposed transport numbers can be applied to water and air quality investigations to determine suitable values for the transport numbers which characterizes the transport processes future development of ferm 1d model includes adding an unsteady component introducing a convective radon transport term in the radon transport differential equation introduction of a network model which provides quasi two dimensional simulations introduction of a two phase radon transport model and application of the ferm 1d to model radon drainage systems beneath houses to divert radon away from houses 4 conclusions this study indicates that finite element numerical modeling provides a valuable tool in understanding radon transport and movement through one and multi layer soils the following points can also be concluded the transport mechanisms of diffusion advection decay and generation in different combinations can be modelled successfully using the finite element method the developed one dimensional finite element model ferm 1d in this study proved to be efficient and accurate for modeling radon transport in soils in principle transport numbers can be developed that separates the different transport mechanisms and determine conditions under which each mechanism of diffusion advection decay and generation dominates diffusion and decay and diffusion advection decay profiles have concave downward profile when all of diffusion advection decay and generation exist the radon profile could have a horizontal plateau advancing from the deep soil then it plunges down when approaching the ground surface for diffusion advection decay conditions for low values of the dimensionless number œÄ1 v Œª l such as 0 01 or 0 05 the decay mechanism dominates and the radon activity concentrations approach zero values almost at the mid depth of the soil column i e there is not a significant radon flux out of the soil for relatively high values of œÄ1 such as 2 0 or 1 0 advection dominates and there are high steep radon profiles at the soil ground surface with an associated significant outward radon flux the radon activity concentration profile at œÄ1 0 2 is the profile at which the radon activity concentration profile at the soil surface appears to just touches the surface with zero activity concentration this value of œÄ1 0 2 appears to be the dividing line or separation border line between advection and decay domination it can be stated that above œÄ1 0 2 advection dominates and below this values decay dominates multi layer soil behavior can be best described using numerical modeling such as by the finite element method ferm 1d where no restrictions on the number of layers are required it is important to note the variation of the radium soil content which explains multi layer soil behavior in the case of greece data non zero radon soil surface boundary condition must be used if a realistic radon soil surface flux out from the ground surface or through buildings foundation is required a transport similarity concept is presented in which different combinations of mechanisms and model parameters can produce the same vertical radon activity concentration profile different sets of model parameters and boundary conditions used in multi layer modeling may lead to the same radon activity concentration profile highlighting the non uniqueness of data 5 declarations ethics approval and consent to participate not applicable consent

3293,rough walled fractures in rock masses as preferential pathways largely influence fluid flow solute and energy transport previous studies indicate that fracture aperture fields could be significantly modified due to shear displacement along fractures we report experimental observations and quantitative analyses of flow path evolution within a single fracture induced by shear displacement particle image velocimetry and refractive index matching techniques were utilized to determine fluid velocity fields inside a transparent 3d printed shear able rough fracture our analysis indicate that aperture variability and correlation length increase with the increasing shear displacement and they are the two key parameters which govern the increases in velocity variability velocity longitudinal correlation length streamline tortuosity and variability of streamline spacing the increase in aperture heterogeneity significantly impacts fluid flow behaviors whilst changes in aperture correlation length further refine these impacts to our best knowledge our study is the first direct measurements of fluid velocity fields and provides insights into the impact of fracture shear on flow behavior keywords shear displacement flow variability rough walled fracture particle image velocimetry piv refractive index matching correlation length c l 1 introduction in fractured rock masses fractures often serve as preferential pathways for fluid energy and solute transport auradou et al 2006 leung and zimmerman 2012 lang et al 2014 resulting in reduced fluid solute and heat breakthrough times compared to non fractured porous media these preferential fluid flow pathways are of great interest in the earth sciences lima et al 2020 ahkami et al 2020 kittil√§ et al 2019 kittil√§ et al 2020 as they can dictate the predominant movement of mass e g fluid and solute and energy e g heat inside the rock mass keller et al 1999 bodin et al 2003 klepikova et al 2014 thus an in depth understanding of fluid flow in fractures is of essential importance for the success of various industrial and scientific subsurface applications for instance oil and gas production geological carbon dioxide storage geothermal energy utilization and groundwater usage to name a few previous studies on fluid flow in fractures have often adopted a parallel plate model or hele shaw cell under the assumption of stokes flow wooding 1960 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 berkowitz and zhou 1996 studies such as pyrak nolte et al 1987 have shown the inadequacy of the parallel plate model in describing the fluid flow due to the complex geometries of rough fracture walls that play a critical role in determining fluid movement and thus transport of solutes and energy as a result the focus of fluid flow in fractures studies has substantially shifted towards investigating rough wall fractures using either rough wall fracture replicas e g surrogates and molds or actual natural fractures providing better representations of real world conditions yeo et al 1998 auradou et al 2005 koyama et al 2006 rong et al 2016 wang et al 2020 li et al 2019 in parallel with numerical studies of fluid flow in rough walled fractures e g walsh et al 2008 wang et al 2016 kong and chen 2018 where fluid flow was computed using computational fluid dynamics cfd such as lattice boltzmann methods parmigiani et al 2019 ahkami et al 2020 to solve the navier stokes equation various methods have been developed to experimentally measure and visualize fluid flow in rough wall fractures the overall the fractures hydraulic properties can be inferred using the measured volumetric flow rates as well as the pressure drops along the fractures lee and cho 2002 rong et al 2016 however these types of measurements do not provide detailed information on local fluid flow path characteristics such as the streamline geometry or the preferential flow paths in comparison with numerical studies e g walsh et al 2008 wang et al 2016 kong and chen 2018 flow path characteristics are more readily obtained using a transparent fracture surrogate and a fluid dye enabling direct visualizations of the development of preferential flow paths in rough wall fractures auradou et al 2005 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2018 li et al 2019 together with the overall volumetric flow rates through the fractures the dye movement may provide indirect fluid flow distribution but is limited by its ability to yield the local velocity field local fluid flow velocities can be quantified by scanning the fractures during the experiments using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri dijk and berkowitz 1999 however nmri scanning commonly suffers from its limited temporal and spatial resolutions ggladden and sedermanladden and sederman 2013 kim et al 2021 compared nmri measurements and cfd and found that mri results in significant underestimation of peak fluid velocity one commonly accepted method to produce high resolution fluid velocity fields is the particle image velocimetry piv technique while piv does have its own limitations see d and in wieneke 2015 it does not share the same spatial and temporal resolution limitation as nmri because of its optical measurement principle rapid evolution in light source and camera of higher resolution and higher frame rate easily break the piv resolution limitation as such piv is even used as a validation technique for nmri measurements of fluid velocity medero et al 2018 kim et al 2021 piv has been further successfully applied to fluid velocity determinations in porous media sen et al 2012 ppatil and liburdyatil and liburdy 2013 holzner et al 2015 in fractured media the Œº piv method has been employed to examine the relationship between solute tail shortening and the formation of eddies in a 2d cross section of a rough fracture lee et al 2015 and discovered that tail shortening is attributed to mass exchange between the main flow in the fracture and flow eddies developed in large aperture regions ahkami et al 2019 used the so called temporo ensemble piv method in a fractured porous medium to investigate the effect of matrix permeability on fluid flow through fractures in a 3d printed fractured porous medium and shown a log normal distribution of longitudinal velocity and a normal distribution of transversal velocity the hydraulic properties of a fracture with rough walls have been shown to be mainly controlled by the fracture aperture distribution renshaw 1995 auradou et al 2005 rong et al 2016 lima et al 2020 which could be significantly altered due to shear displacements of fracture walls during natural or induced seismic activities evans et al 2005 schultz et al 2018 ellsworth et al 2019 various experiments have been conducted to examine the effects of shear on fluid flow in rough wall fractures gentier et al 1997 yeo et al 1998 esaki et al 1999 auradou et al 2005 rong et al 2016 li et al 2019 where the hydraulic properties have been observed to be greatly altered auradou et al 2005 mallikamas and rajaram 2005 ishibashi et al 2016 wang et al 2020 due to shear dilation hydraulic anisotropy and scale effects as summarized by matsuki et al 2010 and due to geomechanical alterations such as grain size shrinking and surface gouging teufel 1987 auradou et al 2005 presented a decrease in permeability with shear parallel to the shear direction using a transparent fracture with a radial injection setup li et al 2019 utilized a clear cast of a rough fracture to capture the movement of a dye through the fracture and recorded a decrease in the number of contacts but an increase in the total contact area moreover fracture permeability perpendicular to shear was shown to increase while permeability parallel to shear was shown to decrease auradou et al 2005 mallikamas and rajaram 2005 the changes in permeability was demonstrated to associate with the changes in the variance of the aperture field auradou et al 2005 mallikamas and rajaram 2005 further suggested that the midplane fluid tortuosity needs to be quantified however except for few numerical studies on fluid flow through rough wall fractures koyama et al 2006 walsh et al 2008 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 kong and chen 2018 where fluid velocity fields were able to be computed no existing equivalent experiment has been performed to provide quantitative measurement on local fluid velocities over the entire fracture challenges still remain when experimentally quantifying the evolution of flow paths due to shear displacement in this paper we directly measured the evolution of flow paths induced by shear displacements these measurements are presented using quantitative analyses of fluid velocities which were determined using piv measurements on a shear able transparent 3d printed fracture to avoid image distortion we adopted the refractive index matching technique kong et al 2011 song et al 2015 we present our quantification by examining the impact of the shear displacement on the aperture distribution the streamline tortuosity and the connectivity of regions for different fluid velocity thresholds to the best of our knowledge such analyses have never yet been reported and provide greater insights into the consequences of fracture wall shearing on fluid flow through rough wall fractures 2 methodology fracture generation the fracture used in this study was numerically generated with the software synfrac provided by paul glover university of leeds uk glover et al 1998 and then 3d printed with a transparent material the settings used in synfrac to generate the fracture can be found in table a 1 in appendix a the dimensions of the fracture area are a length of parallel to flow l 100 mm and a width perpendicular to flow of w 50 mm the fracture top surface i e slide surface and the fracture bottom surface i e base surface are characterized by a mean joint roughness coefficient jrc of 3 66 0 33 and 3 60 0 36 respectively the low jrc values suggest a rather smooth fracture surface details of jrc calculation refer to appendix b fracture printing and refractive index matching the printing was done on a stratasys j735 which has a layer thickness of 14 Œºm while additive manufacturing deposits in layers we do not observe any significant impact from the so called stair stepping the printing material of the base and slide is veroclear with a refractive index of 1 514 song et al 2015 which was matched with a working fluid of the same refractive index to avoid optical distortions during imaging inspired by a solution found by song et al 2015 we created a new fluid solution as our working fluid which is a solution of 44 trans anethole and 56 mineral oil yielding a higher clarity and a lower flammability this refractive index ri matched fluid has a density of 0 91 g ml which is similar to that of water and a dynamic viscosity of Œº ri 9 87 mpa s here the viscosity of the ri matched solution was determined using the arrhenius model arrhenius 1887 1 ln Œº ri x s ln Œº t 1 x s ln Œº o where x s v t v t Œ≤ v o Œº t 2 6 mpa s is the viscosity of pure trans anethole Œº o 230 mpa s is the viscosity of pure oil Œ≤ 0 28 is an empirical constant between 0 1 and v t and v o are the volume fractions of the trans anethole and mineral oil respectively the refractive index of the solution was measured using the orf 1rs refractometer with an accuracy of 0 0005 nd shear mechanism to enable shear displacement the two rough surfaces of the fracture were printed separately on a static base and a movable slide fig 1 a when the slide and base were clamped together the slide was supported by the side walls of the base as seen in the side view of fig 1b and a fracture was formed between the slide and base a channel was fabricated on the top surface of the side walls of the base to accommodate an o ring for the fracture sealing to avoid side wall frictions between the base and slide during fracture shearing a small gap of 0 01 mm was left between the side walls of the base and the slide the gap width is of two orders of magnitude lower than the mean aperture of 0 52 mm see appendix b yielding negligible fluid flow through the gap this gap along with silicon lubricant on the o ring allows smooth shearing without any leaking the ri solution was injected into a flow distribution channel that was printed directed into the base ensuring an even flow across the fracture s transverse area we examined a total of seven shear distances 0 1 2 and 3 mm where the positive shear points to the direction of main fluid flow the fracture at zero displacement can be considered as a mated one but not a complete closure as indicated by the non zero aperture in this study the movement of the slide occurs parallel to the main fluid flow direction using a motor or hand crank the shear displacement was precisely monitored by a precision gauge with 0 001 mm accuracy to ensure an even force across the whole fracture the base and the slide were clamped together in a metal frame to a torque of 0 5 n m aperture measurement in this study the aperture field was measured in situ using the light transmission method detwiler et al 1999 which needs to be calibrated to convert the recorded light intensity to physical aperture through a scaling factor traditionally this calibration is done using either a calibration plate using an area of known aperture or the total volume of the fracture in our current setup the fracture was printed separately with two parts and a dead volume was prepared to allow the displacement leading to a large uncertainty in the calibration of the scaling factor using the aforementioned traditional methods therefore the aperture field was measured at each displacement in three steps hydraulic aperture determination using physical darcy s experiments acquisition of the apparent fracture aperture field and scaling factor determination first we measured the hydraulic aperture b h of the fracture at each shear displacement 0 1 2 and 3 mm using darcy s experiments under the assumption of the cubic law witherspoon et al 1980 oron and berkowitz 1998 2 b h 12 Œº lq w Œ¥ p 1 3 where q is the volumetric flow rate l is the fracture length w is the fracture width Œ¥ p is the corresponding pressure drop across the fracture length and Œº is the dynamic viscosity of the working fluid second at each shear displacement an apparent fracture aperture field was determined using the light transmission method detwiler et al 1999 mouza et al 2000 fig 2 shows the experimental setup of the apparent fracture aperture measurements during the measurements the fracture was first filled with the ri matched fluid followed by the imaging of light transmission through the fracture with a camera this yielded the baseline transmission of the fracture i no dye then pyrromethene a dye was added to the ri matched fluid again followed by the imaging of light transmission through the fracture i dye according to the light transmission method the apparent local fracture aperture b p can be determined using gray value ratio of the two images i e i no dye and i dye as shown in 3 b p Œ± ln i no dye i dye where Œ± is a common scaling factor for all shear positions see fig b 1 third the scaling factor Œ± was numerically regressed when the measured hydraulic aperture in the first step equals the numerically computed hydraulic aperture using the apparent fracture aperture obtained in the second step by solving the 2d reynolds equation zimmerman et al 1991 renshaw 1995 under the assumption of the local cubic law i e 4 b p 3 12 Œº ri p 0 where p is the fluid pressure in all simulations of the reynolds equation we set dirichlet pressure boundary conditions at the fluid inlet and outlet and no flow boundary conditions otherwise by applying eq 2 again one can calculate the numerical hydraulic aperture for each simulation through regression a best fit of Œ± was determined when the measured hydraulic aperture equals the numerically computed hydraulic aperture for all 7 displacements an example regression refers to fig b 2 in appendix b particle image velocimetry for each shear displacement we measured fluid velocity field with the piv technique during the piv measurements a continuous fluid flow at a rate of q 0 05 ml s was induced through the fracture using a high precision pulsation free pump nemesys 2600 n cetoni this flow rate results in a maximum reynolds number of 0 17 calculated using the mean measured aperture rhodamine b coated particles of 1 10 Œºm in diameter were added to the working fluid and later agitated ultrasonically in a sonic bath to avoid particle clumping during the piv measurements the particle number density was 0 04 particles per pixel on the captured images fig 1c shows our side by side camera configuration using a dual cavity nd ylf laser 527 nm wavelength together with a volumetric light expander in line with the fracture yielding a back light illumination of the whole fracture two high speed cmos cameras were placed on the other side of the fracture for imaging the side by side configuration of two cameras offered a 50 image overlap in order to cover the whole fracture area with sufficiently high pixel resolution each camera was equipped with a 540 nm long pass filter to filter the green laser light allowing clean capturing of the light emitted by the rhodamine coated particles additional camera settings can be found in table c 1 in appendix c recording of the fluid flow took place only once its steady state had been reached at each shear displacement the recording was set for 30 s at 50 frames per second to capture the movement of the excited particles the particle velocities were then determined employing the software davis 10 2 lavision 2020 we used the vector averaging method with a multi pass approach the interrogation window was initially set to 64 64 pixels which can capture a maximum particle movement of 6 pixels between the frames and then was dropped down to 16 16 pixels with a 50 overlap using a multi pass approach to improve the signal to noise ratio thus the final velocity we obtained represents a temporal average of the flow over the recording duration 3 results and discussion aperture field there are evident changes in the aperture fields due to the shear displacement fig 3 indicates that the shearing of the fracture gradually enlarges the areas of both the large e g the lower section of the fracture during positive shearing and the small e g the lower section of the fracture during negative shearing aperture zones compared to the aperture probability distribution function pdf of the zero displacement case the aperture pdf i e frequency histograms exhibits a flattening tendency as the shear displacement increases an increase in the aperture s standard deviation table b 1 in appendix b and a decrease in the pdf s peak frequency fig 4 a and b this flattening behavior has been reported in previous studies yeo et al 1998 koyama et al 2006 xie et al 2015 kong and chen 2018 li et al 2020 the shear displacement results in a maximum decrease in the mean aperture of 0 024 mm and 0 022 mm for positive and negative displacements respectively fig 4b these changes in the aperture field introduce hydraulic property changes in the fracture as seen in fig 4c and d following the works of renshaw 1995 auradou et al 2005 and mallikamas and rajaram 2005 we chose the aperture coefficient of variation œÉ b b as the key parameter associated with the changes of aperture field during shearing where œÉ b is the standard deviation of aperture b and b is the expected value of b as explained by renshaw 1995 œÉ b b represents the aperture variability and the non dimensional roughness of a fracture our results suggest a monotonic increase in fracture roughness as the shear displacement accumulates see table b 1 in appendix b we calculated the directional spatial correlation lengths using the measured aperture fields by employing the approach documented in burgess and webster 1980 it is worth noting that the maximum shear displacement is about 1 3 of the maximum correlation length in our study for method details refer to appendix b at the 0 mm position the transversal and longitudinal correlation lengths are around the same 6 6 mm this equality is expected because of the applied numerical method for the generation of the fracture see table a 1 in appendix a and also validates our aperture measurement method fig 4c also suggests a progressive rise for both longitudinal and transversal correlation lengths of aperture field when the shear displacement increases negatively in contrast when the shear displacement increases positively both longitudinal and transversal correlation lengths exhibit a slight decrease but quickly rebound within the current shear displacement compared with shear in the positive direction shear in the negative direction yields a larger increase in the fracture roughness œÉ b b and the associated correlation lengths moreover negative shear displacement results in longer longitudinal correlation lengths whereas positive shear displacement results in larger transversal correlation lengths all changes in the correlation lengths can be visually confirmed from the aperture maps in fig 3 where we can observe 1 significant opening and closing in aperture in the negative shear direction whereas the positive shear direction results in less abrupt changes in aperture and 2 the growth in zones of similar apertures is apparent in the longitudinal direction for negative shear while for the positive shear the growth is apparent in the transversal direction we interpret that this difference behavior between the positive and negative shear is caused by the relatively small displacement compared to the correlation length overall both the longitudinal and transversal correlation lengths show a similar growth trend against the aperture coefficient of variation the changes in the aperture fields can also be described using the so called hydraulic aperture which was measured for each shear displacement for details refer to appendix b following the work of renshaw 1995 the ratio of hydraulic aperture to mechanical aperture here presented by b b h b 3 is plotted against œÉ b b fig 4d in general b h b 3 decreases with the increase of œÉ b b largely following the theoretical renshaw relationship renshaw 1995 however our measurements yields slightly higher values than the theoretical ones this slight offset was also reported in the work of renshaw 1995 in the same range of œÉ b b moreover our measurements shows a faster decrease in the œÉ b b value compared to the theoretical renshaw relationship we interpret that this fast decrease was caused by the increase of flow preference due to the appearance of small aperture zones created by the shear displacement fig 3 to summarize our results suggest that the ratio of hydraulic aperture to mechanical aperture fig 4d changes inversely to the aperture correlation lengths fig 4c velocity field the measured fluid velocity fields allow us to further examine the evolution of flow structure with respect to shear displacement we first quantify the heterogeneity of the velocity field against the aperture variability œÉ b b here the heterogeneity of the velocity field is presented by the coefficient of variation of the velocity magnitude œÉ u u where u u x 2 u y 2 is the fluid velocity magnitude œÉ u is the standard deviation of fluid velocity magnitude and u is the expected value of u similar to the description of aperture œÉ u u presents fluid velocity variability fig 5 a demonstrates a clear increase followed by a plateau and a slight decrease in the velocity variability against the aperture variability as the shear displacement reaches its maximum however the increase amount is different the positive shear displacement induces a much smaller increase 0 05 in velocity variability in comparison with the increase 0 25 induced by the negative shear displacement moreover the same increment in aperture variability yields different increment in velocity variability which could be associated to the distinct behavior in aperture correlation length for positive and negative shear displacements the plateau in velocity variability suggests that further shear displacements do not lead to further increase in velocity heterogeneity even though the aperture variability œÉ b b still continues to grow similar to the aperture field analyses we further examine the flow structure by calculating the correlation length of the velocity field fig 5b and appendix b as the flow is in the longitudinal direction the transveral correlation length only shows minor variations of about 1 2 mm in contrast the longitudinal correlation length shows a linear increase a minimum of 10 5 mm to a maximum of 15 mm for both the positive and negative shear displacements as the aperture variability increases this increase suggests that as shear displacement increases regions of similar velocities are growing in the longitudinal direction streamline and flow channeling the measured velocity fields from the piv measurements enable the computations of fluid streamlines as shown in fig 6 where the streamlines are colored according to the velocity magnitude by definition streamlines are curves tangent to the measured velocity vectors granger 1995 the streamline integration was done using matplotlib with the streamplot function which uses two directions with a second order runge kutta algorithm hunter 2007 the computation procedure of streamlines is the following 1 streamlines are computed with an equal transversal distance at the inlet end of the velocity field 2 streamlines are longitudinally segmented between two adjacent velocity vectors along the streamline into streamline segments for tortuosity calculation the streamline tortuosity can be defined as carman 1937 5 œÑ l s l 2 where l s denotes the streamline length calculated as the summation length of streamline segments and l is the fracture length in our calculations we omit streamlines with a tortuosity lower than one as those streamlines do not traverse the whole fracture the tortuosity of the flow path can be equivalent to the streamline tortuosity as streamlines are curves that are instantaneously tangent to the velocity vectors of the flow the meander of the streamlines clearly indicates that the fluid flows around the contact points and regions of small apertures streamlines also connect regions with different velocity magnitudes in other words velocity magnitude varies along individual streamlines as expected fluid velocity variation along the streamline depends not only the aperture but also the space between adjacent streamlines this statement is supported by that in some regions fluid velocity increases without streamline crowding together and in other regions fluid velocity decreases even though streamlines crowd together fig 6 compared to the zero displacement case the flow paths in the sheared fractures visually become more tortuous fig 6 we present the mean tortuosity of the streamlines for each shear displacement against the aperture variability œÉ b b in fig 7 a a sigmoidal growth of the mean tortuosity can be observed with the increase of aperture variability the lowest mean tortuosity of 1 032 is achieved at the 0 mm position and a maximum of 1 09 and 1 14 of the mean tortuosity are achieved at the maximum negative and positive shear displacement respectively moreover the standard deviation of the tortuosity i e the error bars in fig 7a increases as shear displacement increases the smallest standard deviation of 0 002 is achieved for zero displacement and a maximum standard deviation of 0 024 and 0 031 are achieved at the maximum negative and positive shear displacement respectively the changes in the mean tortuosity and the fluid velocity variability fig 5a suggest that the negative shear displacement leads to fluid velocity fields which are associated with higher velocity variability but with lower mean tortuosity compared to the positive shear displacement even though both the negative and positive shear displacements raise the aperture variability this contrary behavior is apparently related to the contrary changes in aperture correlation lengths fig 4c as described in section 3 fig 6 shows that the space between individual streamlines also changes with shear displacement despite the fact that streamlines were computed with a regular seeding position of equal distance at the inlet end of the fracture if the space between two adjacent streamlines can be considered as a pseudo flow channel the changes in the width of the pseudo flow channels w should also characterize the flow field in this paper we call the width of these pseudo flow channels as the stream channel width w we calculate the stream channel width by calculating the distance between two neighboring streamlines at a regular interval along the flow direction similar to the aperture analysis we examine the variability of the stream channel width œÉ w w and present them in fig 7b against the aperture variability the stream channel width variability can serve as an indicator of flow field heterogeneity and presents the information on the strength of flow preference in general the variability of the stream channel width increases with the increasing of aperture variability although a slight decrease can be observed when the fracture was sheared from the 0 mm to both 1 mm positions this increase suggests the strengthening of flow preference due to the shear displacement here the strengthening of flow preference means that more fluid flow is carried by a few preferential flow paths present in the fracture moreover fig 7a and b show that higher mean tortuosity is not necessarily associated with larger variability of the stream channel width because streamlines can traverse the fracture as groups of tortuous curves with relatively equal spacing between them fig 6 on the other hand the mean tortuosity of flow path also depends on the size and the shape of regions of high aperture and regions of low aperture because flow tends to go through the high aperture regions but around the low aperture regions as indicated by fig 3 it is expected that the larger size of the high aperture and low aperture regions is the longer the flow path is for the same reason if the shape of the high aperture and low aperture regions tend to be elongated the flow path is expected to be even longer as clearly demonstrated in fig 6 to support our argument we examine the relationship between the mean tortuosity and the shape factor of the high aperture and low aperture regions as show in fig 8 here the shape factor s f is calculated using the transversal correlation length c t and the longitudinal correlation length c l as 6 s f c l c t 1 thus s f 0 indicates a region with equal longitudinal and transversal correlation lengths and the larger s f is the more elongated the regions are fig 8 shows that the elongation of the high aperture and low aperture regions results in an increase in the mean tortuosity similarly to what has been shown in fig 7a where the biggest increase seen in the positive shear introduced larger increase in mean flow path tortuosity compared to the negative shear our analysis on the measured aperture field and the measured velocity field have characterized different aspects on the changes in fluid flow induced by the shear displacement our results indicate that the aperture variability œÉ b b is indeed the governing parameter for the changes in fluid flow path and fluid velocity field as well as the representative hydraulic property i e hydraulic aperture however we noticed a significant difference in the changes of the correlation length of the aperture field between the positive and negative shear directions this asymmetric behavior of aperture correlation length shows its consequences on the asymmetric changes in fluid velocity variability i e œÉ u u flow path tortuosity and stream channel width variability i e œÉ w w this asymmetric behavior of aperture correlation length introduces differences in connections between various fracture regions and thus results in changes in flow channeling this statement is supported by our observation that the negative shear displacement results in fluid mass largely being forced through primary channels when compared to the positive shear results fig 3 the concentration of fluid flow into primary channels is particularly noticeable at the inlet and outlet ends as the negative shear displacement accumulates in contrast the positive shear displacement induces less pronounced flow concentration the differences in flow concentration is also well explained by the difference in velocity variability in fig 5a finally the flow path tortuosity evolution can be explained by two factors first the increasing aperture variability results in an increase in the flow path tortuosity due to the increase of aperture heterogeneity second the mean tortuosity of flow path also depends on the size and the shape of high aperture and low aperture regions which can be described using the transversal and longitudinal correlation lengths as shown in figs 4c and 8 4 conclusions this paper presents a study on the evolution of fluid flow paths using the direct visualization and fluid velocity measurements in a single fracture with rough walls when the fracture undergoes shear displacement the presented measurements employed a combination of 3d printing refractive index matching and piv techniques to our best knowledge our study presents the first direct fluid velocity measurement against the vast existing numerical simulations our aperture measurements suggest a maximum mean aperture at the zero displacement position and a flattening of the aperture probability density function pdf with increasing shear displacement our analysis of the aperture variability or roughness show an increasing trend of aperture variability with the accumulative shear displacement a clear increasing trend of aperture correlation length is indicated with the increasing shear displacement negative shear displacement results in a larger longitudinal correlation length compared to the transveral correlation length whilst positive shear displacement leads to the opposite our results indicate difference behaviors between the positive and negative shear largely due to the relatively small displacements in comparison to the aperture correlation lengths however the overall behaviors are similar between the positive and negative shear our piv results enable us to quantify the changes in fluid velocity and flow path as a function of shear displacement an increase in velocity variability is revealed with the increasing shear displacement the differences in correlation length changes are considered to be responsible for the significant difference in the velocity variability between the positive and negative shear directions a sigmoidal increase in streamline tortuosity is showed with the increasing shear displacement this increase in streamline tortuosity stems from the aperture heterogeneity enhancement induced by the shear displacement the difference in the tortuosity increment with respect to the shear directions is also considered to be associated with the differences in correlation length changes an increase in the width variability of the space between streamlines is also suggested and is caused by the increasing heterogeneity of the aperture which forces the fluid flow around the low permeability zones including the contact regions our results highlight the impact of shear displacements on the fluid velocity field and flow path tortuosity demonstrating that the increase in aperture heterogeneity significantly impacts the flow behavior whilst the changes in aperture correlation length further refine these impacts our results also suggest that changes in fluid flow paths are related to changes not only in the asperity sizes but also in the aperture variability or roughness credit authorship contribution statement isamu naets writing original draft conceptualization

during the piv experiments appendix d piv limitations piv does have its own limitations one of the limitations is the disturbances induced by the seeded tracer particles in the fluid flow the other will be the assumption that the seeding particles strictly follow the fluid flow in other words the motion of the seeding particles represents the motion of the fluid in this study we adopt the classical planar piv which does not recover the out of plane velocity this could lead to underestimations in the velocity as the particles move towards or away from the camera induced by high fracture roughness in our study our fracture roughness is moderately low the omitting of the out of plane velocity should be justified nonetheless the out of plane velocity can be resolved by using the so called stereo piv or tomographic piv through additional cameras in addition as piv is an optical method its results are highly susceptible to random noise and are dependent on the configurations of light source camera and lens a trade off often has to be made between the resolution of the image and the field of view to ensure a clear capture of particles while the aforementioned limitations exist the further development of piv has lead to methods to mitigate these limitations such as sub pixel accuracy and interrogation window overlapping to increase spatial resolution nobach and bodenschatz 2009 nonetheless piv still remains one of the few methods that can determine the instantaneous velocities of fluids 
3293,rough walled fractures in rock masses as preferential pathways largely influence fluid flow solute and energy transport previous studies indicate that fracture aperture fields could be significantly modified due to shear displacement along fractures we report experimental observations and quantitative analyses of flow path evolution within a single fracture induced by shear displacement particle image velocimetry and refractive index matching techniques were utilized to determine fluid velocity fields inside a transparent 3d printed shear able rough fracture our analysis indicate that aperture variability and correlation length increase with the increasing shear displacement and they are the two key parameters which govern the increases in velocity variability velocity longitudinal correlation length streamline tortuosity and variability of streamline spacing the increase in aperture heterogeneity significantly impacts fluid flow behaviors whilst changes in aperture correlation length further refine these impacts to our best knowledge our study is the first direct measurements of fluid velocity fields and provides insights into the impact of fracture shear on flow behavior keywords shear displacement flow variability rough walled fracture particle image velocimetry piv refractive index matching correlation length c l 1 introduction in fractured rock masses fractures often serve as preferential pathways for fluid energy and solute transport auradou et al 2006 leung and zimmerman 2012 lang et al 2014 resulting in reduced fluid solute and heat breakthrough times compared to non fractured porous media these preferential fluid flow pathways are of great interest in the earth sciences lima et al 2020 ahkami et al 2020 kittil√§ et al 2019 kittil√§ et al 2020 as they can dictate the predominant movement of mass e g fluid and solute and energy e g heat inside the rock mass keller et al 1999 bodin et al 2003 klepikova et al 2014 thus an in depth understanding of fluid flow in fractures is of essential importance for the success of various industrial and scientific subsurface applications for instance oil and gas production geological carbon dioxide storage geothermal energy utilization and groundwater usage to name a few previous studies on fluid flow in fractures have often adopted a parallel plate model or hele shaw cell under the assumption of stokes flow wooding 1960 zimmerman and bodvarsson 1996 berkowitz and zhou 1996 studies such as pyrak nolte et al 1987 have shown the inadequacy of the parallel plate model in describing the fluid flow due to the complex geometries of rough fracture walls that play a critical role in determining fluid movement and thus transport of solutes and energy as a result the focus of fluid flow in fractures studies has substantially shifted towards investigating rough wall fractures using either rough wall fracture replicas e g surrogates and molds or actual natural fractures providing better representations of real world conditions yeo et al 1998 auradou et al 2005 koyama et al 2006 rong et al 2016 wang et al 2020 li et al 2019 in parallel with numerical studies of fluid flow in rough walled fractures e g walsh et al 2008 wang et al 2016 kong and chen 2018 where fluid flow was computed using computational fluid dynamics cfd such as lattice boltzmann methods parmigiani et al 2019 ahkami et al 2020 to solve the navier stokes equation various methods have been developed to experimentally measure and visualize fluid flow in rough wall fractures the overall the fractures hydraulic properties can be inferred using the measured volumetric flow rates as well as the pressure drops along the fractures lee and cho 2002 rong et al 2016 however these types of measurements do not provide detailed information on local fluid flow path characteristics such as the streamline geometry or the preferential flow paths in comparison with numerical studies e g walsh et al 2008 wang et al 2016 kong and chen 2018 flow path characteristics are more readily obtained using a transparent fracture surrogate and a fluid dye enabling direct visualizations of the development of preferential flow paths in rough wall fractures auradou et al 2005 wang et al 2020 wu et al 2018 li et al 2019 together with the overall volumetric flow rates through the fractures the dye movement may provide indirect fluid flow distribution but is limited by its ability to yield the local velocity field local fluid flow velocities can be quantified by scanning the fractures during the experiments using nuclear magnetic resonance imaging nmri dijk and berkowitz 1999 however nmri scanning commonly suffers from its limited temporal and spatial resolutions ggladden and sedermanladden and sederman 2013 kim et al 2021 compared nmri measurements and cfd and found that mri results in significant underestimation of peak fluid velocity one commonly accepted method to produce high resolution fluid velocity fields is the particle image velocimetry piv technique while piv does have its own limitations see d and in wieneke 2015 it does not share the same spatial and temporal resolution limitation as nmri because of its optical measurement principle rapid evolution in light source and camera of higher resolution and higher frame rate easily break the piv resolution limitation as such piv is even used as a validation technique for nmri measurements of fluid velocity medero et al 2018 kim et al 2021 piv has been further successfully applied to fluid velocity determinations in porous media sen et al 2012 ppatil and liburdyatil and liburdy 2013 holzner et al 2015 in fractured media the Œº piv method has been employed to examine the relationship between solute tail shortening and the formation of eddies in a 2d cross section of a rough fracture lee et al 2015 and discovered that tail shortening is attributed to mass exchange between the main flow in the fracture and flow eddies developed in large aperture regions ahkami et al 2019 used the so called temporo ensemble piv method in a fractured porous medium to investigate the effect of matrix permeability on fluid flow through fractures in a 3d printed fractured porous medium and shown a log normal distribution of longitudinal velocity and a normal distribution of transversal velocity the hydraulic properties of a fracture with rough walls have been shown to be mainly controlled by the fracture aperture distribution renshaw 1995 auradou et al 2005 rong et al 2016 lima et al 2020 which could be significantly altered due to shear displacements of fracture walls during natural or induced seismic activities evans et al 2005 schultz et al 2018 ellsworth et al 2019 various experiments have been conducted to examine the effects of shear on fluid flow in rough wall fractures gentier et al 1997 yeo et al 1998 esaki et al 1999 auradou et al 2005 rong et al 2016 li et al 2019 where the hydraulic properties have been observed to be greatly altered auradou et al 2005 mallikamas and rajaram 2005 ishibashi et al 2016 wang et al 2020 due to shear dilation hydraulic anisotropy and scale effects as summarized by matsuki et al 2010 and due to geomechanical alterations such as grain size shrinking and surface gouging teufel 1987 auradou et al 2005 presented a decrease in permeability with shear parallel to the shear direction using a transparent fracture with a radial injection setup li et al 2019 utilized a clear cast of a rough fracture to capture the movement of a dye through the fracture and recorded a decrease in the number of contacts but an increase in the total contact area moreover fracture permeability perpendicular to shear was shown to increase while permeability parallel to shear was shown to decrease auradou et al 2005 mallikamas and rajaram 2005 the changes in permeability was demonstrated to associate with the changes in the variance of the aperture field auradou et al 2005 mallikamas and rajaram 2005 further suggested that the midplane fluid tortuosity needs to be quantified however except for few numerical studies on fluid flow through rough wall fractures koyama et al 2006 walsh et al 2008 wang et al 2016 wang et al 2018 kong and chen 2018 where fluid velocity fields were able to be computed no existing equivalent experiment has been performed to provide quantitative measurement on local fluid velocities over the entire fracture challenges still remain when experimentally quantifying the evolution of flow paths due to shear displacement in this paper we directly measured the evolution of flow paths induced by shear displacements these measurements are presented using quantitative analyses of fluid velocities which were determined using piv measurements on a shear able transparent 3d printed fracture to avoid image distortion we adopted the refractive index matching technique kong et al 2011 song et al 2015 we present our quantification by examining the impact of the shear displacement on the aperture distribution the streamline tortuosity and the connectivity of regions for different fluid velocity thresholds to the best of our knowledge such analyses have never yet been reported and provide greater insights into the consequences of fracture wall shearing on fluid flow through rough wall fractures 2 methodology fracture generation the fracture used in this study was numerically generated with the software synfrac provided by paul glover university of leeds uk glover et al 1998 and then 3d printed with a transparent material the settings used in synfrac to generate the fracture can be found in table a 1 in appendix a the dimensions of the fracture area are a length of parallel to flow l 100 mm and a width perpendicular to flow of w 50 mm the fracture top surface i e slide surface and the fracture bottom surface i e base surface are characterized by a mean joint roughness coefficient jrc of 3 66 0 33 and 3 60 0 36 respectively the low jrc values suggest a rather smooth fracture surface details of jrc calculation refer to appendix b fracture printing and refractive index matching the printing was done on a stratasys j735 which has a layer thickness of 14 Œºm while additive manufacturing deposits in layers we do not observe any significant impact from the so called stair stepping the printing material of the base and slide is veroclear with a refractive index of 1 514 song et al 2015 which was matched with a working fluid of the same refractive index to avoid optical distortions during imaging inspired by a solution found by song et al 2015 we created a new fluid solution as our working fluid which is a solution of 44 trans anethole and 56 mineral oil yielding a higher clarity and a lower flammability this refractive index ri matched fluid has a density of 0 91 g ml which is similar to that of water and a dynamic viscosity of Œº ri 9 87 mpa s here the viscosity of the ri matched solution was determined using the arrhenius model arrhenius 1887 1 ln Œº ri x s ln Œº t 1 x s ln Œº o where x s v t v t Œ≤ v o Œº t 2 6 mpa s is the viscosity of pure trans anethole Œº o 230 mpa s is the viscosity of pure oil Œ≤ 0 28 is an empirical constant between 0 1 and v t and v o are the volume fractions of the trans anethole and mineral oil respectively the refractive index of the solution was measured using the orf 1rs refractometer with an accuracy of 0 0005 nd shear mechanism to enable shear displacement the two rough surfaces of the fracture were printed separately on a static base and a movable slide fig 1 a when the slide and base were clamped together the slide was supported by the side walls of the base as seen in the side view of fig 1b and a fracture was formed between the slide and base a channel was fabricated on the top surface of the side walls of the base to accommodate an o ring for the fracture sealing to avoid side wall frictions between the base and slide during fracture shearing a small gap of 0 01 mm was left between the side walls of the base and the slide the gap width is of two orders of magnitude lower than the mean aperture of 0 52 mm see appendix b yielding negligible fluid flow through the gap this gap along with silicon lubricant on the o ring allows smooth shearing without any leaking the ri solution was injected into a flow distribution channel that was printed directed into the base ensuring an even flow across the fracture s transverse area we examined a total of seven shear distances 0 1 2 and 3 mm where the positive shear points to the direction of main fluid flow the fracture at zero displacement can be considered as a mated one but not a complete closure as indicated by the non zero aperture in this study the movement of the slide occurs parallel to the main fluid flow direction using a motor or hand crank the shear displacement was precisely monitored by a precision gauge with 0 001 mm accuracy to ensure an even force across the whole fracture the base and the slide were clamped together in a metal frame to a torque of 0 5 n m aperture measurement in this study the aperture field was measured in situ using the light transmission method detwiler et al 1999 which needs to be calibrated to convert the recorded light intensity to physical aperture through a scaling factor traditionally this calibration is done using either a calibration plate using an area of known aperture or the total volume of the fracture in our current setup the fracture was printed separately with two parts and a dead volume was prepared to allow the displacement leading to a large uncertainty in the calibration of the scaling factor using the aforementioned traditional methods therefore the aperture field was measured at each displacement in three steps hydraulic aperture determination using physical darcy s experiments acquisition of the apparent fracture aperture field and scaling factor determination first we measured the hydraulic aperture b h of the fracture at each shear displacement 0 1 2 and 3 mm using darcy s experiments under the assumption of the cubic law witherspoon et al 1980 oron and berkowitz 1998 2 b h 12 Œº lq w Œ¥ p 1 3 where q is the volumetric flow rate l is the fracture length w is the fracture width Œ¥ p is the corresponding pressure drop across the fracture length and Œº is the dynamic viscosity of the working fluid second at each shear displacement an apparent fracture aperture field was determined using the light transmission method detwiler et al 1999 mouza et al 2000 fig 2 shows the experimental setup of the apparent fracture aperture measurements during the measurements the fracture was first filled with the ri matched fluid followed by the imaging of light transmission through the fracture with a camera this yielded the baseline transmission of the fracture i no dye then pyrromethene a dye was added to the ri matched fluid again followed by the imaging of light transmission through the fracture i dye according to the light transmission method the apparent local fracture aperture b p can be determined using gray value ratio of the two images i e i no dye and i dye as shown in 3 b p Œ± ln i no dye i dye where Œ± is a common scaling factor for all shear positions see fig b 1 third the scaling factor Œ± was numerically regressed when the measured hydraulic aperture in the first step equals the numerically computed hydraulic aperture using the apparent fracture aperture obtained in the second step by solving the 2d reynolds equation zimmerman et al 1991 renshaw 1995 under the assumption of the local cubic law i e 4 b p 3 12 Œº ri p 0 where p is the fluid pressure in all simulations of the reynolds equation we set dirichlet pressure boundary conditions at the fluid inlet and outlet and no flow boundary conditions otherwise by applying eq 2 again one can calculate the numerical hydraulic aperture for each simulation through regression a best fit of Œ± was determined when the measured hydraulic aperture equals the numerically computed hydraulic aperture for all 7 displacements an example regression refers to fig b 2 in appendix b particle image velocimetry for each shear displacement we measured fluid velocity field with the piv technique during the piv measurements a continuous fluid flow at a rate of q 0 05 ml s was induced through the fracture using a high precision pulsation free pump nemesys 2600 n cetoni this flow rate results in a maximum reynolds number of 0 17 calculated using the mean measured aperture rhodamine b coated particles of 1 10 Œºm in diameter were added to the working fluid and later agitated ultrasonically in a sonic bath to avoid particle clumping during the piv measurements the particle number density was 0 04 particles per pixel on the captured images fig 1c shows our side by side camera configuration using a dual cavity nd ylf laser 527 nm wavelength together with a volumetric light expander in line with the fracture yielding a back light illumination of the whole fracture two high speed cmos cameras were placed on the other side of the fracture for imaging the side by side configuration of two cameras offered a 50 image overlap in order to cover the whole fracture area with sufficiently high pixel resolution each camera was equipped with a 540 nm long pass filter to filter the green laser light allowing clean capturing of the light emitted by the rhodamine coated particles additional camera settings can be found in table c 1 in appendix c recording of the fluid flow took place only once its steady state had been reached at each shear displacement the recording was set for 30 s at 50 frames per second to capture the movement of the excited particles the particle velocities were then determined employing the software davis 10 2 lavision 2020 we used the vector averaging method with a multi pass approach the interrogation window was initially set to 64 64 pixels which can capture a maximum particle movement of 6 pixels between the frames and then was dropped down to 16 16 pixels with a 50 overlap using a multi pass approach to improve the signal to noise ratio thus the final velocity we obtained represents a temporal average of the flow over the recording duration 3 results and discussion aperture field there are evident changes in the aperture fields due to the shear displacement fig 3 indicates that the shearing of the fracture gradually enlarges the areas of both the large e g the lower section of the fracture during positive shearing and the small e g the lower section of the fracture during negative shearing aperture zones compared to the aperture probability distribution function pdf of the zero displacement case the aperture pdf i e frequency histograms exhibits a flattening tendency as the shear displacement increases an increase in the aperture s standard deviation table b 1 in appendix b and a decrease in the pdf s peak frequency fig 4 a and b this flattening behavior has been reported in previous studies yeo et al 1998 koyama et al 2006 xie et al 2015 kong and chen 2018 li et al 2020 the shear displacement results in a maximum decrease in the mean aperture of 0 024 mm and 0 022 mm for positive and negative displacements respectively fig 4b these changes in the aperture field introduce hydraulic property changes in the fracture as seen in fig 4c and d following the works of renshaw 1995 auradou et al 2005 and mallikamas and rajaram 2005 we chose the aperture coefficient of variation œÉ b b as the key parameter associated with the changes of aperture field during shearing where œÉ b is the standard deviation of aperture b and b is the expected value of b as explained by renshaw 1995 œÉ b b represents the aperture variability and the non dimensional roughness of a fracture our results suggest a monotonic increase in fracture roughness as the shear displacement accumulates see table b 1 in appendix b we calculated the directional spatial correlation lengths using the measured aperture fields by employing the approach documented in burgess and webster 1980 it is worth noting that the maximum shear displacement is about 1 3 of the maximum correlation length in our study for method details refer to appendix b at the 0 mm position the transversal and longitudinal correlation lengths are around the same 6 6 mm this equality is expected because of the applied numerical method for the generation of the fracture see table a 1 in appendix a and also validates our aperture measurement method fig 4c also suggests a progressive rise for both longitudinal and transversal correlation lengths of aperture field when the shear displacement increases negatively in contrast when the shear displacement increases positively both longitudinal and transversal correlation lengths exhibit a slight decrease but quickly rebound within the current shear displacement compared with shear in the positive direction shear in the negative direction yields a larger increase in the fracture roughness œÉ b b and the associated correlation lengths moreover negative shear displacement results in longer longitudinal correlation lengths whereas positive shear displacement results in larger transversal correlation lengths all changes in the correlation lengths can be visually confirmed from the aperture maps in fig 3 where we can observe 1 significant opening and closing in aperture in the negative shear direction whereas the positive shear direction results in less abrupt changes in aperture and 2 the growth in zones of similar apertures is apparent in the longitudinal direction for negative shear while for the positive shear the growth is apparent in the transversal direction we interpret that this difference behavior between the positive and negative shear is caused by the relatively small displacement compared to the correlation length overall both the longitudinal and transversal correlation lengths show a similar growth trend against the aperture coefficient of variation the changes in the aperture fields can also be described using the so called hydraulic aperture which was measured for each shear displacement for details refer to appendix b following the work of renshaw 1995 the ratio of hydraulic aperture to mechanical aperture here presented by b b h b 3 is plotted against œÉ b b fig 4d in general b h b 3 decreases with the increase of œÉ b b largely following the theoretical renshaw relationship renshaw 1995 however our measurements yields slightly higher values than the theoretical ones this slight offset was also reported in the work of renshaw 1995 in the same range of œÉ b b moreover our measurements shows a faster decrease in the œÉ b b value compared to the theoretical renshaw relationship we interpret that this fast decrease was caused by the increase of flow preference due to the appearance of small aperture zones created by the shear displacement fig 3 to summarize our results suggest that the ratio of hydraulic aperture to mechanical aperture fig 4d changes inversely to the aperture correlation lengths fig 4c velocity field the measured fluid velocity fields allow us to further examine the evolution of flow structure with respect to shear displacement we first quantify the heterogeneity of the velocity field against the aperture variability œÉ b b here the heterogeneity of the velocity field is presented by the coefficient of variation of the velocity magnitude œÉ u u where u u x 2 u y 2 is the fluid velocity magnitude œÉ u is the standard deviation of fluid velocity magnitude and u is the expected value of u similar to the description of aperture œÉ u u presents fluid velocity variability fig 5 a demonstrates a clear increase followed by a plateau and a slight decrease in the velocity variability against the aperture variability as the shear displacement reaches its maximum however the increase amount is different the positive shear displacement induces a much smaller increase 0 05 in velocity variability in comparison with the increase 0 25 induced by the negative shear displacement moreover the same increment in aperture variability yields different increment in velocity variability which could be associated to the distinct behavior in aperture correlation length for positive and negative shear displacements the plateau in velocity variability suggests that further shear displacements do not lead to further increase in velocity heterogeneity even though the aperture variability œÉ b b still continues to grow similar to the aperture field analyses we further examine the flow structure by calculating the correlation length of the velocity field fig 5b and appendix b as the flow is in the longitudinal direction the transveral correlation length only shows minor variations of about 1 2 mm in contrast the longitudinal correlation length shows a linear increase a minimum of 10 5 mm to a maximum of 15 mm for both the positive and negative shear displacements as the aperture variability increases this increase suggests that as shear displacement increases regions of similar velocities are growing in the longitudinal direction streamline and flow channeling the measured velocity fields from the piv measurements enable the computations of fluid streamlines as shown in fig 6 where the streamlines are colored according to the velocity magnitude by definition streamlines are curves tangent to the measured velocity vectors granger 1995 the streamline integration was done using matplotlib with the streamplot function which uses two directions with a second order runge kutta algorithm hunter 2007 the computation procedure of streamlines is the following 1 streamlines are computed with an equal transversal distance at the inlet end of the velocity field 2 streamlines are longitudinally segmented between two adjacent velocity vectors along the streamline into streamline segments for tortuosity calculation the streamline tortuosity can be defined as carman 1937 5 œÑ l s l 2 where l s denotes the streamline length calculated as the summation length of streamline segments and l is the fracture length in our calculations we omit streamlines with a tortuosity lower than one as those streamlines do not traverse the whole fracture the tortuosity of the flow path can be equivalent to the streamline tortuosity as streamlines are curves that are instantaneously tangent to the velocity vectors of the flow the meander of the streamlines clearly indicates that the fluid flows around the contact points and regions of small apertures streamlines also connect regions with different velocity magnitudes in other words velocity magnitude varies along individual streamlines as expected fluid velocity variation along the streamline depends not only the aperture but also the space between adjacent streamlines this statement is supported by that in some regions fluid velocity increases without streamline crowding together and in other regions fluid velocity decreases even though streamlines crowd together fig 6 compared to the zero displacement case the flow paths in the sheared fractures visually become more tortuous fig 6 we present the mean tortuosity of the streamlines for each shear displacement against the aperture variability œÉ b b in fig 7 a a sigmoidal growth of the mean tortuosity can be observed with the increase of aperture variability the lowest mean tortuosity of 1 032 is achieved at the 0 mm position and a maximum of 1 09 and 1 14 of the mean tortuosity are achieved at the maximum negative and positive shear displacement respectively moreover the standard deviation of the tortuosity i e the error bars in fig 7a increases as shear displacement increases the smallest standard deviation of 0 002 is achieved for zero displacement and a maximum standard deviation of 0 024 and 0 031 are achieved at the maximum negative and positive shear displacement respectively the changes in the mean tortuosity and the fluid velocity variability fig 5a suggest that the negative shear displacement leads to fluid velocity fields which are associated with higher velocity variability but with lower mean tortuosity compared to the positive shear displacement even though both the negative and positive shear displacements raise the aperture variability this contrary behavior is apparently related to the contrary changes in aperture correlation lengths fig 4c as described in section 3 fig 6 shows that the space between individual streamlines also changes with shear displacement despite the fact that streamlines were computed with a regular seeding position of equal distance at the inlet end of the fracture if the space between two adjacent streamlines can be considered as a pseudo flow channel the changes in the width of the pseudo flow channels w should also characterize the flow field in this paper we call the width of these pseudo flow channels as the stream channel width w we calculate the stream channel width by calculating the distance between two neighboring streamlines at a regular interval along the flow direction similar to the aperture analysis we examine the variability of the stream channel width œÉ w w and present them in fig 7b against the aperture variability the stream channel width variability can serve as an indicator of flow field heterogeneity and presents the information on the strength of flow preference in general the variability of the stream channel width increases with the increasing of aperture variability although a slight decrease can be observed when the fracture was sheared from the 0 mm to both 1 mm positions this increase suggests the strengthening of flow preference due to the shear displacement here the strengthening of flow preference means that more fluid flow is carried by a few preferential flow paths present in the fracture moreover fig 7a and b show that higher mean tortuosity is not necessarily associated with larger variability of the stream channel width because streamlines can traverse the fracture as groups of tortuous curves with relatively equal spacing between them fig 6 on the other hand the mean tortuosity of flow path also depends on the size and the shape of regions of high aperture and regions of low aperture because flow tends to go through the high aperture regions but around the low aperture regions as indicated by fig 3 it is expected that the larger size of the high aperture and low aperture regions is the longer the flow path is for the same reason if the shape of the high aperture and low aperture regions tend to be elongated the flow path is expected to be even longer as clearly demonstrated in fig 6 to support our argument we examine the relationship between the mean tortuosity and the shape factor of the high aperture and low aperture regions as show in fig 8 here the shape factor s f is calculated using the transversal correlation length c t and the longitudinal correlation length c l as 6 s f c l c t 1 thus s f 0 indicates a region with equal longitudinal and transversal correlation lengths and the larger s f is the more elongated the regions are fig 8 shows that the elongation of the high aperture and low aperture regions results in an increase in the mean tortuosity similarly to what has been shown in fig 7a where the biggest increase seen in the positive shear introduced larger increase in mean flow path tortuosity compared to the negative shear our analysis on the measured aperture field and the measured velocity field have characterized different aspects on the changes in fluid flow induced by the shear displacement our results indicate that the aperture variability œÉ b b is indeed the governing parameter for the changes in fluid flow path and fluid velocity field as well as the representative hydraulic property i e hydraulic aperture however we noticed a significant difference in the changes of the correlation length of the aperture field between the positive and negative shear directions this asymmetric behavior of aperture correlation length shows its consequences on the asymmetric changes in fluid velocity variability i e œÉ u u flow path tortuosity and stream channel width variability i e œÉ w w this asymmetric behavior of aperture correlation length introduces differences in connections between various fracture regions and thus results in changes in flow channeling this statement is supported by our observation that the negative shear displacement results in fluid mass largely being forced through primary channels when compared to the positive shear results fig 3 the concentration of fluid flow into primary channels is particularly noticeable at the inlet and outlet ends as the negative shear displacement accumulates in contrast the positive shear displacement induces less pronounced flow concentration the differences in flow concentration is also well explained by the difference in velocity variability in fig 5a finally the flow path tortuosity evolution can be explained by two factors first the increasing aperture variability results in an increase in the flow path tortuosity due to the increase of aperture heterogeneity second the mean tortuosity of flow path also depends on the size and the shape of high aperture and low aperture regions which can be described using the transversal and longitudinal correlation lengths as shown in figs 4c and 8 4 conclusions this paper presents a study on the evolution of fluid flow paths using the direct visualization and fluid velocity measurements in a single fracture with rough walls when the fracture undergoes shear displacement the presented measurements employed a combination of 3d printing refractive index matching and piv techniques to our best knowledge our study presents the first direct fluid velocity measurement against the vast existing numerical simulations our aperture measurements suggest a maximum mean aperture at the zero displacement position and a flattening of the aperture probability density function pdf with increasing shear displacement our analysis of the aperture variability or roughness show an increasing trend of aperture variability with the accumulative shear displacement a clear increasing trend of aperture correlation length is indicated with the increasing shear displacement negative shear displacement results in a larger longitudinal correlation length compared to the transveral correlation length whilst positive shear displacement leads to the opposite our results indicate difference behaviors between the positive and negative shear largely due to the relatively small displacements in comparison to the aperture correlation lengths however the overall behaviors are similar between the positive and negative shear our piv results enable us to quantify the changes in fluid velocity and flow path as a function of shear displacement an increase in velocity variability is revealed with the increasing shear displacement the differences in correlation length changes are considered to be responsible for the significant difference in the velocity variability between the positive and negative shear directions a sigmoidal increase in streamline tortuosity is showed with the increasing shear displacement this increase in streamline tortuosity stems from the aperture heterogeneity enhancement induced by the shear displacement the difference in the tortuosity increment with respect to the shear directions is also considered to be associated with the differences in correlation length changes an increase in the width variability of the space between streamlines is also suggested and is caused by the increasing heterogeneity of the aperture which forces the fluid flow around the low permeability zones including the contact regions our results highlight the impact of shear displacements on the fluid velocity field and flow path tortuosity demonstrating that the increase in aperture heterogeneity significantly impacts the flow behavior whilst the changes in aperture correlation length further refine these impacts our results also suggest that changes in fluid flow paths are related to changes not only in the asperity sizes but also in the aperture variability or roughness credit authorship contribution statement isamu naets writing original draft conceptualization

during the piv experiments appendix d piv limitations piv does have its own limitations one of the limitations is the disturbances induced by the seeded tracer particles in the fluid flow the other will be the assumption that the seeding particles strictly follow the fluid flow in other words the motion of the seeding particles represents the motion of the fluid in this study we adopt the classical planar piv which does not recover the out of plane velocity this could lead to underestimations in the velocity as the particles move towards or away from the camera induced by high fracture roughness in our study our fracture roughness is moderately low the omitting of the out of plane velocity should be justified nonetheless the out of plane velocity can be resolved by using the so called stereo piv or tomographic piv through additional cameras in addition as piv is an optical method its results are highly susceptible to random noise and are dependent on the configurations of light source camera and lens a trade off often has to be made between the resolution of the image and the field of view to ensure a clear capture of particles while the aforementioned limitations exist the further development of piv has lead to methods to mitigate these limitations such as sub pixel accuracy and interrogation window overlapping to increase spatial resolution nobach and bodenschatz 2009 nonetheless piv still remains one of the few methods that can determine the instantaneous velocities of fluids 
3294,the water regimes and biogeochemical cycles are remarkably affected by river damming and drought around the world however the dual effects on river water cycles have not yet attracted sufficient attention along the yangtze river because of the relative consistency of annual water regimes this study first explored the altered water cycle associated with damming and drought using surface water isoscapes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of river and lake water along the yangtze river during the flooding seasons of 2016 and 2018 combined with other historical isotopic data from 2003 to 2013 the results show that river water isotopes are markedly varied on both spatial and temporal scales the relatively more enriched river water representing Œ¥18o values were observed from 2003 to 2007 compared with those in 2018 which were possibly caused by increased evaporative fractionation under abnormal drought conditions in the yangtze river spatially river water Œ¥18o values exhibited a positive trend from upstream to the lower reaches because of the contrasting recharged sources complex mixing and evaporation from upstream to the lower reaches of the yangtze river this trend was related to variations in surface water temperature and water evaporation during the flooding seasons evidenced by a significant correlation between river isotopes and river water temperature moreover the large variability in deuterium excess d excess and Œ¥18o in the downstream could be inherited from the upstream because of short residence time and incomplete mixing in the three gorges reservoir tgr during the initial stage of the three gorges dam tgd operation 2003 2007 in contrast the relatively lower variability of d excess and Œ¥18o was found in the downstream area due to the complete mixing in the tgr causing the homogenization of reservoir water during the normal operation stage after 2010 e g 2013 and 2018 drought stimulates evaporative fractionation on river water and result in more negative d excess values especially in 2006 the dual effects of river damming and drought remarkably changed the longitudinal hydrological connectivity and water cycle dynamics by prolonging the residence time and enhancing the water mixing which should be thoroughly considered for water resource management especially for regions with heavily regulated rivers keywords stable water isotopes cascade dams drought residence time evaporative enrichment surface water temperature 1 introduction rivers provide food and water for human consumption recreational spaces hydropower and industrial production however economic development worldwide has led to approximately 2 8 million dams and reservoirs constructed for navigation agricultural irrigation and for reducing floods and drought geris et al 2015 grill et al 2019 currently almost two thirds of the global rivers are utilized by dams and reservoirs the 2016 paris agreement and the worldwide need for greater renewable energy will lead to even more dam construction by 2030 grill et al 2015 maavara et al 2020 the damming river reservoir systems can result in river fragmentation flow regime changes in terms of magnitude frequency duration and timing as well as sediment transport of chemicals containing nutrients like phosphorous leading to massive eutrophication problems duan et al 2019 yang et al 2007 notably large dams like the three gorges dam tgd which controls china s yangtze river flow can decrease the sediment load but increases the water temperature threatens biodiversity xiong et al 2020 yang et al 2006 particularly in densely populated regions rivers are highly regulated leading to hydrological and ecological alterations such as decline of freshwater flux into the sea and sediment trapping humborg et al 1997 pe√±as and barqu√≠n 2019 yang et al 2011 subsequently increasing river fragmentation has been threatening the structure and sustainability of aquatic communities maavara et al 2020 winemiller et al 2016 xu and pittock 2021 problems related to regulated rivers are especially severe in china where over half of the world s large dams have been built since 1950 cheng et al 2015 duan et al 2019 xu and pittock 2021 by 2017 there were 52 601 dams in the yangtze river basin yrb representing 53 2 of all the dams built in china including the world s largest hydroelectric tgd xu and pittock 2021 hence the yangtze river has attracted prodigious international attention best 2019 m√ºller et al 2008 despite the large body of research delineating the alterations of the hydrological regime caused by cascading reservoirs and assessing the damming effect on river ecosystems and aquatic biodiversity lu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 more explicit examinations of the cumulative damming effects on hydrological cycles have become necessary this is because the effects are highly variable based on the artificial regulation of hydrological system functions including flood control or inter basin water division barbarossa et al 2020 best 2019 furthermore these problems can be further exacerbated by regional drought which is regarded as a worldwide natural hazard christian et al 2021 drought also has adverse effects on regional water cycles and water resources dai et al 2008 jiang et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 recent research demonstrates that global drought is expected to increase in step with observed warming trends moreover this phenomenon will be strengthened in some regions because global temperatures continue to increase with the rising anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions dai 2013 sheffield and wood 2008 therefore regions with heavily regulated rivers must be accurately explored with the ability to recognize altered hydrological processes induced by dam construction it is also important to realize that understanding the effects of drought is crucial to proper reservoir management and water resource utilization the combined effects of river damming and drought on river water cycles can benefit from using isotopic tracers methods Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h in large regulated river basins chiogna et al 2018 deng et al 2016 vanplantinga et al 2017 however reports on this type of research are scarce largely because such research is still challenging due to the limitations of any highly spatial and temporal resolution sampling campaign over large areas these isotopic landscapes isoscapes have been regarded as important tools not only to trace the water cycle dynamics e g catchment hydrology and seasonal rainfall patterns bowen and good 2015 brooks et al 2012 wu et al 2021 but also to illustrate flow changes due to dam monitoring regulations or extreme conditions such as drought or flooding chiogna et al 2018 jiang et al 2021 marchina et al 2017 remmer et al 2019 some scholars have recently assessed the damming or drought impacts on river water cycles using the Œ¥18o isoscape method and focusing on large river basins li et al 2016 n√©grel et al 2016 vanplantinga et al 2017 wang et al 2019 an interesting example from the yangtze river showed that the tgd greatly buffered the fluctuations in river water isotopes and induced a one month lag in the yangtze river water cycle due to precipitation whereas drought led to greater evaporative enrichment of river water deng et al 2016 wu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 identified that in the highly regulated wujiang river basin in guizhou china the cumulative effects of cascading dams caused a jagged increase of isotopic compositions along the impounded river these isoscapes studies solely depended on a short term observation of the yangtze river which may have prevented a comprehensive understanding of the combined effect of damming and drought on the water cycle under a projected climate scenario hence a sufficiently high number of observations is particularly crucial in impounded rivers because of the complex interaction of hydro meteorological processes and landscape heterogeneity the effects of large dams such as the tgd in the yangtze river differ from previous studies in the dam river setting to new dam river lake interactions dai et al 2008 guo et al 2012 liu et al 2016 which increases the complexity of hydrological regimes along with the occurrence of continuous drought in the yrb as shown in fig s1 dai et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 furthermore this effect will be intensified when many ongoing and planned large scale dams located in the upstream yangtze river fig s2 are put into operation in the future zhang et al 2016 as such water cycle dynamics have largely changed and relevant environmental problems which once seemed manageable have also deteriorated however the damming and drought impacts on river water cycles have not yet attracted sufficient attention across the yangtze river because of the relative consistency of annual water discharge therefore this study presents the isoscapes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h from river and lake water along the yangtze river determined during the 2016 and 2018 flooding seasons combined with other published isotopic data ding et al 2014 li et al 2010 wu et al 2018 this study enhances understanding of the hydrological alterations of river damming regulation and drought along the yangtze river using stable water isotopes the specific objectives were to 1 explore the spatial temporal variations of surface water isotopes 2 assess how they have been affected by damming operations and drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographical setting the yangtze river is the longest river in asia 6 3 103 km and the third largest river in

shallow freshwater lakes distributed in the third grade relief fig 1b some shallow lakes have hydrologic connections with the yangtze river or its major tributaries wang and dou 1998 in particular two large lakes the dongting lake and poyang lake are closely connected with the yangtze river by the chenglingji clj and hukou hk outlets respectively the watershed is dominated by a subtropical warm and wet climate and mainly influenced by the asian monsoon the mean annual precipitation was approximately 1142 mm in the watershed from 1960 to 2018 most of which occurred during the wet seasons from may to october 2 2 water samples collection and isotopic analysis fig 1 displays river water and lake water samples taken from the yrb between july and august 2018 the authors extracted samples from 128 river water samples in the main channel and major tributaries of the yangtze river in late july and early august 2018 fig 1a and table s1 for lake water 24 shallow lakes were sampled for isotopic analysis from the mid low reaches of the yangtze river mly in august 2018 at least three samples from each studied lake were extracted approximately 10 cm below the lake water surface at each lake we measured all parameters water temperature dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity in situ using a handheld ysi 556 multimeter ysi inc yellow springs oh usa in addition to clearly reflect the effect of three gorges reservoir tgr river water samples n 70 within tgr were also conducted in late august 2016 all water samples were filtered through pre cleaned 0 22 Œºm acetate filters immediately sealed tightly in a 30 ml high density polyethylene bottle with paraffin film and finally stored in a refrigerator at 4 the isotopic compositions Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of all lake water samples were measured using a los gatos research lgr laser absorption water vapor isotope spectrometer los gatos research mountain view ca usa at the state key laboratory of lake science and environment chinese academy of sciences all the measured results of isotope signatures were expressed in per mil relative to the international vienna standard mean ocean water v smow standard using the Œ¥ notation the measurement uncertainties for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o was 0 5 and 0 1 respectively deuterium excess d excess Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o was calculated as an index to trace river water cycles and assess the evaporation extent of surface water deng et al 2016 wu et al 2018 the d excess values reflected kinetic fractionation effects on water isotopic compositions 2 3 additional input data apart from our river observation other published isotope data from 2003 to 2007 and in 2013 were used during the flood season to assess the altered water cycle of yangtze river ding et al 2014 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 the detailed information of these data is listed in table s1 the monthly isotope compositions of precipitation in the yrb were obtained from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip dataset system https www naweb iaea org which includes the seven sites of wuhan wh changsha cs nanjing nj chongqing cq chengdu cd kunming km and zunyi zy fig 1 the yrb drought years were

analysis of variance anova was used to analyze the differences in river water isotopes between upstream reservoir middle and lower reaches along the yangtze river all statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical package for social sciences ibm corp released 2013 followed by post hoc tukey s least significant difference test at the p 0 05 level of confidence 3 results 3 1 isoscape patterns of river and lake water river water temperatures ranged from 23 6 to 30 9 with an average of 27 6 in 2018 showing a gradual increase from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of yangtze river fig s3 compared with other years a wider range of river water Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values was observed during the flooding season of 2018 showing that Œ¥2h values varied from 127 9 to 34 4 with an average of 68 1 and Œ¥18o values from 17 1 to 5 2 with an average of 10 in 2018 fig 2 and table s1 the temporal variations in Œ¥18o isotopes seemed to be a slightly lower during the tgd construction period 2003 2009 compared to that after the tgd operation table 1 moreover the temporal patterns varied within distinct reaches for example the river water Œ¥18o isotopes in the flooding season of 2018 were the most negative in the upper reaches yet they were the most enriched in the lower reaches figs 2 and 3 river water Œ¥18o displayed a similar spatial pattern in the flooding season from 2003 to 2018 exhibiting a trend from lower Œ¥18o values in the yangtze upstream to higher Œ¥18o values in the yangtze downstream figs 2 and 3 the abrupt changes of Œ¥18o in the yangtze mainstream were associated with tributary inflow water from rivers and floodplain lakes because water samples were more enriched Œ¥18o values in tributaries than those in the mainstream however river water Œ¥18o and d excess exhibited a significant difference p 0 01 among different river sections during the observation years fig 3 the coefficients of variation cv in the Œ¥18o values showed a wider range in 2006 along the yangtze river compared with other years fig 3 which indicates that severe drought and damming regulations had greatly altered the yangtze river water cycle in contrast to the d excess values the river d excess values from yangtze upstream exhibited the highest variability from 2003 to 2018 showing the largest mean d excess values 21 4 fig 3 however a small fluctuation range of d excess was observed in the tgr section during the 2003 2018 period fig 3 the lowest mean d excess value of river water in 2006 was possibly related to drought conditions occurring in the yangtze downstream relative to other years the floodplain s shallow lake water Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h along the middle to lower reaches of the yangtze mly river displayed higher variability in the middle reaches compared with those in the lower reaches fig 4 two of the largest freshwater lakes the dongting lake no 2 and poyang lake no 13 had relatively negative Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values fig 4 and table 2 which are directly connected to the yangtze river all of these shallow lakes from lower reaches were characterized by relatively more positive Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values compared with those from the middle reaches furthermore most lake water presented lower d excess values from the middle reaches 10 whereas the negative d excess values were mainly found in the lower reaches fig 4c implying the greater evaporation effects in the shallow lakes from the lower reaches 3 2 longitudinal variations of d excess along the yangtze river for the flooding season of 2018 the river water d excess presented a small range along the yangtze river varying from 3 4 to 18 3 with an average of 12 3 the d excess values in river water from the mly were relatively lower than those in the upstream and tgr section fig 5 f which are similar to the longitudinal variations in 2013 showing less fluctuation of d excess values in the tgr section by contrast a greater fluctuation of d excess was shown along the yangtze mainstream during the period from 2003 to 2007 fig 5a d in specific the notable fluctuations of d excess values in the river water were found among different sections from the upstream area to the lower reaches which may be associated with the disturbances in damming construction from 2003 to 2007 3 3 relationships between Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values the local meteoric water line lmwl in the yrb was established as Œ¥2h 7 59 Œ¥18o 8 14 r2 0 91 fig 6 based on the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip monthly dataset the slope and intercept of lmwl were lower than the global meteoric water line gmwl Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o 10 reported by craig 1961 both the slope 7 33 and intercept 4 23 of this linear regression line between Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in the yangtze river defined as yangtze river evaporation line yrel were similar to the lmwl during the flooding seasons of 2003 to 2018 fig 6 for 2018 the isotopic data from upstream scattered into the lower right area tgd reservoir systems were located in the middle and samples from mly are shown in the upper right section of fig 6 indicating that the river water Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values gradually increased from upstream to downstream both the slope and interception of yrel in 2018 were larger than those in other years table 1 in contrast to lakes the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o relationship was defined as the lake water evaporation line lwel Œ¥2h 5 6 Œ¥18o 6 43 in lake group i and Œ¥2h 9 33 Œ¥18o 10 5 in lake group ii respectively fig 6 lake group ii is mainly located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river 4 discussion 4 1 environmental controls on the river water isoscapes in the global water cycle land surface water is predominantly supplied by precipitation thus river water inherits the isotopic signatures of precipitation brooks et al 2012 kendall and coplen 2001 ogrinc et al 2008 the Œ¥18o and d excess in river water presented notable spatial and temporal variations along the yangtze river as shown in figs 2 3 and 5 indicating that river water isotopic compositions were primarily caused by contrasting hydrological processes e g recharge sources and damming regulations as well as evaporation in the yrb the annual variations of river Œ¥18o values showed slight differences during the flooding seasons from 2003 to 2018 table 1 which may indicate the existence of a small annual fluctuation of isotopic compositions in watershed precipitation the lmwl displayed a flatter slope and a smaller intercept compared with the gmwl fig 6 implying that precipitation was affected by sub cloud secondary evaporation kendall and coplen 2001 n√©grel et al 2016 in the yangtze river watershed precipitation is mainly dominated by low latitude oceanic regions and experienced isotopic kinetic fractionation hence it resulted in a Œ¥18o enrichment in the raindrops and subsequently in river water with a lower slope and interception of a yangtze river evaporation line fig 6 spatially the more depleted Œ¥18o isotopes in the upstream yangtze were closely associated with runoff from the glacier snow meltwater and permafrost from elevated mountains li et al 2020 large area permafrost were found with glacier meltwater distributed in the upstream regions large volumes of meltwater replenished the upstream yangtze due to the high temperatures during the flooding seasons this meltwater generally contained more depleted isotopic compositions in the source region of the yangtze river li et al 2020 which resulted in the abnormal river water isotopes in the upstream regions from 2003 to 2018 fig 3 by contrast the river water Œ¥18o in the three gorges reservoir tgr regions exhibited relatively homogenous fluctuations and became more positive from chongqing cq to tgd which is a result of strong mixtures and evaporation from large areas of open reservoir water wang et al 2019 this phenomenon can be also evidenced by the spatial variations of Œ¥18o in the tgr by highly dense sampling in the tgr during the flooding season of 2016 fig s4 this positive trend of river water Œ¥18o in the tgr may be affected by variations of evaporation in the tgr because evaporation could cause the enrichment of heavy isotopes in surface water wang et al 2021 a recent study reported that reservoir evaporation occupies approximately 22 of china s total water consumption liu et al 2015 in addition groundwater is also an important contributor for the spatial patterns of river water Œ¥18o along the yangtze river groundwater shows a more negative Œ¥18o value in the upper yangtze river in comparison with the mid lower reaches of yangtze river table s2 which partly causes the spatial patterns of isotopic compositions in river water river water was more enriched in heavy isotopes in the mid lower reaches than those in the upper reaches fig 2 indicating that evaporation fractionation was becoming greater when following a downstream direction the evaporation amount and air temperatures increased from the upper to lower reaches figs s5 and s6 which to some extent results in greater evaporative isotopic fractionation in the mly this effect was also verified by river water spatial variations river water temperature showed significant correlations with river Œ¥18o r 0 72 p 0 01 and Œ¥2h r 0 73 p 0 01 values fig s3 indicating water temperature is a primary factor controlling the river isotopic variability along the yangtze river this finding is consistent to previous researches in the damming rivers such as the wujiang river wang et al 2019 and rivers from eastern canada and the new england states of the northeastern united states timsic and patterson 2014 furthermore the spatial patterns of isotopes in the mly are closely associated with those connected shallow lakes with enriched Œ¥18o values fig 4 there are numerous shallow lakes in the mly pouring into the yangtze river during the flooding season which partially contributes to the positive Œ¥18o values in the mly li et al 2022 lakes from the lower reaches lake group ii presented the most enriched Œ¥18o values relative to the middle reaches which are scattered throughout the upper right section of the yangtze river evaporation line yrel thereby contributing to the river water Œ¥18o patterns in the mly the negative d excess values of lake group ii also indicate that these lakes experience disequilibrium isotopic fractionation under high temperature in the lower reaches which results in the large slope of lwl in lake group ii fig 4 4 2 effects of damming regulation and drought on river water cycle river water cycles remarkably change after river damming activities involving water residence time water solutes and water discharge guo et al 2012 v√∂r√∂smarty and sahagian 2000 vanplantinga et al 2017 yang et al 2006 numerous dams are distributed in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and this study sets an example of the tgd to explore the damming effects on the altered river water cycle the water discharge and water level in the yangtze mainstream were remarkably altered by tgd regulations on impoundment and release after tgd operation fig 7 the differences of water discharge and water level became more distinct from the initial 2003 to 2006 to the normal state 2008 to present seen from the upstream gauging station data of cuntan and downstream of yichang the contrasting differences in water discharge between two stations indicates that the tgr water presented a longer residence time furthermore the dam induced change of river water cycles can be also revealed by the variability of river water Œ¥18o and d excess values jiang et al 2021 li et al 2016 soulsby et al 2015 vanplantinga et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the longitudinal variability of river water d excess values figs 2 and 5 revealed that tgd regulation largely affect the yangtze river water cycles especially in the tgr and middle reaches specifically compared with the normal stage of tgd operation after 2008 the higher the coefficients of variation cv and longitudinal variability of river water d excess values in the tgr and middle reaches became evident during the initial and transitional stage 2003 2007 figs 3 and 5 the water level increased from ca 135 m during 2003 2005 ca 155 m during 2006 2007 and ca 170 m during 2008 2009 to the maximal capacity level of 175 m since 2010 fig 7 as the tgr water level and the storage capacity increased the residence time of tgr became longer and induced more complete mixing hence during the initial stage of tgd operation 2003 2007 the large variability of d excess and Œ¥18o in the downstream could be attributed to upstream behavior fig 5a d which is closely associated with short residence time and incomplete mixing in the tgr in contrast to the normal operation stage after 2010 e g 2013 and 2018 the river water d excess and Œ¥18o values became more homogeneous in the tgr because of longer residence time and a more vigorous mixing process thereby leading to relatively lower variabilities in the isotopic signatures residing downstream with lower cv of d excess and Œ¥18o figs 3 and 5 this situation could dramatically change the aquatic ecosystems from a continuous lotic ecosystem to a huge reservoir and increases the risk of eutrophication and algal blooms in the reservoir regions he et al 2021 therefore river damming regulations remarkably changed the longitudinal hydrological connectivity and water cycles by prolonging the residence time and results in the decline of ecological health and ecosystem services function for river basin since the tgd operation began operation in 2003 several droughts have occurred in the yangtze river downstream from 2003 to 2013 as shown in fig s1 dai et al 2008 liu et al 2016 the drought climate induced heavy isotopes more enriched in precipitation which in turn affected river water isotopic enrichment and hydrological processes by increased evaporation signals saranya et al 2020 vanplantinga et al 2017 the relatively more enriched river water Œ¥18o was observed from 2003 to 2007 compared with that in 2018 fig 3 indicating that river water isotopes signatures could well respond to drought in the yrb specifically the most negative d excess value 4 5 was found during 2006 with the most severe drought in the mly regions fig 3 which indicated that drought could stimulate evaporative fractionation on river water similarly seen from fig 7 the lowest mean water discharge and water level from yichang and cuntan stations was observed during the sampling period of august 2006 which is resulted from the most severe drought in the whole watershed this drought activity involving water isotopes agrees with earlier research jiang et al 2021 saranya et al 2020 for example jiang et al 2021 reported that the dagu river exhibited abnormal d excess values because of the dual effects of strong evaporation under drought conditions and river damming in the lower jordan river the lowest Œ¥18o and d excess of river water samples resulted from the combined effect of aridity and damming regulation hillel et al 2015 4 3 wider implications for cascade damming river systems this study has demonstrated the potential for using isotopic signals in regulated yangtze river systems which identifies how tgd impoundments and water release affect water cycle dynamics through landscapes and associated riverscapes the damping effect shown by isotopic tracers has been previously observed in many damming rivers worldwide such as the rio grande river in the southwestern united states vitvar et al 2007 and the orange river in southern south africa table 3 an isotopic sketch shows that the isotopic signatures Œ¥18o and d excess in released water from dams significantly vary from those of inflowing water after storage in reservoirs this effect is accumulated by a cascade of dams along the yangtze river hence the yangtze river water Œ¥18o gradually increases while d excess decreases from upstream to downstream in the dammed rivers fig 8 this cumulative effect becomes more prominent in the upper yangtze because numerous large dams are under construction in the upper reaches fig s2 for example two large dams the baihetan dam and wudongde dam were completed in 2021 in the upper yangtze valley with high reservoir water levels and storage capacity this caused the homogenization of reservoir water and thus determined the lower fluctuations of Œ¥18o and d excess along the lower reaches of these reservoir this study markedly illustrates spatial and temporal changes of Œ¥18o and d excess in the yangtze river in recent years these changes show a close relationship with the damming effects based on limited isotopic observations damming effects on the hydrodynamics and sustainability of ecosystems should be thoroughly considered in future research additionally the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h approaches may shed new light on identifying alterations in the water cycles across large river systems where the natural environment and anthropogenic activities strongly interact especially in the absence of operating rule data stable isotopes could expedite advancements in assessing the impacts of river regulation on river hydrodynamics water quality and stream temperatures m√ºller et al 2008 xiong et al 2020 for tgd the impacts on yangtze levels generally decreased along a longitudinal direction from tgd to the estuary with a total lag time of approximately 9 12 days and altered the yangtze channel erosion due to reduced sediment load he et al 2021 wang et al 2013 stable isotopic studies Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of large rivers like the mississippi river or danube river are not comparable to the yangtze river studies the systematic isotope studies conducted in the yrb factored in the effects of the various landscape and associated riverscapes which resulted in cyclic alterations unique to the yrb environment overall this study provides long term and high resolution data of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o activity in yangtze river water which makes it a systematic complement to the isotopic database worthy of future research 5 conclusions this study presents the dual effects of damming and drought on yangtze river water cycle dynamics using isoscapes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h from river and lake water along the yangtze river during the 2016 and 2018 flooding seasons we compared these results with the historical isotopic data from 2003 to 2013 spatially river water Œ¥18o values exhibited a positive trend from upstream to the lower reaches because of the contrasting recharged sources complex mixing and evaporation from upstream to the lower reaches of the yangtze river large volumes of meltwater from glacier and permafrost replenished the upstream yangtze during the flooding seasons resulting in abnormally depleted river water Œ¥18o in the upstream regions the river water Œ¥18o in the tgr regions exhibited a positive trend from cq to tgd with a relatively homogenous fluctuation because of its strong mixture and evaporation by contrast river water in the mid lower reaches was more enriched in heavy isotopes because of strong evaporation under high temperature conditions and replenishment from shallow lakes with isotopic enrichment moreover the higher longitudinal variability and cv of river water d excess revealed that tgd regulation largely altered the yangtze river water cycles especially in the tgr and middle reaches under different operation models river water d excess and Œ¥18o values became more homogeneous in the tgr because of longer residence time and a more robust mixing process which led to relatively lower variability in the downstream isotopic signatures during the normal operation stage after 2010 i e 2013 and 2018 this study demonstrates that the d excess and Œ¥18o can be used to explore river water cycle dynamics induced by both natural environmental variability and anthropogenic activities the cumulative cascade of damming effects on the altered water cycle needs more research in light of increasing crisis level problems based on climate and anthropogenic trends that affect water quality river ecosystems and fish biodiversity credit

3294,the water regimes and biogeochemical cycles are remarkably affected by river damming and drought around the world however the dual effects on river water cycles have not yet attracted sufficient attention along the yangtze river because of the relative consistency of annual water regimes this study first explored the altered water cycle associated with damming and drought using surface water isoscapes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of river and lake water along the yangtze river during the flooding seasons of 2016 and 2018 combined with other historical isotopic data from 2003 to 2013 the results show that river water isotopes are markedly varied on both spatial and temporal scales the relatively more enriched river water representing Œ¥18o values were observed from 2003 to 2007 compared with those in 2018 which were possibly caused by increased evaporative fractionation under abnormal drought conditions in the yangtze river spatially river water Œ¥18o values exhibited a positive trend from upstream to the lower reaches because of the contrasting recharged sources complex mixing and evaporation from upstream to the lower reaches of the yangtze river this trend was related to variations in surface water temperature and water evaporation during the flooding seasons evidenced by a significant correlation between river isotopes and river water temperature moreover the large variability in deuterium excess d excess and Œ¥18o in the downstream could be inherited from the upstream because of short residence time and incomplete mixing in the three gorges reservoir tgr during the initial stage of the three gorges dam tgd operation 2003 2007 in contrast the relatively lower variability of d excess and Œ¥18o was found in the downstream area due to the complete mixing in the tgr causing the homogenization of reservoir water during the normal operation stage after 2010 e g 2013 and 2018 drought stimulates evaporative fractionation on river water and result in more negative d excess values especially in 2006 the dual effects of river damming and drought remarkably changed the longitudinal hydrological connectivity and water cycle dynamics by prolonging the residence time and enhancing the water mixing which should be thoroughly considered for water resource management especially for regions with heavily regulated rivers keywords stable water isotopes cascade dams drought residence time evaporative enrichment surface water temperature 1 introduction rivers provide food and water for human consumption recreational spaces hydropower and industrial production however economic development worldwide has led to approximately 2 8 million dams and reservoirs constructed for navigation agricultural irrigation and for reducing floods and drought geris et al 2015 grill et al 2019 currently almost two thirds of the global rivers are utilized by dams and reservoirs the 2016 paris agreement and the worldwide need for greater renewable energy will lead to even more dam construction by 2030 grill et al 2015 maavara et al 2020 the damming river reservoir systems can result in river fragmentation flow regime changes in terms of magnitude frequency duration and timing as well as sediment transport of chemicals containing nutrients like phosphorous leading to massive eutrophication problems duan et al 2019 yang et al 2007 notably large dams like the three gorges dam tgd which controls china s yangtze river flow can decrease the sediment load but increases the water temperature threatens biodiversity xiong et al 2020 yang et al 2006 particularly in densely populated regions rivers are highly regulated leading to hydrological and ecological alterations such as decline of freshwater flux into the sea and sediment trapping humborg et al 1997 pe√±as and barqu√≠n 2019 yang et al 2011 subsequently increasing river fragmentation has been threatening the structure and sustainability of aquatic communities maavara et al 2020 winemiller et al 2016 xu and pittock 2021 problems related to regulated rivers are especially severe in china where over half of the world s large dams have been built since 1950 cheng et al 2015 duan et al 2019 xu and pittock 2021 by 2017 there were 52 601 dams in the yangtze river basin yrb representing 53 2 of all the dams built in china including the world s largest hydroelectric tgd xu and pittock 2021 hence the yangtze river has attracted prodigious international attention best 2019 m√ºller et al 2008 despite the large body of research delineating the alterations of the hydrological regime caused by cascading reservoirs and assessing the damming effect on river ecosystems and aquatic biodiversity lu et al 2020 wang et al 2020 more explicit examinations of the cumulative damming effects on hydrological cycles have become necessary this is because the effects are highly variable based on the artificial regulation of hydrological system functions including flood control or inter basin water division barbarossa et al 2020 best 2019 furthermore these problems can be further exacerbated by regional drought which is regarded as a worldwide natural hazard christian et al 2021 drought also has adverse effects on regional water cycles and water resources dai et al 2008 jiang et al 2021 zhang et al 2015 recent research demonstrates that global drought is expected to increase in step with observed warming trends moreover this phenomenon will be strengthened in some regions because global temperatures continue to increase with the rising anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions dai 2013 sheffield and wood 2008 therefore regions with heavily regulated rivers must be accurately explored with the ability to recognize altered hydrological processes induced by dam construction it is also important to realize that understanding the effects of drought is crucial to proper reservoir management and water resource utilization the combined effects of river damming and drought on river water cycles can benefit from using isotopic tracers methods Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h in large regulated river basins chiogna et al 2018 deng et al 2016 vanplantinga et al 2017 however reports on this type of research are scarce largely because such research is still challenging due to the limitations of any highly spatial and temporal resolution sampling campaign over large areas these isotopic landscapes isoscapes have been regarded as important tools not only to trace the water cycle dynamics e g catchment hydrology and seasonal rainfall patterns bowen and good 2015 brooks et al 2012 wu et al 2021 but also to illustrate flow changes due to dam monitoring regulations or extreme conditions such as drought or flooding chiogna et al 2018 jiang et al 2021 marchina et al 2017 remmer et al 2019 some scholars have recently assessed the damming or drought impacts on river water cycles using the Œ¥18o isoscape method and focusing on large river basins li et al 2016 n√©grel et al 2016 vanplantinga et al 2017 wang et al 2019 an interesting example from the yangtze river showed that the tgd greatly buffered the fluctuations in river water isotopes and induced a one month lag in the yangtze river water cycle due to precipitation whereas drought led to greater evaporative enrichment of river water deng et al 2016 wu et al 2018 wang et al 2019 identified that in the highly regulated wujiang river basin in guizhou china the cumulative effects of cascading dams caused a jagged increase of isotopic compositions along the impounded river these isoscapes studies solely depended on a short term observation of the yangtze river which may have prevented a comprehensive understanding of the combined effect of damming and drought on the water cycle under a projected climate scenario hence a sufficiently high number of observations is particularly crucial in impounded rivers because of the complex interaction of hydro meteorological processes and landscape heterogeneity the effects of large dams such as the tgd in the yangtze river differ from previous studies in the dam river setting to new dam river lake interactions dai et al 2008 guo et al 2012 liu et al 2016 which increases the complexity of hydrological regimes along with the occurrence of continuous drought in the yrb as shown in fig s1 dai et al 2008 zhang et al 2015 furthermore this effect will be intensified when many ongoing and planned large scale dams located in the upstream yangtze river fig s2 are put into operation in the future zhang et al 2016 as such water cycle dynamics have largely changed and relevant environmental problems which once seemed manageable have also deteriorated however the damming and drought impacts on river water cycles have not yet attracted sufficient attention across the yangtze river because of the relative consistency of annual water discharge therefore this study presents the isoscapes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h from river and lake water along the yangtze river determined during the 2016 and 2018 flooding seasons combined with other published isotopic data ding et al 2014 li et al 2010 wu et al 2018 this study enhances understanding of the hydrological alterations of river damming regulation and drought along the yangtze river using stable water isotopes the specific objectives were to 1 explore the spatial temporal variations of surface water isotopes 2 assess how they have been affected by damming operations and drought 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographical setting the yangtze river is the longest river in asia 6 3 103 km and the third largest river in the world with a watershed area of 1 8 106 km2 it originates from the tibetan plateau at an altitude of 4000 to 5000 m and flows eastward to the east china sea bordered by shanghai traditionally the yangtze river can be divided into three sections according to hydrological and geographical settings 1 the upper section between the headwaters and yichang 2 the river s midsection between yichang and hukou and 3 the lower section downstream of the hukou reaches fig 1 a the upper reaches are mainly fed by large tributaries such as the yalong river yal r minjiang river min r the sichuan jialingjiang river jia r the great bend area also known as the jinshajiang river jins r which is 50 km away from lijiang and finally the wujiang wu r river which starts in the wumeng ranges on the yunnan guizhou plateau and flows through four provinces yunnan guizhou sichuan and hubei the upper watershed is characterized by active tectonics and steep high mountains with an elevation above 3500 fig 1b located in the first grade relief many large dams have been built e g the xiangjiaba dam on the jinsha river and tgd or are under construction e g the xiluodu dam an arch dam and the hydroelectric wudongde dam both on the jinsha river located in the upstream and serving these major tributaries fig s2 the yangtze river has 15 dams exceeding 100 m in height and another 20 or more were considered to be built by 2021 https globaldamwatch org the largest hydropower project in the world of the tgd is situated between the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river and started its full operation in 2009 the three gorges reservoir tgr covers the upstream river channel from yichang to chongqing fig 1a the water level of the tgr fluctuates seasonally between 145 m and 175 m because of water release and storage for flood control as well as power generation the storage capacity varies from 17 2 km3 to 39 3 km3 the middle and lower reaches are composed of floodplains and delta plains with numerous shallow freshwater lakes distributed in the third grade relief fig 1b some shallow lakes have hydrologic connections with the yangtze river or its major tributaries wang and dou 1998 in particular two large lakes the dongting lake and poyang lake are closely connected with the yangtze river by the chenglingji clj and hukou hk outlets respectively the watershed is dominated by a subtropical warm and wet climate and mainly influenced by the asian monsoon the mean annual precipitation was approximately 1142 mm in the watershed from 1960 to 2018 most of which occurred during the wet seasons from may to october 2 2 water samples collection and isotopic analysis fig 1 displays river water and lake water samples taken from the yrb between july and august 2018 the authors extracted samples from 128 river water samples in the main channel and major tributaries of the yangtze river in late july and early august 2018 fig 1a and table s1 for lake water 24 shallow lakes were sampled for isotopic analysis from the mid low reaches of the yangtze river mly in august 2018 at least three samples from each studied lake were extracted approximately 10 cm below the lake water surface at each lake we measured all parameters water temperature dissolved oxygen and electrical conductivity in situ using a handheld ysi 556 multimeter ysi inc yellow springs oh usa in addition to clearly reflect the effect of three gorges reservoir tgr river water samples n 70 within tgr were also conducted in late august 2016 all water samples were filtered through pre cleaned 0 22 Œºm acetate filters immediately sealed tightly in a 30 ml high density polyethylene bottle with paraffin film and finally stored in a refrigerator at 4 the isotopic compositions Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o of all lake water samples were measured using a los gatos research lgr laser absorption water vapor isotope spectrometer los gatos research mountain view ca usa at the state key laboratory of lake science and environment chinese academy of sciences all the measured results of isotope signatures were expressed in per mil relative to the international vienna standard mean ocean water v smow standard using the Œ¥ notation the measurement uncertainties for Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o was 0 5 and 0 1 respectively deuterium excess d excess Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o was calculated as an index to trace river water cycles and assess the evaporation extent of surface water deng et al 2016 wu et al 2018 the d excess values reflected kinetic fractionation effects on water isotopic compositions 2 3 additional input data apart from our river observation other published isotope data from 2003 to 2007 and in 2013 were used during the flood season to assess the altered water cycle of yangtze river ding et al 2014 li et al 2010 zhang et al 2016 the detailed information of these data is listed in table s1 the monthly isotope compositions of precipitation in the yrb were obtained from the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip dataset system https www naweb iaea org which includes the seven sites of wuhan wh changsha cs nanjing nj chongqing cq chengdu cd kunming km and zunyi zy fig 1 the yrb drought years were

analysis of variance anova was used to analyze the differences in river water isotopes between upstream reservoir middle and lower reaches along the yangtze river all statistical analyses were conducted using the statistical package for social sciences ibm corp released 2013 followed by post hoc tukey s least significant difference test at the p 0 05 level of confidence 3 results 3 1 isoscape patterns of river and lake water river water temperatures ranged from 23 6 to 30 9 with an average of 27 6 in 2018 showing a gradual increase from the upper reaches to the lower reaches of yangtze river fig s3 compared with other years a wider range of river water Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values was observed during the flooding season of 2018 showing that Œ¥2h values varied from 127 9 to 34 4 with an average of 68 1 and Œ¥18o values from 17 1 to 5 2 with an average of 10 in 2018 fig 2 and table s1 the temporal variations in Œ¥18o isotopes seemed to be a slightly lower during the tgd construction period 2003 2009 compared to that after the tgd operation table 1 moreover the temporal patterns varied within distinct reaches for example the river water Œ¥18o isotopes in the flooding season of 2018 were the most negative in the upper reaches yet they were the most enriched in the lower reaches figs 2 and 3 river water Œ¥18o displayed a similar spatial pattern in the flooding season from 2003 to 2018 exhibiting a trend from lower Œ¥18o values in the yangtze upstream to higher Œ¥18o values in the yangtze downstream figs 2 and 3 the abrupt changes of Œ¥18o in the yangtze mainstream were associated with tributary inflow water from rivers and floodplain lakes because water samples were more enriched Œ¥18o values in tributaries than those in the mainstream however river water Œ¥18o and d excess exhibited a significant difference p 0 01 among different river sections during the observation years fig 3 the coefficients of variation cv in the Œ¥18o values showed a wider range in 2006 along the yangtze river compared with other years fig 3 which indicates that severe drought and damming regulations had greatly altered the yangtze river water cycle in contrast to the d excess values the river d excess values from yangtze upstream exhibited the highest variability from 2003 to 2018 showing the largest mean d excess values 21 4 fig 3 however a small fluctuation range of d excess was observed in the tgr section during the 2003 2018 period fig 3 the lowest mean d excess value of river water in 2006 was possibly related to drought conditions occurring in the yangtze downstream relative to other years the floodplain s shallow lake water Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h along the middle to lower reaches of the yangtze mly river displayed higher variability in the middle reaches compared with those in the lower reaches fig 4 two of the largest freshwater lakes the dongting lake no 2 and poyang lake no 13 had relatively negative Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values fig 4 and table 2 which are directly connected to the yangtze river all of these shallow lakes from lower reaches were characterized by relatively more positive Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h values compared with those from the middle reaches furthermore most lake water presented lower d excess values from the middle reaches 10 whereas the negative d excess values were mainly found in the lower reaches fig 4c implying the greater evaporation effects in the shallow lakes from the lower reaches 3 2 longitudinal variations of d excess along the yangtze river for the flooding season of 2018 the river water d excess presented a small range along the yangtze river varying from 3 4 to 18 3 with an average of 12 3 the d excess values in river water from the mly were relatively lower than those in the upstream and tgr section fig 5 f which are similar to the longitudinal variations in 2013 showing less fluctuation of d excess values in the tgr section by contrast a greater fluctuation of d excess was shown along the yangtze mainstream during the period from 2003 to 2007 fig 5a d in specific the notable fluctuations of d excess values in the river water were found among different sections from the upstream area to the lower reaches which may be associated with the disturbances in damming construction from 2003 to 2007 3 3 relationships between Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values the local meteoric water line lmwl in the yrb was established as Œ¥2h 7 59 Œ¥18o 8 14 r2 0 91 fig 6 based on the global network of isotopes in precipitation gnip monthly dataset the slope and intercept of lmwl were lower than the global meteoric water line gmwl Œ¥2h 8 Œ¥18o 10 reported by craig 1961 both the slope 7 33 and intercept 4 23 of this linear regression line between Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o in the yangtze river defined as yangtze river evaporation line yrel were similar to the lmwl during the flooding seasons of 2003 to 2018 fig 6 for 2018 the isotopic data from upstream scattered into the lower right area tgd reservoir systems were located in the middle and samples from mly are shown in the upper right section of fig 6 indicating that the river water Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o values gradually increased from upstream to downstream both the slope and interception of yrel in 2018 were larger than those in other years table 1 in contrast to lakes the Œ¥2h Œ¥18o relationship was defined as the lake water evaporation line lwel Œ¥2h 5 6 Œ¥18o 6 43 in lake group i and Œ¥2h 9 33 Œ¥18o 10 5 in lake group ii respectively fig 6 lake group ii is mainly located in the lower reaches of the yangtze river 4 discussion 4 1 environmental controls on the river water isoscapes in the global water cycle land surface water is predominantly supplied by precipitation thus river water inherits the isotopic signatures of precipitation brooks et al 2012 kendall and coplen 2001 ogrinc et al 2008 the Œ¥18o and d excess in river water presented notable spatial and temporal variations along the yangtze river as shown in figs 2 3 and 5 indicating that river water isotopic compositions were primarily caused by contrasting hydrological processes e g recharge sources and damming regulations as well as evaporation in the yrb the annual variations of river Œ¥18o values showed slight differences during the flooding seasons from 2003 to 2018 table 1 which may indicate the existence of a small annual fluctuation of isotopic compositions in watershed precipitation the lmwl displayed a flatter slope and a smaller intercept compared with the gmwl fig 6 implying that precipitation was affected by sub cloud secondary evaporation kendall and coplen 2001 n√©grel et al 2016 in the yangtze river watershed precipitation is mainly dominated by low latitude oceanic regions and experienced isotopic kinetic fractionation hence it resulted in a Œ¥18o enrichment in the raindrops and subsequently in river water with a lower slope and interception of a yangtze river evaporation line fig 6 spatially the more depleted Œ¥18o isotopes in the upstream yangtze were closely associated with runoff from the glacier snow meltwater and permafrost from elevated mountains li et al 2020 large area permafrost were found with glacier meltwater distributed in the upstream regions large volumes of meltwater replenished the upstream yangtze due to the high temperatures during the flooding seasons this meltwater generally contained more depleted isotopic compositions in the source region of the yangtze river li et al 2020 which resulted in the abnormal river water isotopes in the upstream regions from 2003 to 2018 fig 3 by contrast the river water Œ¥18o in the three gorges reservoir tgr regions exhibited relatively homogenous fluctuations and became more positive from chongqing cq to tgd which is a result of strong mixtures and evaporation from large areas of open reservoir water wang et al 2019 this phenomenon can be also evidenced by the spatial variations of Œ¥18o in the tgr by highly dense sampling in the tgr during the flooding season of 2016 fig s4 this positive trend of river water Œ¥18o in the tgr may be affected by variations of evaporation in the tgr because evaporation could cause the enrichment of heavy isotopes in surface water wang et al 2021 a recent study reported that reservoir evaporation occupies approximately 22 of china s total water consumption liu et al 2015 in addition groundwater is also an important contributor for the spatial patterns of river water Œ¥18o along the yangtze river groundwater shows a more negative Œ¥18o value in the upper yangtze river in comparison with the mid lower reaches of yangtze river table s2 which partly causes the spatial patterns of isotopic compositions in river water river water was more enriched in heavy isotopes in the mid lower reaches than those in the upper reaches fig 2 indicating that evaporation fractionation was becoming greater when following a downstream direction the evaporation amount and air temperatures increased from the upper to lower reaches figs s5 and s6 which to some extent results in greater evaporative isotopic fractionation in the mly this effect was also verified by river water spatial variations river water temperature showed significant correlations with river Œ¥18o r 0 72 p 0 01 and Œ¥2h r 0 73 p 0 01 values fig s3 indicating water temperature is a primary factor controlling the river isotopic variability along the yangtze river this finding is consistent to previous researches in the damming rivers such as the wujiang river wang et al 2019 and rivers from eastern canada and the new england states of the northeastern united states timsic and patterson 2014 furthermore the spatial patterns of isotopes in the mly are closely associated with those connected shallow lakes with enriched Œ¥18o values fig 4 there are numerous shallow lakes in the mly pouring into the yangtze river during the flooding season which partially contributes to the positive Œ¥18o values in the mly li et al 2022 lakes from the lower reaches lake group ii presented the most enriched Œ¥18o values relative to the middle reaches which are scattered throughout the upper right section of the yangtze river evaporation line yrel thereby contributing to the river water Œ¥18o patterns in the mly the negative d excess values of lake group ii also indicate that these lakes experience disequilibrium isotopic fractionation under high temperature in the lower reaches which results in the large slope of lwl in lake group ii fig 4 4 2 effects of damming regulation and drought on river water cycle river water cycles remarkably change after river damming activities involving water residence time water solutes and water discharge guo et al 2012 v√∂r√∂smarty and sahagian 2000 vanplantinga et al 2017 yang et al 2006 numerous dams are distributed in the upper reaches of the yangtze river and this study sets an example of the tgd to explore the damming effects on the altered river water cycle the water discharge and water level in the yangtze mainstream were remarkably altered by tgd regulations on impoundment and release after tgd operation fig 7 the differences of water discharge and water level became more distinct from the initial 2003 to 2006 to the normal state 2008 to present seen from the upstream gauging station data of cuntan and downstream of yichang the contrasting differences in water discharge between two stations indicates that the tgr water presented a longer residence time furthermore the dam induced change of river water cycles can be also revealed by the variability of river water Œ¥18o and d excess values jiang et al 2021 li et al 2016 soulsby et al 2015 vanplantinga et al 2017 wang et al 2019 the longitudinal variability of river water d excess values figs 2 and 5 revealed that tgd regulation largely affect the yangtze river water cycles especially in the tgr and middle reaches specifically compared with the normal stage of tgd operation after 2008 the higher the coefficients of variation cv and longitudinal variability of river water d excess values in the tgr and middle reaches became evident during the initial and transitional stage 2003 2007 figs 3 and 5 the water level increased from ca 135 m during 2003 2005 ca 155 m during 2006 2007 and ca 170 m during 2008 2009 to the maximal capacity level of 175 m since 2010 fig 7 as the tgr water level and the storage capacity increased the residence time of tgr became longer and induced more complete mixing hence during the initial stage of tgd operation 2003 2007 the large variability of d excess and Œ¥18o in the downstream could be attributed to upstream behavior fig 5a d which is closely associated with short residence time and incomplete mixing in the tgr in contrast to the normal operation stage after 2010 e g 2013 and 2018 the river water d excess and Œ¥18o values became more homogeneous in the tgr because of longer residence time and a more vigorous mixing process thereby leading to relatively lower variabilities in the isotopic signatures residing downstream with lower cv of d excess and Œ¥18o figs 3 and 5 this situation could dramatically change the aquatic ecosystems from a continuous lotic ecosystem to a huge reservoir and increases the risk of eutrophication and algal blooms in the reservoir regions he et al 2021 therefore river damming regulations remarkably changed the longitudinal hydrological connectivity and water cycles by prolonging the residence time and results in the decline of ecological health and ecosystem services function for river basin since the tgd operation began operation in 2003 several droughts have occurred in the yangtze river downstream from 2003 to 2013 as shown in fig s1 dai et al 2008 liu et al 2016 the drought climate induced heavy isotopes more enriched in precipitation which in turn affected river water isotopic enrichment and hydrological processes by increased evaporation signals saranya et al 2020 vanplantinga et al 2017 the relatively more enriched river water Œ¥18o was observed from 2003 to 2007 compared with that in 2018 fig 3 indicating that river water isotopes signatures could well respond to drought in the yrb specifically the most negative d excess value 4 5 was found during 2006 with the most severe drought in the mly regions fig 3 which indicated that drought could stimulate evaporative fractionation on river water similarly seen from fig 7 the lowest mean water discharge and water level from yichang and cuntan stations was observed during the sampling period of august 2006 which is resulted from the most severe drought in the whole watershed this drought activity involving water isotopes agrees with earlier research jiang et al 2021 saranya et al 2020 for example jiang et al 2021 reported that the dagu river exhibited abnormal d excess values because of the dual effects of strong evaporation under drought conditions and river damming in the lower jordan river the lowest Œ¥18o and d excess of river water samples resulted from the combined effect of aridity and damming regulation hillel et al 2015 4 3 wider implications for cascade damming river systems this study has demonstrated the potential for using isotopic signals in regulated yangtze river systems which identifies how tgd impoundments and water release affect water cycle dynamics through landscapes and associated riverscapes the damping effect shown by isotopic tracers has been previously observed in many damming rivers worldwide such as the rio grande river in the southwestern united states vitvar et al 2007 and the orange river in southern south africa table 3 an isotopic sketch shows that the isotopic signatures Œ¥18o and d excess in released water from dams significantly vary from those of inflowing water after storage in reservoirs this effect is accumulated by a cascade of dams along the yangtze river hence the yangtze river water Œ¥18o gradually increases while d excess decreases from upstream to downstream in the dammed rivers fig 8 this cumulative effect becomes more prominent in the upper yangtze because numerous large dams are under construction in the upper reaches fig s2 for example two large dams the baihetan dam and wudongde dam were completed in 2021 in the upper yangtze valley with high reservoir water levels and storage capacity this caused the homogenization of reservoir water and thus determined the lower fluctuations of Œ¥18o and d excess along the lower reaches of these reservoir this study markedly illustrates spatial and temporal changes of Œ¥18o and d excess in the yangtze river in recent years these changes show a close relationship with the damming effects based on limited isotopic observations damming effects on the hydrodynamics and sustainability of ecosystems should be thoroughly considered in future research additionally the Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h approaches may shed new light on identifying alterations in the water cycles across large river systems where the natural environment and anthropogenic activities strongly interact especially in the absence of operating rule data stable isotopes could expedite advancements in assessing the impacts of river regulation on river hydrodynamics water quality and stream temperatures m√ºller et al 2008 xiong et al 2020 for tgd the impacts on yangtze levels generally decreased along a longitudinal direction from tgd to the estuary with a total lag time of approximately 9 12 days and altered the yangtze channel erosion due to reduced sediment load he et al 2021 wang et al 2013 stable isotopic studies Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h of large rivers like the mississippi river or danube river are not comparable to the yangtze river studies the systematic isotope studies conducted in the yrb factored in the effects of the various landscape and associated riverscapes which resulted in cyclic alterations unique to the yrb environment overall this study provides long term and high resolution data of Œ¥2h and Œ¥18o activity in yangtze river water which makes it a systematic complement to the isotopic database worthy of future research 5 conclusions this study presents the dual effects of damming and drought on yangtze river water cycle dynamics using isoscapes Œ¥18o and Œ¥2h from river and lake water along the yangtze river during the 2016 and 2018 flooding seasons we compared these results with the historical isotopic data from 2003 to 2013 spatially river water Œ¥18o values exhibited a positive trend from upstream to the lower reaches because of the contrasting recharged sources complex mixing and evaporation from upstream to the lower reaches of the yangtze river large volumes of meltwater from glacier and permafrost replenished the upstream yangtze during the flooding seasons resulting in abnormally depleted river water Œ¥18o in the upstream regions the river water Œ¥18o in the tgr regions exhibited a positive trend from cq to tgd with a relatively homogenous fluctuation because of its strong mixture and evaporation by contrast river water in the mid lower reaches was more enriched in heavy isotopes because of strong evaporation under high temperature conditions and replenishment from shallow lakes with isotopic enrichment moreover the higher longitudinal variability and cv of river water d excess revealed that tgd regulation largely altered the yangtze river water cycles especially in the tgr and middle reaches under different operation models river water d excess and Œ¥18o values became more homogeneous in the tgr because of longer residence time and a more robust mixing process which led to relatively lower variability in the downstream isotopic signatures during the normal operation stage after 2010 i e 2013 and 2018 this study demonstrates that the d excess and Œ¥18o can be used to explore river water cycle dynamics induced by both natural environmental variability and anthropogenic activities the cumulative cascade of damming effects on the altered water cycle needs more research in light of increasing crisis level problems based on climate and anthropogenic trends that affect water quality river ecosystems and fish biodiversity credit
