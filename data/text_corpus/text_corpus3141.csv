15705,stormwater treatment systems remove and accumulate microplastics from surface runoff but some of them can be moved downward to groundwater by natural freeze thaw cycles yet it is unclear whether or how microplastic properties such as density could affect the extent to which freeze thaw cycles would move microplastics in the subsurface to examine the transport and redistribution of microplastics in the subsurface by freeze thaw cycles three types of microplastics with density smaller than polypropylene or pp similar to polystyrene or ps or greater than polyethylene terephthalate or pet water were first deposited on the top of packed sand the most common filter media used in infiltration based stormwater treatment systems then the columns were subjected to either 23 h of drying at 22 ⁰c control or freeze thaw treatment freezing at 20 ⁰c for 6 h and thawing at 22 ⁰c for 17 h followed by a wetting event the cycle was repeated 36 times and the effluents were analyzed for microplastics microplastics were observed in effluents from the columns that were contaminated with pet and subjected to freeze thaw cycles comparison of the distribution of microplastics in sand columns at the end of 36 cycles confirmed that freeze thaw cycles could disproportionally accelerate the downward mobility of denser microplastics using a force balance model we show that smaller microplastics 50 µm can be pushed at higher velocity by the ice water interface irrespective of the density of microplastics however plastic density becomes critical when the size of microplastics is larger than 50 µm the coupled experimental studies and theoretical framework improved the understanding of why denser microplastics such as pet and pvc may move deeper into the subsurface in the stormwater treatment systems and consequently elevate groundwater pollution risk graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stormwater weathering plastic pollution freezeing sand biofilters subsurface transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial soil surface and subsurface are major sinks of microplastics in the environment li et al 2021 nizzetto et al 2016 scheurer and bigalke 2018 from where they can either move deeper into the ground viaroli et al 2022 or be transported away by wind bullard et al 2021 rezaei et al 2019 or stormwater piñon colin et al 2020 werbowski et al 2021 in particular stormwater treatment systems remove most microplastics from the surface runoff gilbreath et al 2019 lange et al 2021 smyth et al 2021 which is a major conveyor of microplastics in the terrestrial environment boni et al 2021 lutz et al 2021 werbowski et al 2021 these accumulated microplastics could have several health and environmental impacts li et al 2022 prata et al 2020 for instance airborne microplastics could pose inhalation health risks prata 2018 due to their suspension via wind in agricultural land borthakur et al 2021a where contaminated biosolids have been applied crossman et al 2020 koutnik et al 2021a microplastics retained in the subsurface could affect root systems in stormwater and agricultural systems chen et al 2022 huang et al 2021 khalid et al 2020 nano and microplastics could carry some of the pollutants into groundwater aquifers if their mobility in the subsurface is not retarded samandra et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 thus it is critical to understand the processes that affect the mobility of microplastics in subsurface soil including stormwater treatment systems accumulated microplastics in stormwater treatment systems could disintegrate into smaller particles by photochemical or biological processes sørensen et al 2021 zumstein et al 2018 and move downward during intermittent infiltration of stormwater gao et al 2021 koutnik et al 2022a mohanty et al 2015 o connor et al 2019 subsurface soil naturally experiences dry wet and freeze thaw cycles which could increase the transport of the deposited microplastics dong et al 2022 gao et al 2021 koutnik et al 2022a o connor et al 2019 compared to numerous studies that have examined the mechanism of particle transport by dry wet cycles borthakur et al 2021b gu et al 2018 mohanty et al 2015 o connor et al 2019 seiphoori et al 2020 fewer studies have examined the mechanism of particle transport by freeze thaw cycles alimi et al 2021 koutnik et al 2022a mohanty et al 2014 freeze thaw cycles could either increase microplastic mobility by disrupting the deposited microplastics during the expansion of the ice crystals mohanty et al 2014 or decrease the mobility by increasing their aggregation alimi et al 2021 both aggregation and transport in pore water or porous media depend on particle properties such as density size and surface properties bennacer et al 2013 bradford et al 2003 2002 zhang et al 2014 yet none of the previous studies on microplastics examined whether and how the properties of microplastics could determine the extent to which their mobility is affected by the oscillating the ice water interfaces during freeze thaw cycles many studies have examined the dynamics of colloids near the freezing interfaces asthana and tewari 1993 azouni et al 1997 hattori et al 2020 körber et al 1985 lin et al 2020 rempel and worster 2001 1999 saint michel et al 2017 shangguan et al 1992 tyagi et al 2020 and they can help explain the behavior of microplastics in the subsurface soil subjected to freeze thaw cycles during freeze thaw cycles colloids in pore water could experience three types of forces gravitational force owing to particle size and density buoyancy owing to the density of the water displaced by the submerged particle and the interfacial force exerted by moving ice water interfaces when the interface comes close to within few nanometer distances of the colloid azouni et al 1997 spannuth et al 2011 tyagi et al 2020 the interfacial force can be sensitive to colloid surface properties körber et al 1985 shangguan et al 1992 thompson and wettlaufer 1999 the resulting force balance determines the velocity of colloids near ice font at a close distance few nm between the particle and ice front the drag force also changes due to the movement of water molecules from bulk to the interface where the curvature of the ice surface near the particle could change based on the thermal conductivity of the particle rempel and worster 2001 as microplastics are insulators they thermally shields the local interface underneath the particle creating a cooler spot where the ice interface grows faster to create a convex protuberance that could prevent the engulfment of microplastics asthana and tewari 1993 thus convex protuberance could push microplastics and accelerate their mobility in the subsurface consequently the transport of microplastics by these forces could depend on the density thermal and surface properties of microplastics yet no study to date has examined the effect of microplastic density on their mobility in porous media under freeze thaw cycles the research objectives of the study are 1 to examine the effect of the density of microplastics on their mobility in the subsurface filter media subjected to freeze thaw cycles and 2 theoretically estimate the change in velocity of microplastics as a function of their size and density near moving ice water interfaces in still water which is typically the case during freezing conditions in the subsurface soil we hypothesize that freeze thaw cycles will disproportionately move denser microplastics downward the rationale behind the hypothesis is that the specific gravity of microplastics could determine whether a plastic particle would sink or float in pore water and the formation of ice could separate the gap between them by pushing the microplastics up or downward based on the relative position of microplastics with respect to ice crystal growth to test the hypothesis we quantified the mobility of microplastics with different densities in water columns with and without porous media during freeze thaw cycles and compared the difference in the depth distribution of microplastics as a function of their density following many freeze thaw cycles the results could help predict the fate of microplastics in subsurface or stormwater biofilters subjected to freeze thaw cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics preparation and characterization we selected three plastic polymers based on their densities lower than polypropylene or pp ρ p p 920 k g m 3 similar to polystyrene or ps ρ p s 1 015 k g m 3 and greater than polyethylene terephthalate or pet ρ p e t 1 350 k g m 3 the density of water ρ w 1 000 k g m 3 at 12 c koutnik et al 2021b these three plastic types are commonly used in single use plastic products and have been extensively found in natural environments and in stormwater koutnik et al 2021b to create irregular shaped microplastics plastic objects made from one of the three types of polymers were abraded using a mechanical orbital sander figure s1 following the method described elsewhere koutnik et al 2022a sanding created irregularly shaped microplastic particles such as fragments and fibers similar to what has been found in stormwater piñon colin et al 2020 microplastics were characterized for their size distribution shape and for polymer types using thermo scientific nicolet in10 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in the reflectance mode using the particle analysis wizard included in the picta software details in supplementary materials brahney et al 2020 ftir microscope can identify the size distribution of microplastics larger than 20 µm in diameter based on the image analysis of particles spread on a 1 cm2 area of a slide to analyze the size distribution of microplastics at a wider size range 0 1 µm to 2 mm we used a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls 13320 beckman coulter inc ca usa where dry microplastics were dispersed by the tornado dry powder system in the chamber before analyzing the diffracted laser beams from microplastics the grinding of plastic objects resulted in particles with a range of shapes and sizes ftir analysis confirmed that more than 97 of the particles analyzed matched the plastic polymer designated in the plastic object figure s2 the shape of the microplastics varied widely from fiber aspect ratio 3 to fragment shape figure s2 between 11 20 of the particles created were fibers figure s3 the size distribution of the plastic mixtures varied by plastic polymer types figure s2 54 of the ps microplastics were sized between 100 250 μm whereas a similar majority for pet and pp were sized between 50 100 μm a laser diffraction analyzer recorded a slightly different size distribution than that observed using an ftir microscope figure s4 2 2 sand filter design sand is the most common media used in infiltration based stormwater treatment systems in order to increase the infiltration of surface runoff tirpak et al 2021 thus we used quartz sand with sizes between 600 800 μm 20 30 standard sand certified mtp packed in transparent pvc columns 2 54 cm in diameter and 30 cm in height to create model biofilters similar to a previous study koutnik et al 2022a briefly sand was packed in 2 3 cm increment layers to a total filter media height of 15 cm above the bottom drainage layer which consisted of glass wool spread on pea gravel at the bottom the columns were saturated with deionized di water from the bottom and the pore volume was estimated based on the weight difference between saturated and dry columns a total of 20 columns were packed to compare the mobility of 3 types of microplastics by either dry wet control or freeze thaw treatment triplicate columns were used per one type of microplastics per treatment 2 3 distribution of microplastics in the water column without porous media during freezing to simulate the redistribution of suspended microplastics in pore water without being constricted by porous media we freeze microplastic suspension in a column without porous media microplastic suspensions were prepared by mixing a specific amount of each of the three microplastics in 100 ml of di water in a 1l pre cleaned glass bottle the suspension was poured into pre washed transparent pvc columns which were placed in a freezer at 15 ⁰c at an up right position overnight for 18 h the frozen columns were placed in a warm water bath for 1 2 min to melt ice near the wall and loosen the ice core the ice core was laid on an aluminum foil and sliced into segments of 3 cm in length with a heated iron knife each segment was melted in a clean glass bottle and weighed before filtering the water samples through a 24 mm g4 glass fiber filter paper with 1 2 μm pore size thermofisher scientific 09 804 24c to isolate microplastics in each ice core segment 2 4 transport of microplastics in saturated sand columns by freeze thaw cycles the transport experiments were conducted following the method outlined elsewhere koutnik et al 2022a briefly packed sand columns were conditioned to remove any colloids or particulates by injecting 4 pore volumes pv or 100 ml of synthetic stormwater at 5 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump we used synthetic stormwater 6 mm nacl with a similar ph adjusted and ionic strength as a natural stormwater collected from ballona creek los angeles usa ghavanloughajar et al 2020 the use of synthetic stormwater prevented cross contamination with microplastics and particles typically present in natural stormwater the effluent samples for each column were collected and analyzed for background microplastic concentration ranging from 0 01 p ml 1 to 0 18 p ml 1 to simulate microplastic accumulation on biofilters for many years koutnik et al 2022a 0 1 g of each polymer type of microplastics was deposited on the top of 6 columns of which 3 columns were subjected to drying treatment control and the other 3 columns were subjected to freeze thaw treatment during natural freezing in subsurface pore water freezes and water does not typically flow through pores as precipitation occurs via snowfall during the thawing process snow melts create runoff which could pass through the subsurface mobilizing any deposited colloids or microplastics to simulate microplastic transport during freeze thaw cycles in nature the columns were subjected to freeze thaw cycles followed by infiltration events as described elsewhere mohanty et al 2014 briefly the contaminated columns were subjected to 23 h of either drying or freeze thaw treatment followed by a 20 min injection of 4 pv of synthetic stormwater at 5 ml min 1 or 0 96 cm min 1 which was below the hydraulic conductivity of the packed sand to simulate freeze thaw treatment columns were frozen at 20 ⁰c for 6 h and thawed at 22 ⁰c for 17 h to simulate drying treatment the columns were drained by gravity and dried at 22 ⁰c for 23 h the cycles drying followed by wetting or freeze thaw followed by wetting were repeated 36 times and the effluents were analyzed for microplastic concentrations after 1 8 15 22 26 31 and 36 cycles to estimate potential breakthroughs in deposited microplastics to account for any microplastics that were already present in the sand before the contamination stage uncontaminated sand columns were subjected to dry wet or freeze thaw cycle treatments and effluents were analyzed for microplastics in the end all columns were dismantled to sample sand from different depths from specific depths 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 8 12 cm starting from the bottom most depth near effluent as straining was found to be a dominant removal process of large microplastics in the stormwater biofilters koutnik et al 2022b the depth distribution was fitted to an empirical equation eq 1 1 c z c 0 e k z where c z and c 0 are microplastic concentrations p g 1 at depth z cm and on the surface respectively and k is the retardation coefficient thus k is estimated by the fitting depth and concentration data into the model and includes effects of absorption straining gravity settling and removal by any other mechanism 2 5 analysis of effluent and filter media samples to isolate microplastics from effluent water samples were vacuum filtered through 24 mm glass fiber filter membranes with 1 2 µm pore size thermo fisher scientific and the filtered microplastics were stained by adding 0 17 ml of 0 5 µg ml 1 nile red in chloroform solution on filters inside a glass petri dish koutnik et al 2022b filters were air dried with a glass cover and imaged using a smartphone based fluorescence microscope the details of the method is described elsewhere leonard et al 2022 which has been used in multiple studies with environmental and laboratory samples koutnik et al 2022a 2022b the method permits the counting of microplastics that can adsorb nile red dyes and does not differentiate between different types of plastic polymers to estimate the concentration of microplastics retained at different depths of the sand filters 1 g of oven dried sand sample was mixed in 40 ml of 1 6 g ml 1 ki solution in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to settle sand particles leaving the lighter density 1 6 g cm 3 particles including microplastics to float on the supernatant surface mu et al 2019 the supernatant was filtered to isolate plastics stained using nile red and analyzed for microplastic concentration as described earlier the concentrations were reported as the number per l of effluent or g of filter media to analyze the difference and similarity between the measured concentrations between contaminated plastic or treatment types we performed a wilcoxon rank sum test r version 4 0 0 2 6 quality assurance and quality control all lab surfaces were wiped down every day and before and after usage samples were collected stored and processed using pre washed laboratory glassware all glassware and containers were washed with soap and water and then rinsed with di water three times to remove any background microplastics glass covers or clean aluminum foil were used to prevent airborne contamination during the sample processing uncontaminated filter media was analyzed from each column depth for any background concentration of microplastics which was subtracted from the concentration of microplastics at the same depth in contaminated columns to estimate the true penetration depth of added microplastics the di water used in this study was analyzed for possible microplastic contamination the contributions of microplastics from plastic tubing for pumping pvc plastic columns centrifuge polypropylene test tubes and plastic pipette tips were estimated using appropriate blanks during every day of analysis a method blank was run following the same lab procedure the mean of laboratory blanks for each method was subtracted from the measured concentration of samples to account for any microplastics introduced from procedural steps 3 results 3 1 distribution of microplastics in frozen water columns without porous media the redistribution of microplastics in pore water during freeze thaw cycles could depend on the force exerted by the moving ice water interface and physical constraints from the surface porous media near the pore water analysis of the distribution of microplastics in frozen water columns without sand media revealed that microplastic distribution in pore water with the constraint of porous media varied with microplastic density fig 1 more than 60 of pp microplastics were found at the surface with their concentration decreasing with depth in contrast pet concentration was higher at lower depths about 20 of pet particles were found at the surface despite being expected to sink due to their greater density than water 3 2 distribution of microplastics in sand columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles depth distribution of microplastics in columns packed with sand showed that freeze thaw cycles increased the penetration depth of microplastics compared to dry wet cycles fig 2 irrespective of treatment methods the downward mobility was more pronounced for denser microplastics such as pet the distribution was sensitive to the density of microplastics for all the columns subjected to dry wet cycles the microplastic concentration near the outlet was similar to the background concentration 0 7 p g 1 irrespective of microplastic density in contrast for the columns subjected to freeze thaw treatments microplastic concentration near the outlet was similar to background concentration only for columns contaminated with two types of plastics pp and ps regardless of the weathering pet microplastics moved deeper into columns than the pp and ps particles fitting the distribution of microplastics with the exponential model equation 1 koutnik et al 2022b 2022a we showed that retardation of microplastics in sand biofilters varied with microplastic density irrespective of treatment types but the density had a more pronounced effect on microplastic retardation under freeze thaw cycles than that under dry wet cycles fig 2 specifically the retardation coefficient which is estimated based on the slope of the graphs in figure 2c d ranges from 1 1 to 5 5 with the highest slope corresponding to pet in columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles 3 3 the concentration of microplastics in the effluent analysis of microplastic concentration in the effluent from all columns revealed that transport of pp and ps microplastics was negligible and statistically insignificant irrespective of the treatment types fig 3 the 15 cm deep sand media was sufficient to prevent the transport of pp and ps microplastics out of the columns via effluent in contrast pet microplastics were found in higher concentrations than the background concentration from uncontaminated or blank columns the background concentrations were 0 023 p ml 1 and 0 075 p ml 1 for blank columns with dry wet and freeze thaw cycles respectively the higher effluent concentration of pet microplastics in contaminated columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles further confirmed the finding that pet microplastics were disproportionately moved by freeze thaw cycles 4 discussion 4 1 retention of microplastics in sand columns all deposited microplastics with the exception of pet microplastics in columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles were retained in sand columns among the three types of microplastics used pet is heavier than water freeze thaw treatment decreased the retention of pet microplastics and enhanced their mobility more than that of pp and ps microplastics the results indicate that in most conditions microplastics with densities lighter than water can be effectively retained in the subsurface the results are similar to previous studies that showed the removal of microplastics in sand columns gao et al 2021 koutnik et al 2022a o connor et al 2019 rong et al 2022 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2020 most microplastics were removed in sand columns due to the physical straining koutnik et al 2022b 2022a which is sensitive to the size of microplastics and pore size of the media bradford et al 2003 straining occurs when larger particles are blocked by the narrow pores auset and keller 2006 ps particles used in this study were larger than pe or pet particles figure s2 therefore ps microplastics are expected to be removed by sand by straining to a greater extent than the other two types of microplastics larger microplastics blocked at narrow pore throats between sand grains could not move further irrespective of dry wet or freeze thaw cycles this partially explained why ps microplastics were retained to a greater extent than the other two types of microplastics irrespective of weathering treatments among plastic types pet microplastics were found in greater concentration than the background level in the effluents of columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles fig 3 the depth distribution data fig 2 also confirmed the enhanced mobility of pet microplastics by freeze thaw cycles the result indicates that the density of microplastics plays a critical role in the remobilization of microplastics by freeze thaw cycles compared to dry wet cycles previous studies mohanty et al 2015 2014 have compared the remobilization colloids by dry wet and freeze thaw cycles but they did not vary the density of colloids chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 examined the role of gravity on the transport of colloids in sand columns by comparing the transport of bacteria specific gravity similar to pet 1 4 and natural clay colloids specific gravity 2 6 and observed that an increase in specific gravity of colloids increased in colloid transport velocity in vertical sand columns collectively the results confirmed that denser colloids are more susceptible to transport than lighter colloids 4 2 enhanced transport of microplastics by freeze thaw cycles compared to dry wet cycles for the same microplastic type freeze thaw cycles transported more microplastics to the deeper layers than dry wet cycles did within the columns fig 2 although the same amount of microplastics was added to all columns the concentration of microplastics in the top layer of columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles was slightly higher than the concentration in the top layer of columns subjected to dry wet cycles in contrast the concentration in deeper layers was disproportionately greater in columns with freeze thaw cycles than in columns with dry wet cycles this result agreed with a previous study that compared the transport of pp microplastics in sand and soil columns under dry wet or freeze thaw cycles koutnik et al 2022a our study provides additional evidence that the effect of the density of microplastics on the transport of microplastics during freeze thaw cycles in particular the effect of freeze thaw cycles is more pronounced for denser microplastics we attributed the results to fundamental differences in processes by which dry wet or freeze thaw cycles could mobilize deposited microplastics in porous media advancing or receding wetting fronts during dry wet cycles typically disrupt solid water and air water interfaces where colloids were typically deposited denovio et al 2004 thus the shear force of the rapidly moving air water interfaces could scour microplastics or colloids from their deposited locations and mobilize them into pore water flury and aramrak 2017 shang et al 2008 the interaction of air water interfaces on colloids depends on the hydrophobicity of colloids keller and auset 2007 thus hydrophobicity of microplastics may play a greater role than density in the remobilization of microplastics by dry wet cycles in contrast to dry wet cycles freeze thaw cycles involve the transition of the water phase to ice during freezing deposited microplastics can either be pushed or engulfed by the ice front based on the free energy change to replace particle liquid pl and liquid solid lp interfaces with a solid particle sp interface asthana and tewari 1993 shangguan et al 1992 ice front engulfs the particle if the free energy change is negative as all plastics are insulators which block the heat energy from water to ice near the interface the ice formation could accelerate near the microplastics creating a convex shaped interface that would be more likely to push microplastics along the direction of ice interface propagation asthana and tewari 1993 a moving ice front can be more disruptive than rewetting of the pore by liquid water because expanding ice during freezing can exert more pressures than capillary pressures on pore walls during drying koutnik et al 2022a mohanty et al 2014 the ice crystals can also fracture or expand the pore walls thereby creating flow paths conducive to the transport of large colloids borthakur et al 2021b 4 3 mechanisms of microplastic transport by freeze thaw cycles our results confirmed that the extent to which freeze thaw cycles could accelerate the downward mobility of microplastics is dependent on the density of microplastics however the microplastics used in our study are 50 µm and the detection method used in our study could not reliably detect microplastics 10 µm to understand the effect of density on the mobility of microplastics within all size ranges 0 1 µm to 1000 µm we estimated the velocity of suspended plastic particles with a spherical shape at far and close within a few nm distances from the moving ice interface using a force balance approach shangguan et al 1992 the model does not account for the effect of shape which is expected to affect the drag force furthermore the model does not account for the interception of microplastics in porous media when pushed by ice and assumed all microplastics were initially present in one location before being separated by different forces described as follows consequently the model could not directly validate the experimental data nevertheless the simplistic model illustrates the importance of microplastic density on their transport in pore water the velocity of a plastic particle v p far from the moving ice water interface as shown in equation 2 can be derived by force balance where the gravitational force based on the density difference between particle and water f g 4 3 π r p 3 δ ρ g acts against the drag force f d 6 π μ r p v p here δ ρ is the difference in the density of the particle ρ p and water ρ l μ is the viscosity of water g is the acceleration due to gravity and r p is the radius of the particle 2 v p 2 9 r p 2 δ ρ g μ 1 the particle moves at constant flotation velocity in a direction based on the sign of δ ρ fig 4 c thus most pp microplastics are expected to float and stay near the surface of the water column whereas most pet microplastics are expected to settle at the bottom of columns after sufficient time has passed our results fig 1 confirmed the overall trend more than 60 pp microplastics and less than 15 pet microplastics moved to the top of the water column after freeze thaw cycles as the initial position of microplastics in a well mixed suspension and the time taken to freeze the water column was unknown stoke s law could not be used to predict the occurrence of the microplastics present at different depths the force balance on the suspended microplastics would change at close proximity within a few nanometers to the ice water interface where molecular interactions become relevant if the particle is denser than water the interaction between the particle and ice interface would occur only if the velocity of the ice water interface v s is greater than the settling velocity v p fig 4 a at a distance of the order of the atomic spacing the particle would experience an interfacial molecular force f i or the van der waals force or the force due to a change in the interfacial energy in this case the standard stokes equation for the drag force is no longer valid as the flow of liquid is perturbed by the ice front at this close proximity the particle experiences a drag force or cryosuction force f μ because water moves from the suspension towards the interface to support ice growth thereby attracting the particle towards the interface fig 4 a at equilibrium the net force on the particle would be zero f g f i f μ 0 as shown in equation 3 3 4 3 π r p 3 δ ρ g 2 π r p δ σ 0 a 0 a 0 d n α 6 π μ v p r p 2 d α 2 0 where a 0 is the sum of the radii of atoms in the surface layers of the particle and the solid d is the gap between particle and ice water interface and δ σ 0 σ s p σ l p σ s l is the net free energy changes for the particle to be engulfed by ice which occurs when free energy between the ice and particle σ s p exceeds the free energy between water and particle σ l p and ice and water σ s l α is a function of the curvature of the ice water interface near the particle which is the ratio of the radius of curvature of the ice water interface r i and the difference between the radius of interface curvature and particle radius r i r p as the curvature is created by the melting of ice due to a difference in thermal conductivity of water and plastic particle α can be calculated as the ratio of thermal conductivity of particle k p and water k l as the thermal conductivity of microplastics is smaller than water a convex shape ice hump would form near the interface between the particle and ice which can push microplastics further solving equation 4 the velocity of the particle near the ice water interface would become 4 v p d 3 μ α δ σ 0 r p a 0 a 0 d n 2 r p ρ p ρ l g 3 α estimating the velocity of plastic particles with a radius between 0 1 to 1000 μ m near the ice water interface we show that the velocity is sensitive to plastic density if the size of microplastic is bigger than 10 µm fig 4 b the contribution of interfacial force on microplastic mobility was prominent when the particle size was smaller than 10 µm however our method is inadequate to detect microplastics within these size ranges thus the velocity of smaller microplastics 10 µm is expected to increase dramatically with a decrease in size due to push from the ice interface irrespective of the density of microplastics in contrast the velocity of larger microplastics such as the ones used in this study would be much small near the ice water interface and the velocity would be affected by the density of microplastics the theoretical prediction that pet velocity would be much higher than pp and ps near the ice interface is confirmed by our experimental data where pet microplastics were relocated deeper into the water columns fig 1 followed by ps and pet most pp particles were expected to float on the surface so they were not affected by ice propagation from top to bottom of the columns 4 4 environmental implications the results of this study provide the first quantitative and experimental evidence showing accelerated transport of microplastics by freeze thaw cycles as a function of the particle density the theoretical framework provided here can be applied across all plastic polymers with other densities understanding the effects of freeze thaw cycles is critical due to the prevalence of these seasonal weather patterns across all of northern america and europe furthermore these results are useful to predict microplastic movement in freshwater lakes or ponds that undergo freezing during winter as freezing cycles and conditions are expected to vary during climate changes the results can later be used to understand a change in microplastic distribution in the subsurface under different climates predicted climate change scenarios suggest an increase in the frequency and severity of soil freeze thaw cycles in many northern temperate regions of the world henry 2008 with implications for the subsurface transport rates of different emerging contaminants including microplastics the results can also help predict microplastic distribution in the soil in the agricultural fields and urban areas and the potential transport pathways to the groundwater henry 2008 pauli et al 2013 although sand was used in this study to demonstrate the impact of freezing and density the trend is expected to be similar in soils as shown in a previous study koutnik et al 2022a however the effect of density or freeze thaw cycles can be less apparent if most microplastics are removed by straining in narrow flow paths in soil thus soil pore size distribution should be taken into account to accurately determine the effect of microplastic density on their mobility in soil subjected to freeze thaw cycles nevertheless understanding how far some microplastics would move near the root zone can help predict their impact on root function or crop productivity boots et al 2019 de souza machado et al 2019 plants growing in microplastic contaminated soils are predicted to have decreased nutrient contents and increased toxicity as nano plastics can be uptaken by plant roots and soil microbiota li et al 2020 seeley et al 2020 sun et al 2021 downward migration also has the potential for groundwater contamination which serves as a source of fresh water for at least two billion people worldwide panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 viaroli et al 2022 recent anecdotal evidence showed a greater abundance of denser plastics such as pet and pvc in the groundwater samples but the cause of such abundance was unknown samandra et al 2022 our study provided a theoretical basis to predict the increased abundance of denser microplastics in deeper subsurface soil or groundwater aquifers 5 conclusions based on the experimental evidence and theoretical framework we proved that the density of microplastics could play a critical role in the transport of microplastics in subsurface soil or other porous media in stormwater treatment systems subjected to natural freeze thaw cycles most microplastics were retained in sand columns potentially by physical straining if their particle size is larger than the pore size based on the force balance calculation on microplastics near the downward moving ice water interface smaller microplastics 50 µm could be pushed at higher velocity by the ice water interface irrespective of the density of microplastics however density becomes critical when the size of microplastics becomes larger than 50 µm for these large microplastics pet moved deeper into the sand layer compared to low density microplastics such as pp and ps these results suggest that among all accumulated

15705,stormwater treatment systems remove and accumulate microplastics from surface runoff but some of them can be moved downward to groundwater by natural freeze thaw cycles yet it is unclear whether or how microplastic properties such as density could affect the extent to which freeze thaw cycles would move microplastics in the subsurface to examine the transport and redistribution of microplastics in the subsurface by freeze thaw cycles three types of microplastics with density smaller than polypropylene or pp similar to polystyrene or ps or greater than polyethylene terephthalate or pet water were first deposited on the top of packed sand the most common filter media used in infiltration based stormwater treatment systems then the columns were subjected to either 23 h of drying at 22 ⁰c control or freeze thaw treatment freezing at 20 ⁰c for 6 h and thawing at 22 ⁰c for 17 h followed by a wetting event the cycle was repeated 36 times and the effluents were analyzed for microplastics microplastics were observed in effluents from the columns that were contaminated with pet and subjected to freeze thaw cycles comparison of the distribution of microplastics in sand columns at the end of 36 cycles confirmed that freeze thaw cycles could disproportionally accelerate the downward mobility of denser microplastics using a force balance model we show that smaller microplastics 50 µm can be pushed at higher velocity by the ice water interface irrespective of the density of microplastics however plastic density becomes critical when the size of microplastics is larger than 50 µm the coupled experimental studies and theoretical framework improved the understanding of why denser microplastics such as pet and pvc may move deeper into the subsurface in the stormwater treatment systems and consequently elevate groundwater pollution risk graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stormwater weathering plastic pollution freezeing sand biofilters subsurface transport data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction terrestrial soil surface and subsurface are major sinks of microplastics in the environment li et al 2021 nizzetto et al 2016 scheurer and bigalke 2018 from where they can either move deeper into the ground viaroli et al 2022 or be transported away by wind bullard et al 2021 rezaei et al 2019 or stormwater piñon colin et al 2020 werbowski et al 2021 in particular stormwater treatment systems remove most microplastics from the surface runoff gilbreath et al 2019 lange et al 2021 smyth et al 2021 which is a major conveyor of microplastics in the terrestrial environment boni et al 2021 lutz et al 2021 werbowski et al 2021 these accumulated microplastics could have several health and environmental impacts li et al 2022 prata et al 2020 for instance airborne microplastics could pose inhalation health risks prata 2018 due to their suspension via wind in agricultural land borthakur et al 2021a where contaminated biosolids have been applied crossman et al 2020 koutnik et al 2021a microplastics retained in the subsurface could affect root systems in stormwater and agricultural systems chen et al 2022 huang et al 2021 khalid et al 2020 nano and microplastics could carry some of the pollutants into groundwater aquifers if their mobility in the subsurface is not retarded samandra et al 2022 zhou et al 2022 thus it is critical to understand the processes that affect the mobility of microplastics in subsurface soil including stormwater treatment systems accumulated microplastics in stormwater treatment systems could disintegrate into smaller particles by photochemical or biological processes sørensen et al 2021 zumstein et al 2018 and move downward during intermittent infiltration of stormwater gao et al 2021 koutnik et al 2022a mohanty et al 2015 o connor et al 2019 subsurface soil naturally experiences dry wet and freeze thaw cycles which could increase the transport of the deposited microplastics dong et al 2022 gao et al 2021 koutnik et al 2022a o connor et al 2019 compared to numerous studies that have examined the mechanism of particle transport by dry wet cycles borthakur et al 2021b gu et al 2018 mohanty et al 2015 o connor et al 2019 seiphoori et al 2020 fewer studies have examined the mechanism of particle transport by freeze thaw cycles alimi et al 2021 koutnik et al 2022a mohanty et al 2014 freeze thaw cycles could either increase microplastic mobility by disrupting the deposited microplastics during the expansion of the ice crystals mohanty et al 2014 or decrease the mobility by increasing their aggregation alimi et al 2021 both aggregation and transport in pore water or porous media depend on particle properties such as density size and surface properties bennacer et al 2013 bradford et al 2003 2002 zhang et al 2014 yet none of the previous studies on microplastics examined whether and how the properties of microplastics could determine the extent to which their mobility is affected by the oscillating the ice water interfaces during freeze thaw cycles many studies have examined the dynamics of colloids near the freezing interfaces asthana and tewari 1993 azouni et al 1997 hattori et al 2020 körber et al 1985 lin et al 2020 rempel and worster 2001 1999 saint michel et al 2017 shangguan et al 1992 tyagi et al 2020 and they can help explain the behavior of microplastics in the subsurface soil subjected to freeze thaw cycles during freeze thaw cycles colloids in pore water could experience three types of forces gravitational force owing to particle size and density buoyancy owing to the density of the water displaced by the submerged particle and the interfacial force exerted by moving ice water interfaces when the interface comes close to within few nanometer distances of the colloid azouni et al 1997 spannuth et al 2011 tyagi et al 2020 the interfacial force can be sensitive to colloid surface properties körber et al 1985 shangguan et al 1992 thompson and wettlaufer 1999 the resulting force balance determines the velocity of colloids near ice font at a close distance few nm between the particle and ice front the drag force also changes due to the movement of water molecules from bulk to the interface where the curvature of the ice surface near the particle could change based on the thermal conductivity of the particle rempel and worster 2001 as microplastics are insulators they thermally shields the local interface underneath the particle creating a cooler spot where the ice interface grows faster to create a convex protuberance that could prevent the engulfment of microplastics asthana and tewari 1993 thus convex protuberance could push microplastics and accelerate their mobility in the subsurface consequently the transport of microplastics by these forces could depend on the density thermal and surface properties of microplastics yet no study to date has examined the effect of microplastic density on their mobility in porous media under freeze thaw cycles the research objectives of the study are 1 to examine the effect of the density of microplastics on their mobility in the subsurface filter media subjected to freeze thaw cycles and 2 theoretically estimate the change in velocity of microplastics as a function of their size and density near moving ice water interfaces in still water which is typically the case during freezing conditions in the subsurface soil we hypothesize that freeze thaw cycles will disproportionately move denser microplastics downward the rationale behind the hypothesis is that the specific gravity of microplastics could determine whether a plastic particle would sink or float in pore water and the formation of ice could separate the gap between them by pushing the microplastics up or downward based on the relative position of microplastics with respect to ice crystal growth to test the hypothesis we quantified the mobility of microplastics with different densities in water columns with and without porous media during freeze thaw cycles and compared the difference in the depth distribution of microplastics as a function of their density following many freeze thaw cycles the results could help predict the fate of microplastics in subsurface or stormwater biofilters subjected to freeze thaw cycles 2 materials and methods 2 1 microplastics preparation and characterization we selected three plastic polymers based on their densities lower than polypropylene or pp ρ p p 920 k g m 3 similar to polystyrene or ps ρ p s 1 015 k g m 3 and greater than polyethylene terephthalate or pet ρ p e t 1 350 k g m 3 the density of water ρ w 1 000 k g m 3 at 12 c koutnik et al 2021b these three plastic types are commonly used in single use plastic products and have been extensively found in natural environments and in stormwater koutnik et al 2021b to create irregular shaped microplastics plastic objects made from one of the three types of polymers were abraded using a mechanical orbital sander figure s1 following the method described elsewhere koutnik et al 2022a sanding created irregularly shaped microplastic particles such as fragments and fibers similar to what has been found in stormwater piñon colin et al 2020 microplastics were characterized for their size distribution shape and for polymer types using thermo scientific nicolet in10 fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir in the reflectance mode using the particle analysis wizard included in the picta software details in supplementary materials brahney et al 2020 ftir microscope can identify the size distribution of microplastics larger than 20 µm in diameter based on the image analysis of particles spread on a 1 cm2 area of a slide to analyze the size distribution of microplastics at a wider size range 0 1 µm to 2 mm we used a laser diffraction particle size analyzer ls 13320 beckman coulter inc ca usa where dry microplastics were dispersed by the tornado dry powder system in the chamber before analyzing the diffracted laser beams from microplastics the grinding of plastic objects resulted in particles with a range of shapes and sizes ftir analysis confirmed that more than 97 of the particles analyzed matched the plastic polymer designated in the plastic object figure s2 the shape of the microplastics varied widely from fiber aspect ratio 3 to fragment shape figure s2 between 11 20 of the particles created were fibers figure s3 the size distribution of the plastic mixtures varied by plastic polymer types figure s2 54 of the ps microplastics were sized between 100 250 μm whereas a similar majority for pet and pp were sized between 50 100 μm a laser diffraction analyzer recorded a slightly different size distribution than that observed using an ftir microscope figure s4 2 2 sand filter design sand is the most common media used in infiltration based stormwater treatment systems in order to increase the infiltration of surface runoff tirpak et al 2021 thus we used quartz sand with sizes between 600 800 μm 20 30 standard sand certified mtp packed in transparent pvc columns 2 54 cm in diameter and 30 cm in height to create model biofilters similar to a previous study koutnik et al 2022a briefly sand was packed in 2 3 cm increment layers to a total filter media height of 15 cm above the bottom drainage layer which consisted of glass wool spread on pea gravel at the bottom the columns were saturated with deionized di water from the bottom and the pore volume was estimated based on the weight difference between saturated and dry columns a total of 20 columns were packed to compare the mobility of 3 types of microplastics by either dry wet control or freeze thaw treatment triplicate columns were used per one type of microplastics per treatment 2 3 distribution of microplastics in the water column without porous media during freezing to simulate the redistribution of suspended microplastics in pore water without being constricted by porous media we freeze microplastic suspension in a column without porous media microplastic suspensions were prepared by mixing a specific amount of each of the three microplastics in 100 ml of di water in a 1l pre cleaned glass bottle the suspension was poured into pre washed transparent pvc columns which were placed in a freezer at 15 ⁰c at an up right position overnight for 18 h the frozen columns were placed in a warm water bath for 1 2 min to melt ice near the wall and loosen the ice core the ice core was laid on an aluminum foil and sliced into segments of 3 cm in length with a heated iron knife each segment was melted in a clean glass bottle and weighed before filtering the water samples through a 24 mm g4 glass fiber filter paper with 1 2 μm pore size thermofisher scientific 09 804 24c to isolate microplastics in each ice core segment 2 4 transport of microplastics in saturated sand columns by freeze thaw cycles the transport experiments were conducted following the method outlined elsewhere koutnik et al 2022a briefly packed sand columns were conditioned to remove any colloids or particulates by injecting 4 pore volumes pv or 100 ml of synthetic stormwater at 5 ml min 1 using a peristaltic pump we used synthetic stormwater 6 mm nacl with a similar ph adjusted and ionic strength as a natural stormwater collected from ballona creek los angeles usa ghavanloughajar et al 2020 the use of synthetic stormwater prevented cross contamination with microplastics and particles typically present in natural stormwater the effluent samples for each column were collected and analyzed for background microplastic concentration ranging from 0 01 p ml 1 to 0 18 p ml 1 to simulate microplastic accumulation on biofilters for many years koutnik et al 2022a 0 1 g of each polymer type of microplastics was deposited on the top of 6 columns of which 3 columns were subjected to drying treatment control and the other 3 columns were subjected to freeze thaw treatment during natural freezing in subsurface pore water freezes and water does not typically flow through pores as precipitation occurs via snowfall during the thawing process snow melts create runoff which could pass through the subsurface mobilizing any deposited colloids or microplastics to simulate microplastic transport during freeze thaw cycles in nature the columns were subjected to freeze thaw cycles followed by infiltration events as described elsewhere mohanty et al 2014 briefly the contaminated columns were subjected to 23 h of either drying or freeze thaw treatment followed by a 20 min injection of 4 pv of synthetic stormwater at 5 ml min 1 or 0 96 cm min 1 which was below the hydraulic conductivity of the packed sand to simulate freeze thaw treatment columns were frozen at 20 ⁰c for 6 h and thawed at 22 ⁰c for 17 h to simulate drying treatment the columns were drained by gravity and dried at 22 ⁰c for 23 h the cycles drying followed by wetting or freeze thaw followed by wetting were repeated 36 times and the effluents were analyzed for microplastic concentrations after 1 8 15 22 26 31 and 36 cycles to estimate potential breakthroughs in deposited microplastics to account for any microplastics that were already present in the sand before the contamination stage uncontaminated sand columns were subjected to dry wet or freeze thaw cycle treatments and effluents were analyzed for microplastics in the end all columns were dismantled to sample sand from different depths from specific depths 0 5 1 2 3 4 5 8 12 cm starting from the bottom most depth near effluent as straining was found to be a dominant removal process of large microplastics in the stormwater biofilters koutnik et al 2022b the depth distribution was fitted to an empirical equation eq 1 1 c z c 0 e k z where c z and c 0 are microplastic concentrations p g 1 at depth z cm and on the surface respectively and k is the retardation coefficient thus k is estimated by the fitting depth and concentration data into the model and includes effects of absorption straining gravity settling and removal by any other mechanism 2 5 analysis of effluent and filter media samples to isolate microplastics from effluent water samples were vacuum filtered through 24 mm glass fiber filter membranes with 1 2 µm pore size thermo fisher scientific and the filtered microplastics were stained by adding 0 17 ml of 0 5 µg ml 1 nile red in chloroform solution on filters inside a glass petri dish koutnik et al 2022b filters were air dried with a glass cover and imaged using a smartphone based fluorescence microscope the details of the method is described elsewhere leonard et al 2022 which has been used in multiple studies with environmental and laboratory samples koutnik et al 2022a 2022b the method permits the counting of microplastics that can adsorb nile red dyes and does not differentiate between different types of plastic polymers to estimate the concentration of microplastics retained at different depths of the sand filters 1 g of oven dried sand sample was mixed in 40 ml of 1 6 g ml 1 ki solution in a 50 ml centrifuge tube and the mixture was centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 30 min to settle sand particles leaving the lighter density 1 6 g cm 3 particles including microplastics to float on the supernatant surface mu et al 2019 the supernatant was filtered to isolate plastics stained using nile red and analyzed for microplastic concentration as described earlier the concentrations were reported as the number per l of effluent or g of filter media to analyze the difference and similarity between the measured concentrations between contaminated plastic or treatment types we performed a wilcoxon rank sum test r version 4 0 0 2 6 quality assurance and quality control all lab surfaces were wiped down every day and before and after usage samples were collected stored and processed using pre washed laboratory glassware all glassware and containers were washed with soap and water and then rinsed with di water three times to remove any background microplastics glass covers or clean aluminum foil were used to prevent airborne contamination during the sample processing uncontaminated filter media was analyzed from each column depth for any background concentration of microplastics which was subtracted from the concentration of microplastics at the same depth in contaminated columns to estimate the true penetration depth of added microplastics the di water used in this study was analyzed for possible microplastic contamination the contributions of microplastics from plastic tubing for pumping pvc plastic columns centrifuge polypropylene test tubes and plastic pipette tips were estimated using appropriate blanks during every day of analysis a method blank was run following the same lab procedure the mean of laboratory blanks for each method was subtracted from the measured concentration of samples to account for any microplastics introduced from procedural steps 3 results 3 1 distribution of microplastics in frozen water columns without porous media the redistribution of microplastics in pore water during freeze thaw cycles could depend on the force exerted by the moving ice water interface and physical constraints from the surface porous media near the pore water analysis of the distribution of microplastics in frozen water columns without sand media revealed that microplastic distribution in pore water with the constraint of porous media varied with microplastic density fig 1 more than 60 of pp microplastics were found at the surface with their concentration decreasing with depth in contrast pet concentration was higher at lower depths about 20 of pet particles were found at the surface despite being expected to sink due to their greater density than water 3 2 distribution of microplastics in sand columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles depth distribution of microplastics in columns packed with sand showed that freeze thaw cycles increased the penetration depth of microplastics compared to dry wet cycles fig 2 irrespective of treatment methods the downward mobility was more pronounced for denser microplastics such as pet the distribution was sensitive to the density of microplastics for all the columns subjected to dry wet cycles the microplastic concentration near the outlet was similar to the background concentration 0 7 p g 1 irrespective of microplastic density in contrast for the columns subjected to freeze thaw treatments microplastic concentration near the outlet was similar to background concentration only for columns contaminated with two types of plastics pp and ps regardless of the weathering pet microplastics moved deeper into columns than the pp and ps particles fitting the distribution of microplastics with the exponential model equation 1 koutnik et al 2022b 2022a we showed that retardation of microplastics in sand biofilters varied with microplastic density irrespective of treatment types but the density had a more pronounced effect on microplastic retardation under freeze thaw cycles than that under dry wet cycles fig 2 specifically the retardation coefficient which is estimated based on the slope of the graphs in figure 2c d ranges from 1 1 to 5 5 with the highest slope corresponding to pet in columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles 3 3 the concentration of microplastics in the effluent analysis of microplastic concentration in the effluent from all columns revealed that transport of pp and ps microplastics was negligible and statistically insignificant irrespective of the treatment types fig 3 the 15 cm deep sand media was sufficient to prevent the transport of pp and ps microplastics out of the columns via effluent in contrast pet microplastics were found in higher concentrations than the background concentration from uncontaminated or blank columns the background concentrations were 0 023 p ml 1 and 0 075 p ml 1 for blank columns with dry wet and freeze thaw cycles respectively the higher effluent concentration of pet microplastics in contaminated columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles further confirmed the finding that pet microplastics were disproportionately moved by freeze thaw cycles 4 discussion 4 1 retention of microplastics in sand columns all deposited microplastics with the exception of pet microplastics in columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles were retained in sand columns among the three types of microplastics used pet is heavier than water freeze thaw treatment decreased the retention of pet microplastics and enhanced their mobility more than that of pp and ps microplastics the results indicate that in most conditions microplastics with densities lighter than water can be effectively retained in the subsurface the results are similar to previous studies that showed the removal of microplastics in sand columns gao et al 2021 koutnik et al 2022a o connor et al 2019 rong et al 2022 waldschläger and schüttrumpf 2020 most microplastics were removed in sand columns due to the physical straining koutnik et al 2022b 2022a which is sensitive to the size of microplastics and pore size of the media bradford et al 2003 straining occurs when larger particles are blocked by the narrow pores auset and keller 2006 ps particles used in this study were larger than pe or pet particles figure s2 therefore ps microplastics are expected to be removed by sand by straining to a greater extent than the other two types of microplastics larger microplastics blocked at narrow pore throats between sand grains could not move further irrespective of dry wet or freeze thaw cycles this partially explained why ps microplastics were retained to a greater extent than the other two types of microplastics irrespective of weathering treatments among plastic types pet microplastics were found in greater concentration than the background level in the effluents of columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles fig 3 the depth distribution data fig 2 also confirmed the enhanced mobility of pet microplastics by freeze thaw cycles the result indicates that the density of microplastics plays a critical role in the remobilization of microplastics by freeze thaw cycles compared to dry wet cycles previous studies mohanty et al 2015 2014 have compared the remobilization colloids by dry wet and freeze thaw cycles but they did not vary the density of colloids chrysikopoulos and syngouna 2014 examined the role of gravity on the transport of colloids in sand columns by comparing the transport of bacteria specific gravity similar to pet 1 4 and natural clay colloids specific gravity 2 6 and observed that an increase in specific gravity of colloids increased in colloid transport velocity in vertical sand columns collectively the results confirmed that denser colloids are more susceptible to transport than lighter colloids 4 2 enhanced transport of microplastics by freeze thaw cycles compared to dry wet cycles for the same microplastic type freeze thaw cycles transported more microplastics to the deeper layers than dry wet cycles did within the columns fig 2 although the same amount of microplastics was added to all columns the concentration of microplastics in the top layer of columns subjected to freeze thaw cycles was slightly higher than the concentration in the top layer of columns subjected to dry wet cycles in contrast the concentration in deeper layers was disproportionately greater in columns with freeze thaw cycles than in columns with dry wet cycles this result agreed with a previous study that compared the transport of pp microplastics in sand and soil columns under dry wet or freeze thaw cycles koutnik et al 2022a our study provides additional evidence that the effect of the density of microplastics on the transport of microplastics during freeze thaw cycles in particular the effect of freeze thaw cycles is more pronounced for denser microplastics we attributed the results to fundamental differences in processes by which dry wet or freeze thaw cycles could mobilize deposited microplastics in porous media advancing or receding wetting fronts during dry wet cycles typically disrupt solid water and air water interfaces where colloids were typically deposited denovio et al 2004 thus the shear force of the rapidly moving air water interfaces could scour microplastics or colloids from their deposited locations and mobilize them into pore water flury and aramrak 2017 shang et al 2008 the interaction of air water interfaces on colloids depends on the hydrophobicity of colloids keller and auset 2007 thus hydrophobicity of microplastics may play a greater role than density in the remobilization of microplastics by dry wet cycles in contrast to dry wet cycles freeze thaw cycles involve the transition of the water phase to ice during freezing deposited microplastics can either be pushed or engulfed by the ice front based on the free energy change to replace particle liquid pl and liquid solid lp interfaces with a solid particle sp interface asthana and tewari 1993 shangguan et al 1992 ice front engulfs the particle if the free energy change is negative as all plastics are insulators which block the heat energy from water to ice near the interface the ice formation could accelerate near the microplastics creating a convex shaped interface that would be more likely to push microplastics along the direction of ice interface propagation asthana and tewari 1993 a moving ice front can be more disruptive than rewetting of the pore by liquid water because expanding ice during freezing can exert more pressures than capillary pressures on pore walls during drying koutnik et al 2022a mohanty et al 2014 the ice crystals can also fracture or expand the pore walls thereby creating flow paths conducive to the transport of large colloids borthakur et al 2021b 4 3 mechanisms of microplastic transport by freeze thaw cycles our results confirmed that the extent to which freeze thaw cycles could accelerate the downward mobility of microplastics is dependent on the density of microplastics however the microplastics used in our study are 50 µm and the detection method used in our study could not reliably detect microplastics 10 µm to understand the effect of density on the mobility of microplastics within all size ranges 0 1 µm to 1000 µm we estimated the velocity of suspended plastic particles with a spherical shape at far and close within a few nm distances from the moving ice interface using a force balance approach shangguan et al 1992 the model does not account for the effect of shape which is expected to affect the drag force furthermore the model does not account for the interception of microplastics in porous media when pushed by ice and assumed all microplastics were initially present in one location before being separated by different forces described as follows consequently the model could not directly validate the experimental data nevertheless the simplistic model illustrates the importance of microplastic density on their transport in pore water the velocity of a plastic particle v p far from the moving ice water interface as shown in equation 2 can be derived by force balance where the gravitational force based on the density difference between particle and water f g 4 3 π r p 3 δ ρ g acts against the drag force f d 6 π μ r p v p here δ ρ is the difference in the density of the particle ρ p and water ρ l μ is the viscosity of water g is the acceleration due to gravity and r p is the radius of the particle 2 v p 2 9 r p 2 δ ρ g μ 1 the particle moves at constant flotation velocity in a direction based on the sign of δ ρ fig 4 c thus most pp microplastics are expected to float and stay near the surface of the water column whereas most pet microplastics are expected to settle at the bottom of columns after sufficient time has passed our results fig 1 confirmed the overall trend more than 60 pp microplastics and less than 15 pet microplastics moved to the top of the water column after freeze thaw cycles as the initial position of microplastics in a well mixed suspension and the time taken to freeze the water column was unknown stoke s law could not be used to predict the occurrence of the microplastics present at different depths the force balance on the suspended microplastics would change at close proximity within a few nanometers to the ice water interface where molecular interactions become relevant if the particle is denser than water the interaction between the particle and ice interface would occur only if the velocity of the ice water interface v s is greater than the settling velocity v p fig 4 a at a distance of the order of the atomic spacing the particle would experience an interfacial molecular force f i or the van der waals force or the force due to a change in the interfacial energy in this case the standard stokes equation for the drag force is no longer valid as the flow of liquid is perturbed by the ice front at this close proximity the particle experiences a drag force or cryosuction force f μ because water moves from the suspension towards the interface to support ice growth thereby attracting the particle towards the interface fig 4 a at equilibrium the net force on the particle would be zero f g f i f μ 0 as shown in equation 3 3 4 3 π r p 3 δ ρ g 2 π r p δ σ 0 a 0 a 0 d n α 6 π μ v p r p 2 d α 2 0 where a 0 is the sum of the radii of atoms in the surface layers of the particle and the solid d is the gap between particle and ice water interface and δ σ 0 σ s p σ l p σ s l is the net free energy changes for the particle to be engulfed by ice which occurs when free energy between the ice and particle σ s p exceeds the free energy between water and particle σ l p and ice and water σ s l α is a function of the curvature of the ice water interface near the particle which is the ratio of the radius of curvature of the ice water interface r i and the difference between the radius of interface curvature and particle radius r i r p as the curvature is created by the melting of ice due to a difference in thermal conductivity of water and plastic particle α can be calculated as the ratio of thermal conductivity of particle k p and water k l as the thermal conductivity of microplastics is smaller than water a convex shape ice hump would form near the interface between the particle and ice which can push microplastics further solving equation 4 the velocity of the particle near the ice water interface would become 4 v p d 3 μ α δ σ 0 r p a 0 a 0 d n 2 r p ρ p ρ l g 3 α estimating the velocity of plastic particles with a radius between 0 1 to 1000 μ m near the ice water interface we show that the velocity is sensitive to plastic density if the size of microplastic is bigger than 10 µm fig 4 b the contribution of interfacial force on microplastic mobility was prominent when the particle size was smaller than 10 µm however our method is inadequate to detect microplastics within these size ranges thus the velocity of smaller microplastics 10 µm is expected to increase dramatically with a decrease in size due to push from the ice interface irrespective of the density of microplastics in contrast the velocity of larger microplastics such as the ones used in this study would be much small near the ice water interface and the velocity would be affected by the density of microplastics the theoretical prediction that pet velocity would be much higher than pp and ps near the ice interface is confirmed by our experimental data where pet microplastics were relocated deeper into the water columns fig 1 followed by ps and pet most pp particles were expected to float on the surface so they were not affected by ice propagation from top to bottom of the columns 4 4 environmental implications the results of this study provide the first quantitative and experimental evidence showing accelerated transport of microplastics by freeze thaw cycles as a function of the particle density the theoretical framework provided here can be applied across all plastic polymers with other densities understanding the effects of freeze thaw cycles is critical due to the prevalence of these seasonal weather patterns across all of northern america and europe furthermore these results are useful to predict microplastic movement in freshwater lakes or ponds that undergo freezing during winter as freezing cycles and conditions are expected to vary during climate changes the results can later be used to understand a change in microplastic distribution in the subsurface under different climates predicted climate change scenarios suggest an increase in the frequency and severity of soil freeze thaw cycles in many northern temperate regions of the world henry 2008 with implications for the subsurface transport rates of different emerging contaminants including microplastics the results can also help predict microplastic distribution in the soil in the agricultural fields and urban areas and the potential transport pathways to the groundwater henry 2008 pauli et al 2013 although sand was used in this study to demonstrate the impact of freezing and density the trend is expected to be similar in soils as shown in a previous study koutnik et al 2022a however the effect of density or freeze thaw cycles can be less apparent if most microplastics are removed by straining in narrow flow paths in soil thus soil pore size distribution should be taken into account to accurately determine the effect of microplastic density on their mobility in soil subjected to freeze thaw cycles nevertheless understanding how far some microplastics would move near the root zone can help predict their impact on root function or crop productivity boots et al 2019 de souza machado et al 2019 plants growing in microplastic contaminated soils are predicted to have decreased nutrient contents and increased toxicity as nano plastics can be uptaken by plant roots and soil microbiota li et al 2020 seeley et al 2020 sun et al 2021 downward migration also has the potential for groundwater contamination which serves as a source of fresh water for at least two billion people worldwide panno et al 2019 samandra et al 2022 viaroli et al 2022 recent anecdotal evidence showed a greater abundance of denser plastics such as pet and pvc in the groundwater samples but the cause of such abundance was unknown samandra et al 2022 our study provided a theoretical basis to predict the increased abundance of denser microplastics in deeper subsurface soil or groundwater aquifers 5 conclusions based on the experimental evidence and theoretical framework we proved that the density of microplastics could play a critical role in the transport of microplastics in subsurface soil or other porous media in stormwater treatment systems subjected to natural freeze thaw cycles most microplastics were retained in sand columns potentially by physical straining if their particle size is larger than the pore size based on the force balance calculation on microplastics near the downward moving ice water interface smaller microplastics 50 µm could be pushed at higher velocity by the ice water interface irrespective of the density of microplastics however density becomes critical when the size of microplastics becomes larger than 50 µm for these large microplastics pet moved deeper into the sand layer compared to low density microplastics such as pp and ps these results suggest that among all accumulated microplastics in stormwater treatment systems denser microplastics such as pet and pvc are more likely to move deeper into the subsurface to groundwater declaration of competing interest the authors

15706,magnetic field is a simple and powerful means that enables controlled the transport of electrode particles in flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi however the magnetic particles are easily stripped from hybrid suspension electrodes and the precise manipulation of the charge percolation network remains challenging in this study a programmable magnetic field was introduced into the fcdi system to enhance the desalination performance and operational stability of magnetic fcdi with core shell magnetic carbon mc used as an alternative electrode additive the results showed that the pulsed magnetic field pmf was more effective in enhancing the average salt removal rate asrr compared to the constant magnetic field cmf with 51 6 and 67 7 enhancement respectively compared to the magnetic field free condition the outstanding advantage of the pmf lies in the enhancement in the trapping and mediating effects in the switching magnetic field which keeps the concentration of the

2011 mauter and fiske 2020 metzger et al 2020 uliana et al 2021 capacitive deionization cdi is considered a promising electrical driven technology for potential application in desalination and clean water production due to its relatively low energy consumption cost effectiveness and ease of maintenance ma et al 2016 patel et al 2020b uliana et al 2021 zuo et al 2020 among the variety of cdi derived devices flow electrode capacitive deionization fcdi developed in 2013 jeon et al 2013 is recognized as an alternative desalination technique to thermal and pressure desalination processes lin 2020 patel et al 2020a 2020b in the charging process an electrode slurry is pumped through the cathode and anode chambers separated by ion exchange membranes iems and the ions removed from the spacer chamber are finally stored in the electrical double layers edls of the electrode particles tang et al 2020 xu et al 2021a many recent studies have shown that fcdi systems can be continuously charged for hours to days and stacked to increase the production of fresh water making them feasible for practical applications chung et al 2020 fang et al 2021 ma et al 2016 xu et al 2021b zhang et al 2020 increasing the desalination rate has been the most important research effort in fcdi studies in the last few years the most widely accepted and used strategy is to increase the mass loadings of active materials and or conductive additives to create connected electron percolation networks hatzell et al 2015 luo et al 2021 luo et al 2021 ma et al 2020 narayanan et al 2021 rommerskirchen et al 2019 surface chemical modification of the active material has been demonstrated to improve the dispersion hydrophilicity and electrical conductivity of the suspension electrode cai et al 2020 huang et al 2021 park et al 2016 several functional groups e g carboxyl coo sulfonic group so3 and amino and multi component composite materials e g polypyrrole polyetherimide and sulfosuccinic were introduced to improve the surface chemical properties of the active material cai et al 2020 folaranmi et al 2022 huang et al 2021 li et al 2020 lin et al 2020 rahimi et al 2021 xu et al 2020 2021d although the mass loading of the modified activated carbon ac reached an unprecedented 28 wt the increased electrode impedances and the high dispersion of electrode particles was not conducive to electron transport hatzell et al 2015 huang et al 2021 in addition the high mass loading caused the poor fluidity rheological properties of the suspended electrodes carmona orbezo and dryfe 2021 hatzell et al 2015 narayanan et al 2021 recently found that the static yield stress τy increased 30 fold when the carbon black cb concentration increased from 3 1 wt to 5 4 wt resulting in a significant increase in pumping energy consumption the technical bottlenecks mentioned above including the difficulty of pumping high viscosity electrode slurries the high pumping energy requirement and the risk of clogging are forcing researchers to revisit the operation strategies and suspension electrode formulations improving the working capacitance of fcdi systems with low carbon loadings is another alternative strategy to seek a trade off between desalination rate and rheological properties bian et al 2020 folaranmi et al 2020 xu et al 2021c yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge however fcdi performed at low carbon content has so far failed to achieve satisfactory desalination rates due to limitations in the poor construction of charge percolation networks hatzell et al 2015 xu et al 2022a zhang et al 2018 note that the charge percolation network refers to the conductive pathway available for charge transport and the interested reader is referred to the vehoff et al 2010 in laminar flow carmona orbezo and dryfe 2021 hoyt et al 2015 li and xuan 2018 the effective adsorption capacity of fcdi is dominated by the thickness of the hydrodynamic boundary layer magnetic field have been shown to be an optional strategy to control the transport process of the suspension electrode xu et al 2022a 2022b under a magnetic field the electrode particles aggregated on the current collector surface enhancing the direct electron transport between electrode particles however the magnetic particles are easily stripped from the hybrid suspension electrodes with ac as activated material under a high intensity magnetic field and the precise manipulation of the charge percolation network remains challenging xu et al 2022b therefore how to achieve efficient controllable and stable magnetic fcdi is what researchers are chasing in this study we demonstrate a novel method for manipulating the charge percolation networks by precisely regulating the transport of suspension electrode simply using a pulsed magnetic field pmf core shell magnetic carbon mc was prepared by calcining fe3o4 resorcinol formaldehyde rf nanoparticles wang et al 2020 and was used as a magnetic conductive additive for the ac electrodes the mass ratio of mc to ac was 2 5 1 25 wt in a magnetic field mc particles in the suspension electrode not only increase the working area of the collector by aggregation effect but also increase the concentration of the ac electrode near the current collector through the trapping and mediating effects a pmf with controlled magnetic flux φ and pulse width pw maintains the effective adsorption capacity of fcdi at a higher level than a constant magnetic field cmf and reduces the risk of flow channel blockage finally the desalination performance and operational stability of the pulsed magnetic fcdi system was evaluated over 20 000 cycles in short this study provides a simple controllable and low cost method for fcdi operation and suspension electrode formulation opening a new pathway for enhanced electron transport between suspension electrodes 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of magnetic conductive additive core shell fe3o4 c was prepared in two steps synthesis of the fe3o4 rf precursor and carbonization in brief the resin precursor was prepared through the stöber method with some modifications wang et al 2020 2015 first 20 g of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab c19h42brn 99 cas 57 09 0 macklin and 300 ml of ethanol c2h6o 99 7 cas 64 17 5 macklin were dissolved in 700 ml of milli q water 18 2 ω millipore usa after

mixture was mechanically stirred at room temperature for at least 24 h after that the fe3o4 rf resin precursor was collected via magnetic separation and washed using ethanol and milli q water until the supernatant was completely clarified finally the fe3o4 rf particles were carbonized at 600 c for 3 h under an n2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 2 c min 1 the obtained materials were denoted mc 2 2 experimental setup a schematic of the magnetic fcdi system is shown in fig 1 a and b since the φ provided by the electromagnet decays with distance the fcdi cell was built based on the conventional three chamber structure with some modification xu et al 2022a the spacer chamber was created using a pair of anion cation exchange membranes g1204 and g0014 lvhe china and a silicon gasket thickness 0 5 mm was inserted between the iems the thickness of the graphite current collector was 1 mm the end plate was composed of two acrylic plates with thicknesses of 2 mm and 8 mm a circular hole with a diameter of 50 mm was dug in the center of the latter plate to embed the electromagnet kk p50 27 0 12 v kaka electrical co ltd china fig 1c the total thickness of the collector silicone gasket and acrylic plate was 4 mm which is the minimum distance d from the flow electrode chamber thickness 4 mm to the electromagnet the effective area a eff between the flow electrode chamber and iems was 15 0 cm2 to artificially control the magnetic field intensity a programmable double channel dc power dp821a rigol china supply was connected to two electromagnets as shown in fig s1 φ is linearly related to the applied voltage i e φ 2 92u r2 0 999 within the rated value u 0 12 v thus the magnetic field can be programmed by the voltage to study the desalination performance of fcdi 2 3 desalination performance test the flow electrode suspension was prepared by mixing 2 5 wt ac yec 8a yihuan tansu china 1 25 wt mc and 0 5 g l 1 nacl into milli q water in all experiments 40 ml of electrode slurry was continuously pumped into the electrode chambers i e in short circuit cycle scc mode at a flow rate of 50 ml min 1 the flow electrode in the external carbon tank was stirred using a mechanical agitator synthetic brackish water c 0 0 5 g l 1 nacl was pumped into the spacer chamber in single pass mode at a constant flow rate q of 1 6 ml min 1 unless otherwise noted the φ supplied by the electromagnet was controlled at 29 2 mt and the cell voltage of the fcdi cell was controlled at 1 0 v when the electromagnet was operated in pmf mode the effect of the pw i e the working time of the electromagnet in each period was investigated at a duty cycle of 0 5 fig 1d when the electromagnet was operated in cmf mode the duty cycle was 1 0 in the charging process the instant current of the fcdi cell and the effluent conductivity were monitored using a data acquisition system lq min vernier usa with a current sensor and a conductivity meter in each experimental test the cell voltage was not applied until the effluent conductivity reached a stable value 2 4 calculations the average salt removal rate asrr μmol cm 2 min 1 and charge efficiency ce were calculated as follows 1 asrr c 0 0 t c t d t t q m a eff 2 ce f c 0 0 t c t d t t q t m 0 t i d t where c 0 and c t are the salt concentrations at 0 and t s respectively q is the flow rate of the brackish water m is the molar mass of nacl t is the charging time f is the faraday constant and i is the instant current 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fe3o4 c an rf shell was coated on commercial fe3o4 nanoparticles according to the stöber method yang et al 2015 after calcination the resin layer was transformed into amorphous carbon wang et al 2015 the thickness of the carbon layer can be found to be 20 nm from the transmission electron microscope tem images fig 2 a c the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds element mapping results showed that both fe and o elements were distributed in the central region of the mc particles while c was mainly distributed in the outer layer fig 2 d h a clear boundary between c and fe o could be observed compared with the pristine fe3o4 samples the specific surface area of mc increased from 7 8 to 101 6 m2 g 1 and the average pore diameter decreased from 14 2 to 2 6 nm table s1 fig 2i depicts the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the materials the crystal phases of the raw material and mc sample could be well indexed as magnetite pdf 19 0629 the crystallinity of calcined mc being higher than that of raw fe3o4 is a common phenomenon due to the presence of a small amount of fe impurities liu et al 2018 as shown in the vibrating sample magnetometer vsm measurement fig 2j the mc sample exhibited a lower saturation magnetization of 55 8 emu g 1 than the pristine fe3o4 which had a value of 79 4 emu g 1 x ray photoelectron spectra xps measurement showed that the fe 2p intensity in mc increased with etching depth fig 2 k and l which is in full agreement with the tem results the high intensity of the o 1s signal detected on the mc surface i e the carbon layer should be attributed to the oxygen containing functional groups e g cooh and oh hatzell et al 2015 tian et al 2019 xu et al 2021d in brief the above characterizations fully proved the successful preparation of core shell fe3o4 c nanoparticles according to the results of thermogravimetric analyzer tga the carbon content was calculated to be 16 5 of the total mass of mc fig 2m and the results were supported by carbon and sulfur analyzer insert of fig 2m the carbon shell can not only increase the electrical conductivity of the material but also provide a large surface area for ion adsorption luo et al 2016 figs 2n and s2 showed the cyclic voltammetry cv results for fe3o4 mc and ac the cv curves of ac exhibit good capacitance characteristics with symmetric shapes without any obvious redox peaks indicating ideal edl adsorption and highly reversible ion adsorption desorption characteristics in contrast the bare fe3o4 showed an extremely low current signal in its cv curve due to the lack of adsorption sites table s1 compared to fe3o4 mc produced little current signal enhancement in the cv test because of the low carbon content however electrochemical impedance spectrometry eis analysis indicated that the carbon layer coated on the surface of fe3o4 significantly improved the electrical conductivity of mc which was comparable to that of ac fig 2o although increasing the thickness of the carbon layer is beneficial to ion adsorption fig s3a the carbon content affects the assessment of the adsorption performance of ac to exclude the adsorption of ions by mc as much as possible the magnetic carbon with a thickness of 20 nm was chosen for subsequent experiments 3 2 desalination performance of pulsed magnetic fcdi a preliminary evaluation of the desalination performance of magnetic fcdi under pmf and cmf modes was performed under the pmf the pw was controlled at 10 s i e the working and resting without magnetic field application times of the magnetic field in each half cycle were 10 s insert of fig s4 and the maximum φ was controlled at 29 mt fig 3 a showed the cycling performance of the magnetic fcdi system over 100 cycles 2000 s the current density j of fcdi in pmf mode varied periodically and the fluctuation was maintained in the range of 6 9 5 a m 2 that is j sharply increased to the peak value when the magnetic field was applied while j precipitously dropped when the magnetic field was removed fig 3b in cmf mode j remained constant and lay exactly between the peak and valley values in pmf mode as a result the salt removal efficiencies under the two magnetic field strategies were similar and higher than that in the fcdi operation without a magnetic field asrr 0 31 μmol cm 2 min 1 figs 3c and s4 additionally the desalination performance of fcdi with and without a magnetic field was poor when only mc was used as the flow electrode hence the adsorption contribution of mc can be neglected 3 3 effect of magnetic flux to explain the difference between the two magnetic field modes the effect of the magnetic field intensity φ 3 6 29 2 mt on the desalination performance of fcdi was investigated fig 4 a showed the positive effect of the magnetic field on the desalination performance of fcdi the change in effluent salt concentrations were exactly the same as the change in j fig s5 both modes exhibited stable j and effluent salt concentration variations for 100 cycles under different φ conditions this result can be partially explained by the aggregation of electrode particles on the current collector surface under a magnetic field however note that the fluctuation range of j increased as φ increased fig 4 b e for instance the current peak and valley at φ 3 6 mt were 4 65 and 5 25 a m 2 respectively while the current values at φ 29 3 mt increased to 6 0 and 9 6 a m 2 respectively the occurrence of the current peak in each cycle is due to the instantaneous application of the magnetic field which drove the electrode particles in the flow channel to migrate to the current collector side thus increasing the local electrode concentration the current valley appeared as the flow electrode redispersed with the removal of the magnetic field since the mc particles play a negligible role in ion adsorption the enhanced desalination performance in the magnetic fcdi system should be attributed to the ac electrode with a high specific surface area specifically the manipulation of mc particles by the magnetic field facilitates the transport of electrons between the ac flow electrodes in this process a high intensity magnetic field was required to drive the mc particles when the magnetic field was removed the flow electrode immediately returned to a homogeneous state thus the area of the blue region under a magnetic field slowly approaches that of the red region without a magnetic field as φ increases that is the smaller the area difference between the two regions is the closer the desalination performance of fcdi in the two modes 3 4 effect of pulse width can the desalination performance of fcdi under pulsed conditions be further enhanced by precisely manipulating the charge percolation networks so that the blue region is larger than the red region in this section the effect of the pw 1 2 5 10 20 and 40 s on the desalination performance of magnetic fcdi was investigated all experimental tests were performed for 400 s with a duty cycle of 0 5 fig s6 fig 5 clearly showed that the instant j values in each half cycle decreased with time under a magnetic field the longer the pw is the more obvious the deterioration of j as a result the difference between the blue area and red area was negatively correlated with the pw when the time is sufficiently long j can be expected to decrease to the level under the cmf these phenomena indicated that the working adsorption capacity of fcdi gradually decreased with time conversely a shorter pw means that the flow electrode can enter the next cycle faster avoiding deterioration of the desalination performance of fcdi fig s7a the blue region exceeded the red region when the pw was less than 10 s fig 5 a c fig s7b summarized the difference in the desalination rate δasrr asrrp asrrc of fcdi between the cmf and pmf modes at different pws δasrr reached 0 05 μmol cm 2 min 1 at pw 1 s thus selecting a pmf with a shorter pw i e higher frequency is recommended for operation of magnetic fcdi in addition to the advantages mentioned above frequent magnetic field switching can not only prevent excessive aggregation of mc on the current collector surface but also reduce the energy consumption for activating the electromagnet 3 5 mechanism of pulsed magnetic fcdi charge transport in suspension electrodes has been shown to occur through two main mechanisms liang et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 charge percolation networks generated by direct particle contact and diffusion convection transport caused by particle collisions the former and the latter depend on the relationship between the thicknesses of the hydrodynamic boundary layer and the potential boundary layer carmona orbezo and dryfe 2021 hoyt et al 2015 in a conventional fcdi system i e without a magnetic field the electrode particles in the central region of the flow channel are less aggregated due to the shear thinning effect li and xuan 2018 in which the electron transport is less efficient fig 6 a demonstrate the transport process of mc particles in a transparent flow through cuvette 2 mm thick under a magnetic field for optimal observation the concentration of mc in the flow electrode was only one tenth that in the desalination process the mc particles in the flow field q 50 ml min 1 were clearly attracted by the electromagnet figs 6 b and c and s8 showed the surface 3d morphology imaging of mc particles taken by laser microscopy it was observed that the mc particles aggregated and became chain like clusters after the applying of the magnetic field due to the increase in the dipole dipole interaction of the magnetic particles maurya and sarkar 2021 it can be seen from the profile outline that the maximum stacking height of magnetic carbon clusters has approximately doubled when the magnetic field was switched off the complete reverse transition i e returning to a homogeneous state occurred due to instantaneous breakage of the chain structure these results revealed that the transport process of mc particles under a switching magnetic field was fully reversible additionally the large ac particles 10 μm can be predicted to migrate to the current collector side for electron transport due to the collision trapping and adhesion effects of the nanoscale mc particles fig 6f despite the viscosity of the suspension electrode increased with the addition of mc to ac fig s9 an increase in φ accelerates the aggregation of the electrode particles and thereby increases the working area of the current collector and shortens the distance for ion transport fig 6e similar mechanism has been clarified in previous studies linnartz et al 2020 xu et al 2021c yang et al 2019 a high frequency switching magnetic field enables controlled manipulation of the charge percolation networks and can keep the concentration of the flow electrode on the surface of the current collector at a high level fig 6d additionally the exchange between the flow electrode particles near the current collector and in the center region of the flow channel is enhanced thus the working adsorption capacity of magnetic fcdi operating in pmf mode is maintained at a higher level than that in cmf mode compared to the addition of pristine fe3o4 the mc can efficiently mediate the transport of electrons between the current collector and ac particles due to the presence of a highly conductive carbon layer fig 2o pan et al 2018 yu et al 2022 therefore the magnetic fcdi achieved better desalination performance and stability in pmf mode compared to cmf mode 3 6 long term performance of pulsed magnetic fcdi figs 7 a and b and s9 showed the long term desalination performance of the pulsed magnetic fcdi system at a fixed φ of 29 2 mt and a pw of 1 s j increased from 7 82 0 6 to 11 15 0 95 a m 2 after 20 000 cycles in scc mode the increase in j should be attributed to the increase in the salt concentration in the electrolyte zhang et al 2020 as calculated the asrr increased from 0 4 to 0 68 μmol min 1 cm 2 fig 7b in addition the ce was maintained above 96 suggesting the stability of the magnetic fcdi compared with conventional conductive additives such as cb and carbon nanotubes cnts ma et al 2020 tang et al 2019 mc particles in the hybrid flow electrode can be quickly separated from the hybrid flow electrode and recycled using magnetic separation which is more advantageous in practical applications in addition scanning electron microscopy sem images and xps spectra were obtained for the mc samples to determine the changes in the morphology and elemental content of the mc particles before and after use as shown in fig 7 c and d no differences in the sizes or core shell structures were found between the original mc and the used samples the xps high resolution patterns of c 1s fig 7e fe 2p fig 7f and o 1s fig 7g elements also did not show any difference between the two material samples all these results demonstrate the robustness of mc and the stability of the pulsed magnetic fcdi in continuous operation a detailed comparison of the desalination performance of the magnetic fcdi system with that in previous studies is provided in table 1 for comparison data obtained under similar experimental conditions e g carbon content 2 0 2 5 wt and operational modes were selected the comparison results clearly show that the asrrs obtained under magnetic fields cmf and pmf were significantly higher than those in previous works using ac or cb as flow electrodes he et al 2018 jiang et al 2022 ma et al 2021 2020 yang et al 2019 to the best of my knowledge the asrr of 0 52 μmol min 1 cm 2 achieved in this study is the highest ever achieved under similar experimental conditions in addition the superiority in energy normalized removed salt enrs is attributed to the high charge efficiency and the relatively low operating voltage he et al 2018 xu et al 2021b magnetic fcdi is expected to achieve higher desalination performance with further increases in the cell voltage flow rate and initial salt concentration 4 conclusions in the present study a pmf assisted fcdi system was first used for desalination of brackish water to precisely manipulating the charge percolation networks of the suspension electrodes core shell fe3o4 c nanoparticles were added to the ac electrode as magnetic conductive additives with masses of 1 25 and 2 5 wt the magnetic field intensity and waveform of the electromagnets can be precisely controlled by a programmable dc power supply the results demonstrated that the salt removal rate of fcdi can be significantly enhanced by introducing a magnetic field when the max φ is 29 2 mt the asrrs in cmf and pmf modes were 0 47 and 0 52 μmol cm 2 min 1 respectively significantly higher than that in the absence of a magnetic field 0 31 μmol min 1 cm 2 in cmf mode the positive effect of the magnetic field can be mainly ascribed to the increase in the current collector surface and the shortening of the ionic transport distance in addition to these two mechanisms the trapping and mediating effects of mc particles on the ac flow electrode were enhanced by the high frequency switching magnetic field the exchange efficiency between the flow electrode particles near the wall and in the center region of the flow channel was improved thus the concentration and adsorption capacity of the flow electrode on the surface of the current collector was maintained at a high level which greatly promoted the ion adsorption rate finally the long term performance of the pulsed magnetic fcdi was evaluated the asrr and ce of the pulsed magnetic fcdi system reached 0 4 0 68 μmol cm 2 min 1 and 96 respectively after 20 000 cycles the morphology and composition of the mc particles recovered by magnetic separation did not change indicating the feasibility of utilizing mc and a pmf for long term desalination in conclusion our study demonstrates the promising advantages of magnetic fcdi in practical applications and efficient desalination especially for the fcdi with low amounts of active material research on enhancing the desalination performance of fcdi by applying magnetic fields is still in its infancy and researchers need to optimize and improve it in many aspects such as the preparation of advanced magnetic materials and the manipulation of magnetic fields we believe that the

improve the surface chemical properties of the active material cai et al 2020 folaranmi et al 2022 huang et al 2021 li et al 2020 lin et al 2020 rahimi et al 2021 xu et al 2020 2021d although the mass loading of the modified activated carbon ac reached an unprecedented 28 wt the increased electrode impedances and the high dispersion of electrode particles was not conducive to electron transport hatzell et al 2015 huang et al 2021 in addition the high mass loading caused the poor fluidity rheological properties of the suspended electrodes carmona orbezo and dryfe 2021 hatzell et al 2015 narayanan et al 2021 recently found that the static yield stress τy increased 30 fold when the carbon black cb concentration increased from 3 1 wt to 5 4 wt resulting in a significant increase in pumping energy consumption the technical bottlenecks mentioned above including the difficulty of pumping high viscosity electrode slurries the high pumping energy requirement and the risk of clogging are forcing researchers to revisit the operation strategies and suspension electrode formulations improving the working capacitance of fcdi systems with low carbon loadings is another alternative strategy to seek a trade off between desalination rate and rheological properties bian et al 2020 folaranmi et al 2020 xu et al 2021c yang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 to the best of our knowledge however fcdi performed at low carbon content has so far failed to achieve satisfactory desalination rates due to limitations in the poor construction of charge percolation networks hatzell et al 2015 xu et al 2022a zhang et al 2018 note that the charge percolation network refers to the conductive pathway available for charge transport and the interested reader is referred to the vehoff et al 2010 in laminar flow carmona orbezo and dryfe 2021 hoyt et al 2015 li and xuan 2018 the effective adsorption capacity of fcdi is dominated by the thickness of the hydrodynamic boundary layer magnetic field have been shown to be an optional strategy to control the transport process of the suspension electrode xu et al 2022a 2022b under a magnetic field the electrode particles aggregated on the current collector surface enhancing the direct electron transport between electrode particles however the magnetic particles are easily stripped from the hybrid suspension electrodes with ac as activated material under a high intensity magnetic field and the precise manipulation of the charge percolation network remains challenging xu et al 2022b therefore how to achieve efficient controllable and stable magnetic fcdi is what researchers are chasing in this study we demonstrate a novel method for manipulating the charge percolation networks by precisely regulating the transport of suspension electrode simply using a pulsed magnetic field pmf core shell magnetic carbon mc was prepared by calcining fe3o4 resorcinol formaldehyde rf nanoparticles wang et al 2020 and was used as a magnetic conductive additive for the ac electrodes the mass ratio of mc to ac was 2 5 1 25 wt in a magnetic field mc particles in the suspension electrode not only increase the working area of the collector by aggregation effect but also increase the concentration of the ac electrode near the current collector through the trapping and mediating effects a pmf with controlled magnetic flux φ and pulse width pw maintains the effective adsorption capacity of fcdi at a higher level than a constant magnetic field cmf and reduces the risk of flow channel blockage finally the desalination performance and operational stability of the pulsed magnetic fcdi system was evaluated over 20 000 cycles in short this study provides a simple controllable and low cost method for fcdi operation and suspension electrode formulation opening a new pathway for enhanced electron transport between suspension electrodes 2 materials and methods 2 1 synthesis of magnetic conductive additive core shell fe3o4 c was prepared in two steps synthesis of the fe3o4 rf precursor and carbonization in brief the resin precursor was prepared through the stöber method with some modifications wang et al 2020 2015 first 20 g of hexadecyl trimethyl ammonium bromide ctab c19h42brn 99 cas 57 09 0 macklin and 300 ml of ethanol c2h6o 99 7 cas 64 17 5 macklin were dissolved in 700 ml of milli q water 18 2 ω millipore usa after 0 5 h of ultrasound treatment 4 g of commercial nanoscale magnetite fe3o4 50 100 nm 99 5 cas 1317 61 9 macklin and 2 4 ml of ammonia water nh3 h2o 25 28 cas 1336 21 6 macklin were added to the as prepared solution after 1 h of ultrasound treatment 2 4 g of resorcinol c6h6o2 99 cas 108 46 3 macklin and 3 6 ml of formaldehyde ch2o 37 wt cas 50 00 0 macklin were added into the mixed solution the mixture was mechanically stirred at room temperature for at least 24 h after that the fe3o4 rf resin precursor was collected via magnetic separation and washed using ethanol and milli q water until the supernatant was completely clarified finally the fe3o4 rf particles were carbonized at 600 c for 3 h under an n2 atmosphere with a heating rate of 2 c min 1 the obtained materials were denoted mc 2 2 experimental setup a schematic of the magnetic fcdi system is shown in fig 1 a and b since the φ provided by the electromagnet decays with distance the fcdi cell was built based on the conventional three chamber structure with some modification xu et al 2022a the spacer chamber was created using a pair of anion cation exchange membranes g1204 and g0014 lvhe china and a silicon gasket thickness 0 5 mm was inserted between the iems the thickness of the graphite current collector was 1 mm the end plate was composed of two acrylic plates with thicknesses of 2 mm and 8 mm a circular hole with a diameter of 50 mm was dug in the center of the latter plate to embed the electromagnet kk p50 27 0 12 v kaka electrical co ltd china fig 1c the total thickness of the collector silicone gasket and acrylic plate was 4 mm which is the minimum distance d from the flow electrode chamber thickness 4 mm to the electromagnet the effective area a eff between the flow electrode chamber and iems was 15 0 cm2 to artificially control the magnetic field intensity a programmable double channel dc power dp821a rigol china supply was connected to two electromagnets as shown in fig s1 φ is linearly related to the applied voltage i e φ 2 92u r2 0 999 within the rated value u 0 12 v thus the magnetic field can be programmed by the voltage to study the desalination performance of fcdi 2 3 desalination performance test the flow electrode suspension was prepared by mixing 2 5 wt ac yec 8a yihuan tansu china 1 25 wt mc and 0 5 g l 1 nacl into milli q water in all experiments 40 ml of electrode slurry was continuously pumped into the electrode chambers i e in short circuit cycle scc mode at a flow rate of 50 ml min 1 the flow electrode in the external carbon tank was stirred using a mechanical agitator synthetic brackish water c 0 0 5 g l 1 nacl was pumped into the spacer chamber in single pass mode at a constant flow rate q of 1 6 ml min 1 unless otherwise noted the φ supplied by the electromagnet was controlled at 29 2 mt and the cell voltage of the fcdi cell was controlled at 1 0 v when the electromagnet was operated in pmf mode the effect of the pw i e the working time of the electromagnet in each period was investigated at a duty cycle of 0 5 fig 1d when the electromagnet was operated in cmf mode the duty cycle was 1 0 in the charging process the instant current of the fcdi cell and the effluent conductivity were monitored using a data acquisition system lq min vernier usa with a current sensor and a conductivity meter in each experimental test the cell voltage was not applied until the effluent conductivity reached a stable value 2 4 calculations the average salt removal rate asrr μmol cm 2 min 1 and charge efficiency ce were calculated as follows 1 asrr c 0 0 t c t d t t q m a eff 2 ce f c 0 0 t c t d t t q t m 0 t i d t where c 0 and c t are the salt concentrations at 0 and t s respectively q is the flow rate of the brackish water m is the molar mass of nacl t is the charging time f is the faraday constant and i is the instant current 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of fe3o4 c an rf shell was coated on commercial fe3o4 nanoparticles according to the stöber method yang et al 2015 after calcination the resin layer was transformed into amorphous carbon wang et al 2015 the thickness of the carbon layer can be found to be 20 nm from the transmission electron microscope tem images fig 2 a c the energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy eds element mapping results showed that both fe and o elements were distributed in the central region of the mc particles while c was mainly distributed in the outer layer fig 2 d h a clear boundary between c and fe o could be observed compared with the pristine fe3o4 samples the specific surface area of mc increased from 7 8 to 101 6 m2 g 1 and the average pore diameter decreased from 14 2 to 2 6 nm table s1 fig 2i depicts the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns of the materials the crystal phases of the raw material and mc sample could be well indexed as magnetite pdf 19 0629 the crystallinity of calcined mc being higher than that of raw fe3o4 is a common phenomenon due to the presence of a small amount of fe impurities liu et al 2018 as shown in the vibrating sample magnetometer vsm measurement fig 2j the mc sample exhibited a lower saturation magnetization of 55 8 emu g 1 than the pristine fe3o4 which had a value of 79 4 emu g 1 x ray photoelectron spectra xps measurement showed that the fe 2p intensity in mc increased with etching depth fig 2 k and l which is in full agreement with the tem results the high intensity of the o 1s signal detected on the mc surface i e the carbon layer should be attributed to the oxygen containing functional groups e g cooh and oh hatzell et al 2015 tian et al 2019 xu et al 2021d in brief the above characterizations fully proved the successful preparation of core shell fe3o4 c nanoparticles according to the results of thermogravimetric analyzer tga the carbon content was calculated to be 16 5 of the total mass of mc fig 2m and the results were supported by carbon and sulfur analyzer insert of fig 2m the carbon shell can not only increase the electrical conductivity of the material but also provide a large surface area for ion adsorption luo et al 2016 figs 2n and s2 showed the cyclic voltammetry cv results for fe3o4 mc and ac the cv curves of ac exhibit good capacitance characteristics with symmetric shapes without any obvious redox peaks indicating ideal edl adsorption and highly reversible ion adsorption desorption characteristics in contrast the bare fe3o4 showed an extremely low current signal in its cv curve due to the lack of adsorption sites table s1 compared to fe3o4 mc produced little current signal enhancement in the cv test because of the low carbon content however electrochemical impedance spectrometry eis analysis indicated that the carbon layer coated on the surface of fe3o4 significantly improved the electrical conductivity of mc which was comparable to that of ac fig 2o although increasing the thickness of the carbon layer is beneficial to ion adsorption fig s3a the carbon content affects the assessment of the adsorption performance of ac to exclude the adsorption of ions by mc as much as possible the magnetic carbon with a thickness of 20 nm was chosen for subsequent experiments 3 2 desalination performance of pulsed magnetic fcdi a preliminary evaluation of the desalination performance of magnetic fcdi under pmf and cmf modes was performed under the pmf the pw was controlled at 10 s i e the working and resting without magnetic field application times of the magnetic field in each half cycle were 10 s insert of fig s4 and the maximum φ was controlled at 29 mt fig 3 a showed the cycling performance of the magnetic fcdi system over 100 cycles 2000 s the current density j of fcdi in pmf mode varied periodically and the fluctuation was maintained in the range of 6 9 5 a m 2 that is j sharply increased to the peak value when the magnetic field was applied while j precipitously dropped when the magnetic field was removed fig 3b in cmf mode j remained constant and lay exactly between the peak and valley values in pmf mode as a result the salt removal efficiencies under the two magnetic field strategies were similar and higher than that in the fcdi operation without a magnetic field asrr 0 31 μmol cm 2 min 1 figs 3c and s4 additionally the desalination performance of fcdi with and without a magnetic field was poor when only mc was used as the flow electrode hence the adsorption contribution of mc can be neglected 3 3 effect of magnetic flux to explain the difference between the two magnetic field modes the effect of the magnetic field intensity φ 3 6 29 2 mt on the desalination performance of fcdi was investigated fig 4 a showed the positive effect of the magnetic field on the desalination performance of fcdi the change in effluent salt concentrations were exactly the same as the change in j fig s5 both modes exhibited stable j and effluent salt concentration variations for 100 cycles under different φ conditions this result can be partially explained by the aggregation of electrode particles on the current collector surface under a magnetic field however note that the fluctuation range of j increased as φ increased fig 4 b e for instance the current peak and valley at φ 3 6 mt were 4 65 and 5 25 a m 2 respectively while the current values at φ 29 3 mt increased to 6 0 and 9 6 a m 2 respectively the occurrence of the current peak in each cycle is due to the instantaneous application of the magnetic field which drove the electrode particles in the flow channel to migrate to the current collector side thus increasing the local electrode concentration the current valley appeared as the flow electrode redispersed with the removal of the magnetic field since the mc particles play a negligible role in ion adsorption the enhanced desalination performance in the magnetic fcdi system should be attributed to the ac electrode with a high specific surface area specifically the manipulation of mc particles by the magnetic field facilitates the transport of electrons between the ac flow electrodes in this process a high intensity magnetic field was required to drive the mc particles when the magnetic field was removed the flow electrode immediately returned to a homogeneous state thus the area of the blue region under a magnetic field slowly approaches that of the red region without a magnetic field as φ increases that is the smaller the area difference between the two regions is the closer the desalination performance of fcdi in the two modes 3 4 effect of pulse width can the desalination performance of fcdi under pulsed conditions be further enhanced by precisely manipulating the charge percolation networks so that the blue region is larger than the red region in this section the effect of the pw 1 2 5 10 20 and 40 s on the desalination performance of magnetic fcdi was investigated all experimental tests were performed for 400 s with a duty cycle of 0 5 fig s6 fig 5 clearly showed that the instant j values in each half cycle decreased with time under a magnetic field the longer the pw is the more obvious the deterioration of j as a result the difference between the blue area and red area was negatively correlated with the pw when the time is sufficiently long j can be expected to decrease to the level under the cmf these phenomena indicated that the working adsorption capacity of fcdi gradually decreased with time conversely a shorter pw means that the flow electrode can enter the next cycle faster avoiding deterioration of the desalination performance of fcdi fig s7a the blue region exceeded the red region when the pw was less than 10 s fig 5 a c fig s7b summarized the difference in the desalination rate δasrr asrrp asrrc of fcdi between the cmf and pmf modes at different pws δasrr reached 0 05 μmol cm 2 min 1 at pw 1 s thus selecting a pmf with a shorter pw i e higher frequency is recommended for operation of magnetic fcdi in addition to the advantages mentioned above frequent magnetic field switching can not only prevent excessive aggregation of mc on the current collector surface but also reduce the energy consumption for activating the electromagnet 3 5 mechanism of pulsed magnetic fcdi charge transport in suspension electrodes has been shown to occur through two main mechanisms liang et al 2017 rommerskirchen et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 charge percolation networks generated by direct particle contact and diffusion convection transport caused by particle collisions the former and the latter depend on the relationship between the thicknesses of the hydrodynamic boundary layer and the potential boundary layer carmona orbezo and dryfe 2021 hoyt et al 2015 in a conventional fcdi system i e without a magnetic field the electrode particles in the central region of the flow channel are less aggregated due to the shear thinning effect li and xuan 2018 in which the electron transport is less efficient fig 6 a demonstrate the transport process of mc particles in a transparent flow through cuvette 2 mm thick under a magnetic field for optimal observation the concentration of mc in the flow electrode was only one tenth that in the desalination process the mc particles in the flow field q 50 ml min 1 were clearly attracted by the electromagnet figs 6 b and c and s8 showed the surface 3d morphology imaging of mc particles taken by laser microscopy it was observed that the mc particles aggregated and became chain like clusters after the applying of the magnetic field due to the increase in the dipole dipole interaction of the magnetic particles maurya and sarkar 2021 it can be seen from the profile outline that the maximum stacking height of magnetic carbon clusters has approximately doubled when the magnetic field was switched off the complete reverse transition i e returning to a homogeneous state occurred due to instantaneous breakage of the chain structure these results revealed that the transport process of mc particles under a switching magnetic field was fully reversible additionally the large ac particles 10 μm can be predicted to migrate to the current collector side for electron transport due to the collision trapping and adhesion effects of the nanoscale mc particles fig 6f despite the viscosity of the suspension electrode increased with the addition of mc to ac fig s9 an increase in φ accelerates the aggregation of the electrode particles and thereby increases the working area of the current collector and shortens the distance for ion transport fig 6e similar mechanism has been clarified in previous studies linnartz et al 2020 xu et al 2021c yang et al 2019 a high frequency switching magnetic field enables controlled manipulation of the charge percolation networks and can keep the concentration of the flow electrode on the surface of the current collector at a high level fig 6d additionally the exchange between the flow electrode particles near the current collector and in the center region of the flow channel is enhanced thus the working adsorption capacity of magnetic fcdi operating in pmf mode is maintained at a higher level than that in cmf mode compared to the addition of pristine fe3o4 the mc can efficiently mediate the transport of electrons between the current collector and ac particles due to the presence of a highly conductive carbon layer fig 2o pan et al 2018 yu et al 2022 therefore the magnetic fcdi achieved better desalination performance and stability in pmf mode compared to cmf mode 3 6 long term performance of pulsed magnetic fcdi figs 7 a and b and s9 showed the long term desalination performance of the pulsed magnetic fcdi system at a fixed φ of 29 2 mt and a pw of 1 s j increased from 7 82 0 6 to 11 15 0 95 a m 2 after 20 000 cycles in scc mode the increase in j should be attributed to the increase in the salt concentration in the electrolyte zhang et al 2020 as calculated the asrr increased from 0 4 to 0 68 μmol min 1 cm 2 fig 7b in addition the ce was maintained above 96 suggesting the stability of the magnetic fcdi compared with conventional conductive additives such as cb and carbon nanotubes cnts ma et al 2020 tang et al 2019 mc particles in the hybrid flow electrode can be quickly separated from the hybrid flow electrode and recycled using magnetic separation which is more advantageous in practical applications in addition scanning electron microscopy sem images and xps spectra were obtained for the mc samples to determine the changes in the morphology and elemental content of the mc particles before and after use as shown in fig 7 c and d no differences in the sizes or core shell structures were found between the original mc and the used samples the xps high resolution patterns of c 1s fig 7e fe 2p fig 7f and o 1s fig 7g elements also did not show any difference between the two material samples all these results demonstrate the robustness of mc and the stability of the pulsed magnetic fcdi in continuous operation a detailed comparison of the desalination performance of the magnetic fcdi system with that in previous studies is provided in table 1 for comparison data obtained under similar experimental conditions e g carbon content 2 0 2 5 wt and operational modes were selected the comparison results clearly show that the asrrs obtained under magnetic fields cmf and pmf were significantly higher than those in previous works using ac or cb as flow electrodes he et al 2018 jiang et al 2022 ma et al 2021 2020 yang et al 2019 to the best of my knowledge the asrr of 0 52 μmol min 1 cm 2 achieved in this study is the highest ever achieved under similar experimental conditions in addition the superiority in energy normalized removed salt enrs is attributed to the high charge efficiency and the relatively low operating voltage he et al 2018 xu et al 2021b magnetic fcdi is expected to achieve higher desalination performance with further increases in the cell voltage flow rate and initial salt concentration 4 conclusions in the present study a pmf assisted fcdi system was first used for desalination of brackish water to precisely manipulating the charge percolation networks of the suspension electrodes core shell fe3o4 c nanoparticles were added to the ac electrode as magnetic conductive additives with masses of 1 25 and 2 5 wt the magnetic field intensity and waveform of the electromagnets can be precisely controlled by a programmable dc power supply the results demonstrated that the salt removal rate of fcdi can be significantly enhanced by introducing a magnetic field when the max φ is 29 2 mt the asrrs in cmf and pmf modes were 0 47 and 0 52 μmol cm 2 min 1 respectively significantly higher than that in the absence of a magnetic field 0 31 μmol min 1 cm 2 in cmf mode the positive effect of the magnetic field can be mainly ascribed to the increase in the current collector surface and the shortening of the ionic transport distance in addition to these two mechanisms the trapping and mediating effects of mc particles on the ac flow electrode were enhanced by the high frequency switching magnetic field the exchange efficiency between the flow electrode particles near the wall and in the center region of the flow channel was improved thus the concentration and adsorption capacity of the flow electrode on the surface of the current collector was maintained at a high level which greatly promoted the ion adsorption rate finally the long term performance of the pulsed magnetic fcdi was evaluated the asrr and ce of the pulsed magnetic fcdi system reached 0 4 0 68 μmol cm 2 min 1 and 96 respectively after 20 000 cycles the morphology and composition of the mc particles recovered by magnetic separation did not change indicating the feasibility of utilizing mc and a pmf for long term desalination in conclusion our study demonstrates the promising advantages of magnetic fcdi in practical applications and efficient desalination especially for the fcdi with low amounts of active material research on enhancing the desalination performance of fcdi by applying magnetic fields is still in its infancy and researchers need to optimize and improve it in many aspects such as the preparation of advanced magnetic materials and the manipulation of magnetic fields we believe that the

15707,this comprehensive review looks critically what is known about members of the genus defluviicoccus an example of a glycogen accumulating organism gao in wastewater treatment plants but found also in other habitats it considers the operating conditions thought to affect its performance in activated sludge plants designed to remove phosphorus microbiologically including the still controversial view that it competes with the polyphosphate accumulating bacterium ca accumulibacter for readily biodegradable substrates in the anaerobic zone receiving the influent raw sewage it looks at its present phylogeny and what is known about it s physiology and biochemistry under the highly selective conditions of these plants where the biomass is recycled continuously through alternative anaerobic feed aerobic famine conditions encountered there the impact of whole genome sequence data which have revealed considerable intra and interclade genotypic diversity on our understanding of its in situ behaviour is also addressed particular attention is paid to the problems in much of the literature data based on clone library and next generation dna sequencing data where defluviicoccus identification is restricted to genus level only equally problematic in many publications no attempt has been made to distinguish between defluviicoccus and the other known gao especially ca competibacter which as shown here has a very different ecophysiology the impact this has had and continues to have on our understanding of members of this genus is discussed as is the present controversy over its taxonomy it also suggests where research should be directed to answer some of the important research questions raised in this review graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords defluviicoccus glycogen accumulating organisms ca competibacter phosphate accumulating organisms ca accumulibacter enhanced biological phosphorus removal activated sludge 1 introduction despite being first described in 2005 maszenan et al 2005 and ordered subsequently into several clades surprisingly little interest has been shown more recently in defluviicoccus compared for example to the interest in the gao ca competibacter or the polyphosphate accumulating organism ca accumulibacter with which it interacts in wastewater treatment plants this review is an attempt to fill some of these gaps 2 the genus defluviicoccus in 2005 maszenan et al reported the isolation by micromanipulation of a slow growing gram negative coccus appearing in tetrads of cocci from an activated sludge plant treating mainly brewery waste in pilsen in the czech republic this morphotype is seen commonly in wastewater treatment plants and embraces a phylogenetic and physiologically wide diversity of bacteria as detailed by seviour et al 2000 and so by itself a tetrad morphology fig 1 has limited identification value 16s rrna sequencing and phenotypic analysis including chemotaxonomy showed this isolate named defluviicoccus vanus was a previously undescribed member of the subgroup 1 alphaproteobacteria in the family rhodospirillaceae fig 2 since then it has become clear that based on 16s rrna sequence data the genus defluviicoccus embraces several phylogenetic groups conveniently referred to as clades or clusters fig 2 so d vanus is a clade i member members of clade i and clade ii defluviicoccus were first recognized in clone libraries of 16s rrna gene sequences retrieved from wastewater treatment plants by mcilroy and seviour 2009 wong et al 2004 meyer et al 2006 and burow et al 2007a or from fish analyses oehmen et al 2006a 2006b these include the clade i ca defluviicoccus tetraformis strain tf071 nobu et al 2014 while defluviicoccus strain gaohk meyer et al 2006 wang et al 2014b emerged as a member of clade ii members of both clades share the tetrad cell arrangement although individual cell sizes can vary burow et al 2007a schroeder et al 2008 while those in clade iii are strikingly different morphologically originally recognized as an uncultured alphaproteobacterial filamentous gram negative nostocoida limicola morphotype blackall et al 2000 in wastewater treatment plants and given the name candidatus monilibacter batavus levantesi et al 2004 it was shown later nittami et al 2009 to be a member of defluviicoccus clade iii based on its 16s rrna sequence fig 2 and has since been named candidatus defluviicoccus seviourii onetto et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 have reported a filamentous defluviicoccus hybridizing with fish probes designed to target cluster ii members although whether it possessed the nostocoida limicola ii morphotype was not discussed in 2009 mcilroy and seviour found a 16s rrna sequence in a clone library from a wastewater treatment plant whose 16s rrna sequence failed to cluster closely with those of members of the existing clades 1 ii or iii fig 2 furthermore it formed a clade with sequences retrieved from a wide diversity of habitats including activated sludge but also from urban aerosols sediments and oral plaques as detailed later mcilroy and seviour 2009 these sequences were considered to be from members of defluviicoccus clade iv fig 2 having 16s rrna sequences of each of these clade members it was then possible to design targeted fish probes for their in situ identification and physiology as described later currently available fish probe sequence details are given in table 1 the sbr9 1a fish probe designed by beer et al 2004 from the 16s rrna sequence now known to be a chimera of a sphingomonas thought to be a gao was shown subsequently to target members of clades i and iii defluviicoccus mcilroy et al 2011b its target site in these populations was missing an internal nucleotide but the probe was still able to bind to it under the hybridization stringency conditions recommended in some early papers the original sphingomonas fish probe of beer et al 2004 was used and the targeted populations were referred to as sphingomonas related organisms or alphaproteobacteria gao e g lopez vazquez et al 2009a 2009b oehmen et al 2006a 2005a 2005b oehmen et al 2006b as discussed later the phylogenetic diversity of defluviicoccus is greater than suggested above analyses of eight defluviicoccus genomes bessarab et al 2022 has suggested the existence of another clade v embracing 16s rrna sequences from a range of habitats fig 2 the frequent occurrence of defluviicoccus in wastewater treatment plants often at high abundances and especially in those designed to remove phosphorus p microbiologically suggests that they are well suited ecophysiologically to this habitat and hence likely to impact on plant performance they have been shown to accumulate large reserves of glycogen under certain operational conditions and are thus referred to as glycogen accumulating organisms or gao bessarab et al 2022 liu et al 1996 maszenan et al 2005 nielsen et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 3 the microbiology of ebpr activated sludge systems while conventional activated sludge treatment plants remove organic carbonaceous material adequately the levels of p and n leaving in the treated effluent are environmentally undesirable leading to eutrophication and often stagnation of receiving bodies of water hence plants have evolved often empirically to give rise to processes able to reduce effluent p and n levels to acceptable levels by imposing selective pressures on the microbial community which encourage the growth and eventual enrichment of the desired bacterial populations barnard and comeau 2014 khunjar et al 2014 wanner et al 2021 the pao polyphosphate accumulating organisms possess the ability to store p intracellularly as polyphosphate granules at levels beyond those required to support cell growth and the process is known as enhanced biological phosphorus removal or ebpr mcmahon et al 2010 seviour et al 2010 seviour et al 2003 this selective pressure in continuous flow ebpr systems is exerted by exposure of the biomass continuously to alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions raw influent sewage is fed initially into an anaerobic feed reactor where the pao assimilate the readily biodegradable substrates instead of using these to support anaerobic growth they act as precursors for synthesis of chemically diverse intracellular storage materials already stored intracellular polyphosphate and glycogen reserves and the anaerobic tricarboxylic acid cycle are thought to provide the necessary energy and reducing power for their assimilation and synthesis and the orthophosphate generated is released into the bulk liquid mcmahon et al 2010 biomass is then passed into an aerobic famine reactor where the pao respire aerobically the storage material to generate carbon and energy sources for cell replication and the energy generated drives uptake of external orthophosphate and its conversion to intracellular polyphosphate granules mcmahon et al 2010 subsequent removal of pao cells during sludge wasting thus removes this immobilized p most ebpr plants also remove n microbiologically since the chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizing aob nitrifying bacteria under aerobic conditions oxidize nh3 to no2 stein 2019 which is then oxidized to no3 by the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob daims et al 2016 it is now clear that members of the archaea aoa are also nitrifiers zhang et al 2015 while some single bacterial populations the comammox can oxidize nh3 to no3 in a single step daims et al 2016 both groups are found in ebpr plants fan et al 2017 roots et al 2019 under the subsequent anoxic conditions chemoorganoheterotrophic denitrifying bacteria using no3 or no2 as electron acceptor to reduce it to environmentally harmless n2 which dissipates into the atmosphere lu et al 2014 mcilroy et al 2016 whether defluviicoccus participates in denitrification is discussed when the n metabolism of these is examined in detail in section 10 5 it was long thought unlikely that all pao would share the same phenotype in ebpr plants as those demonstrated by the still uncultured first identified pao the ß proteobacterium candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis crocetti et al 2000 hesselmann et al 1999 application of fish coupled with microautoradiography mar and histochemical staining showed it possessed the phenotype suggested from some of the early metabolic models thus under anaerobic feed conditions volatile short chain fatty acids like acetate and propionate the most common vfa in wastewater are assimilated and stored intracellularly as poly ß hydroxyalkanoate granules pha nielsen et al 2019 roy et al 2021 the stored pha are then respired under the famine aerobic conditions to generate energy in the form of atp reducing power and carbon fragments to accumulate extracellular orthophosphate synthesize intracellular polyphosphate granules and replenish the glycogen stores needed for subsequent pao anaerobic metabolic activities nielsen et al 2019 seviour et al 2003 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 with little available readily metabolizable substrates remaining in the aerobic famine stage organisms able to store carbon and energy sources anaerobically are selectively advantaged roy et al 2021 seviour et al 2003 both candidatus dechloromonas phosphoritropha and candidatus dechloromonas phosphorivorans pao share most of their anaerobic phenotype with ca accumulibacter petriglieri et al 2021 it is now clear that other pao defined here as any organism which utilizes stored polyp to facilitate anaerobic carbon assimilation nielsen et al 2019 seviour and mcilroy 2008 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 possess a different anaerobic phenotype to that described above for example neither tetrasphaera spp close et al 2021 zhang and kinyua 2020 which are more abundant than ca a phosphatis in many full scale treatment plants globally dueholm et al 2022 mielczarek et al 2013 nielsen et al 2019 roy et al 2021 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 nor the microlunatus phosphovorus pao assimilate volatile fatty acids although close et al 2021 have shown that their clade ii tetrasphaera population recycle phas under ebpr conditions both can ferment glucose and amino acids liu et al 2019 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 in tetrasphaera amino acids like glycine glutamate and aspartate can also be assimilated and stored anaerobically close et al 2021 kristiansen et al 2013 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 it is now clear that they like ca accumulibacter synthesise glycogen anaerobically which is then used aerobically to provide energy for phosphate assimilation marques et al 2017 rubio rincón et al 2019 this ability to ferment means that it can grow under the anaerobic anoxic conditions encountered in ebpr processes and thus provide substrates for other pao including ca accumulibacter nielsen et al 2019 thus tetrasphaera has a very different anaerobic physiology to ca accumulibacter most of these published tetrasphaera data have come from t elongata the most readily cultured but it is now clear it is not as high a p accumulator as some other members close et al 2021 singleton et al 2022 the level of phylogenetic diversity amongst tetrasphaera long known to be high nguyen et al 2011 marques et al 2017 has been re examined by singleton et al 2022 they present convincing evidence from whole genome sequencing analyses that uncultured clade 3 tetrasphaera members in fact embraced members of two new genera ca phosphoribacter and ca lutibacillus with the former shown to be the most abundant tetrasphaera detected in ebpr plants around the world 4 the glycogen accumulating organisms these organisms have been defined as populations that can accumulate glycogen intracellularly aerobically and use it under anaerobic conditions as the main energy source to assimilate substrates which are converted to intracellular storage products wong and liu 2007 thus the glycogen accumulating organisms gao and some of the pao share some of the same phenotype in the ebpr anaerobic feed stage importantly as glycogen serves now as the main anaerobic gao energy source for these events since polyp stores are not available no orthophosphate is released into the bulk liquid thus in the subsequent aerobic famine phase the gao metabolize their storage materials for cell growth but not to accumulate excess intracellular polyp instead glycogen is synthesized and stored for future utilization under the subsequent anaerobic conditions nielsen et al 2019 seviour and mcilroy 2008 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 some of the ca a phosphatis pao anaerobic phenotype has been demonstrated in several gao bacteria including strains of defluviicoccus spp mcilroy et al 2010 nittami et al 2009 wong and liu 2007 the betaproteobacterial ca propionivibrio aalbergensis albertsen et al 2016 and gammaproteobacterial competibacteriaceae kong et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2014 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 but not the actinobacterial micropruina glycogenica mcilroy et al 2018 whose anaerobic phenotype is quite different to those of all other known gao thus under anaerobic conditions this gao the most commonly seen in danish plants dueholm et al 2022 nielsen et al 2019 assimilates sugars and amino acids which are then thought to be fermented to lactate acetate ethanol and propionate consequently m glycogenica has been referred to as a fermentative gao mcilroy et al 2018 these products of fermentation are stored partially as glycogen which then acts as the carbon energy and reducing power sources under the subsequent aerobic conditions mcilroy et al 2018 thus they have been thought to compete anaerobically for substrates with the fermentative tetrasphaera pao stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 it seems likely that other gao populations await description including the defluviicoccus detected in habitats other than activated sludge see below key metabolic features of the gao and pao are listed in table 2 therefore as with the pao these gao are also metabolically diverse suggesting there is no single or uniform anaerobic gao phenotype and conclusions reached especially in early modelling and subsequent studies where the individual gao member clades were assumed collectively to have a single identical ecophysiology bin et al 2015 coats et al 2017 weissbrodt et al 2013 need re examination in some gao papers only the role of ca competibacter was considered even though defluviicoccus may have also been present in the community kolakovic et al 2021 weissbrodt et al 2013 welles et al 2015 possibly because they were once thought prematurely to be important only in plants treating industrial wastes dueholm et al 2022 if dominant the gao have been thought by many to compete anaerobically for readily biodegradable substrates with the ca accumulibacter pao and so reduce potentially the p removal capacity by a reduction in pao relative abundances e g mao et al 2016 as with clade i defluviicoccus members nielsen et al 2019 wang et al 2012 however not all such studies support these proposals begum and batista 2014 law et al 2016 majed and gu 2020 neethling et al 2006 qiu et al 2019 tu and schuler 2013 as discussed in more detail later whether these behavioural inconsistencies reflect variations in the in situ physiology and thus relative competitiveness of individual members between and within each individual clade as suggested by mcilroy et al 2011a for defluviicoccus clade iii members and kolakovic et al 2021 mcdaniel et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 for ca accumulibacter clades and singleton et al 2022 for tetrasphaera needs urgent clarification certainly fundamental strain and interspecies variabilities are known for both ca accumulibacter flowers et al 2013 petriglieri et al 2022 rubio rincón et al 2019 welles et al 2017 2015 the competibacteriaceae kong et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2014 wang et al 2021a and wang et al 2021b have suggested that competition between ca accumulibacter and d vanus in some situations may be decided by their relative abilities to produce biomass during the aerobic phase it is important to point out that even if defluviicoccus might reduce ebpr capacity their presence in these ebpr plants can yield peripheral benefits for example it seems likely that they are responsible under the prevailing anaerobic aerobic conditions for the excess carbon removal from influents with high cod n p feeds and hence reduce the risk of viscous sludge bulking which might otherwise occur as a result of such deficiencies kiss et al 2011 furthermore under anaerobic conditions high abundances of defluviicoccus clade i may be exploited for production of mixtures of novel polyhydroxyalkanoate pha co polymers with attractive properties and whose individual component levels can be manipulated by changing the feed compositions dai et al 2008 2007b wang et al 2021b similar outcomes were obtained using molasses as substrate under anaerobic aerobic conditions where short chain length and medium chain length pha were produced with 3 hydroxyhexanoate yield increases corresponding to increases in abundance of defluviicoccus clades i and ii at the expense of the competibacter gao pisco et al 2009 a paper mill wastewater feed with high c n ratio has been exploited successfully for the same purpose bengtsson et al 2008 pha production from an acetate feed in the pao is 3 polyhydroxybutyrate phb only and with gao 3 polyhydroxyvalerate phv 25 and 3 polyhydroxybutyrate 73 and a high total pha vfa ratio zheng et al 2002 zhou et al 2008 wang et al 2021b have shown that when d vanust was grown on butyrate and isobutyrate at 30 c it synthesised unusual 6 14 carbon long phas including polyhydroxy 4 methylvalerate ph4mv polyhydroxyhexanoate phhx and polyhydroxy 2 methylhexanate ph2mhx no such novel phas were seen by wang et al 2020b at 30 c with a butyrate isobutyrate feed and a community dominated by ca accumulibacter but with defluviicoccus present too instead mainly phb was produced and at low levels however pijuan et al 2004a did detect unidentified peaks from cultures fed butyrate and isobutyrate but whether these were the same as those detected by wang et al 2021b is not known many questions about defluviicoccus ecology physiology and systematics remain unanswered this review examines their phylogenetic diversity and ecological distribution and examines critically their role in ebpr wastewater treatment plants and elsewhere it suggests what key research questions need to be addressed and examines the key genomic features of defluviicoccus gao which might distinguish them from each other other gao and the pao 5 the natural occurrence of defluviicoccus it is important to realize that defluviicoccus is found more widely than in activated sludge plant communities although most of the relevant publications are descriptive and rarely if ever has their role or their impact on community behaviour there been elucidated as discussed earlier 16s rrna sequences of members of clade iv defluviicoccus were detected using pcr clone library analyses in early studies in urban aerosols sediments and oral plaques mcilroy and seviour 2009 most of the later publications have used amplicon sequencing protocols allowing populations to be identified to genus level only and very few have used fish in situ identification for further taxonomic resolution hence which clade s the defluviicoccus there belong to is rarely stated this is an important point worth emphasizing since increasing evidence would suggest that members of the different clades and even those within the same clade may possess different ecophysiologies eg begum and batista 2014 burow et al 2007b mcilroy et al 2011a schroeder et al 2008 in addition whether these defluviicoccus express the gao phenotype in non activated sludge habitats is not clear although it seems likely that the selective pressures brought to bear on them are quite different to those encountered there such clarification is achievable now with raman fish microspectroscopy with its ability to detect and quantify the diagnostic storage products glycogen pha and polyp in single fish identified cells in such communities fernando et al 2019 lee et al 2021 li et al 2018b furthermore it is difficult to decide unequivocally that the defluviicoccus in these atypical habitats are autochthones genuine stable members of the communities or represent invaders arising from site contamination with treated sewage effluent containing defluviicoccus as considered likely for their presence in marine sediment samples eg matturro et al 2017 and possibly in saline lake sediments abed et al 2012 belov et al 2018 they have also been found in a noumean new caledonian lagoon supplemented with dissolved inorganic p to encourage n fixation pfreundt et al 2016 where p supplementation was reported to enhance defluviicoccus abundances but with no explanation as to why their 16s rrna sequences were only 83 similar to that of d vanus but 99 similar to those of other environmental sequences suggesting they may be clade iv members the same caveats may apply also to soil samples where defluviicoccus has been detected although the literature suggests their presence there is not unusual al kindi and abed 2016 hui et al 2018 ji et al 2020 kaminsky et al 2017 nacke et al 2011 narendrula kotha and nkongolo 2017 ramadan et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 again little taxonomic detail has been provided and nor in most cases are their possible roles there detailed their relative abundances often considerable appear to change with changing soil properties li et al 2018a szoboszlay et al 2017 zhang and kinyua 2020 and they may play a positive role in the plant rhizosphere de tender et al 2016 ramadan et al 2021 or in soil fungal nutrition shao et al 2019 animal excretion contamination in the tibetan plateau led to a decrease in soil defluviicoccus abundance li et al 2021 but the effect if any of this loss on soil or plant nutrition was not discussed a high tolerance to mercury in a contaminated soil has also been reported ma et al 2019 defluviicoccus has been reported in holothurian invertebrates enomoto et al 2012 ocean sediments hassenrück et al 2016 solid fractions of manure zhong et al 2018 and bioaerosols from biomass burning emissions wei et al 2019 but again with no detailed accompanying taxonomic information wetlands too contain defluviicoccus liu et al 2020 tan et al 2019 where their primary source is thought likely again to be a wastewater feed ge et al 2019 have suggested they may play some role in a pyrite constructed wetlands designed to remove p a process thought to involve the aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of pyrite defluviicoccus was also reported together with micropruina another gao found in wastewater treatment plants in a wetland with an active alumina substrate designed to remove n from domestic sewage feed liu et al 2020 again suggesting this habitat as their original source defluviicoccus have also been detected in other invertebrates fan et al 2013 and been cultured from japanese neurotoxic ribbon worms melnikova et al 2017 its 16s rrna sequence was 98 similar to that of d vanus yet instead of growing as the distinctive tetrad cell arrangements of d vanus the cells were quite different appearing as short rods with rounded ends suggesting these too may belong to a new clade a defluviicoccus of undetermined phylogeny and described as a pathogen with no supporting evidence for such a description was also detected in the intestinal tract of early weaned piglets zhu et al 2020 6 how common is defluviicoccus in wastewater treatment plant most of our understanding of the phylogeny and ecophysiology of members of the genus defluviicoccus have come from studies on ebpr activated sludge communities although not all contain it and it occurs in other plant configurations including those with high levels of salinity wang et al 2020a wang et al 2015 the earlier view that these gao occurred predominantly in plants treating industrial wastes meyer et al 2006 is no longer sustainable nielsen et al 2019 nittami et al 2009 with ca d seviourii in australian ebpr plants treating domestic wastes the suggestion has also been made that defluviicoccus is more commonly found in laboratory scale bioreactors fed a synthetic sewage with high levels of readily assimilable substrates like acetate than in full scale plants with complex carbon sources and lower acetate levels tu and schuler 2013 however the data of nielsen et al 2019 and dueholm et al 2022 would question this view emphasizing yet again the risks of reaching generalizations from individual case studies in their original description of axenic cultures of d vanus maszenan et al 2005 showed by staining that it accumulated pha but failed to store polyp features consistent with a gao phenotype this observation was confirmed for members of clades i and ii in situ in ebpr plants using a range of techniques including pha and polyp staining coupled with fish stable isotope probing and microautoradiography mar burow et al 2007b meyer et al 2006 wong et al 2004 a gao phenotype for clade iii filamentous members was confirmed by nittami et al 2009 and mcilroy et al 2010 while the placement of strains into clade iv was based initially on 16s rrna sequence similarities alone mcilroy and seviour 2009 several treatment plant surveys have been published either based on fingerprinting plant communities of different configurations in attempts to understand which operating parameters might affect their relative abundances there or in validating newly designed fish probes nittami et al 2009 however many of the former predate the recognition of defluviicoccus members of clades iii and iv as well as ca p aalborgensis albertsen et al 2016 and cpb 18 and often ignore m glycogenica lópez vázquez et al 2008 did show with fish that very few defluviicoccus clade i and ii members were found in full scale ebpr plants in the netherlands whether other clade members or gao other than ca competibacter were present is not clear since at that time these had not been described or recognised while not especially widely occurring mielczarek et al 2013 did find this gao often at high abundances in some danish plants especially in ebpr plants treating domestic wastes and the bulking filamentous ca d seviourii has also been found at high abundances in the stable foams in chinese activated sludge plants li et al 2020a although whether it was the causative agent is not clear as there are no reports of it being hydrophobic clade iii defluviicoccus were also abundant in a membrane ebpr process operating efficiently at close to 30 c qiu et al 2019 several defluviicoccus distinct otus were reported wang et al 2020a at high abundances in a full scale simultaneous chemical phosphorus removal system although the authors seem to attribute the ebpr anaerobic chemical transformations to the aerobic stage of the process and vice versa in their small global survey of multiple samples from full scale plants nielsen et al 2019 showed that m glycogenica occurred at high abundances especially in plants in america and britain and was the most abundant gao globally closely followed by defluviicoccus all existing clades being most abundant in full scale plants in africa south africa and australasia and with the clones gao cpb s18 and ca competibacter less abundant the later large global survey of dueholm et al 2022 has added considerably to our knowledge of the biogeography of defluviicoccus in ebpr plants confirming many of the data from the smaller survey nielsen et al 2019 where its distribution varied considerably amongst different countries and continents as for example with ca d seviourii which was particularly abundant in malaysia poland south africa australia and portugal the reasons why are probably complex cells of the tetrad forming defluviicoccus are seen commonly in aerobic granules li et al 2020b liang et al 2022 pronk et al 2015 being embedded in excessive amounts of the exocellular capsular material they synthesize this material has been characterized by pronk et al 2017 for putative clade ii members which however failed to hybridize with the df 2 probe of meyer et al 2006 the major component is an alpha 1 4 acid soluble polymer consisting predominantly of glucose together with galactose residues with och3 residues attached to the glucose monomers extraction of dna from defluviicoccus tetrad cells is notoriously difficult ahn et al 2007 guo et al 2017 maszenan et al 2005 mcilroy et al 2009 and pronk et al 2017 have suggested that presence of this highly acidic polymer may explain why and maybe why defluviicoccus is not detected always in clone library amplicon sequences retrieved from activated sludge communities it may also provide a permeability barrier to fish probes reaching their target sites although dna extraction methods involving both physical and chemical disruption have been employed successfully to recover high quality defluviicoccus dna bessarab et al 2022 and pretreatment can render cells more permeable to them individually identified defluviicoccus member abundances have also been achieved using qpcr assays eg lu et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 2022 wang et al 2020b both have well documented limitations but fish probes can target single cells be applied together with other techniques like fish mar and fish raman microspectroiscopy providing information on their in situ physiology and revealing population morphology at a single cell level high defluviicoccus abundances have also been reported in denitrifying polycaprolactone supported solid phase communities yu et al 2021 and those of membrane bioreactors fed real wastewater silva et al 2016 and operating at long sludge retention times as well as in ceramic membrane bioreactors where ozonation was claimed to increase their relative abundance tang et al 2019 they have also been found in an up flow biological aerated filter treating petrochemical secondary effluent fu et al 2016 decreasing hydraulic retention times hrt in an sbr treating saline wastewater led to parallel decreases in its relative abundances wang et al 2015 however no detail on which clade s were affected in this manner was provided although zhang et al 2020b suggested defluviicoccus clade 1 and ii members were favoured somewhat surprisingly over ca competibacter at shorter hrt in a two sludge denitrifying p removal system conditions which also clearly advantaged ca accumulibacter over both gao again no clear explanation for such trends was provided 7 what operational conditions may affect the population sizes of defluviicoccus in wastewater treatment plants the 16s rrna based global survey of treatment plants involving 740 treatment plants in 425 cities in 31 countries on six continents dueholm et al 2022 holds a few surprises for example their data suggest the relative abundances of defluviicoccus putatively 24 species including ca d seviourii but with only small levels of diversity present in each plant sample were not restricted to ebpr plants but in fact increased in plants operating at higher temperatures with high industrial loads and designed to remove carbonaceous compounds only especially in south american and asian countries but also in tropical and dryer climates this review has already made it clear that defluviicoccus can also occur at high abundances in ebpr plants with alternating anaerobic aerobic zones and tu and schuler 2013 have listed the conditions favouring their selection in such plants these are i low ph 7 25 ii p limitation high c p ratio iii glucose addition iv extended sludge age some of these are dealt with here and others in sections 14 and 15 defluviicoccus grows especially well in media with high cod p ratio often at the expense of ca accumulibacter majed and gu 2020 song et al 2022 tayà et al 2013 wang et al 2012 wong and liu 2007 certainly wong and liu 2007 and wang et al 2021b now at 30 c were able to generate highly enriched cultures of the tetrad forming gao probably clade i defluviicoccus kong et al 2002 mcilroy et al 2011b using such operating parameters and the original defluviicoccus d vanust was isolated from an activated sludge treating a brewery wastewater high in complex polysaccharide substrates where similar conditions existed maszenan et al 2005 it is thought that under such p limiting conditions the ca accumulibacter pao can modify their metabolism to behave like gao using glycogen and not polyp as energy source for substrate uptake under anaerobic conditions ahn et al 2009 barat et al 2008 kolakovic et al 2021 kong et al 2002 muszyński et al 2015 tayà et al 2013 welles et al 2015 zhou et al 2008 majed and gu 2020 showed that when feed c p ratios increased ca accumulibacter relative abundances fell while those of ca competibacter increased but those of defluviicoccus clade ii did not these trends are different to those reported by kong et al 2002 with clade i defluviicoccus however no similar changes in community composition were seen by welles et al 2017 in response to changes in c p ratios raman micro spectroscopy majed and gu 2020 showed in individual cells of their ca accumulibacter a dramatic decrease in polyp levels and statistically significant increases in their intracellular phb and glycogen levels with increasing c p ratios a finding consistent with a diminishing reliance of polyp as an energy source under increasing conditions of p limitation a statistically significant increase in phb levels was seen anaerobically with both ca competibacter and defluviicoccus but any increases in their glycogen levels under aerobic conditions at increasing c p ratios were not statistically significant it has been suggested that having such a versatile metabolism enables ca accumulibacter to survive in full scale ebpr plants where the p loading is likely to be highly variable mcmahon et al 2010 welles et al 2017 the use of n limiting paper mill wastewater to enrich for defluviicoccus for subsequent production of novel phas has been discussed above in addition kiss et al 2011 mcilroy et al 2011a and onetto et al 2019 have reported that communities of plants with anaerobic zones treating winery wastewater again with elevated cod n p ratios regularly have high abundances of clades i iv defluviicoccus members especially in the non vintage periods of operation in fact onetto et al 2017 using fishnanosims demonstrated that controlled n supplementation was an effective strategy to control defluviicoccus clade ii domination in such plants low c n wastewater can modify markedly the mixed liquor microbiome zhang et al 2020a in the community of a coupled aerobic anoxic nitrous decomposition operation cando plant wang et al 2020b claimed that a short anaerobic phase selected a gao community where the abundance of defluviicoccus probably clade iv and ca competibacter both increased as the cod n of the reactor feed decreased a similar trend had been reported earlier by wang et al 2018 for an sbr aerobic granular sludge plant designed to remove both n and p and operating at high do levels where defluviicoccus clade unknown increased in abundance as pao abundances decreased in parallel with a falling cod n ratio wang et al 2020ab also suggested in their cando experiments that defluviicoccus clade iv was the dominant population in an n2o producing community although whether it was generating the n2o was not reported especially since members of this genus have been shown bessarab et al 2022 not to possess the gene complement for complete denitrification to dinitrogen as discussed in section 10 5 8 sensitivity of defluviicoccus to antibacterial agents in activated sludge plants there is increasing interest in the ecology of antibiotic resistant residue production and their potential threat to human health and it is now clear that activated sludge plants are major sources guo et al 2017 li et al 2020 evidence suggests that defluviicoccus populations clades not given are especially resistant in aerobic granular sludge systems in situ to antibiotics like the fluoroquinone enrofloxacin and the folate synthesis inhibitor sulfadiazine li et al 2020b however their resistance may not result solely from them possessing antibiotic resistant genes but instead by protection from acquiring these from other bacteria by horizontal gene transfer hgt in the presence of triclosan known to encourage hgt by their exocellular polysaccharide capsular material hu et al 2019 described earlier clearly more effort should be directed towards understanding the role of defluviicoccus in antibiotic resistance gene spread especially since lu et al 2020 produced evidence that defluviicoccus clade unknown found in reused water systems in china appeared to carry multiple antibiotic resistance genes to six commonly used antibiotics furthermore dai et al 2022 showed that the presence of polyvinyl microplastics to reactors fed acetate led to enhanced triclosan degradation and the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes decreased they also suggested that both ca competibacter and defluviicoccus again were the likely hosts for several mobile genetic elements and antibiotic resistance genes they detected clearly much is still to be understood about the importance of both these gao in the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment and the role of activated sludge chemicals in it neither defluviicoccus clade not given nor ca competibacter appeared to tolerate polyaluminium chloride pac at the levels used globally to control bulking and foaming filamentous bacteria like ca microthrix parvicella fan et al 2020 in activated sludge plants while ca accumulibacter relative abundances appeared not to be affected markedly wang et al 2020ba although the gao diversity was high no similar data were provided for micropruina or propionivibrio or whether members of the different defluviicoccus clades responded differentially to pac addition of chromium nanoparticles to an ebpr process appeared to enhance the relative abundance of a defluviicoccus population sun et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 which was held responsible for parallel increases in denitrification rates despite the general view examined in this review that most such populations are incapable of complete reduction of no3 no2 to n2 alternatively this apparent contradiction suggests again large differences may exist amongst individual strains 9 comparative genomics of defluviicoccus bessarab et al 2022 have published the whole genome sequences of eight defluviicoccus populations some of which had been published earlier and including those of defluviicoccus vanust and others from metagenomic studies all meet the mimag criteria bowers et al 2017 of a high quality genome as supported by checkm derived completeness and contamination values further details are given in bessarab et al 2022 the availability of these sequences bessarab et al 2022 nobu et al 2014 onetto et al 2019 wang et al 2014b has answered many of the uncertainties emerging from the early experimental data and increased substantially our understanding of the potential in situ biochemistry and physiology of members of increasing numbers of clades as detailed below they have also confirmed much but importantly not all of the earlier data generated experimentally burow et al 2008a burow et al 2008b wong and liu 2007 which form the basis of many metabolic gao defluviicoccus models lanham et al 2014 lopez vazquez et al 2009b oehmen et al 2010a oehmen et al 2007 oehmen et al 2010b oehmen et al 2006a oehmen et al 2006b such discrepancies in the defluviicoccus phenotypic genotypic characterization literature are now no surprise and may reflect diversities similar to those reported for ca accumulibacter kolakovic et al 2021 petriglieri et al 2022 and ca competibacter populations mcilroy et al 2014 regardless these trends emphasize again the risks in reaching genus embracing generalizations from data provided by individual strains they also emphasize again the need to ensure the precise identity using fish of which defluviicoccus population is under study especially if subsequent modelling is to be undertaken oehmen et al 2010a 10 the ecophysiology of defluviicoccus in activated sludge plants the reader is referred to bessarab et al 2022 for a more detailed discussion of this material furthermore a metabolic map fig 3 illustrates many of the features of the anaerobic metabolism of defluviicoccus discussed in this section 10 1 substrate uptake early fish mar studies showed that clade 1 and ii defluviicoccus assimilate a limited range of substrates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions burow et al 2007 burow et al 2008a burow et al 2008b wong and liu 2007 whole genome sequence analyses has revealed that all populations described by bessarab et al 2022 have genes for activation of both acetate acetyl coa synthetase and propionate propionyl coa synthetase bessarab et al 2022 but lack dedicated genes for propionate transport agreeing with burow et al 2008b who suggested both substrates shared a common transport system s cation acetate symporter actp they also claim that clade ii members alone could assimilate amino acids but all defluviicoccus genome sequence data show supplementary table 1 2 bessarab et al 2022 presence of genes encoding large numbers of abc and aapj transporters and thus possess an ability to assimilate a wide range of amino acids of the eight genome sequences analysed only defluviicoccus kalu maxac and defluviicoccus fred maxac 307 lack a gene s encoding a na glutamate symporter bessarab et al 2022 and all possess the liv encoding genes for transport of branched amino acids supplementary table 2 the data of wong and liu 2007 agree with most of these experimental results burow et al 2008a burow et al 2008b except that they could not detect experimentally anaerobic glucose uptake in their d vanus t population except when d vanus was grown under an anaerobic aerobic alternating regime wong and liu 2007 comparative analyses of the eight defluviicoccus genomes bessarab et al 2022 showed only d vanus ca d tetraformis defluviicoccus sp ssa4 ca d seviourii and defluviicoccus fred maxac 378 possess a single gene copy of a glucose mannose transporter supplementary table 2 bessarab et al 2022 it was not identified in genomes of defluviicoccus gao hk or defluviicoccus kalu maxac which instead possess one or more copies of a na glucose symporter gene supplementary table 3 bessarab et al 2022 therefore it seems likely that potentially these can all assimilate glucose while defluviicoccus fred maxac 307 may not whether these genes are expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions is unclear interestingly d vanust was isolated under aerobic conditions originally on glucose as the carbon source maszenan et al 2005 albeit with a very slow growth rate yet schroeder et al 2008 failed to show by fish mar any glucose uptake by their clade ii defluviicoccus strain under continuous aerobic conditions further experiments using larger numbers of strains are required to clarify these uncertainties 10 2 mechanisms for anaerobic and aerobic substrate uptake inhibitor and ionophore studies similar to those used by burow et al 2009 for elucidating central metabolic pathways in defluviicoccus see below were adapted to help resolve their substrate active transport systems under alternating aerobic and anaerobic conditions burow et al 2008a burow et al 2008b highly enriched cultures 81 85 of total of clade 1 defluviicoccus were used and an assumption made that the data generated were considered to reflect its ecophysiology alone under anaerobic conditions acetate uptake rates fell markedly in the presence of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m chlorophenylhydrazone cccp and dinitrophenyl both uncouplers of the proton motive force pmf similarly monensin known to disrupt the na trans membrane gradient also reduced acetate uptake rates these data were interpreted as being consistent with acetate assimilation depending on both a pmf and a na potential with the former the main contributor burow et al 2008a burow et al 2008b burow et al 2008b also looked at how this pmf might be established under anaerobic conditions in defluviicoccus clade 1 they showed n n dicyclohexylcarbodiimide an inhibitor of atpases had no effect on acetate uptake rates and hence proposed that fi f0 atpases played no role in pmf establishment there instead as inhibition of fumarate reductase led to acetate uptake rates falling markedly they proposed that the pmf in their defluviicoccus was established by h efflux coupled to electron transport linked fumarate reduction this system is known to exist in ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 saunders et al 2007 which also possess the atpase pmf system seen in the ca accumulibacter pao zhou et al 2010 genes encoding a fumarate reductase are present in genomes of all sequenced defluviicoccus members bessarab et al 2022 alternatively burow et al 2008a and burow et al 2008b suggested that this anaerobic pmf may also be generated by extrusion of methylmalonyl coa decarboxylation linked efflux of na across the cell membrane and homologous genes have since been detected in ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 but not in ca accumulibacter the same systems probably exist in those defluviicoccus strains whose genomes contain the key genes encoding of propionyl co a carboxylase and methylmalonyl coa decarboxylase bessarab et al 2022 which are in all except the defluviicoccus fred maxac 148 genome although their individual copy numbers and those of most other genes vary considerably bessarab et al 2022 table 3 acetate uptake rates were determined to be lower in their defluviicoccus than in ca accumulibacter reflecting differences in the relative activities of their acetate permeases or in their substrate affinities burow et al 2008b and this seems to be the case for all defluviicoccus examined for substrate preferences mcmahon et al 2010 10 3 carbon metabolism burow et al 2008a burow et al 2009 and burow et al 2008b were amongst the first to determine experimentally the in situ metabolic pathways involved in anaerobic carbon catabolism in defluviicoccus clade 1 populations in activated sludge using the same approach already described with a highly enriched gao culture and fish mar together with metabolic inhibitors they showed evidence for the presence of an anaerobic glycolysis pathway for glycogen catabolism as suggested in early generic models for gaos dai et al 2007a filipe et al 2001b lopez vazquez et al 2009a lopez vazquez et al 2009b oehmen et al 2010a oehmen et al 2007 oehmen et al 2010b and an anaerobic functional glyoxylate pathway furthermore anaerobic stored glycogen degradation was thought to involve the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway which in the absence of polyp stores is considered the major source of energy for gao anaerobic substrate transport mcmahon et al 2010 the view now is that to balance the gao cell redox the excess reducing power generated from glycogen catabolism was consumed by the functioning of the reductive tricarboxylic acid tca cycle where fumarate reductase reduces fumarate to succinate and the subsequent succinate propionate methylmalonyl coa pathway then leads to increased production of propionyl coa oehmen et al 2007 this latter cycle is known to supply precursors for the methylmalonyl coa pathway leading to the synthesis of 3 polyhydroxyvalerate and 3 hydroxy 2 methylvalerate which is produced in much higher amounts in defluviicoccus grown on propionate than on acetate with 3 hydroxybutyrate and 3 hydroxyvalerate or in ca accumulibacter which lack the or succinate propionate methylmalonyl coa pathway oehmen et al 2010a oehmen et al 2007 bessarab et al 2022 showed from comparative genomic analyses that these same reductive tca pathways are probably functional in all defluviicoccus members including those from previously recognized clades nobu et al 2014 onetto et al 2019 wang et al 2014b genes encoding the same tca and succinate propionate pathways for polyhydroxyvalerate production have since been shown in a ca c denitrificans strain mcilroy et al 2014 earlier genomic studies showed both clade ii defluviicoccus gaohk wang et al 2014b and clade 1 ca defluviicoccus tetraformis nobu et al 2014 possessed the genes for the emp tca and glyoxylate pathways although genes encoding enzymes involved in the emp glycolysis and tca cycle were also present in clade iii ca d seviourii those encoding enzymes for the anaplerotic glyoxylate pathway for acetate catabolism could not be detected onetto et al 2019 despite burow et al 2009 suggesting they were present in their defluviicoccus instead ca d seviourii possessed the alternative anaplerotic ethylmalonyl coa pathway also found in the competibacteriacae oehmen et al 2010b enabling it to grow on acetate several genes involved in the ethylmalonyl coa pathway are present in the genome sequences of all the defluviicoccus populations bessarab et al 2022 whose genomes have been re examined and again their individual copy numbers varied between them bessarab et al 2022 table 3 contradicting some of the earlier genomic studies by nobu et al 2014 and wang et al 2014b 10 4 biosynthesis of storage materials glycogen recycling occurring during the cyclical anaerobic aerobic conditions operative in ebpr bioprocesses defines the gao phenotype bessarab et al 2022 thus as discussed above anaerobic glycogen degradation is thought to be the source of reducing equivalents for synthesis of intracellular pha synthesized from both carbon substrates assimilated in the anaerobic feed phase and from organic acids derived from catabolism of glycogen or fermentation of metabolic products liu et al 2019 wang et al 2021a then subsequent aerobic degradation of pha in the aerobic phase provides substrates for glycogen synthesis through gluconeogenesis all the defluvicoccus genomes examined contain genes encoding a complete pathway for glycogen synthesis bessarab et al 2022 equally the genes encoding the pathway for glycogen degradation via the emp pathway were present in all defluviicoccus genomes bessarab et al 2022 but those encoding the entner doudoroff pathway were not seen in any although mcilroy et al 2014 detected these in ca competibacter denitrificans where their function there was unclear the d vanus t genome contains genes encoding the enzymes involved in synthesis of the monomers phb and phv from acyl coa compounds derived from acetate and propionate metabolism respectively bessarab et al 2022 these are namely phab for pha synthesis from acetyl coa and fabf and fabg for pha synthesis from propionyl coa and most likely butyryl co a no phaa genes were found in any of these genomes all others except ca d tetraformis also possess the genes fabg and phaj for pathways for alternate pha monomer synthesis related to fatty acid metabolism genes for the two pha synthases phac and phae respectively were also identified in the genomes of all the other defluviicoccus together with the phaz gene encoding a pha depolymerase for aerobic pha catabolism except that ca d seviourii lacks the phab gene gene copies of these vary between genomes table 3 aerobic catabolic degradation of pha most probably proceeds through conversion of 3 hydroxybutyrate coa to acetoacetyl coa via crotonyl coa where the acetyl coa then enters central metabolism with glycogen formation occurring by the gluconeogenesis pathway as above all defluviicoccus genomes contain genes essential for polyphosphate synthesis and degradation although some differences in their individual copy numbers were seen bessarab et al 2022 table 3 thus none of phop phoq phod phoc and phoh were present in d vanust while ca d tetraformis had phop and phod defluviicoccus gaohk lacked phod and phoh and ca d seviourii possessed only phoq defluviicoccus maxac 307 and maxac 378 both lacked phoc and phod while defluviicoccus maxac 148 like d vanust lacked all these genes none of the genomes contained pap genes encoding polyphosphate amp phosphotransferase suggesting this alternative pathway for polyp synthesis is absent in the defluviicoccus gao bessarab et al 2022 while the gene encoding a high affinity phosphate transport system pst was found in all genomes the pit gene encoding the low affinity phosphate transporter whose presence has been argued to be a possible inclusive determinant of the pao phenotype stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 was detected bessarab et al 2022 but only in defluviicoccus maxac 307 and defluviicoccus gaohk previously noted by y wang et al 2014 how homologous it is to the pao pit or how its expression is regulated and what its role might be in these defluviicoccus strains is not known but clearly its assessment as being a distinguishing feature exclusive to the pao genotype needs reexamination 10 5 nitrogen metabolism because of its frequent high abundances in ebpr plants much effort has been directed to see whether defluviicoccus can carry out anaerobic respiration denitrification by reducing no3 sequentially via no2 n2o and no to dinitrogen gas in plant anoxic zones and hence contribute to n removal although strong evidence suggests that some members of the pao ca accumulibacter and tetrasphaera spp as well as ca c denitrificans subgroup 6 can denitrify all the way to dinitrogen flowers et al 2013 kong et al 2006 marques et al 2017 mcilroy et al 2014 little persuasive data exist for such an ability for members of the different clades of defluviicoccus nielsen et al 2019 although they are assumed in some studies to carry out denitrification eg chen et al 2021 this is despite claims based on indirect evidence that clade iv members appeared to reduce no2 to n2o wang et al 2020b what is generally accepted now from different experimental approaches including whole genome sequence data bessarab et al 2022 nobu et al 2014 onetto et al 2019 wang et al 2014b is that they may reduce denitrify no3 to no2 but no further wang et al 2008a with clade i wang et al 2020b wang et al 2019 with clade iv however their ability to generate no2 may assist other populations including the denitrifying ca accumulibacter ribera guardia et al 2016 rubio rincón et al 2017 tian et al 2017 wang et al 2019 to grow under anoxic conditions and hence play an indirect role in enhancing n and indirectly p removal in activated sludge plants wang et al 2008b the presence of no3 no2 in the anaerobic feed zone is thought to reduce ebpr capacity by allowing the denitrifying bacteria to use these as electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration of readily metabolizable cod and hence reduce substrates otherwise available to the pao seviour et al 2003 evidence suggests that presence of nitrite can reduce defluviicoccus clades i and ii abundances and consequently enrich ca accumulibacter in a propionate fed anaerobic anoxic nitrite system tayà et al 2013 thus providing a potential means of defluviicoccus elimination in ebpr plants see earlier whether this strategy is realistic on an industrial scale for gao control is unclear since earlier ye et al 2010 suggested nitrite could act in the opposite way thus providing ca c denitrificans subgroup 6 the only competibacteriaceae known to fully denitrify mcilroy et al 2014 with an advantage over the pao ca accumulibacter community again inter and intra clade differences may explain such inconsistencies all defluviicoccus genomes have the nifdhk operon for fixation of atmospheric n bessarab et al 2022 while the vnfdgk operon is seen in only a few members bessarab et al 2022 a trait considered to be a valuable adaptation under the n limiting conditions found in many industrial treatment plants eg onetto et al 2019 but probably not those treating domestic wastes where n is usually plentiful in the form of urea ca c denitrificans has no such ability mcilroy et al 2014 although the nifdhk operon was detected in the clade iia uw 1 genome of ca accumulibacter clade ii members flowers et al 2013 the nifdhk operon contains the nifk nifd nifh and nif k genes where nifk encodes for the β subunit of component 1 of nitrogenase the vnfdgk operon located downstream of the nifdhk operon allows independent operon expression bessarab et al 2022 whether these n fixation encoding genes are expressed under such n limiting conditions is not known all also possess the genes for urease transport and hydrolysis bessarab et al 2022 but not all appear to have the capacity for assimilatory no3 reduction suggesting they may not grow on nitrate as sole n source as seems to be the ability of ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 thus although some defluviicoccus members have been reported to possess the gene encoding an assimilatory nitrate reductase nobu et al 2014 onetto et al 2019 wang et al 2014b not all the defluviicoccus genomes analysed by bessarab et al 2022 including those listed above did 11 competition between defluviicoccus and other gao in activated sludge basic differences in their in situ ecophysiology little data have been published exploring the co existence of defluviicoccus with the gao ca p alborgensis or m glycogenica or how they might compete with each other in ebpr systems oehmen et al 2010a qiu et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 wang et al 2021b a comment especially pertinent to ca p aalborgensis which shares the same anaerobic phenotype with defluviicoccus albertsen et al 2016 few attempts have been made to see if defluviicoccus populations from different clades might also compete with each other meyer et al 2006 schroeder et al 2008 wong and liu 2007 dueholm et al 2022 have revealed that all these gao are found widely in plants around the world but with strikingly different distributions however while ca c denitrificans and defluviicoccus may be mutually exclusive in some communities carvalheira et al 2014 dueholm et al 2022 hossain et al 2022 muszyński and miłobędzka 2015 ong et al 2014 tu and schuler 2013 weissbrodt et al 2013 wong et al 2004 wong and liu 2007 in others both can occur together each often at high relative abundances eg dueholm et al 2022 majed and gu 2020 in some published studies where ca competibacter were present no reported attempt was made to see whether defluviicoccus gao might also have been there rubio rincón et al 2017 welles et al 2015 furthermore as pointed out above in many modelling papers neither was identified but instead see earlier both were often referred to collectively as the gao eg filipe et al 2001a 2001b 2001c mao et al 2016 zheng et al 2002 despite them having fundamentally different ecophysiologies as outlined above bessarab et al 2022 burow et al 2008a burow et al 2009 burow et al 2008b mcilroy et al 2014 consequently it is not surprising that they do not always co exist eg begum and batista 2014 carvalheira et al 2014 muszyński and miłobędzka 2015 suggesting each may occupy a separate niche s certainly several global surveys have shown that treatment plants in some countries lack one but not the other eg kong et al 2006 wong and liu 2007 one documented striking difference is their anaerobic behaviour in response to different carbon feed sources thus d vanus can assimilate both acetate and propionate meyer et al 2006 at relatively high uptake rates with the latter more rapidly assimilated and the preferred substrate when both are available carvalheira et al 2014 dai et al 2007a oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2006b pijuan et al 2004a b yet while the uptake rate of acetate in ca c denitrificans is similar to that of defluviicoccus propionate is hardly if at all assimilated dai et al 2007a oehmen et al 2010a oehmen et al 2010b oehmen et al 2004 oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b pijuan et al 2004b wang et al 2014a zhang et al 2021 the resultant phas synthesized differ with the substrate used with poly ß hydroxybutyrate phb and poly ß hydroxyvalerate phv produced from acetate by both and poly ß 2 methylvalerate ph2mv from propionate but only in defluviicoccus dai et al 2007a lopez vazquez et al 2009a lopez vazquez et al 2009b oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2005c despite burow et al 2008a showing by fish mar that butyrate was not assimilated by their population of defluviicoccus begum and batista 2014 provided fish data suggesting that butyrate as sole anaerobic carbon source seemed to favour clade i defluviicoccus the only clade looked for over ca competibacter thus after week 10 while defluviicoccus relative abundance had doubled while that of ca competibacter was halved similar selective trends of butyrate were reported by oehmen et al 2005b but now where ebpr capacity also fell and with no corresponding changes in defluviicoccus abundance it seems clear now for d vanust at least that it can assimilate both butyrate and isobutyrate albeit at slower rates than acetate and propionate wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b wang et al 2020b furthermore as mentioned above only ca c denitrificans subgroup 6 of the 7 known can fully denitrify kong et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2014 oehmen et al 2010a which would provide them with an advantage over defluviicoccus under anoxic conditions while subgroups 1 4 and 5 reduce nitrate to nitrite and subgroups 3 and 7 possess no denitrifying abilities unlike defluviicoccus bessarab et al 2022 none has any ability to fix atmospheric n2 mcilroy et al 2014 whether its exclusive possession of the ed pathway is advantageous to ca c denitrificans in activated sludge is unclear when wong and liu 2007 followed gao successional changes in an acetate fed anaerobic aerobic membrane reactor with no p removal using fish analyses they showed that ca competibacter were the dominant gao present initially then after 85 days the gao population had switched to one wholly dominated by defluviicoccus a shift thought to arise from the reactor running with long hydraulic retention time and sludge age however it seems equally likely that defluviicoccus may have out competed ca competibacter eventually for acetate in the feed because of low dissolved oxygen conditions dai et al 2007a zhang et al 2020c 12 competition between defluviicoccus and the pao in activated sludge much has been published in attempts to explain how defluviicoccus might out compete ca accumulibacter leading to a reduction in ebpr capacity despite considerable data raising concerns as to whether this always happens qiu et al 2019 little has been published exploring whether the other pao might be equally vulnerable to defluviicoccus or ca competibacter or the impact the gao ca p aalbergensis or m glycogenica might have on ebpr capacity both have been detected at high abundances in plants globally with ca p aalborgensis especially common in many plants in europe dueholm et al 2022 and m glycogenica abundant in plants in denmark australia and northern america both defluviicoccus clade i ii and iii members and m glycogenica were present at high abundances in treatment plants in malaysia and in an ebpr plant in singapore operating at 30 c together with ca p aalborgensis qiu et al 2019 because of similarities in their anaerobic behaviour it seems feasible that m glycogenica could compete with the tetrasphaera pao for substrates in this feed stage mcilroy et al 2018 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 and hence reduce ebpr capacity in plants where both are present in high abundances yet this possibility has not been explored all the published data deal with the many operational factors thought to alter the balance between competibacteriaceae and defluviicoccus and ca accumulibacter leading to reduction in ebpr capacities little attention has been paid to seeing whether such outcomes are independent of clade membership or occur only with interactions between members of particular clades usually not mentioned of each of these if the latter it might explain why there is considerable disagreement in the literature of the extent of negative impact on ebpr capacity by these gao see earlier equally how relative abundances of each clade is affected by plant operational conditions has not been examined extensively as it has in ca accumulibacter 13 nature of carbon source in the feed one important parameter determining the outcome of competition between defluviicoccus and ca accumulibacter is the carbon source available to them in the anaerobic feed stage shen and zhou 2016 in the data of oehmen and colleagues oehmen et al 2004 oehmen et al 2006a oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2006b oehmen et al 2005c and in general confirmed subsequently by others lopez vazquez et al 2009a lopez vazquez et al 2009b whether acetate and propionate the two most common vfa in activated sludge mixed liquor present in the feed chen et al 2013 lu et al 2006 can determine their relative abundances and hence subsequent ebpr stability and capacity shen and zhou 2016 the possible influence of feed substrate on competition between defluviicoccus and ca competibacter was considered above but whether the same relationships exist between all other pao and gao members is not known briefly oehmen et al 2006a 2005a 2005b 2006b 2005c have reported that while ca accumulibacter could take up acetate and propionate at similar rates but in both cases faster than defluviicoccus then referred to as alphaproteobacterial gao ca competibacter had a similar rate for acetate uptake but a negligible rate for propionate assimilation see above on the other hand deluviicoccus assimilated propionate as its preferred substrate dai et al 2007a possibly because less energy from glycogen metabolism is needed to transport propionate and at a similar rate to ca accumulibacter but took up acetate at only about half that of ca accumulibacter however not all the published substrate utilization data support these differences again probably because of inter and intraclade differences between the gao and pao populations studied and often incomplete identification data for example dai et al 2007b obtained a highly enriched community of cluster 1 defluviicoccus which had out competed ca competibacter for the acetate in the feed although it seems likely as expressed above that defluviicoccus might have been favored at the low dissolved oxygen levels present wang et al 2020b have also suggested that anaerobic glycogen synthesis occurs with a propionate feed in ca accumulibacter and zhang et al 2020c confirmed that high acetate levels may in some cases favour defluviicoccus over ca accumulibacter importantly unlike both defluviicoccus and ca competibacter there was no delay in acetate and propionate assimilation rates by ca accumulibacter when these were switched in the feed thus defluviicoccus was less competitive with a propionate feed after exposure to acetate lu et al 2006 than ca accumulibacter oehmen et al 2006a 2005a 2006b have suggested that regularly alternating the feed substrate between acetate to propionate would be an elegant way of controlling the abundances of both these gao while this strategy has been shown to work at lab scale chen et al 2005 chen et al 2004 lu et al 2006 oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2005c its feasibility for gao control in full scale ebpr plants has received little attention thomas et al 2003 tu and schuler 2013 have questioned the direct role of substrate in defluviicoccus ca accumulibacter competition which does not always occur see earlier they proposed that the feed concentrations of acetate were crucially important as suggested earlier by burow et al 2008b they argued that most of the studies carried out rely on data from laboratory scale reactors which generally operate with much higher acetate levels than those found in full scale ebpr plants and from fish data showed that the relative abundances of ca accumulibacter were much higher when lower acetate levels were used however this outcome was ph dependant as detailed below evidence burow et al 2007a maszenan et al 2005 wong and liu 2007 has suggested that d vanus in situ and in pure culture can assimilates glucose see above while ca acumulibacter is unable to directly both however may ferment glucose and assimilate the fermentation products possibly explaining findings of oehmen et al 2005b and wang et al 2010 who both claimed that presence of glucose led to an increase in ca competibacter abundance the same situation may exist with butyrate assimilation with it being first fermented to acetate or propionate wang et al 2021b although as mentioned already shen and zhou 2016 and wang et al wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b wang et al 2020b have suggested that d vanus and other clade i and il members can assimilate both butyrate and isobutyrate at 30 c albeit less rapidly that acetate and propionate furthermore d vanus seems able to assimilate a wider range of substrates anaerobically than either making it more competitive in plants treating industrial wastes industrial but see earlier where such diversity exists burow et al 2007a kong et al 2006 oehmen et al 2006a oehmen et al 2006b however genome sequence data bessarab et al 2022 clearly suggest that considerable differences exist amongst defluviicoccus clade members in their substrate utilization patterns 14 culture ph and temperature it is clear from the literature that ph can play an important role in influencing the relative abundances of the ca accumulibacter and defluviicoccus and ca competibacter in ebpr plants although the basis for such competition are probably complex there is considerable support for the suggestion that stable ebpr performance and high ca accumulibacter abundances occur at ph 7 25 oehmen et al 2007 oehmen et al 2005b while at lower ph the gao appear to have the competitive advantage whether this trend applies to all pao and gao populations is yet to be clarified thus in an acetate fed reactor run at ph 7 ebpr capacity was low and ca competibacter dominated the community its abundance then decreased markedly after a shift to ph 8 but with no accompanying large increase in ca accumulibacter abundance the same trends were seen with propionate and defluviicoccus oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2005c but now ca accumulibacter abundances increased at the higher ph this led oehmen et al 2005b to suggest that ca accumulibacter competed more effectively with the defluviicoccus for propionate assimilation than with ca competibacter for acetate uptake probably because of a faster propionate transport system corresponding analyses indicated that glycogen hydrolysis was reduced in both these gao at the higher ph it was proposed that running ebpr plants at high ph may be a suitable strategy to maximise ca accumulibacter activity oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2005c and minimise the impact of defluviicoccus although it is not known whether this strategy has been implemented at any large scale ebpr facility in later papers lopez vazquez et al 2009a lopez vazquez et al 2009b possible interactions between carbon source ph and temperature were examined they used feeds containing different acetate propionate ratios and showed that at low temperatures 10 c ca accumulibacter dominated only if acetate and propionate were added simultaneously but not when added separately unless the ph was 7 5 or above at the higher temperature 30 c the gao dominated although confusingly by this they meant exclusively ca competibacter and defluviicoccus was not considered they showed that addition of acetate propionate 75 25 and 50 50 changed the community so that now ca accumulibacter dominated but only at low temperature 10 c regardless of ph however with the 75 25 acetate propionate ratio ca accumulibacter still dominated but only at ph 7 and 7 5 and with the 50 50 ratio only at 30 c and ph 7 5 their conclusions were that at low temperature 10 c the gao ie ca competibacter were disadvantaged while ebpr capacity was stable while this outcome supports the general view that lower temperatures favour high ebpr capacity which often declines during summer gu et al 2008 it is clear that the impact of temperature on ebpr and outcomes of competition between the pao and ca competibacter gao is complex thus until recently little data had been published on possible impacts of operating temperature on ebpr with defluviicoccus however shen et al 2017 did establish a multi cycle ebpr system running more stably with acetate than propionate at 30 c they showed with fish that defluviicoccus abundances clades i and ii fell gradually at 30 c even with a propionate feed while those of ca competibacter gao and ca accumulibacter clade iic were largely unaffected thus their data suggested that defluviicoccus may not be as competitive at 30 c as was once assumed later wang et al 2021b confirmed that stable ebpr was achievable with acetate propionate and butyrate feeds and for d vanus t at least that its acetate and propionate uptake rates at 30 c were substantially lower than those for ca accumulibacter confirming that unlike ca competibacter it was actually selectively disadvantaged at higher temperatures they also showed that the growth kinetics of d vanus t were markedly different to those of ca competibacter this example serves again to emphasise the need for precise phylogenetic identification of which gao is under discussion thus the once widely held view that ebpr capacity in plants fell sharply at temperatures above 25 c because the pao were outcompeted by the gao lopez vazquez et al 2009a lopez vazquez et al 2009b weissbrodt et al 2013 no longer holds true universally how ca p aalborensis and m glycogenica might respond in similar circumstances is unknown it is now clear that lab scale and full scale ebpr systems can in fact operate stably at the elevated wastewater temperatures of c a 30 c or higher these plant conditions prevail in tropical countries like malaysia and singapore law et al 2016 ong et al 2014 poh et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 poh et al 2021 have shown showed that ebpr capacity was stable long term at 30 c and stability could be maintained at 35 c for 2 days it was only at 40 c that the process failed no defluviicoccus were detected by fish although not unexpectedly see above the ca competibacter abundance increased with increases in temperature in both the poh et al 2021 and ong et al 2014 studies yet all three full scale ebpr plants in singapore examined by qiu et al 2019 operated effectively with highly diverse gao and pao communities which differed markedly for each suggesting that those organisms commonly seen dominating temperate ebpr plants can thrive at the higher temperatures under some circumstances qiu et al 2019 qiu et al 2022 in all three plants examined the ca acumulibacter were predominantly type ii b and c clade members both often found in tropical plants together with tetrasphaera populations both ca competibacter and defluviicoccus strains were also present in all three plants albeit at low abundances except for ca d seviourii as were both ca propionivibrio aalborgensis and micropruina glycogenica the recognition of nine defluviicoccus otus there suggests that in contrast to the data of wang et al 2021b such tropical systems appear to harbour temperature tolerant defluviicoccus populations and these have since been further studied qiu et al 2022 two sbr systems one at 30 c and the other at 35 c were run concurrently while defluviicoccus was lower in abundance than the ca competibacter community embracing several previously undetected strains their communities were dominated again in both reactors by the filamentous ca defluviicoccus seviourii making short appearance see below which coincided with decreases in ebpr capacities were cluster ii tetrad forms and cocci organized into clusters qiu et al 2022 it was suggested that these tetrad defluviicoccus were unable to compete with ca accumulibacter populations under the imposed conditions of low substrate concentrations because of low uptake rates of acetate and propionate while ca defluviicoccus seviourii did these rate differences may reflect surface area cell volume differences between them or it seems possible that presence of exocellular capsular material diagnostic of the tetrad morphology not seen with the filamentous ca d seviourii may impeded substrate uptake 15 substrate concentrations as mentioned above tu schuler 2013 showed that the ca accumulibacter were advantaged over the gao when acetate concentrations were kept low they exposed their ebpr sbr communities to the following conditions to attempt to explain why with the following experiments with high ph 7 4 8 4 and rapid 10 min acetate addition ensuring initial high concentration in anaerobic feed ca accumulibacter were present in high abundances 82 of total eub positive cells but no ca competibacter or cluster i defluviicoccus were seen by fish although small numbers of defluviicoccus cluster ii 4 were present when the ph was decreased 6 4 7 0 no ca accumulibacter or ca competibacter were detected instead the community was dominated by cluster i and cluster ii defluviicoccus 21 and 33 respectively at low ph 6 4 7 and slow acetate addition ensuring a low acetate concentration under anaerobic feed about 77 of the total community were ca accumulibacter with both ca competibacter and defluviicoccus now undetectable or at very low levels when this experiment was repeated with rapid acetate addition defluviicoccus cluster ii dominated 31 but neither ca competibacter nor ca accumulibacter were seen on the basis of these data tu schuler 2013 proposed that defluviicoccus had a competitive advantage at low ph but only at high acetate levels in the reactor since with slow acetate addition low concentrations ca accumulibacter dominated suggesting the former behaved as r strategists while the latter adopted a k strategy at low ph but an r strategy at higher ph their other convincing contribution was the suggestion as to why ebpr failed at low ph was not the result of defluviicoccus competing directly with ca accumulibacter for acetate but instead their population abundances increased only after ca accumulibacter had disappeared as a result of its sensitivity to low ph and so acetate was then available solely to defluviicoccus they concluded that while less commonly reported in full scale ebpr plants earlier lab scale experiments may have overstated the practical importance of defluviicoccus ca accumulibacter competition and subsequent ebpr failure at low ph further studies are required to see if interactions between other gao pao follow the same patterns 16 defluviicoccus systematics it is clear that our present understanding of the systematics and biodiversity of members of this genus is far from complete for example dueholm et al 2022 retrieved 16s rrna amplicons for what they adjudged to be 18 defluviicoccus species not currently recorded in the midas 4 database especially from plants in china whether these were members of the five clades currently recognized or of additional clades was not made clear there has been considerable discussion on where members of the genus defluviicoccus should be classified and whether they should remain as members of the family rhodospirillaceae onetto et al 2019 average nucleotide identity ani comparisons between all pairs of the eight available defluviicoccus genomes bessarab et al 2022 were within the range 76 80 consistent with each being a distinct species within a single genus according to interpretations of jain et al 2018 analyses of the ca d seviourii genome led onetto et al 2019 to suggest with that it should be removed from this family and instead reclassified into a candidate family 2 12 full 67 15 a decision based on the genome taxonomy database gtdb systematics parks et al 2020 in a subsequent re examination of members of the alphaproteobacteria based on 16s rrna gene sequences hördt et al 2020 proposed that members of this genus are best placed within the family geminicoccaceae in the rhodospirillales but with the caveat that defluviicoccus may be assigned to its own family if sufficient evidence became available from additional whole genome data since provided by bessarab et al 2022 they examined the proposal by hördt et al 2020 more closely where the suggestion was that both defluviicoccus and tistrella should be removed from the rhodospirillaceae and placed together within the geminicoccaceae comparison of per group proportion nucleotide identity pni statistics led them to suggest that pni differences between defluviicoccus and tistrella were consistent with these two genera being related at either intra family or intra order level but inconsistent with them both belonging to the family geminicoccaceae as proposed by hördt et al 2020 based on these data their proposal was that members of the genus defluviicoccus are probably best considered as a separate family defluviicoccaceae within the order rhodospirillales clearly genome sequence data from more strains of this and other closely related groups like tistrella are needed 16 conclusions this publication has attempted a critical and comprehensive review of the glycogen accumulating bacteria defluviicoccus it is clear from the literature that in many cases where its precise identification has not been resolved much confusion persists about its in situ ecology and physiology and assumptions and generalizations especially in the earlier studies that all gao behave the same and more importantly that all the defluviicoccus populations have the same phenotypic properties need serious attention only those studies using fish analyses or who use the full length 16s rrna amplicon sequencing protocol of dueholm et al 2020 can reveal their phylogenetic affiliations consequently in many reports no consideration is given to the probability that both inter and intra clade differences exist amongst individual members as have now been documented for most of the pao and ca competibacter it is now clear from the little genome sequence data available that the genus defluviicoccus embraces a highly diverse group of organisms and there is still much to learn about them the hope is that this review will persuade others to look more closely at this fascinating group of organisms whether their genome sequence data will provide clues as to how we might recover more of these in pure culture remains to be seen although the advantages of having axenic cultures are many for example these instead of enriched populations could be used to understand in situ physiology under different operational conditions and the generation and analysis of genome sequence data would be less equivocal than in the case of metagenome assembled genomes it would also be much easier to elucidate which factors affect regulation of synthesis and activity of key gao enzymes using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches these organisms deserve such close attention declaration of

15707,this comprehensive review looks critically what is known about members of the genus defluviicoccus an example of a glycogen accumulating organism gao in wastewater treatment plants but found also in other habitats it considers the operating conditions thought to affect its performance in activated sludge plants designed to remove phosphorus microbiologically including the still controversial view that it competes with the polyphosphate accumulating bacterium ca accumulibacter for readily biodegradable substrates in the anaerobic zone receiving the influent raw sewage it looks at its present phylogeny and what is known about it s physiology and biochemistry under the highly selective conditions of these plants where the biomass is recycled continuously through alternative anaerobic feed aerobic famine conditions encountered there the impact of whole genome sequence data which have revealed considerable intra and interclade genotypic diversity on our understanding of its in situ behaviour is also addressed particular attention is paid to the problems in much of the literature data based on clone library and next generation dna sequencing data where defluviicoccus identification is restricted to genus level only equally problematic in many publications no attempt has been made to distinguish between defluviicoccus and the other known gao especially ca competibacter which as shown here has a very different ecophysiology the impact this has had and continues to have on our understanding of members of this genus is discussed as is the present controversy over its taxonomy it also suggests where research should be directed to answer some of the important research questions raised in this review graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords defluviicoccus glycogen accumulating organisms ca competibacter phosphate accumulating organisms ca accumulibacter enhanced biological phosphorus removal activated sludge 1 introduction despite being first described in 2005 maszenan et al 2005 and ordered subsequently into several clades surprisingly little interest has been shown more recently in defluviicoccus compared for example to the interest in the gao ca competibacter or the polyphosphate accumulating organism ca accumulibacter with which it interacts in wastewater treatment plants this review is an attempt to fill some of these gaps 2 the genus defluviicoccus in 2005 maszenan et al reported the isolation by micromanipulation of a slow growing gram negative coccus appearing in tetrads of cocci from an activated sludge plant treating mainly brewery waste in pilsen in the czech republic this morphotype is seen commonly in wastewater treatment plants and embraces a phylogenetic and physiologically wide diversity of bacteria as detailed by seviour et al 2000 and so by itself a tetrad morphology fig 1 has limited identification value 16s rrna sequencing and phenotypic analysis including chemotaxonomy showed this isolate named defluviicoccus vanus was a previously undescribed member of the subgroup 1 alphaproteobacteria in the family rhodospirillaceae fig 2 since then it has become clear that based on 16s rrna sequence data the genus defluviicoccus embraces several phylogenetic groups conveniently referred to as clades or clusters fig 2 so d vanus is a clade i member members of clade i and clade ii defluviicoccus were first recognized in clone libraries of 16s rrna gene sequences retrieved from wastewater treatment plants by mcilroy and seviour 2009 wong et al 2004 meyer et al 2006 and burow et al 2007a or from fish analyses oehmen et al 2006a 2006b these include the clade i ca defluviicoccus tetraformis strain tf071 nobu et al 2014 while defluviicoccus strain gaohk meyer et al 2006 wang et al 2014b emerged as a member of clade ii members of both clades share the tetrad cell arrangement although individual cell sizes can vary burow et al 2007a schroeder et al 2008 while those in clade iii are strikingly different morphologically originally recognized as an uncultured alphaproteobacterial filamentous gram negative nostocoida limicola morphotype blackall et al 2000 in wastewater treatment plants and given the name candidatus monilibacter batavus levantesi et al 2004 it was shown later nittami et al 2009 to be a member of defluviicoccus clade iii based on its 16s rrna sequence fig 2 and has since been named candidatus defluviicoccus seviourii onetto et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 have reported a filamentous defluviicoccus hybridizing with fish probes designed to target cluster ii members although whether it possessed the nostocoida limicola ii morphotype was not discussed in 2009 mcilroy and seviour found a 16s rrna sequence in a clone library from a wastewater treatment plant whose 16s rrna sequence failed to cluster closely with those of members of the existing clades 1 ii or iii fig 2 furthermore it formed a clade with sequences retrieved from a wide diversity of habitats including activated sludge but also from urban aerosols sediments and oral plaques as detailed later mcilroy and seviour 2009 these sequences were considered to be from members of defluviicoccus clade iv fig 2 having 16s rrna sequences of each of these clade members it was then possible to design targeted fish probes for their in situ identification and physiology as described later currently available fish probe sequence details are given in table 1 the sbr9 1a fish probe designed by beer et al 2004 from the 16s rrna sequence now known to be a chimera of a sphingomonas thought to be a gao was shown subsequently to target members of clades i and iii defluviicoccus mcilroy et al 2011b its target site in these populations was missing an internal nucleotide but the probe was still able to bind to it under the hybridization stringency conditions recommended in some early papers the original sphingomonas fish probe of beer et al 2004 was used and the targeted populations were referred to as sphingomonas related organisms or alphaproteobacteria gao e g lopez vazquez et al 2009a 2009b oehmen et al 2006a 2005a 2005b oehmen et al 2006b as discussed later the phylogenetic diversity of defluviicoccus is greater than suggested above analyses of eight defluviicoccus genomes bessarab et al 2022 has suggested the existence of another clade v embracing 16s rrna sequences from a range of habitats fig 2 the frequent occurrence of defluviicoccus in wastewater treatment plants often at high abundances and especially in those designed to remove phosphorus p microbiologically suggests that they are well suited ecophysiologically to this habitat and hence likely to impact on plant performance they have been shown to accumulate large reserves of glycogen under certain operational conditions and are thus referred to as glycogen accumulating organisms or gao bessarab et al 2022 liu et al 1996 maszenan et al 2005 nielsen et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 3 the microbiology of ebpr activated sludge systems while conventional activated sludge treatment plants remove organic carbonaceous material adequately the levels of p and n leaving in the treated effluent are environmentally undesirable leading to eutrophication and often stagnation of receiving bodies of water hence plants have evolved often empirically to give rise to processes able to reduce effluent p and n levels to acceptable levels by imposing selective pressures on the microbial community which encourage the growth and eventual enrichment of the desired bacterial populations barnard and comeau 2014 khunjar et al 2014 wanner et al 2021 the pao polyphosphate accumulating organisms possess the ability to store p intracellularly as polyphosphate granules at levels beyond those required to support cell growth and the process is known as enhanced biological phosphorus removal or ebpr mcmahon et al 2010 seviour et al 2010 seviour et al 2003 this selective pressure in continuous flow ebpr systems is exerted by exposure of the biomass continuously to alternating anaerobic aerobic conditions raw influent sewage is fed initially into an anaerobic feed reactor where the pao assimilate the readily biodegradable substrates instead of using these to support anaerobic growth they act as precursors for synthesis of chemically diverse intracellular storage materials already stored intracellular polyphosphate and glycogen reserves and the anaerobic tricarboxylic acid cycle are thought to provide the necessary energy and reducing power for their assimilation and synthesis and the orthophosphate generated is released into the bulk liquid mcmahon et al 2010 biomass is then passed into an aerobic famine reactor where the pao respire aerobically the storage material to generate carbon and energy sources for cell replication and the energy generated drives uptake of external orthophosphate and its conversion to intracellular polyphosphate granules mcmahon et al 2010 subsequent removal of pao cells during sludge wasting thus removes this immobilized p most ebpr plants also remove n microbiologically since the chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidizing aob nitrifying bacteria under aerobic conditions oxidize nh3 to no2 stein 2019 which is then oxidized to no3 by the nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob daims et al 2016 it is now clear that members of the archaea aoa are also nitrifiers zhang et al 2015 while some single bacterial populations the comammox can oxidize nh3 to no3 in a single step daims et al 2016 both groups are found in ebpr plants fan et al 2017 roots et al 2019 under the subsequent anoxic conditions chemoorganoheterotrophic denitrifying bacteria using no3 or no2 as electron acceptor to reduce it to environmentally harmless n2 which dissipates into the atmosphere lu et al 2014 mcilroy et al 2016 whether defluviicoccus participates in denitrification is discussed when the n metabolism of these is examined in detail in section 10 5 it was long thought unlikely that all pao would share the same phenotype in ebpr plants as those demonstrated by the still uncultured first identified pao the ß proteobacterium candidatus accumulibacter phosphatis crocetti et al 2000 hesselmann et al 1999 application of fish coupled with microautoradiography mar and histochemical staining showed it possessed the phenotype suggested from some of the early metabolic models thus under anaerobic feed conditions volatile short chain fatty acids like acetate and propionate the most common vfa in wastewater are assimilated and stored intracellularly as poly ß hydroxyalkanoate granules pha nielsen et al 2019 roy et al 2021 the stored pha are then respired under the famine aerobic conditions to generate energy in the form of atp reducing power and carbon fragments to accumulate extracellular orthophosphate synthesize intracellular polyphosphate granules and replenish the glycogen stores needed for subsequent pao anaerobic metabolic activities nielsen et al 2019 seviour et al 2003 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 with little available readily metabolizable substrates remaining in the aerobic famine stage organisms able to store carbon and energy sources anaerobically are selectively advantaged roy et al 2021 seviour et al 2003 both candidatus dechloromonas phosphoritropha and candidatus dechloromonas phosphorivorans pao share most of their anaerobic phenotype with ca accumulibacter petriglieri et al 2021 it is now clear that other pao defined here as any organism which utilizes stored polyp to facilitate anaerobic carbon assimilation nielsen et al 2019 seviour and mcilroy 2008 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 possess a different anaerobic phenotype to that described above for example neither tetrasphaera spp close et al 2021 zhang and kinyua 2020 which are more abundant than ca a phosphatis in many full scale treatment plants globally dueholm et al 2022 mielczarek et al 2013 nielsen et al 2019 roy et al 2021 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 nor the microlunatus phosphovorus pao assimilate volatile fatty acids although close et al 2021 have shown that their clade ii tetrasphaera population recycle phas under ebpr conditions both can ferment glucose and amino acids liu et al 2019 marques et al 2017 nguyen et al 2015 in tetrasphaera amino acids like glycine glutamate and aspartate can also be assimilated and stored anaerobically close et al 2021 kristiansen et al 2013 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 it is now clear that they like ca accumulibacter synthesise glycogen anaerobically which is then used aerobically to provide energy for phosphate assimilation marques et al 2017 rubio rincón et al 2019 this ability to ferment means that it can grow under the anaerobic anoxic conditions encountered in ebpr processes and thus provide substrates for other pao including ca accumulibacter nielsen et al 2019 thus tetrasphaera has a very different anaerobic physiology to ca accumulibacter most of these published tetrasphaera data have come from t elongata the most readily cultured but it is now clear it is not as high a p accumulator as some other members close et al 2021 singleton et al 2022 the level of phylogenetic diversity amongst tetrasphaera long known to be high nguyen et al 2011 marques et al 2017 has been re examined by singleton et al 2022 they present convincing evidence from whole genome sequencing analyses that uncultured clade 3 tetrasphaera members in fact embraced members of two new genera ca phosphoribacter and ca lutibacillus with the former shown to be the most abundant tetrasphaera detected in ebpr plants around the world 4 the glycogen accumulating organisms these organisms have been defined as populations that can accumulate glycogen intracellularly aerobically and use it under anaerobic conditions as the main energy source to assimilate substrates which are converted to intracellular storage products wong and liu 2007 thus the glycogen accumulating organisms gao and some of the pao share some of the same phenotype in the ebpr anaerobic feed stage importantly as glycogen serves now as the main anaerobic gao energy source for these events since polyp stores are not available no orthophosphate is released into the bulk liquid thus in the subsequent aerobic famine phase the gao metabolize their storage materials for cell growth but not to accumulate excess intracellular polyp instead glycogen is synthesized and stored for future utilization under the subsequent anaerobic conditions nielsen et al 2019 seviour and mcilroy 2008 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 some of the ca a phosphatis pao anaerobic phenotype has been demonstrated in several gao bacteria including strains of defluviicoccus spp mcilroy et al 2010 nittami et al 2009 wong and liu 2007 the betaproteobacterial ca propionivibrio aalbergensis albertsen et al 2016 and gammaproteobacterial competibacteriaceae kong et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2014 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 but not the actinobacterial micropruina glycogenica mcilroy et al 2018 whose anaerobic phenotype is quite different to those of all other known gao thus under anaerobic conditions this gao the most commonly seen in danish plants dueholm et al 2022 nielsen et al 2019 assimilates sugars and amino acids which are then thought to be fermented to lactate acetate ethanol and propionate consequently m glycogenica has been referred to as a fermentative gao mcilroy et al 2018 these products of fermentation are stored partially as glycogen which then acts as the carbon energy and reducing power sources under the subsequent aerobic conditions mcilroy et al 2018 thus they have been thought to compete anaerobically for substrates with the fermentative tetrasphaera pao stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 it seems likely that other gao populations await description including the defluviicoccus detected in habitats other than activated sludge see below key metabolic features of the gao and pao are listed in table 2 therefore as with the pao these gao are also metabolically diverse suggesting there is no single or uniform anaerobic gao phenotype and conclusions reached especially in early modelling and subsequent studies where the individual gao member clades were assumed collectively to have a single identical ecophysiology bin et al 2015 coats et al 2017 weissbrodt et al 2013 need re examination in some gao papers only the role of ca competibacter was considered even though defluviicoccus may have also been present in the community kolakovic et al 2021 weissbrodt et al 2013 welles et al 2015 possibly because they were once thought prematurely to be important only in plants treating industrial wastes dueholm et al 2022 if dominant the gao have been thought by many to compete anaerobically for readily biodegradable substrates with the ca accumulibacter pao and so reduce potentially the p removal capacity by a reduction in pao relative abundances e g mao et al 2016 as with clade i defluviicoccus members nielsen et al 2019 wang et al 2012 however not all such studies support these proposals begum and batista 2014 law et al 2016 majed and gu 2020 neethling et al 2006 qiu et al 2019 tu and schuler 2013 as discussed in more detail later whether these behavioural inconsistencies reflect variations in the in situ physiology and thus relative competitiveness of individual members between and within each individual clade as suggested by mcilroy et al 2011a for defluviicoccus clade iii members and kolakovic et al 2021 mcdaniel et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 for ca accumulibacter clades and singleton et al 2022 for tetrasphaera needs urgent clarification certainly fundamental strain and interspecies variabilities are known for both ca accumulibacter flowers et al 2013 petriglieri et al 2022 rubio rincón et al 2019 welles et al 2017 2015 the competibacteriaceae kong et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2014 wang et al 2021a and wang et al 2021b have suggested that competition between ca accumulibacter and d vanus in some situations may be decided by their relative abilities to produce biomass during the aerobic phase it is important to point out that even if defluviicoccus might reduce ebpr capacity their presence in these ebpr plants can yield peripheral benefits for example it seems likely that they are responsible under the prevailing anaerobic aerobic conditions for the excess carbon removal from influents with high cod n p feeds and hence reduce the risk of viscous sludge bulking which might otherwise occur as a result of such deficiencies kiss et al 2011 furthermore under anaerobic conditions high abundances of defluviicoccus clade i may be exploited for production of mixtures of novel polyhydroxyalkanoate pha co polymers with attractive properties and whose individual component levels can be manipulated by changing the feed compositions dai et al 2008 2007b wang et al 2021b similar outcomes were obtained using molasses as substrate under anaerobic aerobic conditions where short chain length and medium chain length pha were produced with 3 hydroxyhexanoate yield increases corresponding to increases in abundance of defluviicoccus clades i and ii at the expense of the competibacter gao pisco et al 2009 a paper mill wastewater feed with high c n ratio has been exploited successfully for the same purpose bengtsson et al 2008 pha production from an acetate feed in the pao is 3 polyhydroxybutyrate phb only and with gao 3 polyhydroxyvalerate phv 25 and 3 polyhydroxybutyrate 73 and a high total pha vfa ratio zheng et al 2002 zhou et al 2008 wang et al 2021b have shown that when d vanust was grown on butyrate and isobutyrate at 30 c it synthesised unusual 6 14 carbon long phas including polyhydroxy 4 methylvalerate ph4mv polyhydroxyhexanoate phhx and polyhydroxy 2 methylhexanate ph2mhx no such novel phas were seen by wang et al 2020b at 30 c with a butyrate isobutyrate feed and a community dominated by ca accumulibacter but with defluviicoccus present too instead mainly phb was produced and at low levels however pijuan et al 2004a did detect unidentified peaks from cultures fed butyrate and isobutyrate but whether these were the same as those detected by wang et al 2021b is not known many questions about defluviicoccus ecology physiology and systematics remain unanswered this review examines their phylogenetic diversity and ecological distribution and examines critically their role in ebpr wastewater treatment plants and elsewhere it suggests what key research questions need to be addressed and examines the key genomic features of defluviicoccus gao which might distinguish them from each other other gao and the pao 5 the natural occurrence of defluviicoccus it is important to realize that defluviicoccus is found more widely than in activated sludge plant communities although most of the relevant publications are descriptive and rarely if ever has their role or their impact on community behaviour there been elucidated as discussed earlier 16s rrna sequences of members of clade iv defluviicoccus were detected using pcr clone library analyses in early studies in urban aerosols sediments and oral plaques mcilroy and seviour 2009 most of the later publications have used amplicon sequencing protocols allowing populations to be identified to genus level only and very few have used fish in situ identification for further taxonomic resolution hence which clade s the defluviicoccus there belong to is rarely stated this is an important point worth emphasizing since increasing evidence would suggest that members of the different clades and even those within the same clade may possess different ecophysiologies eg begum and batista 2014 burow et al 2007b mcilroy et al 2011a schroeder et al 2008 in addition whether these defluviicoccus express the gao phenotype in non activated sludge habitats is not clear although it seems likely that the selective pressures brought to bear on them are quite different to those encountered there such clarification is achievable now with raman fish microspectroscopy with its ability to detect and quantify the diagnostic storage products glycogen pha and polyp in single fish identified cells in such communities fernando et al 2019 lee et al 2021 li et al 2018b furthermore it is difficult to decide unequivocally that the defluviicoccus in these atypical habitats are autochthones genuine stable members of the communities or represent invaders arising from site contamination with treated sewage effluent containing defluviicoccus as considered likely for their presence in marine sediment samples eg matturro et al 2017 and possibly in saline lake sediments abed et al 2012 belov et al 2018 they have also been found in a noumean new caledonian lagoon supplemented with dissolved inorganic p to encourage n fixation pfreundt et al 2016 where p supplementation was reported to enhance defluviicoccus abundances but with no explanation as to why their 16s rrna sequences were only 83 similar to that of d vanus but 99 similar to those of other environmental sequences suggesting they may be clade iv members the same caveats may apply also to soil samples where defluviicoccus has been detected although the literature suggests their presence there is not unusual al kindi and abed 2016 hui et al 2018 ji et al 2020 kaminsky et al 2017 nacke et al 2011 narendrula kotha and nkongolo 2017 ramadan et al 2021 zhang et al 2019 again little taxonomic detail has been provided and nor in most cases are their possible roles there detailed their relative abundances often considerable appear to change with changing soil properties li et al 2018a szoboszlay et al 2017 zhang and kinyua 2020 and they may play a positive role in the plant rhizosphere de tender et al 2016 ramadan et al 2021 or in soil fungal nutrition shao et al 2019 animal excretion contamination in the tibetan plateau led to a decrease in soil defluviicoccus abundance li et al 2021 but the effect if any of this loss on soil or plant nutrition was not discussed a high tolerance to mercury in a contaminated soil has also been reported ma et al 2019 defluviicoccus has been reported in holothurian invertebrates enomoto et al 2012 ocean sediments hassenrück et al 2016 solid fractions of manure zhong et al 2018 and bioaerosols from biomass burning emissions wei et al 2019 but again with no detailed accompanying taxonomic information wetlands too contain defluviicoccus liu et al 2020 tan et al 2019 where their primary source is thought likely again to be a wastewater feed ge et al 2019 have suggested they may play some role in a pyrite constructed wetlands designed to remove p a process thought to involve the aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of pyrite defluviicoccus was also reported together with micropruina another gao found in wastewater treatment plants in a wetland with an active alumina substrate designed to remove n from domestic sewage feed liu et al 2020 again suggesting this habitat as their original source defluviicoccus have also been detected in other invertebrates fan et al 2013 and been cultured from japanese neurotoxic ribbon worms melnikova et al 2017 its 16s rrna sequence was 98 similar to that of d vanus yet instead of growing as the distinctive tetrad cell arrangements of d vanus the cells were quite different appearing as short rods with rounded ends suggesting these too may belong to a new clade a defluviicoccus of undetermined phylogeny and described as a pathogen with no supporting evidence for such a description was also detected in the intestinal tract of early weaned piglets zhu et al 2020 6 how common is defluviicoccus in wastewater treatment plant most of our understanding of the phylogeny and ecophysiology of members of the genus defluviicoccus have come from studies on ebpr activated sludge communities although not all contain it and it occurs in other plant configurations including those with high levels of salinity wang et al 2020a wang et al 2015 the earlier view that these gao occurred predominantly in plants treating industrial wastes meyer et al 2006 is no longer sustainable nielsen et al 2019 nittami et al 2009 with ca d seviourii in australian ebpr plants treating domestic wastes the suggestion has also been made that defluviicoccus is more commonly found in laboratory scale bioreactors fed a synthetic sewage with high levels of readily assimilable substrates like acetate than in full scale plants with complex carbon sources and lower acetate levels tu and schuler 2013 however the data of nielsen et al 2019 and dueholm et al 2022 would question this view emphasizing yet again the risks of reaching generalizations from individual case studies in their original description of axenic cultures of d vanus maszenan et al 2005 showed by staining that it accumulated pha but failed to store polyp features consistent with a gao phenotype this observation was confirmed for members of clades i and ii in situ in ebpr plants using a range of techniques including pha and polyp staining coupled with fish stable isotope probing and microautoradiography mar burow et al 2007b meyer et al 2006 wong et al 2004 a gao phenotype for clade iii filamentous members was confirmed by nittami et al 2009 and mcilroy et al 2010 while the placement of strains into clade iv was based initially on 16s rrna sequence similarities alone mcilroy and seviour 2009 several treatment plant surveys have been published either based on fingerprinting plant communities of different configurations in attempts to understand which operating parameters might affect their relative abundances there or in validating newly designed fish probes nittami et al 2009 however many of the former predate the recognition of defluviicoccus members of clades iii and iv as well as ca p aalborgensis albertsen et al 2016 and cpb 18 and often ignore m glycogenica lópez vázquez et al 2008 did show with fish that very few defluviicoccus clade i and ii members were found in full scale ebpr plants in the netherlands whether other clade members or gao other than ca competibacter were present is not clear since at that time these had not been described or recognised while not especially widely occurring mielczarek et al 2013 did find this gao often at high abundances in some danish plants especially in ebpr plants treating domestic wastes and the bulking filamentous ca d seviourii has also been found at high abundances in the stable foams in chinese activated sludge plants li et al 2020a although whether it was the causative agent is not clear as there are no reports of it being hydrophobic clade iii defluviicoccus were also abundant in a membrane ebpr process operating efficiently at close to 30 c qiu et al 2019 several defluviicoccus distinct otus were reported wang et al 2020a at high abundances in a full scale simultaneous chemical phosphorus removal system although the authors seem to attribute the ebpr anaerobic chemical transformations to the aerobic stage of the process and vice versa in their small global survey of multiple samples from full scale plants nielsen et al 2019 showed that m glycogenica occurred at high abundances especially in plants in america and britain and was the most abundant gao globally closely followed by defluviicoccus all existing clades being most abundant in full scale plants in africa south africa and australasia and with the clones gao cpb s18 and ca competibacter less abundant the later large global survey of dueholm et al 2022 has added considerably to our knowledge of the biogeography of defluviicoccus in ebpr plants confirming many of the data from the smaller survey nielsen et al 2019 where its distribution varied considerably amongst different countries and continents as for example with ca d seviourii which was particularly abundant in malaysia poland south africa australia and portugal the reasons why are probably complex cells of the tetrad forming defluviicoccus are seen commonly in aerobic granules li et al 2020b liang et al 2022 pronk et al 2015 being embedded in excessive amounts of the exocellular capsular material they synthesize this material has been characterized by pronk et al 2017 for putative clade ii members which however failed to hybridize with the df 2 probe of meyer et al 2006 the major component is an alpha 1 4 acid soluble polymer consisting predominantly of glucose together with galactose residues with och3 residues attached to the glucose monomers extraction of dna from defluviicoccus tetrad cells is notoriously difficult ahn et al 2007 guo et al 2017 maszenan et al 2005 mcilroy et al 2009 and pronk et al 2017 have suggested that presence of this highly acidic polymer may explain why and maybe why defluviicoccus is not detected always in clone library amplicon sequences retrieved from activated sludge communities it may also provide a permeability barrier to fish probes reaching their target sites although dna extraction methods involving both physical and chemical disruption have been employed successfully to recover high quality defluviicoccus dna bessarab et al 2022 and pretreatment can render cells more permeable to them individually identified defluviicoccus member abundances have also been achieved using qpcr assays eg lu et al 2020 qiu et al 2019 2022 wang et al 2020b both have well documented limitations but fish probes can target single cells be applied together with other techniques like fish mar and fish raman microspectroiscopy providing information on their in situ physiology and revealing population morphology at a single cell level high defluviicoccus abundances have also been reported in denitrifying polycaprolactone supported solid phase communities yu et al 2021 and those of membrane bioreactors fed real wastewater silva et al 2016 and operating at long sludge retention times as well as in ceramic membrane bioreactors where ozonation was claimed to increase their relative abundance tang et al 2019 they have also been found in an up flow biological aerated filter treating petrochemical secondary effluent fu et al 2016 decreasing hydraulic retention times hrt in an sbr treating saline wastewater led to parallel decreases in its relative abundances wang et al 2015 however no detail on which clade s were affected in this manner was provided although zhang et al 2020b suggested defluviicoccus clade 1 and ii members were favoured somewhat surprisingly over ca competibacter at shorter hrt in a two sludge denitrifying p removal system conditions which also clearly advantaged ca accumulibacter over both gao again no clear explanation for such trends was provided 7 what operational conditions may affect the population sizes of defluviicoccus in wastewater treatment plants the 16s rrna based global survey of treatment plants involving 740 treatment plants in 425 cities in 31 countries on six continents dueholm et al 2022 holds a few surprises for example their data suggest the relative abundances of defluviicoccus putatively 24 species including ca d seviourii but with only small levels of diversity present in each plant sample were not restricted to ebpr plants but in fact increased in plants operating at higher temperatures with high industrial loads and designed to remove carbonaceous compounds only especially in south american and asian countries but also in tropical and dryer climates this review has already made it clear that defluviicoccus can also occur at high abundances in ebpr plants with alternating anaerobic aerobic zones and tu and schuler 2013 have listed the conditions favouring their selection in such plants these are i low ph 7 25 ii p limitation high c p ratio iii glucose addition iv extended sludge age some of these are dealt with here and others in sections 14 and 15 defluviicoccus grows especially well in media with high cod p ratio often at the expense of ca accumulibacter majed and gu 2020 song et al 2022 tayà et al 2013 wang et al 2012 wong and liu 2007 certainly wong and liu 2007 and wang et al 2021b now at 30 c were able to generate highly enriched cultures of the tetrad forming gao probably clade i defluviicoccus kong et al 2002 mcilroy et al 2011b using such operating parameters and the original defluviicoccus d vanust was isolated from an activated sludge treating a brewery wastewater high in complex polysaccharide substrates where similar conditions existed maszenan et al 2005 it is thought that under such p limiting conditions the ca accumulibacter pao can modify their metabolism to behave like gao using glycogen and not polyp as energy source for substrate uptake under anaerobic conditions ahn et al 2009 barat et al 2008 kolakovic et al 2021 kong et al 2002 muszyński et al 2015 tayà et al 2013 welles et al 2015 zhou et al 2008 majed and gu 2020 showed that when feed c p ratios increased ca accumulibacter relative abundances fell while those of ca competibacter increased but those of defluviicoccus clade ii did not these trends are different to those reported by kong et al 2002 with clade i defluviicoccus however no similar changes in community composition were seen by welles et al 2017 in response to changes in c p ratios raman micro spectroscopy majed and gu 2020 showed in individual cells of their ca accumulibacter a dramatic decrease in polyp levels and statistically significant increases in their intracellular phb and glycogen levels with increasing c p ratios a finding consistent with a diminishing reliance of polyp as an energy source under increasing conditions of p limitation a statistically significant increase in phb levels was seen anaerobically with both ca competibacter and defluviicoccus but any increases in their glycogen levels under aerobic conditions at increasing c p ratios were not statistically significant it has been suggested that having such a versatile metabolism enables ca accumulibacter to survive in full scale ebpr plants where the p loading is likely to be highly variable mcmahon et al 2010 welles et al 2017 the use of n limiting paper mill wastewater to enrich for defluviicoccus for subsequent production of novel phas has been discussed above in addition kiss et al 2011 mcilroy et al 2011a and onetto et al 2019 have reported that communities of plants with anaerobic zones treating winery wastewater again with elevated cod n p ratios regularly have high abundances of clades i iv defluviicoccus members especially in the non vintage periods of operation in fact onetto et al 2017 using fishnanosims demonstrated that controlled n supplementation was an effective strategy to control defluviicoccus clade ii domination in such plants low c n wastewater can modify markedly the mixed liquor microbiome zhang et al 2020a in the community of a coupled aerobic anoxic nitrous decomposition operation cando plant wang et al 2020b claimed that a short anaerobic phase selected a gao community where the abundance of defluviicoccus probably clade iv and ca competibacter both increased as the cod n of the reactor feed decreased a similar trend had been reported earlier by wang et al 2018 for an sbr aerobic granular sludge plant designed to remove both n and p and operating at high do levels where defluviicoccus clade unknown increased in abundance as pao abundances decreased in parallel with a falling cod n ratio wang et al 2020ab also suggested in their cando experiments that defluviicoccus clade iv was the dominant population in an n2o producing community although whether it was generating the n2o was not reported especially since members of this genus have been shown bessarab et al 2022 not to possess the gene complement for complete denitrification to dinitrogen as discussed in section 10 5 8 sensitivity of defluviicoccus to antibacterial agents in activated sludge plants there is increasing interest in the ecology of antibiotic resistant residue production and their potential threat to human health and it is now clear that activated sludge plants are major sources guo et al 2017 li et al 2020 evidence suggests that defluviicoccus populations clades not given are especially resistant in aerobic granular sludge systems in situ to antibiotics like the fluoroquinone enrofloxacin and the folate synthesis inhibitor sulfadiazine li et al 2020b however their resistance may not result solely from them possessing antibiotic resistant genes but instead by protection from acquiring these from other bacteria by horizontal gene transfer hgt in the presence of triclosan known to encourage hgt by their exocellular polysaccharide capsular material hu et al 2019 described earlier clearly more effort should be directed towards understanding the role of defluviicoccus in antibiotic resistance gene spread especially since lu et al 2020 produced evidence that defluviicoccus clade unknown found in reused water systems in china appeared to carry multiple antibiotic resistance genes to six commonly used antibiotics furthermore dai et al 2022 showed that the presence of polyvinyl microplastics to reactors fed acetate led to enhanced triclosan degradation and the propagation of antibiotic resistance genes decreased they also suggested that both ca competibacter and defluviicoccus again were the likely hosts for several mobile genetic elements and antibiotic resistance genes they detected clearly much is still to be understood about the importance of both these gao in the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment and the role of activated sludge chemicals in it neither defluviicoccus clade not given nor ca competibacter appeared to tolerate polyaluminium chloride pac at the levels used globally to control bulking and foaming filamentous bacteria like ca microthrix parvicella fan et al 2020 in activated sludge plants while ca accumulibacter relative abundances appeared not to be affected markedly wang et al 2020ba although the gao diversity was high no similar data were provided for micropruina or propionivibrio or whether members of the different defluviicoccus clades responded differentially to pac addition of chromium nanoparticles to an ebpr process appeared to enhance the relative abundance of a defluviicoccus population sun et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 which was held responsible for parallel increases in denitrification rates despite the general view examined in this review that most such populations are incapable of complete reduction of no3 no2 to n2 alternatively this apparent contradiction suggests again large differences may exist amongst individual strains 9 comparative genomics of defluviicoccus bessarab et al 2022 have published the whole genome sequences of eight defluviicoccus populations some of which had been published earlier and including those of defluviicoccus vanust and others from metagenomic studies all meet the mimag criteria bowers et al 2017 of a high quality genome as supported by checkm derived completeness and contamination values further details are given in bessarab et al 2022 the availability of these sequences bessarab et al 2022 nobu et al 2014 onetto et al 2019 wang et al 2014b has answered many of the uncertainties emerging from the early experimental data and increased substantially our understanding of the potential in situ biochemistry and physiology of members of increasing numbers of clades as detailed below they have also confirmed much but importantly not all of the earlier data generated experimentally burow et al 2008a burow et al 2008b wong and liu 2007 which form the basis of many metabolic gao defluviicoccus models lanham et al 2014 lopez vazquez et al 2009b oehmen et al 2010a oehmen et al 2007 oehmen et al 2010b oehmen et al 2006a oehmen et al 2006b such discrepancies in the defluviicoccus phenotypic genotypic characterization literature are now no surprise and may reflect diversities similar to those reported for ca accumulibacter kolakovic et al 2021 petriglieri et al 2022 and ca competibacter populations mcilroy et al 2014 regardless these trends emphasize again the risks in reaching genus embracing generalizations from data provided by individual strains they also emphasize again the need to ensure the precise identity using fish of which defluviicoccus population is under study especially if subsequent modelling is to be undertaken oehmen et al 2010a 10 the ecophysiology of defluviicoccus in activated sludge plants the reader is referred to bessarab et al 2022 for a more detailed discussion of this material furthermore a metabolic map fig 3 illustrates many of the features of the anaerobic metabolism of defluviicoccus discussed in this section 10 1 substrate uptake early fish mar studies showed that clade 1 and ii defluviicoccus assimilate a limited range of substrates under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions burow et al 2007 burow et al 2008a burow et al 2008b wong and liu 2007 whole genome sequence analyses has revealed that all populations described by bessarab et al 2022 have genes for activation of both acetate acetyl coa synthetase and propionate propionyl coa synthetase bessarab et al 2022 but lack dedicated genes for propionate transport agreeing with burow et al 2008b who suggested both substrates shared a common transport system s cation acetate symporter actp they also claim that clade ii members alone could assimilate amino acids but all defluviicoccus genome sequence data show supplementary table 1 2 bessarab et al 2022 presence of genes encoding large numbers of abc and aapj transporters and thus possess an ability to assimilate a wide range of amino acids of the eight genome sequences analysed only defluviicoccus kalu maxac and defluviicoccus fred maxac 307 lack a gene s encoding a na glutamate symporter bessarab et al 2022 and all possess the liv encoding genes for transport of branched amino acids supplementary table 2 the data of wong and liu 2007 agree with most of these experimental results burow et al 2008a burow et al 2008b except that they could not detect experimentally anaerobic glucose uptake in their d vanus t population except when d vanus was grown under an anaerobic aerobic alternating regime wong and liu 2007 comparative analyses of the eight defluviicoccus genomes bessarab et al 2022 showed only d vanus ca d tetraformis defluviicoccus sp ssa4 ca d seviourii and defluviicoccus fred maxac 378 possess a single gene copy of a glucose mannose transporter supplementary table 2 bessarab et al 2022 it was not identified in genomes of defluviicoccus gao hk or defluviicoccus kalu maxac which instead possess one or more copies of a na glucose symporter gene supplementary table 3 bessarab et al 2022 therefore it seems likely that potentially these can all assimilate glucose while defluviicoccus fred maxac 307 may not whether these genes are expressed under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions is unclear interestingly d vanust was isolated under aerobic conditions originally on glucose as the carbon source maszenan et al 2005 albeit with a very slow growth rate yet schroeder et al 2008 failed to show by fish mar any glucose uptake by their clade ii defluviicoccus strain under continuous aerobic conditions further experiments using larger numbers of strains are required to clarify these uncertainties 10 2 mechanisms for anaerobic and aerobic substrate uptake inhibitor and ionophore studies similar to those used by burow et al 2009 for elucidating central metabolic pathways in defluviicoccus see below were adapted to help resolve their substrate active transport systems under alternating aerobic and anaerobic conditions burow et al 2008a burow et al 2008b highly enriched cultures 81 85 of total of clade 1 defluviicoccus were used and an assumption made that the data generated were considered to reflect its ecophysiology alone under anaerobic conditions acetate uptake rates fell markedly in the presence of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m chlorophenylhydrazone cccp and dinitrophenyl both uncouplers of the proton motive force pmf similarly monensin known to disrupt the na trans membrane gradient also reduced acetate uptake rates these data were interpreted as being consistent with acetate assimilation depending on both a pmf and a na potential with the former the main contributor burow et al 2008a burow et al 2008b burow et al 2008b also looked at how this pmf might be established under anaerobic conditions in defluviicoccus clade 1 they showed n n dicyclohexylcarbodiimide an inhibitor of atpases had no effect on acetate uptake rates and hence proposed that fi f0 atpases played no role in pmf establishment there instead as inhibition of fumarate reductase led to acetate uptake rates falling markedly they proposed that the pmf in their defluviicoccus was established by h efflux coupled to electron transport linked fumarate reduction this system is known to exist in ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 saunders et al 2007 which also possess the atpase pmf system seen in the ca accumulibacter pao zhou et al 2010 genes encoding a fumarate reductase are present in genomes of all sequenced defluviicoccus members bessarab et al 2022 alternatively burow et al 2008a and burow et al 2008b suggested that this anaerobic pmf may also be generated by extrusion of methylmalonyl coa decarboxylation linked efflux of na across the cell membrane and homologous genes have since been detected in ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 but not in ca accumulibacter the same systems probably exist in those defluviicoccus strains whose genomes contain the key genes encoding of propionyl co a carboxylase and methylmalonyl coa decarboxylase bessarab et al 2022 which are in all except the defluviicoccus fred maxac 148 genome although their individual copy numbers and those of most other genes vary considerably bessarab et al 2022 table 3 acetate uptake rates were determined to be lower in their defluviicoccus than in ca accumulibacter reflecting differences in the relative activities of their acetate permeases or in their substrate affinities burow et al 2008b and this seems to be the case for all defluviicoccus examined for substrate preferences mcmahon et al 2010 10 3 carbon metabolism burow et al 2008a burow et al 2009 and burow et al 2008b were amongst the first to determine experimentally the in situ metabolic pathways involved in anaerobic carbon catabolism in defluviicoccus clade 1 populations in activated sludge using the same approach already described with a highly enriched gao culture and fish mar together with metabolic inhibitors they showed evidence for the presence of an anaerobic glycolysis pathway for glycogen catabolism as suggested in early generic models for gaos dai et al 2007a filipe et al 2001b lopez vazquez et al 2009a lopez vazquez et al 2009b oehmen et al 2010a oehmen et al 2007 oehmen et al 2010b and an anaerobic functional glyoxylate pathway furthermore anaerobic stored glycogen degradation was thought to involve the embden meyerhof parnas emp pathway which in the absence of polyp stores is considered the major source of energy for gao anaerobic substrate transport mcmahon et al 2010 the view now is that to balance the gao cell redox the excess reducing power generated from glycogen catabolism was consumed by the functioning of the reductive tricarboxylic acid tca cycle where fumarate reductase reduces fumarate to succinate and the subsequent succinate propionate methylmalonyl coa pathway then leads to increased production of propionyl coa oehmen et al 2007 this latter cycle is known to supply precursors for the methylmalonyl coa pathway leading to the synthesis of 3 polyhydroxyvalerate and 3 hydroxy 2 methylvalerate which is produced in much higher amounts in defluviicoccus grown on propionate than on acetate with 3 hydroxybutyrate and 3 hydroxyvalerate or in ca accumulibacter which lack the or succinate propionate methylmalonyl coa pathway oehmen et al 2010a oehmen et al 2007 bessarab et al 2022 showed from comparative genomic analyses that these same reductive tca pathways are probably functional in all defluviicoccus members including those from previously recognized clades nobu et al 2014 onetto et al 2019 wang et al 2014b genes encoding the same tca and succinate propionate pathways for polyhydroxyvalerate production have since been shown in a ca c denitrificans strain mcilroy et al 2014 earlier genomic studies showed both clade ii defluviicoccus gaohk wang et al 2014b and clade 1 ca defluviicoccus tetraformis nobu et al 2014 possessed the genes for the emp tca and glyoxylate pathways although genes encoding enzymes involved in the emp glycolysis and tca cycle were also present in clade iii ca d seviourii those encoding enzymes for the anaplerotic glyoxylate pathway for acetate catabolism could not be detected onetto et al 2019 despite burow et al 2009 suggesting they were present in their defluviicoccus instead ca d seviourii possessed the alternative anaplerotic ethylmalonyl coa pathway also found in the competibacteriacae oehmen et al 2010b enabling it to grow on acetate several genes involved in the ethylmalonyl coa pathway are present in the genome sequences of all the defluviicoccus populations bessarab et al 2022 whose genomes have been re examined and again their individual copy numbers varied between them bessarab et al 2022 table 3 contradicting some of the earlier genomic studies by nobu et al 2014 and wang et al 2014b 10 4 biosynthesis of storage materials glycogen recycling occurring during the cyclical anaerobic aerobic conditions operative in ebpr bioprocesses defines the gao phenotype bessarab et al 2022 thus as discussed above anaerobic glycogen degradation is thought to be the source of reducing equivalents for synthesis of intracellular pha synthesized from both carbon substrates assimilated in the anaerobic feed phase and from organic acids derived from catabolism of glycogen or fermentation of metabolic products liu et al 2019 wang et al 2021a then subsequent aerobic degradation of pha in the aerobic phase provides substrates for glycogen synthesis through gluconeogenesis all the defluvicoccus genomes examined contain genes encoding a complete pathway for glycogen synthesis bessarab et al 2022 equally the genes encoding the pathway for glycogen degradation via the emp pathway were present in all defluviicoccus genomes bessarab et al 2022 but those encoding the entner doudoroff pathway were not seen in any although mcilroy et al 2014 detected these in ca competibacter denitrificans where their function there was unclear the d vanus t genome contains genes encoding the enzymes involved in synthesis of the monomers phb and phv from acyl coa compounds derived from acetate and propionate metabolism respectively bessarab et al 2022 these are namely phab for pha synthesis from acetyl coa and fabf and fabg for pha synthesis from propionyl coa and most likely butyryl co a no phaa genes were found in any of these genomes all others except ca d tetraformis also possess the genes fabg and phaj for pathways for alternate pha monomer synthesis related to fatty acid metabolism genes for the two pha synthases phac and phae respectively were also identified in the genomes of all the other defluviicoccus together with the phaz gene encoding a pha depolymerase for aerobic pha catabolism except that ca d seviourii lacks the phab gene gene copies of these vary between genomes table 3 aerobic catabolic degradation of pha most probably proceeds through conversion of 3 hydroxybutyrate coa to acetoacetyl coa via crotonyl coa where the acetyl coa then enters central metabolism with glycogen formation occurring by the gluconeogenesis pathway as above all defluviicoccus genomes contain genes essential for polyphosphate synthesis and degradation although some differences in their individual copy numbers were seen bessarab et al 2022 table 3 thus none of phop phoq phod phoc and phoh were present in d vanust while ca d tetraformis had phop and phod defluviicoccus gaohk lacked phod and phoh and ca d seviourii possessed only phoq defluviicoccus maxac 307 and maxac 378 both lacked phoc and phod while defluviicoccus maxac 148 like d vanust lacked all these genes none of the genomes contained pap genes encoding polyphosphate amp phosphotransferase suggesting this alternative pathway for polyp synthesis is absent in the defluviicoccus gao bessarab et al 2022 while the gene encoding a high affinity phosphate transport system pst was found in all genomes the pit gene encoding the low affinity phosphate transporter whose presence has been argued to be a possible inclusive determinant of the pao phenotype stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 was detected bessarab et al 2022 but only in defluviicoccus maxac 307 and defluviicoccus gaohk previously noted by y wang et al 2014 how homologous it is to the pao pit or how its expression is regulated and what its role might be in these defluviicoccus strains is not known but clearly its assessment as being a distinguishing feature exclusive to the pao genotype needs reexamination 10 5 nitrogen metabolism because of its frequent high abundances in ebpr plants much effort has been directed to see whether defluviicoccus can carry out anaerobic respiration denitrification by reducing no3 sequentially via no2 n2o and no to dinitrogen gas in plant anoxic zones and hence contribute to n removal although strong evidence suggests that some members of the pao ca accumulibacter and tetrasphaera spp as well as ca c denitrificans subgroup 6 can denitrify all the way to dinitrogen flowers et al 2013 kong et al 2006 marques et al 2017 mcilroy et al 2014 little persuasive data exist for such an ability for members of the different clades of defluviicoccus nielsen et al 2019 although they are assumed in some studies to carry out denitrification eg chen et al 2021 this is despite claims based on indirect evidence that clade iv members appeared to reduce no2 to n2o wang et al 2020b what is generally accepted now from different experimental approaches including whole genome sequence data bessarab et al 2022 nobu et al 2014 onetto et al 2019 wang et al 2014b is that they may reduce denitrify no3 to no2 but no further wang et al 2008a with clade i wang et al 2020b wang et al 2019 with clade iv however their ability to generate no2 may assist other populations including the denitrifying ca accumulibacter ribera guardia et al 2016 rubio rincón et al 2017 tian et al 2017 wang et al 2019 to grow under anoxic conditions and hence play an indirect role in enhancing n and indirectly p removal in activated sludge plants wang et al 2008b the presence of no3 no2 in the anaerobic feed zone is thought to reduce ebpr capacity by allowing the denitrifying bacteria to use these as electron acceptors for anaerobic respiration of readily metabolizable cod and hence reduce substrates otherwise available to the pao seviour et al 2003 evidence suggests that presence of nitrite can reduce defluviicoccus clades i and ii abundances and consequently enrich ca accumulibacter in a propionate fed anaerobic anoxic nitrite system tayà et al 2013 thus providing a potential means of defluviicoccus elimination in ebpr plants see earlier whether this strategy is realistic on an industrial scale for gao control is unclear since earlier ye et al 2010 suggested nitrite could act in the opposite way thus providing ca c denitrificans subgroup 6 the only competibacteriaceae known to fully denitrify mcilroy et al 2014 with an advantage over the pao ca accumulibacter community again inter and intra clade differences may explain such inconsistencies all defluviicoccus genomes have the nifdhk operon for fixation of atmospheric n bessarab et al 2022 while the vnfdgk operon is seen in only a few members bessarab et al 2022 a trait considered to be a valuable adaptation under the n limiting conditions found in many industrial treatment plants eg onetto et al 2019 but probably not those treating domestic wastes where n is usually plentiful in the form of urea ca c denitrificans has no such ability mcilroy et al 2014 although the nifdhk operon was detected in the clade iia uw 1 genome of ca accumulibacter clade ii members flowers et al 2013 the nifdhk operon contains the nifk nifd nifh and nif k genes where nifk encodes for the β subunit of component 1 of nitrogenase the vnfdgk operon located downstream of the nifdhk operon allows independent operon expression bessarab et al 2022 whether these n fixation encoding genes are expressed under such n limiting conditions is not known all also possess the genes for urease transport and hydrolysis bessarab et al 2022 but not all appear to have the capacity for assimilatory no3 reduction suggesting they may not grow on nitrate as sole n source as seems to be the ability of ca competibacter mcilroy et al 2014 thus although some defluviicoccus members have been reported to possess the gene encoding an assimilatory nitrate reductase nobu et al 2014 onetto et al 2019 wang et al 2014b not all the defluviicoccus genomes analysed by bessarab et al 2022 including those listed above did 11 competition between defluviicoccus and other gao in activated sludge basic differences in their in situ ecophysiology little data have been published exploring the co existence of defluviicoccus with the gao ca p alborgensis or m glycogenica or how they might compete with each other in ebpr systems oehmen et al 2010a qiu et al 2019 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 wang et al 2021b a comment especially pertinent to ca p aalborgensis which shares the same anaerobic phenotype with defluviicoccus albertsen et al 2016 few attempts have been made to see if defluviicoccus populations from different clades might also compete with each other meyer et al 2006 schroeder et al 2008 wong and liu 2007 dueholm et al 2022 have revealed that all these gao are found widely in plants around the world but with strikingly different distributions however while ca c denitrificans and defluviicoccus may be mutually exclusive in some communities carvalheira et al 2014 dueholm et al 2022 hossain et al 2022 muszyński and miłobędzka 2015 ong et al 2014 tu and schuler 2013 weissbrodt et al 2013 wong et al 2004 wong and liu 2007 in others both can occur together each often at high relative abundances eg dueholm et al 2022 majed and gu 2020 in some published studies where ca competibacter were present no reported attempt was made to see whether defluviicoccus gao might also have been there rubio rincón et al 2017 welles et al 2015 furthermore as pointed out above in many modelling papers neither was identified but instead see earlier both were often referred to collectively as the gao eg filipe et al 2001a 2001b 2001c mao et al 2016 zheng et al 2002 despite them having fundamentally different ecophysiologies as outlined above bessarab et al 2022 burow et al 2008a burow et al 2009 burow et al 2008b mcilroy et al 2014 consequently it is not surprising that they do not always co exist eg begum and batista 2014 carvalheira et al 2014 muszyński and miłobędzka 2015 suggesting each may occupy a separate niche s certainly several global surveys have shown that treatment plants in some countries lack one but not the other eg kong et al 2006 wong and liu 2007 one documented striking difference is their anaerobic behaviour in response to different carbon feed sources thus d vanus can assimilate both acetate and propionate meyer et al 2006 at relatively high uptake rates with the latter more rapidly assimilated and the preferred substrate when both are available carvalheira et al 2014 dai et al 2007a oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2006b pijuan et al 2004a b yet while the uptake rate of acetate in ca c denitrificans is similar to that of defluviicoccus propionate is hardly if at all assimilated dai et al 2007a oehmen et al 2010a oehmen et al 2010b oehmen et al 2004 oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b pijuan et al 2004b wang et al 2014a zhang et al 2021 the resultant phas synthesized differ with the substrate used with poly ß hydroxybutyrate phb and poly ß hydroxyvalerate phv produced from acetate by both and poly ß 2 methylvalerate ph2mv from propionate but only in defluviicoccus dai et al 2007a lopez vazquez et al 2009a lopez vazquez et al 2009b oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2005c despite burow et al 2008a showing by fish mar that butyrate was not assimilated by their population of defluviicoccus begum and batista 2014 provided fish data suggesting that butyrate as sole anaerobic carbon source seemed to favour clade i defluviicoccus the only clade looked for over ca competibacter thus after week 10 while defluviicoccus relative abundance had doubled while that of ca competibacter was halved similar selective trends of butyrate were reported by oehmen et al 2005b but now where ebpr capacity also fell and with no corresponding changes in defluviicoccus abundance it seems clear now for d vanust at least that it can assimilate both butyrate and isobutyrate albeit at slower rates than acetate and propionate wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b wang et al 2020b furthermore as mentioned above only ca c denitrificans subgroup 6 of the 7 known can fully denitrify kong et al 2006 mcilroy et al 2014 oehmen et al 2010a which would provide them with an advantage over defluviicoccus under anoxic conditions while subgroups 1 4 and 5 reduce nitrate to nitrite and subgroups 3 and 7 possess no denitrifying abilities unlike defluviicoccus bessarab et al 2022 none has any ability to fix atmospheric n2 mcilroy et al 2014 whether its exclusive possession of the ed pathway is advantageous to ca c denitrificans in activated sludge is unclear when wong and liu 2007 followed gao successional changes in an acetate fed anaerobic aerobic membrane reactor with no p removal using fish analyses they showed that ca competibacter were the dominant gao present initially then after 85 days the gao population had switched to one wholly dominated by defluviicoccus a shift thought to arise from the reactor running with long hydraulic retention time and sludge age however it seems equally likely that defluviicoccus may have out competed ca competibacter eventually for acetate in the feed because of low dissolved oxygen conditions dai et al 2007a zhang et al 2020c 12 competition between defluviicoccus and the pao in activated sludge much has been published in attempts to explain how defluviicoccus might out compete ca accumulibacter leading to a reduction in ebpr capacity despite considerable data raising concerns as to whether this always happens qiu et al 2019 little has been published exploring whether the other pao might be equally vulnerable to defluviicoccus or ca competibacter or the impact the gao ca p aalbergensis or m glycogenica might have on ebpr capacity both have been detected at high abundances in plants globally with ca p aalborgensis especially common in many plants in europe dueholm et al 2022 and m glycogenica abundant in plants in denmark australia and northern america both defluviicoccus clade i ii and iii members and m glycogenica were present at high abundances in treatment plants in malaysia and in an ebpr plant in singapore operating at 30 c together with ca p aalborgensis qiu et al 2019 because of similarities in their anaerobic behaviour it seems feasible that m glycogenica could compete with the tetrasphaera pao for substrates in this feed stage mcilroy et al 2018 stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 and hence reduce ebpr capacity in plants where both are present in high abundances yet this possibility has not been explored all the published data deal with the many operational factors thought to alter the balance between competibacteriaceae and defluviicoccus and ca accumulibacter leading to reduction in ebpr capacities little attention has been paid to seeing whether such outcomes are independent of clade membership or occur only with interactions between members of particular clades usually not mentioned of each of these if the latter it might explain why there is considerable disagreement in the literature of the extent of negative impact on ebpr capacity by these gao see earlier equally how relative abundances of each clade is affected by plant operational conditions has not been examined extensively as it has in ca accumulibacter 13 nature of carbon source in the feed one important parameter determining the outcome of competition between defluviicoccus and ca accumulibacter is the carbon source available to them in the anaerobic feed stage shen and zhou 2016 in the data of oehmen and colleagues oehmen et al 2004 oehmen et al 2006a oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2006b oehmen et al 2005c and in general confirmed subsequently by others lopez vazquez et al 2009a lopez vazquez et al 2009b whether acetate and propionate the two most common vfa in activated sludge mixed liquor present in the feed chen et al 2013 lu et al 2006 can determine their relative abundances and hence subsequent ebpr stability and capacity shen and zhou 2016 the possible influence of feed substrate on competition between defluviicoccus and ca competibacter was considered above but whether the same relationships exist between all other pao and gao members is not known briefly oehmen et al 2006a 2005a 2005b 2006b 2005c have reported that while ca accumulibacter could take up acetate and propionate at similar rates but in both cases faster than defluviicoccus then referred to as alphaproteobacterial gao ca competibacter had a similar rate for acetate uptake but a negligible rate for propionate assimilation see above on the other hand deluviicoccus assimilated propionate as its preferred substrate dai et al 2007a possibly because less energy from glycogen metabolism is needed to transport propionate and at a similar rate to ca accumulibacter but took up acetate at only about half that of ca accumulibacter however not all the published substrate utilization data support these differences again probably because of inter and intraclade differences between the gao and pao populations studied and often incomplete identification data for example dai et al 2007b obtained a highly enriched community of cluster 1 defluviicoccus which had out competed ca competibacter for the acetate in the feed although it seems likely as expressed above that defluviicoccus might have been favored at the low dissolved oxygen levels present wang et al 2020b have also suggested that anaerobic glycogen synthesis occurs with a propionate feed in ca accumulibacter and zhang et al 2020c confirmed that high acetate levels may in some cases favour defluviicoccus over ca accumulibacter importantly unlike both defluviicoccus and ca competibacter there was no delay in acetate and propionate assimilation rates by ca accumulibacter when these were switched in the feed thus defluviicoccus was less competitive with a propionate feed after exposure to acetate lu et al 2006 than ca accumulibacter oehmen et al 2006a 2005a 2006b have suggested that regularly alternating the feed substrate between acetate to propionate would be an elegant way of controlling the abundances of both these gao while this strategy has been shown to work at lab scale chen et al 2005 chen et al 2004 lu et al 2006 oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2005c its feasibility for gao control in full scale ebpr plants has received little attention thomas et al 2003 tu and schuler 2013 have questioned the direct role of substrate in defluviicoccus ca accumulibacter competition which does not always occur see earlier they proposed that the feed concentrations of acetate were crucially important as suggested earlier by burow et al 2008b they argued that most of the studies carried out rely on data from laboratory scale reactors which generally operate with much higher acetate levels than those found in full scale ebpr plants and from fish data showed that the relative abundances of ca accumulibacter were much higher when lower acetate levels were used however this outcome was ph dependant as detailed below evidence burow et al 2007a maszenan et al 2005 wong and liu 2007 has suggested that d vanus in situ and in pure culture can assimilates glucose see above while ca acumulibacter is unable to directly both however may ferment glucose and assimilate the fermentation products possibly explaining findings of oehmen et al 2005b and wang et al 2010 who both claimed that presence of glucose led to an increase in ca competibacter abundance the same situation may exist with butyrate assimilation with it being first fermented to acetate or propionate wang et al 2021b although as mentioned already shen and zhou 2016 and wang et al wang et al 2021a wang et al 2021b wang et al 2020b have suggested that d vanus and other clade i and il members can assimilate both butyrate and isobutyrate at 30 c albeit less rapidly that acetate and propionate furthermore d vanus seems able to assimilate a wider range of substrates anaerobically than either making it more competitive in plants treating industrial wastes industrial but see earlier where such diversity exists burow et al 2007a kong et al 2006 oehmen et al 2006a oehmen et al 2006b however genome sequence data bessarab et al 2022 clearly suggest that considerable differences exist amongst defluviicoccus clade members in their substrate utilization patterns 14 culture ph and temperature it is clear from the literature that ph can play an important role in influencing the relative abundances of the ca accumulibacter and defluviicoccus and ca competibacter in ebpr plants although the basis for such competition are probably complex there is considerable support for the suggestion that stable ebpr performance and high ca accumulibacter abundances occur at ph 7 25 oehmen et al 2007 oehmen et al 2005b while at lower ph the gao appear to have the competitive advantage whether this trend applies to all pao and gao populations is yet to be clarified thus in an acetate fed reactor run at ph 7 ebpr capacity was low and ca competibacter dominated the community its abundance then decreased markedly after a shift to ph 8 but with no accompanying large increase in ca accumulibacter abundance the same trends were seen with propionate and defluviicoccus oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2005c but now ca accumulibacter abundances increased at the higher ph this led oehmen et al 2005b to suggest that ca accumulibacter competed more effectively with the defluviicoccus for propionate assimilation than with ca competibacter for acetate uptake probably because of a faster propionate transport system corresponding analyses indicated that glycogen hydrolysis was reduced in both these gao at the higher ph it was proposed that running ebpr plants at high ph may be a suitable strategy to maximise ca accumulibacter activity oehmen et al 2005a oehmen et al 2005b oehmen et al 2005c and minimise the impact of defluviicoccus although it is not known whether this strategy has been implemented at any large scale ebpr facility in later papers lopez vazquez et al 2009a lopez vazquez et al 2009b possible interactions between carbon source ph and temperature were examined they used feeds containing different acetate propionate ratios and showed that at low temperatures 10 c ca accumulibacter dominated only if acetate and propionate were added simultaneously but not when added separately unless the ph was 7 5 or above at the higher temperature 30 c the gao dominated although confusingly by this they meant exclusively ca competibacter and defluviicoccus was not considered they showed that addition of acetate propionate 75 25 and 50 50 changed the community so that now ca accumulibacter dominated but only at low temperature 10 c regardless of ph however with the 75 25 acetate propionate ratio ca accumulibacter still dominated but only at ph 7 and 7 5 and with the 50 50 ratio only at 30 c and ph 7 5 their conclusions were that at low temperature 10 c the gao ie ca competibacter were disadvantaged while ebpr capacity was stable while this outcome supports the general view that lower temperatures favour high ebpr capacity which often declines during summer gu et al 2008 it is clear that the impact of temperature on ebpr and outcomes of competition between the pao and ca competibacter gao is complex thus until recently little data had been published on possible impacts of operating temperature on ebpr with defluviicoccus however shen et al 2017 did establish a multi cycle ebpr system running more stably with acetate than propionate at 30 c they showed with fish that defluviicoccus abundances clades i and ii fell gradually at 30 c even with a propionate feed while those of ca competibacter gao and ca accumulibacter clade iic were largely unaffected thus their data suggested that defluviicoccus may not be as competitive at 30 c as was once assumed later wang et al 2021b confirmed that stable ebpr was achievable with acetate propionate and butyrate feeds and for d vanus t at least that its acetate and propionate uptake rates at 30 c were substantially lower than those for ca accumulibacter confirming that unlike ca competibacter it was actually selectively disadvantaged at higher temperatures they also showed that the growth kinetics of d vanus t were markedly different to those of ca competibacter this example serves again to emphasise the need for precise phylogenetic identification of which gao is under discussion thus the once widely held view that ebpr capacity in plants fell sharply at temperatures above 25 c because the pao were outcompeted by the gao lopez vazquez et al 2009a lopez vazquez et al 2009b weissbrodt et al 2013 no longer holds true universally how ca p aalborensis and m glycogenica might respond in similar circumstances is unknown it is now clear that lab scale and full scale ebpr systems can in fact operate stably at the elevated wastewater temperatures of c a 30 c or higher these plant conditions prevail in tropical countries like malaysia and singapore law et al 2016 ong et al 2014 poh et al 2021 qiu et al 2019 poh et al 2021 have shown showed that ebpr capacity was stable long term at 30 c and stability could be maintained at 35 c for 2 days it was only at 40 c that the process failed no defluviicoccus were detected by fish although not unexpectedly see above the ca competibacter abundance increased with increases in temperature in both the poh et al 2021 and ong et al 2014 studies yet all three full scale ebpr plants in singapore examined by qiu et al 2019 operated effectively with highly diverse gao and pao communities which differed markedly for each suggesting that those organisms commonly seen dominating temperate ebpr plants can thrive at the higher temperatures under some circumstances qiu et al 2019 qiu et al 2022 in all three plants examined the ca acumulibacter were predominantly type ii b and c clade members both often found in tropical plants together with tetrasphaera populations both ca competibacter and defluviicoccus strains were also present in all three plants albeit at low abundances except for ca d seviourii as were both ca propionivibrio aalborgensis and micropruina glycogenica the recognition of nine defluviicoccus otus there suggests that in contrast to the data of wang et al 2021b such tropical systems appear to harbour temperature tolerant defluviicoccus populations and these have since been further studied qiu et al 2022 two sbr systems one at 30 c and the other at 35 c were run concurrently while defluviicoccus was lower in abundance than the ca competibacter community embracing several previously undetected strains their communities were dominated again in both reactors by the filamentous ca defluviicoccus seviourii making short appearance see below which coincided with decreases in ebpr capacities were cluster ii tetrad forms and cocci organized into clusters qiu et al 2022 it was suggested that these tetrad defluviicoccus were unable to compete with ca accumulibacter populations under the imposed conditions of low substrate concentrations because of low uptake rates of acetate and propionate while ca defluviicoccus seviourii did these rate differences may reflect surface area cell volume differences between them or it seems possible that presence of exocellular capsular material diagnostic of the tetrad morphology not seen with the filamentous ca d seviourii may impeded substrate uptake 15 substrate concentrations as mentioned above tu schuler 2013 showed that the ca accumulibacter were advantaged over the gao when acetate concentrations were kept low they exposed their ebpr sbr communities to the following conditions to attempt to explain why with the following experiments with high ph 7 4 8 4 and rapid 10 min acetate addition ensuring initial high concentration in anaerobic feed ca accumulibacter were present in high abundances 82 of total eub positive cells but no ca competibacter or cluster i defluviicoccus were seen by fish although small numbers of defluviicoccus cluster ii 4 were present when the ph was decreased 6 4 7 0 no ca accumulibacter or ca competibacter were detected instead the community was dominated by cluster i and cluster ii defluviicoccus 21 and 33 respectively at low ph 6 4 7 and slow acetate addition ensuring a low acetate concentration under anaerobic feed about 77 of the total community were ca accumulibacter with both ca competibacter and defluviicoccus now undetectable or at very low levels when this experiment was repeated with rapid acetate addition defluviicoccus cluster ii dominated 31 but neither ca competibacter nor ca accumulibacter were seen on the basis of these data tu schuler 2013 proposed that defluviicoccus had a competitive advantage at low ph but only at high acetate levels in the reactor since with slow acetate addition low concentrations ca accumulibacter dominated suggesting the former behaved as r strategists while the latter adopted a k strategy at low ph but an r strategy at higher ph their other convincing contribution was the suggestion as to why ebpr failed at low ph was not the result of defluviicoccus competing directly with ca accumulibacter for acetate but instead their population abundances increased only after ca accumulibacter had disappeared as a result of its sensitivity to low ph and so acetate was then available solely to defluviicoccus they concluded that while less commonly reported in full scale ebpr plants earlier lab scale experiments may have overstated the practical importance of defluviicoccus ca accumulibacter competition and subsequent ebpr failure at low ph further studies are required to see if interactions between other gao pao follow the same patterns 16 defluviicoccus systematics it is clear that our present understanding of the systematics and biodiversity of members of this genus is far from complete for example dueholm et al 2022 retrieved 16s rrna amplicons for what they adjudged to be 18 defluviicoccus species not currently recorded in the midas 4 database especially from plants in china whether these were members of the five clades currently recognized or of additional clades was not made clear there has been considerable discussion on where members of the genus defluviicoccus should be classified and whether they should remain as members of the family rhodospirillaceae onetto et al 2019 average nucleotide identity ani comparisons between all pairs of the eight available defluviicoccus genomes bessarab et al 2022 were within the range 76 80 consistent with each being a distinct species within a single genus according to interpretations of jain et al 2018 analyses of the ca d seviourii genome led onetto et al 2019 to suggest with that it should be removed from this family and instead reclassified into a candidate family 2 12 full 67 15 a decision based on the genome taxonomy database gtdb systematics parks et al 2020 in a subsequent re examination of members of the alphaproteobacteria based on 16s rrna gene sequences hördt et al 2020 proposed that members of this genus are best placed within the family geminicoccaceae in the rhodospirillales but with the caveat that defluviicoccus may be assigned to its own family if sufficient evidence became available from additional whole genome data since provided by bessarab et al 2022 they examined the proposal by hördt et al 2020 more closely where the suggestion was that both defluviicoccus and tistrella should be removed from the rhodospirillaceae and placed together within the geminicoccaceae comparison of per group proportion nucleotide identity pni statistics led them to suggest that pni differences between defluviicoccus and tistrella were consistent with these two genera being related at either intra family or intra order level but inconsistent with them both belonging to the family geminicoccaceae as proposed by hördt et al 2020 based on these data their proposal was that members of the genus defluviicoccus are probably best considered as a separate family defluviicoccaceae within the order rhodospirillales clearly genome sequence data from more strains of this and other closely related groups like tistrella are needed 16 conclusions this publication has attempted a critical and comprehensive review of the glycogen accumulating bacteria defluviicoccus it is clear from the literature that in many cases where its precise identification has not been resolved much confusion persists about its in situ ecology and physiology and assumptions and generalizations especially in the earlier studies that all gao behave the same and more importantly that all the defluviicoccus populations have the same phenotypic properties need serious attention only those studies using fish analyses or who use the full length 16s rrna amplicon sequencing protocol of dueholm et al 2020 can reveal their phylogenetic affiliations consequently in many reports no consideration is given to the probability that both inter and intra clade differences exist amongst individual members as have now been documented for most of the pao and ca competibacter it is now clear from the little genome sequence data available that the genus defluviicoccus embraces a highly diverse group of organisms and there is still much to learn about them the hope is that this review will persuade others to look more closely at this fascinating group of organisms whether their genome sequence data will provide clues as to how we might recover more of these in pure culture remains to be seen although the advantages of having axenic cultures are many for example these instead of enriched populations could be used to understand in situ physiology under different operational conditions and the generation and analysis of genome sequence data would be less equivocal than in the case of metagenome assembled genomes it would also be much easier to elucidate which factors affect regulation of synthesis and activity of key gao enzymes using transcriptomic and proteomic approaches these organisms deserve such close attention declaration of

15708,pervious pavement system pps is a suitable alternative technique for mitigating urban flooding and urban heat island uhi simultaneously however existing literature has revealed that ppss cannot achieve the expected permeability and evaporation to overcome this gap this study presents an elaborate review of problems associated with ppss and highlights its benefits to stormwater management and uhi mitigation we determined key parameters of ppss that could influence urban flooding and uhi mitigation including hydrological properties thermal physical properties structure design and clogging resistance we identified the co benefits approach of pps towards performance synergism on stormwater management and uhi mitigation from quality controlled design and fabrication periodic maintenance and effective evaluation system based on practice environments the results indicate that existing studies of ppss primarily focus on permeability while little emphasis is given to the evaporative cooling performance leading to a biased development with a loss of test standards and regulations that cannot control the cooling potential of the system the performance synergism of permeability and evaporative cooling in pps should be studied further while considering quality control of the materials and in situ practice design parameter controls with commonly used standards during fabrication periodic maintenance during operation and pre and post evaluation processes of ppss should work collectively to achieve optimal benefits and reduced costs keywords pervious pavement system urban heat

suspended solids uhi urban heat island data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction owing to rapid urbanization impervious artificial surfaces have replaced natural soils causing irregularities in the natural ecosystem and water evaporation this also causes various urban issues including urban heat islands uhis and urban flooding he et al 2022a moftakhari et al 2018 uhis seriously impact the levels of outdoor thermal comfort and cause heat related morbidities furthermore the increased outdoor temperature leads to increased use of air conditioning indoors which increases the peak electricity demand during summers and results in rising cooling energy consumption of buildings he et al 2022b santamouris et al 2015 additionally the overexploitation of water resources and overuse of impermeable materials suppress the replenishment of groundwater and increase surface runoff leading to urban flooding thus threatening safety of the local population jiang et al 2018 flooding and heat island problems are more challenging in hot humid areas where the majority of citizens suffer from heavy rainfall in summers and from hot and humid weather to address these issues many strategies have been proposed and some of them have already been successfully implemented for improving environmental quality the strategies include the application of water sensitive urban design along with promoting low impact development and establishment of eco garden and sustainable cities both water sensitive urban design and low impact development are effective in hot and humid areas because these strategies use infiltration friendly and evaporable materials to mitigate urban flooding and uhis simultaneously the replacement of impervious artificial pavements by pervious pavement systems ppss has great potential for environmental sustainability retrofit because typically pavements account for 20 40 of the total area of a city wu and thompson 2013 fig 1 presents how ppss contribute to urban flooding and uhi mitigation simultaneously pores of pps allow water to infiltrate into underlying soils promoting groundwater recharge and alleviating surface run off moreover the pores inside the materials and structure can retain a part of the water for evaporation which further cools the pavement and the air near its surface thus promoting uhi mitigation therefore efforts have been made to improve the capabilities and feasibility of application of ppss to mitigate uhi and urban flooding the research topics mainly cover i hydrological properties including permeability and water retention ii thermal properties including albedo conductivity heat capability and evaporative cooling effect and iii maintenance including clogging and cleaning methods and durability these research topics are studied considering the mechanical properties of the pps many review articles have reported on pps benefits barriers and future development from different perspectives including the performances of infiltration cooling and the clogging mechanism according to the criteria in section 2 a total of 32 reviews have been conducted 25 of which have focused on stormwater management and only 6 focusing on uhi mitigation specifically santamouris 2013 and qin 2015 critically reviewed cool pavements and their ability to mitigate urban overheating and presented the benefits and future research directions such two studies have confirmed that ppss can induce a cooling effect as a result of the evaporation of water inside the structure making it more appropriate for rainy and humid areas hence improving the capillary ability to increase the water content and evaporation rate in outdoor conditions is crucial although many other reviews have focused on the applications of pcps most of them have emphasised the influence of material type and mix design on the stormwater management strength clogging and durability chandrappa and biligiri 2016 kia et al 2017 for instance xie et al 2019 examined the environmental benefits of pcps on the stormwater management uhi mitigation traffic noise reduction and skid resistance improvement emphasis has been placed on the impacts of mix design pavement design construction practice and service environment on the durability of pcps without significantly increasing its maintenance requirements or compromising its infiltration properties furthermore despite increased emphasise on the benefits of stormwater management and uhi mitigation in existing studies the key parameters for controlling these benefits remain overlooked in particular without a clear identification of key parameters the synergistic performances of stormwater management and uhi mitigation remain unpractical whilst existing study has reported pps s excellent permeability the pps can only exhibit poor cooling performances wang et al 2018 other relevant studies have further illustrated that although increasing pores size in the structure is conducive to water percolation it weakens evaporative cooling performance and system strength wang et al 2019a notably smaller pores ensure better water retaining properties avoiding excessively lowing pps strength however smaller pores have a higher likelihood to be blocked leading to a sharp decrease in permeability built upon academic outcomes various technical standards and regulations have been formulated and implemented however such standards and regulations vary with countries and regions and most of them emphasise permeability performance with less attention paid to evaporative cooling effect for instance the american society for testing and materials astm c1701m 17a astm 2017 and astm c1781 c1781m 18e1 astm 2018 standards specify the indoor and outdoor test methods for measuring pps permeability coefficient respectively the cjj t188 2012 mhurd 2012a and cjj t190 2012 mhurd 2012b standards in china regulate the design and construction method of ppss and stipulate that the permeability coefficient of pervious paving materials cannot be 0 01 cm s the england bs7533 13 2009 bsi 2009 standard suggests pps construction based on soil conditions the only consideration of permeability for stormwater management leads to an obvious bias in technical implementation even although pps has been widely regarded as an effective technique in green rating systems only few standards including gb t50378 2019 mhurd 2019b and jgj286 2013 mhurd 2013 in china recommend the adoption of ppss for improving the permeability and thermal environment of construction sites and regulating the evaporation of pps 1 3 kg m2 d furthermore the lack of maintenance leads to the clogging of pps further restricting its acceptance by stakeholders existing studies have indicated the importance of pps performance synergy on urban flooding and uhi mitigation therefore it is expected that the pps should be well designed well constructed and well maintained until it is recycled however dispersive research topics as well as limited standards and technical regulations are inadequate for support pps to achieve so to overcome these research gaps this review here aims to clarify the research progress in pps development with respect to its implementation and to reveal the approach of performance synergism on urban flooding and uhi mitigation this paper is completed with a stringent analysis of 570 papers the research progress benefits and key parameters have been reviewed to frame an effective approach for understanding pps performance synergy this review article is structured as follows first ppss were reviewed based on existing literature with the consideration of urban stormwater management and uhi mitigation section 3 second pps benefits in aspects of urban flooding and uhis mitigation were summarised section 4 third key parameters that control these benefits of were identified section 5 to address the following questions i why are these parameters important ii how can we approach and improve the parameters based on different design criteria iii are there any relevant methods and standards for regulating these parameters furthermore an approach was framed based on the gaps and solutions from the perspective of co benefits approach better maintenance and an effective evaluation system to realise the performance synergy of pps on urban flooding and uhi mitigation based on local climate section 6 2 methodology in recent years many studies have been devoted to the development of ppss typical surface typology and structures of ppss are shown in fig 2 the surface materials of ppss could be mainly divided into three categories i e pervious interlocking pavements pip pervious concrete pavements pcp and pervious asphalt pavements pap the pervious surface paving materials of pip are commonly pre made in factories using concrete or ceramic materials before being assembled on site through interlocking pavers the surface materials of pcp and pap are entirely built on site usually adopting open graded coarse single sized aggregate gravel without fine aggregate i e sand this is similar to the construction of conventional concrete and asphalt each of these pps surface materials can be designed with different porosity shapes and colours based on need the structure of pps depends on the pervious materials used e g crushed stone as they form the pathways for water infiltration structures can be divided into the following three types based on the site permeability conditions 1 full permeability 2 partial permeability and 3 no infiltration permeability for partial and no infiltration structures a pipe with pores is assembled on the soil layer for water drainage thus improving its infiltration capability fig 3 presents a flowchart of this current review given that many articles use the terms permeable pavements and porous pavements to represent the pps sprouse et al 2020 both permeable and porous were included in the search here to expand the research range in the mainstream databases including google scholar scopus web of science sciencedirect springer and wiley for accurately tracking pps research progress the screening standard used in the present study was as follows i articles written in the english language and ii focused on pps considering stormwater management and uhi articles using pps to analyse other themes such as low impact development were excluded based on these criteria a total of 570 articles were reviewed 3 research on pervious pavements to identify the application areas of pps across different climates study areas were generated based on the köppen climate classification map fig 4 which is widely used in atmospheric research and classified based on patterns of average precipitation temperature and natural vegetation peel et al 2007 the sites of the experimental analyses and case studies for simulation were adopted as the locations that were targeted on the map for theorical papers with sites specified the first author s affiliation was identified as the study area furthermore to clearly identify the type of selected articles the selected papers were categorised based on research methods and themes i e experiment based simulative based and theoretical based with focus on either the stormwater management or uhi mitigation or considering both topics overall ppss have been studied in 32 countries with different climate conditions china and the united states of america presented the most significant contributions with 180 and 127 articles respectively followed by european countries with a total of 69 articles in these studies areas with tropical and humid subtropical climates were the hotspots of pps research covering the southern regions of china and the us as well as germany and france these areas are relatively warm and have enough precipitation all year round pps seems unsuitable in other areas such as tropical and subtropical desert climates owing to the nil precipitation alternatively in high latitude areas mainly with continental subarctic climate anti freezing measures need to be considered for pps implementation furthermore articles statistics was considered from multiple perspectives including different types of pps pavements and surface materials methods and topics pcp is the most common type of pps included in 254 articles owing to its wide adoption relatively low cost construction and limited labour requirement pip is the second most applied pps type included in 97 papers where it is pre made in factories and needs special mechanical equipment and is difficult to prepare in the laboratory pap presents the least investigated typology included in 82 papers likely due to its complex construction procedure furthermore 88 articles dealt with at least two types of pps to investigate their performance in 49 articles the pps type was not identified and the authors only stated the parameters used for the research mostly for simulated studies with respect to study methods the experimental methods and simulative analyses are considered in 448 and 78 articles respectively moreover 44 articles were thermotical including the mechanisms and thermotical design methods with different parameters life cycle assessments and reviews stormwater management are the predominant study topic of ppss with 502 papers while uhi comprised 60 articles and only 8 of them focus on both the main content of the selected articles includes monitoring ppss performance investigating the influencing factors and innovating new techniques to improve their benefits in particular 300 articles are published on the permeability coefficient mainly focusing on methods to achieve the targeted goals and improve upon them with the balance of strength as well as the permeability changes under different conditions including clogging 63 papers and freezing thawing 16 papers conditions a further 80 and 41 articles are dedicated to urban flooding alleviation and uhi mitigation after adopting ppss respectively with emphasis on the surface volume and peak flow decrease and surface temperature decrease and air temperature reduction in addition pollution inhibition also received a lot of attention with 91 articles published on this topic moreover there are 32 review articles with only 6 focusing on uhi mitigation and the remainder focusing on the stormwater management with emphasis on flooding mitigation or pollution removal the rest of the articles mostly focus on assessing regulating or improving the parameters including the water absorption and retaining properties 12 articles evaporation rate 28 articles thermophysical properties 9 articles structure design 22 articles and water reuse 12 articles 4 benefits of pervious pavement systems pps in city construction 4 1 urban stormwater management the connected or half connected pores inside the pps form channels for water infiltration and storage zhu et al 2019 notably the volume of rainwater retained inside the pps structure has been reported as 16 66 hernández crespo et al 2019 and numerous studies have demonstrated that this volume can effectively decrease the drain pressure through total runoff volume and peak flow thereby reducing the risk of urban flooding table 1 lists the representative studies that have comprehensively assessed the pps performance during rainfall events through simulating and monitoring rainfall conditions under different types of pps it was found that the pps could effectively reduce total runoff volume and peak flow by up to 97 and 93 respectively rodriguez rojas et al 2020 while providing rainfall runoff attenuation of more than 40 of the total rainfall retained within the structure alsubih et al 2017 compared to the referenced impervious pavement furthermore pps is more effective in response to rainfall events with shorter return periods as it significantly reduces runoff volume and peak discharge but less so for heavy storms with longer return periods wang et al 2019c in addition the increase of the urban population and traffic density leads to the accumulation of more pollutants on the surface of pps such as total suspended solids tss heavy metals including cu cd pb and zn chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients including total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and ammonia nh4 n causing serious water pollution tirpak et al 2020 contributing to specific pore characteristics pollutants can be effectively retained inside the pps using interception filtration sedimentation nutrient transformation and microbial removal singare et al 2011 table 2 summarises the purification effect of ppss on stormwater runoff quality revealing an effective tss removal of 45 100 however tss particles are continuously accumulated in connected and semi connected channels during rainfall events which is the primary source of blockage in ppss debnath and sarkar 2021 moreover removal efficiency of cod by different ppss varies from 9 to 60 in particular pap is a better alternative for pollutant removal because the binding medium in this pervious pavement easily forms silicide aluminum ferrite and other substances after hydration which contributes to the adsorption process of cod winston and hunt 2017 regardless of the pps type the heavy metals in rainwater runoff namely cd cu pb and zn can be effectively removed by 41 99 61 99 45 99 and 46 99 respectively although pps has a controlling effect on nutrient salt pollutants in rainwater runoff the removal efficiency fluctuates greatly with different ppss for example the tp and tn removal efficiencies of the systems can vary with 6 68 and 5 99 respectively notably once the water volume surpasses the pps storage capability it can gradually infiltrate into the base layer either for groundwater recharge or reuse collected using municipal pipes the harvested water from the pps can be collected for agriculture irrigation or as a heat resource or non potable water source for buildings antunes et al 2020 del castillo garcía et al 2013 the energy of water stored inside the structure can also be harvested by a heat exchange medium del castillo garcía et al 2013 for example charlesworth et al 2017 reviewed a technique of ground source heat systems beneath the pps for moving the heated or cooled water taking advantage of the natural heat stored below the ground this technique is proved to be more efficient than traditional soil or air source heat systems since heat is transferred from the water inside the structure of the pps more efficiently than it is in soil or air 4 2 urban heat island mitigation under dry conditions i e without evaporation ppss intensify uhi effects owing to their low specific heat capacity and albedo compared to those of impervious pavements asaeda and ca 2000 hu et al 2017 li et al 2013a during rainfall the infiltrated water can partially remove heat from the pps through heat exchange consequently the retained water can be evaporated out of the pps converting the incident energy into latent energy which can cool the surface table 3 lists the representative research conducted to identify the thermal performance of pps and its impact on the surrounding environment in different locations worldwide temperature comparisons of ppss conducted using attached thermocouples between dry and wet conditions or with impervious pavements under the same environment are the most direct methods for demonstrating the cooling performance among which indoor sample experiments that adopted pps surface paving materials as the research objects have demonstrated a surface cooling of up to 20 c compared to their own dry conditions wang et al 2019a outdoor samples or field experiments also demonstrated a good cooling performance of pps which could effectively cool the surface from 0 6 14 c compared to that observed on impervious pavements however ppss show limited cooling effects on the air as demonstrated in field experiments due to the limited geometry and obstruction by ambient environments as shown in the table 3 wang et al 2018 established that ppss with a plain size of 4 4 m could achieve an air temperature decrease of 1 c compared to dry conditions and referenced dense concrete at a height of 0 3 0 9 m moreover the black globe temperature typically adopted to assess the heat exposure was lower up to 3 c at a height of 0 5m compared to dry conditions similar results were observed by li et al 2013c in which the near surface air temperature at 5 1cm of pps was slightly lower less than 1 c than that of impervious concrete moreover a simulation by nakayama and fujita 2010 revealed that after a rainfall event the surface temperature of the water holding block was 5 20 c lower than that of other engineered pavements further the air temperature at a height of 1 m above the water holding block was 1 2 c lower than that of lawn areas and 3 5 c lower than that of building rooftops the different cooling effects were mainly due to the different materials and structures of ppss water availability near the surface and the practice environment specifically the cooling effects are highly dependent on the moisture availability near the surface layer since the evaporated water does not need to overcome large internal resistance inside the materials during vapor diffusion this was confirmed in a study by wang et al 2018 in which the cooling times of pip the time during which surface temperature of wet conditions is lower than that of dry conditions were six times longer than that of pcp in the same environment owing to the high water absorption and retaining capabilities furthermore although the high surface albedo of pps could weaken its evaporation rate it still achieves better cooling performance because of the prolonged high evaporation stage increasing energy consumption compared to the low albedo condition wang et al 2019b 5 key parameters owing to different manufacturing processes pps properties vary markedly e g effective air voids of 15 30 permeability of 20 500 m day compressive strengths of 5 5 20 5 mpa and flexural strengths of 1 3 8 mpa xie et al 2019 changes in these properties are highly correlated with pps pore structures including pore types connected pores half connected pores or closed pores porosity effective porosity pore size and tortuosity zhong et al 2018 zhong and wille 2016 connected pores form the channels for water to pass through ultimately determining the permeability of the system zhong et al 2016 both connected and half connected pores can further determine the evaporative cooling performance of the system garcia et al 2015 the pore character also affects the mechanical and thermal physical properties of the system chen et al 2019a moreover advanced techniques such as the mercury intrusion test and x ray based tests allow the measurement of these pore characteristics for better understanding the reasons causing pps property variation kayhanian et al 2012 however the pore size is generally randomised and is difficult to control during the manufacturing process samples used for these tests were small and could bring bias easily thus beyond pore size other key parameters are needed to exhibit environmental benefits and more importantly for quality control this section focuses on the key parameters of ppss relevant to urban stormwater management and uhi mitigation consisting of hydrological and thermophysical properties structure and clogging resistance 5 1 hydrological properties 5 1 1 permeability coefficient fig 5 a presents the infiltration process of pps during the rainfall where the results indicate that the pps permeability is generally measured by using the permeability coefficient metric cm s or mm s which is expressed as flow per unit of hydraulic gradient generally pps structures contains the surface layers the base layer and the sub grade layer a large number of connected pores large pore sizes and low tortuosity of pps structure can result in a high permeability coefficient the base layer that is often underlain by clastic rocks can form a large visible channel of connected pores similar to the base layer the sub grade i e the soil generally has good infiltration or can be assisted by municipal pipes for water removal from the pps rodriguez hernandez et al 2015 nevertheless large pores are improper for the surface layers of light traffic roads as pervious paving surface materials should not only consider permeability but should also meet the strength requirements 5 1 1 1 method for achieving permeability coefficient there are two approaches including mixture adjustment and new fillers that have been adopted to control the permeability coefficients of pervious paving materials the adoption of mixture adjustment is expected to optimise the structure of pervious paving materials sonebi and bassuoni 2013 yahia and kabagire 2014 specifically to obtain a certain permeability coefficient with an appropriate strength two estimation methods including the empirical formula method and the porosity based material design method have been widely adopted in the production of pc the empirical formula method delivers an empirical relationship between the mixture parameters and permeability coefficient for instance the linear regression formula developed by ibrahim et al 2014 exhibited an r2 of 0 75 between the permeability coefficient and cement content water content and aggregate size distribution however this empirical formula method is limited by the aggregate type and specific parameters ranges in comparison the porosity based material design method prioritises the total porosity as the main design parameter since it is a key pore structure feature of pervious paving materials that dictates its permeability and there is a well developed relationship between porosity and permeability deo and neithalath 2011 sumanasooriya and neithalath 2011 yahia and kabagire 2014 based on a volume ratio of stacked state coarse aggregates the volume of cementitious materials is calculable by subtracting the target porosity and the dosage of cementitious material and water can be determined according to the water cement ratio the compaction method should be critically considered during material production due to its affects on the desired porosity pereira da costa et al 2021 however the precision of this method is relatively low as the vertical connected pore distribution is highly connected to the permeability coefficient martin et al 2014 the measured inter connected porosity of pc was generally 4 7 smaller than the target value 15 25 xie et al 2020 an alternative method involves the direct use of volume ratios for coarse aggregate and cement paste and hypothesise all the aggregates as spheres in which the impact of cement paste on the packing of coarse aggregates is neglected this method has been validated with a high accuracy for continuous and total porosities of 17 2 and 26 5 against the desired values of 17 and 25 5 nguyen et al 2014 the second method suggests new materials as fillers or major items to increase the large pores inside the pervious materials thereby expecting a higher permeability coefficient table 4 two types of fillers i e the fine and coarse fillers were mainly adopted fine fillers including fly ash silica fume latex polymer and paper industry waste were adopted to replace the partial fine traditional aggregates sands and cement aiming to increase the adhesion of coarse aggregates with less fine aggregates the permeability coefficient could up to 1 04 cm s with the use of fine fillers like palm oil fuel alternatively coarse fillers such as steel lag and seashell by products aim to directly replace coarse aggregates and increase the pore size for instance using 70 by weight ceramic waste as the raw material for pervious bricks the permeability coefficient and flexural strength of pervious bricks can reach up to 0 15 cm s and 33 mpa respectively zhou et al 2018 however inappropriate substitution ratios of additional fillers could damage the structural strength performance especially with paper industry waste palm oil fuel and discarded porcelain whereas the permeability coefficient could be largely improved it should be noted that replacing 40 weight of fine aggregates with palm oil fuel reduced the comprehensive strength by 49 but increased the permeability coefficient by 132 ibrahim and abdul razak 2016 5 1 1 2 method for testing the permeability coefficient once surface materials were selected testing and regulating the permeability of the pps were of concern along with the use of modern techniques that required no destruction including the use of computational fluid dynamic simulations with x ray tomography analyses computed tomography imaging and slice imaging to simulate the permeability coefficient ni et al 2021 zhang et al 2018a numerous standards and regulations have been formulated and some representative ones used worldwide are listed in table 5 among these methods constant variable head methods are the most widely used for indoor tests zhang et al 2020a the single or double rings methods notably similar to the fall head method are most commonly reported in the literature for outdoor tests moreover to measure highly porous media i e the sub grade of ppss with a permeability of 10 8 10 4 m2 a simplified method using a venturi tube to gauge the flowing gas has been put forward to address the time record error caused by the aforementioned methods above qin et al 2018b notably the guidelines in china indicate that the permeability coefficient of ppss should be above 0 01 cm s however the effectiveness of these reported methods remains unclear previous studies found that the permeability coefficients measured using the falling head method were 100 300 higher than those measured using the constant head method although the former is more convenient to use zhang et al 2020a furthermore the permeability coefficient was found to be dependent on the head level used in the test the permeability coefficient under a low pressure of constant heat method i e 2 cm is much closer to that of the fall head method lederle et al 2020 qin et al 2015 thus a low head level is recommended since rain events typically result in the accumulation of small amounts of water on the surface of ppss another concern revolves around setting of the sample the infiltration capacity test results of saturated and unsaturated ppss can differ by 300 boogaard and lucke 2019 moreover leakage on the side of the sample due to the rough surface can also create error a comparison among the constant head falling head modified astm c1701m 17a astm 2017 and constant flow methods revealed that errors caused by sample to sample variations were greater than that of method uncertainty showing an average deviation of 20 therefore if the permeability capacity of an unsaturated pps was used as the design input for computer models the permeability capacity may be significantly overestimated as the actual outdoor conditions are not considered in the existing permeability test methods rainfall simulation tests were carried out by using either samples or field experiments to examine the dynamic permeability rate and study the influence of rainfall conditions i e rainfall density and duration on the runoff control capability of ppss a representative rainfall simulation infiltrometer was invented by nichols et al 2014 it contained an inner and out ring that were separated by 3 m thick sheeting with pvc pipes set above them water flowing from the holes on the lower surface of the pvc pipe was passed through two horizontal wire gauze sheets to break the flow into droplets to simulate the rainfalls once the water started visibly ponding the pavement surface outside the framed area water flow and time are recorded and the maximum infiltration capacity and permeability coefficient of the pps are identified the permeability coefficient under the double ring test was 60 greater than that obtained using the rainfall simulation method and a strong positive correlation r2 0 85 was revealed between the two methods rodriguez hernandez et al 2015 5 1 2 water absorption and retaining properties water availability is a pre factor that affects the evaporative cooling performance of ppss determined by using the water absorption rate and saturated water content fig 5 a wu et al 2018 during natural rainfall or artificial watering the water inside the connected and half connected pores travels downwards due to capillary action and gravity until the pps achieves saturation tziampou et al 2020 afterwards once evaporation begins the water inside the pores transforms from liquid to vapour and a dynamic liquid flow driven by capillary action will be formed inside the materials to meet the upward demand of surface evaporation aboufoul et al 2019 however as evaporation proceeds along with a decrease in the available water the evaporation front is forced back inside the materials largely increasing the evaporation resistance and directly leading to a low evaporation rate kuehni et al 2016 accordingly it is deduced that water absorption rates determine how fast water can be obtained during rainfall or artificial watering moreover the water absorption rate and retention together determine how long the hydrological connection can be maintained the results in table 3 indicate that pervious materials with high capillary absorption rate 2 040 kg m2 s0 5 and water retention 121 07kg m3 can maintain a large hydraulic continuity for nearly 12 h to support a high evaporation rate 0 85kg m2 h under typical hot humid areas wang et al 2019a in comparision when the water inside a pc is below 76 mm evaporation is insignificant with respect to surface cooling nemirovsky et al 2013 existing studies have reported two methods for water availability improvement including the use of high absorptive fillers and adoption of water spray to meet evaporation demand high absorptive fillers including fly ash silica fume and biomass are capable of increasing the capillary pores and promoting water retaining for instance by using these fillers the saturated water content of pervious paving materials increased up to 0 32 g cm3 while the water absorption height reached 70 of the material height table 4 wang et al 2021 sprinkling wastewater at intervals a representative of water spraying techniques has been reported to reduce the convective heat and increase the latent heat where a surface cooling of 2 20 c was achieved compared to dry conditions table 3 yamagata et al 2008 wang et al 2019a certain methods such as modification of pervious material structures to hold enough water or exposing more moisture to the atmosphere could also achieve good results for instance sealing the five sides of pc while leaving the face open could retain 6 97 kg m3 of water and reduce the surface temperature by 3 13 c compared to dry conditions bao et al 2019 for studying the water retention capabilities the rainfall simulation test method is robust enough to meet the conditions of pervious pavements during rainfall or watering although few to no standards or regulations have been implemented the integrated immersion test is also considered effective to assess the saturated water content with less time cost wang et al 2019b for water absorption rate test the partial immersion test is most similar to the rainfall simulation test with only the upper surface in contact with water the partial immersion test can be used to test the capillary water absorption rate as per the iso15148 2002 iso 2002 standard comparison among the integral immersion partial immersion and rainfall simulation tests in the same indoor environment revealed that the partial immersion test had the highest accuracy for qualitatively assessing the water absorption and retention properties of pervious paving materials wang et al 2019b a high accuracy of partial immersion method has been reported in analysing the water absorption rate and retention of several widely used pervious paving materials in hot humid areas in china the properties ranged from 0 01 to 2 04 kg m2 s0 5 and 101 36 to 121 07 kg m3 respectively with standard deviations ranging from 0 to 5 64 wang et al 2019a 5 1 3 evaporation rate the evaporative cooling effect of a pps can be measured using the evaporation rate as it is defined by the mass of water evaporated from the pps per square meter per hour kg m2 h fig 5 b the evaporation process can be divided into two stages the first stage is the high evaporation rate stage when the drying front is near the surface and the water level can adequately support evaporation during this process the meteorological parameters are main factors that affect the evaporation rate along with water availability ben neriah et al 2014 following the pattern of solar radiation air temperature partial pressure of water vapour wind speed zhang et al 2018c pps evaporation rates during the first stage have been reported up to 0 9 kg m2 h similar to the water evaporation rate of the same environment wang et at 2019a the second stage occurs when the water level can no longer support evaporation and the evaporation front fades back into the internal surface of the pps the start of the second stage depends on both the porosity and tortuosity of the materials owing to high resistance in the materials the evaporation rate will decrease and eventually reach zero aboufoul et al 2019 garcia et al 2015 table 3 exhibits the types and experimental set of typical studies on evaporative cooling performance of pps with most of them based on surface paving materials moreover indoor sample experiment using an electronic balance is the most common method for measuring evaporation rates and analysing the impact of different factors on the evaporative cooling potential novel methods based on the principle of balance have been adopted to measure heavy samples overcoming limitation of the range and accuracy of balance for instance the apparatus that hung two columns of the same weight and dimensions in balance has been adopted to study the evaporation rate of pc with one column containing pc and crushed stone and the other only containing crushed stone but with a mini low profile load cell set on the bottom to form the counterbalance once the pc has been wetted the tension gaps of these two columns can be collected at interval times to calculate the evaporation rate of the pc syrrakou and pinder 2014 however the test methods of measuring in situ evaporation rate remain limited specifically the humidity balance method through monitoring air temperatures and relative air humidity gaps between the tunnel entrance and exit at interval times has shown to be an effective way for assessing evaporation rates in field nevertheless this method requires additional verification since humidity is significantly impacted by wind speeds and temperatures starke et al 2010 table 6 presents simulation methods for estimating the evaporation rates of pps including surface energy and water balance methods and adopting regression formulas which either from experiments or refer to the method used for soil evaporation calculation with absent parameters decided by experimental data for the surface energy balance method important components of the energy balance such as the convective heat flux and downward heat flux into the ppss are coupled with the evaporation process and still need to be further tested zhang et al 2020b analogously the water balance method requires the same area of impervious permeable pavement as the reference which is difficult to find in practice brown and borst 2015 although the regression formula of evaporation resistance has been widely employed to calculate the soil evaporation rate the key coefficients i e the surface resistance and aerodynamic resistance are highly correlated to pore structure and must be regressed separately qin and hiller 2016 other methods such as direct regression of the relationship between surface wetting condition and water content of ppss have also revealed good results the standard deviation between simulated and measured surface temperature of the pps was 0 4 c wei and he 2013 however whether this method is sufficient to estimate the evaporation rate of a pps remains unclear as the surface humidity ratio is obtained through photos which is greatly impacted by the surface morphology the standardisation or regulation of pps evaporation rates remains relatively except that the chinese national standard jgj286 2013 design standard of thermal environment of urban residential areas mhurd 2013 regulates the evaporation rate of ppss should not be below 1 3 kg m2 d under typical summer days of hot humid areas in china 5 2 thermophysical properties thermal physical properties including albedo emissivity specific heat capacity heat conductivity coefficient and convective heat transfer coefficient are key parameters that affect the cooling potential of ppss and are essential for simulation table 7 presents the typical thermal properties of pps surface materials considering heterogeneity of pps the thermal properties of different pervious materials were largely divided the albedo with a range of 0 03 0 39 is not only dependent on the nature of the object itself i e surface condition including the colour and roughness but is also impacted by the practice condition e g weather and usage the albedo of pc was confirmed to be higher than that of pa with darker colour wu et al 2018 and decreased linearly with an increase of porosity ranging from 0 39 to 0 25 zhang et al 2015 meanwhile the albedo of pervious paving materials changes under varying weather conditions notably high in the early morning and late afternoons but consistently low during the mid day with a gap up to 0 10 li et al 2013b the indoor spectrophotometry test method has been widely adopted to measure the albedo referring to astm e903 12 astm 2012 and astm g159 98 astm 1998 at least three test points is suggested due to porous and uneven surface characters another field test method consists of a radiation detector li et al 2013b following the astm c1549 09 astm 2009a and astm e1918 16 standards astm 2016b but with high sample size requirement usually 4 4 m levelling the albedometer above the target and assembling a baffle around the lower detector of the albedometer to assist with receiving the reflected radiation only from the target could decrease the sample plain size to 1 1 m qin et al 2018a high emissivity also increases the cooling effects of the pps especially during night time the literature has also indicated that the emissivity of various pervious surface materials is 0 8 0 9 as most of them are cement based materials an ae1 emissometer can be adopted to measure this parameter referring to astm c1371 15 astm 2015 wang et al 2019a typical specific heat values of pervious materials in table 7 indicate that pervious paving materials have a stable but poor specific heat values that are close to 1000 j kg k empirical specific heat values were typically employed as specific test methods for pps materials have not been reported yet analogously conductive properties decrease with increasing porosity affected by the tortuosity of air voids chen et al 2019b the thermal conductivity of pervious paving materials is generally measured based on the steady state or transient heat transfer process chen et al 2019a the steady state method is relatively accurate but requires 5 6 h to reach equilibrium referring to astm c518 10 astm 2010 the transient heat transfer includes the transient plane source and thermal needle probe methods referring to astm d7984 16 astm 2016a and accuracies of both are limited due to existence of large sized pores higher roughness of pps increases the surface areas encountering air thereby increasing the convective heat transfer coefficient specific convective heat transfer coefficients of pps surface remain unqualified with most researchers instead using empirical formulas chen et al 2019a qin and hiller 2016 thus increasing the risk of deviation in simulated results due to the specific range of these formulas mirsadeghi et al 2013 5 3 structure design the structure design of ppss including layer thickness subgrade condition and the chosen aggregate should be considered to avoid surface runoff during different rainfall conditions and to optimise evaporative cooling performance to cool the surface liu et al 2021 a thicker pps structure can enlarge the infiltration path of water and effectively reduce the maximum runoff duration liu et al 2021 high underground water levels and low subgrade permeability can affect the exfiltration of water if no pipes are embedded winston et al 2018 zhang and chui 2020 moreover the appropriate aggregate would improve water flow and pollutant removal efficiency for instance rounded uniform coarse aggregate with low compaction was found to be beneficial to the hydraulic conductivity and turbulence of water flow koohmishi 2019 koohmishi and azarhoosh 2021 coarse aggregate with calcareous sources also demonstrated an improved pollutant removal of 98 99 and low leaching ability of heavy metals holmes et al 2017 in addition pps with a fine grained top layer and coarse grained bottom layer exhibited the highest evaporation rates which was 16 higher than that of pps with coarse grained aggregates indicating very low evaporation rates even lower than impermeable materials starke et al 2011 moreover specific attention was given to geofabrics one layer of pps structure made of woven or non woven permeable fabrics and usually set between the bedding layer and sub base layer or at the lower level separating the sub base from the sub grade fig 2 it was reported to have the ability to separate filter reinforce protect and drain the system scholz 2013 although geofabric can also seriously weaken the permeability of pps due to the variable properties the permeability coefficients of geotextile may range from 36 120 l m2 s boving et al 2008 according to its type weight and thickness geofabrics installed above sub grade were efficient at retaining sediment particles 33 mm in diameter a maximum of 8 3 of the total sediment mass was retained in the geofabric layer but over 90 of the sediments were trapped in the paving and bedding aggregate layers lucke and beecham 2011 moreover higher the retention of suspended solids on the geofabric the higher the risk of blocking pps similar results were confirmed by the test of two used nonwoven geotextiles used in pps with permeability coefficient of 150 and 163 mm s where the average and maximum water permeability loss was 24 6 and 51 respectively garcia casuso et al 2020 typical standards that regulate pps structure are listed in table 5 specifically three ppss are divided in the bs7533 13 2009 based on the permeability of the subgrade total partial and no permeability fig 2 once the character of the sub grade strength and permeability is evaluated the details of the materials to be used thickness of each layer and pipe sizes can be determined based on the local rainfall and loading conditions by referring to this standard 5 4 clogging resistance after the pps is installed its performance gradually reduces due to clogging therefore maintenance throughout the operational stage is essential clogging gradually decrease the connection inside the voids significantly damaging pps permeability evidence has shown that clogging could decrease the total surface runoff and peak flow reduction by 62 92 and 37 65 respectively cui et al 2019 similar field investigations on a 12 year serviced pc also revealed that only one fifth of the samples had 15 porosity which was below the expected threshold for pc and porosity near the top surface was consistently lower than that in deeper sections due to the clogging radlińska et al 2012 the interaction among clogging resources pps and climate conditions determine the clogging process among which clogging resources are widely distributed in the environment and have largely divided physical and chemical characteristics including the particulate matter from deposition e g sands and clays waterborne particulate matter that drains into pores and organic matter e g oil leak boving et al 2008 kumar et al 2016 among these particles fine particle deposits particles 38 µm readily enter the deeper pores leading to blockage kayhanian et al 2012 for instance clogging caused by fine clays per unit mass were about ten times greater than that of sands coughlin et al 2012 accordingly pps with bigger pore size and higher tortuosity are more easily clogged by fine grained materials and over 90 of the sediment is retained in the top two layers i e paving and bedding layers of ppss regardless of pavement blockage conditions cui et al 2019 kayhanian et al 2012 lucke and beecham 2011 the self collapse of voids caused by traffic aging and freezing thawing cycles are another main source of clogging chopra et al 2010 welker et al 2013 for instance ppss implemented for vehicle traffic are more easily clogged because of the heavy load high vibration frequency and input of clogging materials carried by wheels lin et al 2016 longer exposure to the sun could also accelerate the clogging process in ppss due to the erosion of pervious materials henderson and tighe 2012 kumar et al 2016 the modification of pps materials and structures in addition to adopting a cleaning method can help to avoid or reduce clogging changing the set of pps layers by using geotextile fabric one pervious material set between surface layers can stop clogging materials from percolating deeper scholz 2013 however the accumulation of deposits in the geotextile also increases the risk of permeability loss boving et al 2008 brown et al 2009 different cleaning methods such as pressure power washing vacuum sweeping surface cleaning using a stiff broom milling machine backwashing or a combination of these methods can also partially alleviate clogging table 8 however even with maintenance a certain of clogging remains unavoidable as no cleaning methods are 100 effective 6 formulating the co benefits approach of ppss towards performance synergism based on the analysis of benefits and related key parameters the largely divided properties revealed a lack of synergism between different parameters of pps during fabrication clogging illustrated improper maintenance methods during operation stage moreover the lack of effective evaluation system before and after implementation of pps is also the primary cause of biased development studies that systemically consider the permeability and evaporative cooling of ppss remains limited with only one study assessing the influence of structure on pps performance table 9 liu et al 2020 therefore it is essential to formulate the co benefits approach of ppss through quality control scheme and evaluation system during the design fabrication and operation stage based on the practice environment so as to achieve a synergistic performance of ppss for mitigating of urban flooding and uhi fig 6 this section will focus on the gaps between pps research and practice providing give suggestions for optimizing performance synergism 6 1 performance synergism of ppss during design and fabrication based on the environment 6 1 1 coordinating key parameters for achieving the best comprehensive ability most existing studies only focus on one or two pps parameters of stormwater management table 1 or uhi mitigation table 3 whereas integration of the pervious paving materials and structure to meet the quality of strength permeability and evaporative cooling performance has scarcely been investigated although the methods for achieving a high permeability with acceptable strength performance have already been realised see section 5 1 1 its inappropriate application could lead to a poor evaporative cooling performance for example high strength pc with a low tortuosity can largely increase permeability but allows for a lower levels of water storage that not enough to support the evaporation kia et al 2019 moreover elucidation of the construction of structure to the evaporative cooling performance of pps remains unclear despite the few studies indicating that the sub layers did help to improve the evaporative cooling performance nemirovsky et al 2013 starke et al 2011 also changing rules of key parameters under freeze thaw cycles are still scarce particular considering the application of pps has expanded to cold regions like canada the water in the pores of pps is cold consolidated with expanded volume resulting in local frost heaving and cracking of materials directly leading to mass loss and structural damage singh et al 2020 summaries from existing studies explain that the frost resistance of ppss can be improved by using fillers e g mineral powder and water reducing agent but data on the changes of key parameters along with the freeze thaw cycles are unavailable yang and jiang 2003 to unlock these technical barriers pps design method that balance these key parameters should be formulated during the design and fabrication stage the mix design methods of pervious paving materials and the set of structure that balance of strength permeability and evaporation is foundational to achieve the design target on the basis of clear understanding the influencing factors of each key parameter moreover the practice environment must be included in the assessment to further determine whether the pps has achieved the design goals permeability should coordinate with local rainfall conditions and the surrounding runoff to withstand the interval between rainfall especially in hot humid areas with frequent high intensity rainfall in summer surrounding runoff caused by local level and slope conditions of the terrain is the other factor that seriously impacts the penetration and should also be involved in the design stage hou et al 2019 meanwhile to achieve a good evaporative cooling performance the pps should not only be designed to contain sufficient water under rainfall to avoid frequent water replenishment but also be assessed under typical days of local climate to further check its suitability to fight against uhis since meteorological parameters have great impact on the evaporation for ppss applied in cold regions the primary structure should be implemented above the frozen line to avoid damage while allowing optimal operations in rainfall conditions nantasai and nassiri 2019 6 1 2 standards for controlling key parameters during design and fabrication although the permeability test methods have been standardised the different test procedures make the results difficult to compare e g the various water pressures used in these methods qin et al 2015 analogously the integral immersion test has been widely adopted to assess the water retention capabilities but the absorption rates have been neglected what s more despite the close correlation between these hydrological properties and rainfall density and duration all existing standardised hydrological test methods were conducted under constant water conditions which are notably distinct from different actual rainfall conditions evaporation rates have been studied by various sample or field experiments without any specific standards and are thus difficult to use for simulations and comparisons the onsite construction of ppss e g pc and pa mix composition mix delivery timing delays and queues placement practices and weather can greatly affect the above key parameters although standardised construction methods based on local climate conditions remain limited alshareedah et al 2020 putman and neptune 2011 to achieve successful practice of ppss regulations on permeability and evaporative cooling demands for each practice environment should be formulated to clarify the target design afterwards standardised test methods of permeability considering rainfall conditions and terrain features should be carried out to meet the design target further standardised rapid test methods for assessing the pps cooling performance based on key parameters must be proposed given the fact that the specific device currently used is difficult to obtain and the resulting data are often unable to be used or compared lastly the standardised construction methods based on different types of ppss should be formulated to avoid performance damage 6 2 periodic maintenance during operation 6 2 1 sufficient periodic maintenance based on the understanding of clogging process despite the investigation of various periodic maintenance methods table 8 pps performance recovery is not completely reversible and is largely dependent on the type of pps and clogging conditions coughlin et al 2012 drake and bradford 2013 however the clogging process under various practice environment is still not systemically studied although the degree of clogging and the related permeability coefficient change of ppss has been addressed by many indoor or field studies the experimental setups by using different types of pollution resources used e g sands and clays and variable permeability test methods fall head or constant head method are largely different from clogging process under local environment however field monitoring has revealed that the pps clogging processes under interval rainfalls could be divided into three stages pre clogged transitional and clogging based on the maximum relative water content 0 11 m3 m3 along the pps the maintenance should be scheduled once the transition begins razzaghmanesh and borst 2018 additionally a few predictive models have been put forth but with limited application due to the lack of sufficient long term validated support data these include the simple four parameter black box regression model for predicting the physical clogging as a function of cumulative volume and climatic conditions yong et al 2013 and an empirical theory based formulation derived from the kozeny carmen equation which considers the initial vertical permeability porosity amount of clogging material retained and an experimental empirical coefficient tan et al 2003 these findings are helpful for identifying the optimal maintenance times and methods considering the variation in clogging sediments diversified periodic maintenance methods based on a strong understanding of clogging process are necessary to fit different application conditions while more effective methods that have been readily adopted must also be further studied in addition proper maintenance methods are essential to avoid premature failure for instance vacuum sweeping may not be capable of dislodging and extracting strongly trapped clogged materials whereas pressure washing at high strengths may result in increased environmental pollution when clogged materials are pushed down into the groundwater sandoval et al 2020b 6 2 2 water supplementation to enhance pps evaporative cooling performance water supplementation methods such as artificial watering enhancing pps evaporative cooling must be further studied watering details including start time duration and water temperatures based on local climate should be integrated to derive the optimal evaporative cooling strategy while minimising water reports have shown that daily 6 mm wetting over a duration of 10 min in the morning preferentially between 08 00 10 00 guaranteed the maximum evaporative cooling for 24 h during a heat wave in zurich kubilay et al 2021 however additional studies focusing on pps watering methods in other climate regions remain relatively rare during practice water sprinkling facilities could be combined with irrigation systems of the green belt via automatic pipes or supported by local pavement cleaning staffs for applications with larger areas and without green facilities water trucks for municipal sprinklers can also be used as primary supply source hendel et al 2015 further the reclaimed water from buildings or stored rainwater can be used to further decrease irrigated water demand additionally methods such as the use of capillary columns inside the pps structure to transport the deep water up to the surface for evaporation has resulted in a surface cooling of 15 3 compared to that of the impervious pavements liu et al 2020 6 3 pre and post implementation evaluation system 6 3 1 pps pre evaluation for optimizing design existing studies on the integration of pps parameters into simulation models for design optimisation remains limited table 10 presents the pre evaluation methods for assessing pps environmental impacts among these the swmm model is widely applied to examine the runoff control capability of a pps based on different structures and rainfall conditions although this model considers sewer systems in the simulation of rainfall for complex land use areas it does not consider soil type or spatial distribution other simulation methods have also been effective in estimating stormwater management but with limited validation and few applications liu et al 2016 yang et al 2015 therefore methods of pps optimisation for meeting different local rainfall conditions remain extremely limited for locations that experience light rainfall pps permeability coefficient could relatively low as high values may compromise the strength as the duration and interval of rainfall have a significant impact on the pps surface runoff further studies must be conducted considering the soil conditions water storage and permeability of each layer fu et al 2020 regarding the evaporative cooling performance of ppss although the thermal models of pavements have been well identified the lack of thermophysical properties and hydrological data are the main obstacle to accurately predict the cooling potential under different climatic conditions qin and hiller 2014 wang et al 2019b some studies have considered a few thermal physical properties e g the albedo and emissivity however because the other properties have been overlooked the resulting accuracy of these assessment may be limited wei and he 2013 moreover these thermal properties could also change due to water content variation analogously despite the models that integrate evaporation data when estimating the thermal environmental index changes e g near surface air temperature and wet bulb globe temperature table 6 evaporation data extracted via experiments and regression formulas primarily affect the simulated accuracy as these methods were conducted under set of certain conditions and thus have an inherently limited range of application moreover the lack of calibration and validation data for these models also creates barriers in the study of the ppss a more effective pre evaluation system considering the ideal pps design e g set areas and degree of dispersion must be further studied to mitigate urban flooding and uhi effect in particular the performance of pps under dry and wet conditions as well as its effect on the thermal environment and human thermal comfort requires further exploration all such studies should be based on in depth analysis of evaporation rates and thermophysical properties of pps 6 3 2 pps post evaluation for assessing the performance changes in the system the actual performance under outdoor conditions requires post evaluation due to the large influence of clogging and ageing on ppss typical long term field monitoring showed in table 1 with an emphasis on surface runoff over a duration of 1 4 year has illustrated that clogging substantially impact pps hydrological properties with a permeability coefficient loss up to 85 kumar et al 2016 conversely changes in the evaporative cooling performance of ppss have over time not been reported similarly the changes of water absorption and retention properties due to clogging and their impacts on evaporative cooling performance has scarcely been investigated meanwhile whether periodic rainfall can supply adequate water for evaporation in addition to how best to supplement water supplies remains largely unknown given that the degrees of clogging and aging for different types of ppss under different practice environments vary a lot a long term performance monitoring system is essential to predict the attenuation of key parameters as well as formulating the most suitable periodic clean methods meanwhile the data obtained by long term field monitoring can be used to build verify or modify models and empirical equations while optimising pps design 7 summary and conclusions as a major technique for urban stormwater management and urban overheating mitigation ppss have been studied in more than 30 countries and is continuously revamped the present review provides insights regarding problems in achieving performance synergism of ppss by reviewing benefits interpreting key parameters highlighting limitations and providing pertinent suggestions in research and practice the major contributions are listed below based on the literature 570 papers ppss have been demonstrated to be an excellent system for stormwater management through the aspects of urban flooding control table 1 pollutants removal table 2 and uhi mitigation through the surface evaporative cooling table 3 it was found that the application areas of ppss are primarily located in relatively warm areas receiving ample year round precipitation and are comprised of three major types pap pcp and pip pps contribution vary by materials structures and the local environment moreover compared to the well recognised stormwater management practices 502 papers only 60 papers covered the topic of uhi and most were based on surface cooling while papers on nearby air cooling and thermal comfort remain relatively limited key parameters of pps controlling urban stormwater management and urban overheating mitigation include the hydrological properties consisting of the permeability coefficient water absorption and retention evaporation rate thermophysical properties structure design and clogging resistance were interpreted urban stormwater management showed a significant correlation with permeability coefficient and water absorption and retention in contrast water absorption and retention evaporation rate and thermophysical properties were considered for uhi mitigation these ecological benefits can be achieved by considering both the structure design of pps and its ability to prevent congestion it was observed that few studies coordinated multivariate parameters to optimise the performance of the pps however most studies only focused on the pps permeability although large and effective pore connection can improve permeability this does not indicate that the pps exhibits good cooling potential in the design and construction stages key parameters must be controlled to balance these two benefits more importantly the practice environment including the climatic and site condition pollution and functional use should be considered for its highly connectivity to the performance exhibition and maintenance methods of ppss large variations in pps features reported in previous studies also confirmed the need for standardisation in terms of permeability the standard is quite mature for cross comparison but they still vary from real conditions for the cooling performance results of existing studies are not comparable and evaluation methods remain limited notably the water absorption and retaining properties thermal properties and the local weather conditions work together to determine the evaporation rate furthermore whether the structure of the pps can promote the evaporation process requires further investigation the development of an ideal pps evaluation system must be prioritised based on the pre and post evaluation system however to build this the long term monitoring that considers both the permeability and cooling potential of the pps is required to determine whether the pps could serve well under the consideration of clogging and aging an ideal periodic maintenance method must be further studied and determined to help modify pps design and assess cost efficiency overall this review has increased the collective under understanding and provided a valid approach for improving pps performance both of which are imperative to facilitate the development

15708,pervious pavement system pps is a suitable alternative technique for mitigating urban flooding and urban heat island uhi simultaneously however existing literature has revealed that ppss cannot achieve the expected permeability and evaporation to overcome this gap this study presents an elaborate review of problems associated with ppss and highlights its benefits to stormwater management and uhi mitigation we determined key parameters of ppss that could influence urban flooding and uhi mitigation including hydrological properties thermal physical properties structure design and clogging resistance we identified the co benefits approach of pps towards performance synergism on stormwater management and uhi mitigation from quality controlled design and fabrication periodic maintenance and effective evaluation system based on practice environments the results indicate that existing studies of ppss primarily focus on permeability while little emphasis is given to the evaporative cooling performance leading to a biased development with a loss of test standards and regulations that cannot control the cooling potential of the system the performance synergism of permeability and evaporative cooling in pps should be studied further while considering quality control of the materials and in situ practice design parameter controls with commonly used standards during fabrication periodic maintenance during operation and pre and post evaluation processes of ppss should work collectively to achieve optimal benefits and reduced costs keywords pervious pavement system urban heat

suspended solids uhi urban heat island data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction owing to rapid urbanization impervious artificial surfaces have replaced natural soils causing irregularities in the natural ecosystem and water evaporation this also causes various urban issues including urban heat islands uhis and urban flooding he et al 2022a moftakhari et al 2018 uhis seriously impact the levels of outdoor thermal comfort and cause heat related morbidities furthermore the increased outdoor temperature leads to increased use of air conditioning indoors which increases the peak electricity demand during summers and results in rising cooling energy consumption of buildings he et al 2022b santamouris et al 2015 additionally the overexploitation of water resources and overuse of impermeable materials suppress the replenishment of groundwater and increase surface runoff leading to urban flooding thus threatening safety of the local population jiang et al 2018 flooding and heat island problems are more challenging in hot humid areas where the majority of citizens suffer from heavy rainfall in summers and from hot and humid weather to address these issues many strategies have been proposed and some of them have already been successfully implemented for improving environmental quality the strategies include the application of water sensitive urban design along with promoting low impact development and establishment of eco garden and sustainable cities both water sensitive urban design and low impact development are effective in hot and humid areas because these strategies use infiltration friendly and evaporable materials to mitigate urban flooding and uhis simultaneously the replacement of impervious artificial pavements by pervious pavement systems ppss has great potential for environmental sustainability retrofit because typically pavements account for 20 40 of the total area of a city wu and thompson 2013 fig 1 presents how ppss contribute to urban flooding and uhi mitigation simultaneously pores of pps allow water to infiltrate into underlying soils promoting groundwater recharge and alleviating surface run off moreover the pores inside the materials and structure can retain a part of the water for evaporation which further cools the pavement and the air near its surface thus promoting uhi mitigation therefore efforts have been made to improve the capabilities and feasibility of application of ppss to mitigate uhi and urban flooding the research topics mainly cover i hydrological properties including permeability and water retention ii thermal properties including albedo conductivity heat capability and evaporative cooling effect and iii maintenance including clogging and cleaning methods and durability these research topics are studied considering the mechanical properties of the pps many review articles have reported on pps benefits barriers and future development from different perspectives including the performances of infiltration cooling and the clogging mechanism according to the criteria in section 2 a total of 32 reviews have been conducted 25 of which have focused on stormwater management and only 6 focusing on uhi mitigation specifically santamouris 2013 and qin 2015 critically reviewed cool pavements and their ability to mitigate urban overheating and presented the benefits and future research directions such two studies have confirmed that ppss can induce a cooling effect as a result of the evaporation of water inside the structure making it more appropriate for rainy and humid areas hence improving the capillary ability to increase the water content and evaporation rate in outdoor conditions is crucial although many other reviews have focused on the applications of pcps most of them have emphasised the influence of material type and mix design on the stormwater management strength clogging and durability chandrappa and biligiri 2016 kia et al 2017 for instance xie et al 2019 examined the environmental benefits of pcps on the stormwater management uhi mitigation traffic noise reduction and skid resistance improvement emphasis has been placed on the impacts of mix design pavement design construction practice and service environment on the durability of pcps without significantly increasing its maintenance requirements or compromising its infiltration properties furthermore despite increased emphasise on the benefits of stormwater management and uhi mitigation in existing studies the key parameters for controlling these benefits remain overlooked in particular without a clear identification of key parameters the synergistic performances of stormwater management and uhi mitigation remain unpractical whilst existing study has reported pps s excellent permeability the pps can only exhibit poor cooling performances wang et al 2018 other relevant studies have further illustrated that although increasing pores size in the structure is conducive to water percolation it weakens evaporative cooling performance and system strength wang et al 2019a notably smaller pores ensure better water retaining properties avoiding excessively lowing pps strength however smaller pores have a higher likelihood to be blocked leading to a sharp decrease in permeability built upon academic outcomes various technical standards and regulations have been formulated and implemented however such standards and regulations vary with countries and regions and most of them emphasise permeability performance with less attention paid to evaporative cooling effect for instance the american society for testing and materials astm c1701m 17a astm 2017 and astm c1781 c1781m 18e1 astm 2018 standards specify the indoor and outdoor test methods for measuring pps permeability coefficient respectively the cjj t188 2012 mhurd 2012a and cjj t190 2012 mhurd 2012b standards in china regulate the design and construction method of ppss and stipulate that the permeability coefficient of pervious paving materials cannot be 0 01 cm s the england bs7533 13 2009 bsi 2009 standard suggests pps construction based on soil conditions the only consideration of permeability for stormwater management leads to an obvious bias in technical implementation even although pps has been widely regarded as an effective technique in green rating systems only few standards including gb t50378 2019 mhurd 2019b and jgj286 2013 mhurd 2013 in china recommend the adoption of ppss for improving the permeability and thermal environment of construction sites and regulating the evaporation of pps 1 3 kg m2 d furthermore the lack of maintenance leads to the clogging of pps further restricting its acceptance by stakeholders existing studies have indicated the importance of pps performance synergy on urban flooding and uhi mitigation therefore it is expected that the pps should be well designed well constructed and well maintained until it is recycled however dispersive research topics as well as limited standards and technical regulations are inadequate for support pps to achieve so to overcome these research gaps this review here aims to clarify the research progress in pps development with respect to its implementation and to reveal the approach of performance synergism on urban flooding and uhi mitigation this paper is completed with a stringent analysis of 570 papers the research progress benefits and key parameters have been reviewed to frame an effective approach for understanding pps performance synergy this review article is structured as follows first ppss were reviewed based on existing literature with the consideration of urban stormwater management and uhi mitigation section 3 second pps benefits in aspects of urban flooding and uhis mitigation were summarised section 4 third key parameters that control these benefits of were identified section 5 to address the following questions i why are these parameters important ii how can we approach and improve the parameters based on different design criteria iii are there any relevant methods and standards for regulating these parameters furthermore an approach was framed based on the gaps and solutions from the perspective of co benefits approach better maintenance and an effective evaluation system to realise the performance synergy of pps on urban flooding and uhi mitigation based on local climate section 6 2 methodology in recent years many studies have been devoted to the development of ppss typical surface typology and structures of ppss are shown in fig 2 the surface materials of ppss could be mainly divided into three categories i e pervious interlocking pavements pip pervious concrete pavements pcp and pervious asphalt pavements pap the pervious surface paving materials of pip are commonly pre made in factories using concrete or ceramic materials before being assembled on site through interlocking pavers the surface materials of pcp and pap are entirely built on site usually adopting open graded coarse single sized aggregate gravel without fine aggregate i e sand this is similar to the construction of conventional concrete and asphalt each of these pps surface materials can be designed with different porosity shapes and colours based on need the structure of pps depends on the pervious materials used e g crushed stone as they form the pathways for water infiltration structures can be divided into the following three types based on the site permeability conditions 1 full permeability 2 partial permeability and 3 no infiltration permeability for partial and no infiltration structures a pipe with pores is assembled on the soil layer for water drainage thus improving its infiltration capability fig 3 presents a flowchart of this current review given that many articles use the terms permeable pavements and porous pavements to represent the pps sprouse et al 2020 both permeable and porous were included in the search here to expand the research range in the mainstream databases including google scholar scopus web of science sciencedirect springer and wiley for accurately tracking pps research progress the screening standard used in the present study was as follows i articles written in the english language and ii focused on pps considering stormwater management and uhi articles using pps to analyse other themes such as low impact development were excluded based on these criteria a total of 570 articles were reviewed 3 research on pervious pavements to identify the application areas of pps across different climates study areas were generated based on the köppen climate classification map fig 4 which is widely used in atmospheric research and classified based on patterns of average precipitation temperature and natural vegetation peel et al 2007 the sites of the experimental analyses and case studies for simulation were adopted as the locations that were targeted on the map for theorical papers with sites specified the first author s affiliation was identified as the study area furthermore to clearly identify the type of selected articles the selected papers were categorised based on research methods and themes i e experiment based simulative based and theoretical based with focus on either the stormwater management or uhi mitigation or considering both topics overall ppss have been studied in 32 countries with different climate conditions china and the united states of america presented the most significant contributions with 180 and 127 articles respectively followed by european countries with a total of 69 articles in these studies areas with tropical and humid subtropical climates were the hotspots of pps research covering the southern regions of china and the us as well as germany and france these areas are relatively warm and have enough precipitation all year round pps seems unsuitable in other areas such as tropical and subtropical desert climates owing to the nil precipitation alternatively in high latitude areas mainly with continental subarctic climate anti freezing measures need to be considered for pps implementation furthermore articles statistics was considered from multiple perspectives including different types of pps pavements and surface materials methods and topics pcp is the most common type of pps included in 254 articles owing to its wide adoption relatively low cost construction and limited labour requirement pip is the second most applied pps type included in 97 papers where it is pre made in factories and needs special mechanical equipment and is difficult to prepare in the laboratory pap presents the least investigated typology included in 82 papers likely due to its complex construction procedure furthermore 88 articles dealt with at least two types of pps to investigate their performance in 49 articles the pps type was not identified and the authors only stated the parameters used for the research mostly for simulated studies with respect to study methods the experimental methods and simulative analyses are considered in 448 and 78 articles respectively moreover 44 articles were thermotical including the mechanisms and thermotical design methods with different parameters life cycle assessments and reviews stormwater management are the predominant study topic of ppss with 502 papers while uhi comprised 60 articles and only 8 of them focus on both the main content of the selected articles includes monitoring ppss performance investigating the influencing factors and innovating new techniques to improve their benefits in particular 300 articles are published on the permeability coefficient mainly focusing on methods to achieve the targeted goals and improve upon them with the balance of strength as well as the permeability changes under different conditions including clogging 63 papers and freezing thawing 16 papers conditions a further 80 and 41 articles are dedicated to urban flooding alleviation and uhi mitigation after adopting ppss respectively with emphasis on the surface volume and peak flow decrease and surface temperature decrease and air temperature reduction in addition pollution inhibition also received a lot of attention with 91 articles published on this topic moreover there are 32 review articles with only 6 focusing on uhi mitigation and the remainder focusing on the stormwater management with emphasis on flooding mitigation or pollution removal the rest of the articles mostly focus on assessing regulating or improving the parameters including the water absorption and retaining properties 12 articles evaporation rate 28 articles thermophysical properties 9 articles structure design 22 articles and water reuse 12 articles 4 benefits of pervious pavement systems pps in city construction 4 1 urban stormwater management the connected or half connected pores inside the pps form channels for water infiltration and storage zhu et al 2019 notably the volume of rainwater retained inside the pps structure has been reported as 16 66 hernández crespo et al 2019 and numerous studies have demonstrated that this volume can effectively decrease the drain pressure through total runoff volume and peak flow thereby reducing the risk of urban flooding table 1 lists the representative studies that have comprehensively assessed the pps performance during rainfall events through simulating and monitoring rainfall conditions under different types of pps it was found that the pps could effectively reduce total runoff volume and peak flow by up to 97 and 93 respectively rodriguez rojas et al 2020 while providing rainfall runoff attenuation of more than 40 of the total rainfall retained within the structure alsubih et al 2017 compared to the referenced impervious pavement furthermore pps is more effective in response to rainfall events with shorter return periods as it significantly reduces runoff volume and peak discharge but less so for heavy storms with longer return periods wang et al 2019c in addition the increase of the urban population and traffic density leads to the accumulation of more pollutants on the surface of pps such as total suspended solids tss heavy metals including cu cd pb and zn chemical oxygen demand cod and nutrients including total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and ammonia nh4 n causing serious water pollution tirpak et al 2020 contributing to specific pore characteristics pollutants can be effectively retained inside the pps using interception filtration sedimentation nutrient transformation and microbial removal singare et al 2011 table 2 summarises the purification effect of ppss on stormwater runoff quality revealing an effective tss removal of 45 100 however tss particles are continuously accumulated in connected and semi connected channels during rainfall events which is the primary source of blockage in ppss debnath and sarkar 2021 moreover removal efficiency of cod by different ppss varies from 9 to 60 in particular pap is a better alternative for pollutant removal because the binding medium in this pervious pavement easily forms silicide aluminum ferrite and other substances after hydration which contributes to the adsorption process of cod winston and hunt 2017 regardless of the pps type the heavy metals in rainwater runoff namely cd cu pb and zn can be effectively removed by 41 99 61 99 45 99 and 46 99 respectively although pps has a controlling effect on nutrient salt pollutants in rainwater runoff the removal efficiency fluctuates greatly with different ppss for example the tp and tn removal efficiencies of the systems can vary with 6 68 and 5 99 respectively notably once the water volume surpasses the pps storage capability it can gradually infiltrate into the base layer either for groundwater recharge or reuse collected using municipal pipes the harvested water from the pps can be collected for agriculture irrigation or as a heat resource or non potable water source for buildings antunes et al 2020 del castillo garcía et al 2013 the energy of water stored inside the structure can also be harvested by a heat exchange medium del castillo garcía et al 2013 for example charlesworth et al 2017 reviewed a technique of ground source heat systems beneath the pps for moving the heated or cooled water taking advantage of the natural heat stored below the ground this technique is proved to be more efficient than traditional soil or air source heat systems since heat is transferred from the water inside the structure of the pps more efficiently than it is in soil or air 4 2 urban heat island mitigation under dry conditions i e without evaporation ppss intensify uhi effects owing to their low specific heat capacity and albedo compared to those of impervious pavements asaeda and ca 2000 hu et al 2017 li et al 2013a during rainfall the infiltrated water can partially remove heat from the pps through heat exchange consequently the retained water can be evaporated out of the pps converting the incident energy into latent energy which can cool the surface table 3 lists the representative research conducted to identify the thermal performance of pps and its impact on the surrounding environment in different locations worldwide temperature comparisons of ppss conducted using attached thermocouples between dry and wet conditions or with impervious pavements under the same environment are the most direct methods for demonstrating the cooling performance among which indoor sample experiments that adopted pps surface paving materials as the research objects have demonstrated a surface cooling of up to 20 c compared to their own dry conditions wang et al 2019a outdoor samples or field experiments also demonstrated a good cooling performance of pps which could effectively cool the surface from 0 6 14 c compared to that observed on impervious pavements however ppss show limited cooling effects on the air as demonstrated in field experiments due to the limited geometry and obstruction by ambient environments as shown in the table 3 wang et al 2018 established that ppss with a plain size of 4 4 m could achieve an air temperature decrease of 1 c compared to dry conditions and referenced dense concrete at a height of 0 3 0 9 m moreover the black globe temperature typically adopted to assess the heat exposure was lower up to 3 c at a height of 0 5m compared to dry conditions similar results were observed by li et al 2013c in which the near surface air temperature at 5 1cm of pps was slightly lower less than 1 c than that of impervious concrete moreover a simulation by nakayama and fujita 2010 revealed that after a rainfall event the surface temperature of the water holding block was 5 20 c lower than that of other engineered pavements further the air temperature at a height of 1 m above the water holding block was 1 2 c lower than that of lawn areas and 3 5 c lower than that of building rooftops the different cooling effects were mainly due to the different materials and structures of ppss water availability near the surface and the practice environment specifically the cooling effects are highly dependent on the moisture availability near the surface layer since the evaporated water does not need to overcome large internal resistance inside the materials during vapor diffusion this was confirmed in a study by wang et al 2018 in which the cooling times of pip the time during which surface temperature of wet conditions is lower than that of dry conditions were six times longer than that of pcp in the same environment owing to the high water absorption and retaining capabilities furthermore although the high surface albedo of pps could weaken its evaporation rate it still achieves better cooling performance because of the prolonged high evaporation stage increasing energy consumption compared to the low albedo condition wang et al 2019b 5 key parameters owing to different manufacturing processes pps properties vary markedly e g effective air voids of 15 30 permeability of 20 500 m day compressive strengths of 5 5 20 5 mpa and flexural strengths of 1 3 8 mpa xie et al 2019 changes in these properties are highly correlated with pps pore structures including pore types connected pores half connected pores or closed pores porosity effective porosity pore size and tortuosity zhong et al 2018 zhong and wille 2016 connected pores form the channels for water to pass through ultimately determining the permeability of the system zhong et al 2016 both connected and half connected pores can further determine the evaporative cooling performance of the system garcia et al 2015 the pore character also affects the mechanical and thermal physical properties of the system chen et al 2019a moreover advanced techniques such as the mercury intrusion test and x ray based tests allow the measurement of these pore characteristics for better understanding the reasons causing pps property variation kayhanian et al 2012 however the pore size is generally randomised and is difficult to control during the manufacturing process samples used for these tests were small and could bring bias easily thus beyond pore size other key parameters are needed to exhibit environmental benefits and more importantly for quality control this section focuses on the key parameters of ppss relevant to urban stormwater management and uhi mitigation consisting of hydrological and thermophysical properties structure and clogging resistance 5 1 hydrological properties 5 1 1 permeability coefficient fig 5 a presents the infiltration process of pps during the rainfall where the results indicate that the pps permeability is generally measured by using the permeability coefficient metric cm s or mm s which is expressed as flow per unit of hydraulic gradient generally pps structures contains the surface layers the base layer and the sub grade layer a large number of connected pores large pore sizes and low tortuosity of pps structure can result in a high permeability coefficient the base layer that is often underlain by clastic rocks can form a large visible channel of connected pores similar to the base layer the sub grade i e the soil generally has good infiltration or can be assisted by municipal pipes for water removal from the pps rodriguez hernandez et al 2015 nevertheless large pores are improper for the surface layers of light traffic roads as pervious paving surface materials should not only consider permeability but should also meet the strength requirements 5 1 1 1 method for achieving permeability coefficient there are two approaches including mixture adjustment and new fillers that have been adopted to control the permeability coefficients of pervious paving materials the adoption of mixture adjustment is expected to optimise the structure of pervious paving materials sonebi and bassuoni 2013 yahia and kabagire 2014 specifically to obtain a certain permeability coefficient with an appropriate strength two estimation methods including the empirical formula method and the porosity based material design method have been widely adopted in the production of pc the empirical formula method delivers an empirical relationship between the mixture parameters and permeability coefficient for instance the linear regression formula developed by ibrahim et al 2014 exhibited an r2 of 0 75 between the permeability coefficient and cement content water content and aggregate size distribution however this empirical formula method is limited by the aggregate type and specific parameters ranges in comparison the porosity based material design method prioritises the total porosity as the main design parameter since it is a key pore structure feature of pervious paving materials that dictates its permeability and there is a well developed relationship between porosity and permeability deo and neithalath 2011 sumanasooriya and neithalath 2011 yahia and kabagire 2014 based on a volume ratio of stacked state coarse aggregates the volume of cementitious materials is calculable by subtracting the target porosity and the dosage of cementitious material and water can be determined according to the water cement ratio the compaction method should be critically considered during material production due to its affects on the desired porosity pereira da costa et al 2021 however the precision of this method is relatively low as the vertical connected pore distribution is highly connected to the permeability coefficient martin et al 2014 the measured inter connected porosity of pc was generally 4 7 smaller than the target value 15 25 xie et al 2020 an alternative method involves the direct use of volume ratios for coarse aggregate and cement paste and hypothesise all the aggregates as spheres in which the impact of cement paste on the packing of coarse aggregates is neglected this method has been validated with a high accuracy for continuous and total porosities of 17 2 and 26 5 against the desired values of 17 and 25 5 nguyen et al 2014 the second method suggests new materials as fillers or major items to increase the large pores inside the pervious materials thereby expecting a higher permeability coefficient table 4 two types of fillers i e the fine and coarse fillers were mainly adopted fine fillers including fly ash silica fume latex polymer and paper industry waste were adopted to replace the partial fine traditional aggregates sands and cement aiming to increase the adhesion of coarse aggregates with less fine aggregates the permeability coefficient could up to 1 04 cm s with the use of fine fillers like palm oil fuel alternatively coarse fillers such as steel lag and seashell by products aim to directly replace coarse aggregates and increase the pore size for instance using 70 by weight ceramic waste as the raw material for pervious bricks the permeability coefficient and flexural strength of pervious bricks can reach up to 0 15 cm s and 33 mpa respectively zhou et al 2018 however inappropriate substitution ratios of additional fillers could damage the structural strength performance especially with paper industry waste palm oil fuel and discarded porcelain whereas the permeability coefficient could be largely improved it should be noted that replacing 40 weight of fine aggregates with palm oil fuel reduced the comprehensive strength by 49 but increased the permeability coefficient by 132 ibrahim and abdul razak 2016 5 1 1 2 method for testing the permeability coefficient once surface materials were selected testing and regulating the permeability of the pps were of concern along with the use of modern techniques that required no destruction including the use of computational fluid dynamic simulations with x ray tomography analyses computed tomography imaging and slice imaging to simulate the permeability coefficient ni et al 2021 zhang et al 2018a numerous standards and regulations have been formulated and some representative ones used worldwide are listed in table 5 among these methods constant variable head methods are the most widely used for indoor tests zhang et al 2020a the single or double rings methods notably similar to the fall head method are most commonly reported in the literature for outdoor tests moreover to measure highly porous media i e the sub grade of ppss with a permeability of 10 8 10 4 m2 a simplified method using a venturi tube to gauge the flowing gas has been put forward to address the time record error caused by the aforementioned methods above qin et al 2018b notably the guidelines in china indicate that the permeability coefficient of ppss should be above 0 01 cm s however the effectiveness of these reported methods remains unclear previous studies found that the permeability coefficients measured using the falling head method were 100 300 higher than those measured using the constant head method although the former is more convenient to use zhang et al 2020a furthermore the permeability coefficient was found to be dependent on the head level used in the test the permeability coefficient under a low pressure of constant heat method i e 2 cm is much closer to that of the fall head method lederle et al 2020 qin et al 2015 thus a low head level is recommended since rain events typically result in the accumulation of small amounts of water on the surface of ppss another concern revolves around setting of the sample the infiltration capacity test results of saturated and unsaturated ppss can differ by 300 boogaard and lucke 2019 moreover leakage on the side of the sample due to the rough surface can also create error a comparison among the constant head falling head modified astm c1701m 17a astm 2017 and constant flow methods revealed that errors caused by sample to sample variations were greater than that of method uncertainty showing an average deviation of 20 therefore if the permeability capacity of an unsaturated pps was used as the design input for computer models the permeability capacity may be significantly overestimated as the actual outdoor conditions are not considered in the existing permeability test methods rainfall simulation tests were carried out by using either samples or field experiments to examine the dynamic permeability rate and study the influence of rainfall conditions i e rainfall density and duration on the runoff control capability of ppss a representative rainfall simulation infiltrometer was invented by nichols et al 2014 it contained an inner and out ring that were separated by 3 m thick sheeting with pvc pipes set above them water flowing from the holes on the lower surface of the pvc pipe was passed through two horizontal wire gauze sheets to break the flow into droplets to simulate the rainfalls once the water started visibly ponding the pavement surface outside the framed area water flow and time are recorded and the maximum infiltration capacity and permeability coefficient of the pps are identified the permeability coefficient under the double ring test was 60 greater than that obtained using the rainfall simulation method and a strong positive correlation r2 0 85 was revealed between the two methods rodriguez hernandez et al 2015 5 1 2 water absorption and retaining properties water availability is a pre factor that affects the evaporative cooling performance of ppss determined by using the water absorption rate and saturated water content fig 5 a wu et al 2018 during natural rainfall or artificial watering the water inside the connected and half connected pores travels downwards due to capillary action and gravity until the pps achieves saturation tziampou et al 2020 afterwards once evaporation begins the water inside the pores transforms from liquid to vapour and a dynamic liquid flow driven by capillary action will be formed inside the materials to meet the upward demand of surface evaporation aboufoul et al 2019 however as evaporation proceeds along with a decrease in the available water the evaporation front is forced back inside the materials largely increasing the evaporation resistance and directly leading to a low evaporation rate kuehni et al 2016 accordingly it is deduced that water absorption rates determine how fast water can be obtained during rainfall or artificial watering moreover the water absorption rate and retention together determine how long the hydrological connection can be maintained the results in table 3 indicate that pervious materials with high capillary absorption rate 2 040 kg m2 s0 5 and water retention 121 07kg m3 can maintain a large hydraulic continuity for nearly 12 h to support a high evaporation rate 0 85kg m2 h under typical hot humid areas wang et al 2019a in comparision when the water inside a pc is below 76 mm evaporation is insignificant with respect to surface cooling nemirovsky et al 2013 existing studies have reported two methods for water availability improvement including the use of high absorptive fillers and adoption of water spray to meet evaporation demand high absorptive fillers including fly ash silica fume and biomass are capable of increasing the capillary pores and promoting water retaining for instance by using these fillers the saturated water content of pervious paving materials increased up to 0 32 g cm3 while the water absorption height reached 70 of the material height table 4 wang et al 2021 sprinkling wastewater at intervals a representative of water spraying techniques has been reported to reduce the convective heat and increase the latent heat where a surface cooling of 2 20 c was achieved compared to dry conditions table 3 yamagata et al 2008 wang et al 2019a certain methods such as modification of pervious material structures to hold enough water or exposing more moisture to the atmosphere could also achieve good results for instance sealing the five sides of pc while leaving the face open could retain 6 97 kg m3 of water and reduce the surface temperature by 3 13 c compared to dry conditions bao et al 2019 for studying the water retention capabilities the rainfall simulation test method is robust enough to meet the conditions of pervious pavements during rainfall or watering although few to no standards or regulations have been implemented the integrated immersion test is also considered effective to assess the saturated water content with less time cost wang et al 2019b for water absorption rate test the partial immersion test is most similar to the rainfall simulation test with only the upper surface in contact with water the partial immersion test can be used to test the capillary water absorption rate as per the iso15148 2002 iso 2002 standard comparison among the integral immersion partial immersion and rainfall simulation tests in the same indoor environment revealed that the partial immersion test had the highest accuracy for qualitatively assessing the water absorption and retention properties of pervious paving materials wang et al 2019b a high accuracy of partial immersion method has been reported in analysing the water absorption rate and retention of several widely used pervious paving materials in hot humid areas in china the properties ranged from 0 01 to 2 04 kg m2 s0 5 and 101 36 to 121 07 kg m3 respectively with standard deviations ranging from 0 to 5 64 wang et al 2019a 5 1 3 evaporation rate the evaporative cooling effect of a pps can be measured using the evaporation rate as it is defined by the mass of water evaporated from the pps per square meter per hour kg m2 h fig 5 b the evaporation process can be divided into two stages the first stage is the high evaporation rate stage when the drying front is near the surface and the water level can adequately support evaporation during this process the meteorological parameters are main factors that affect the evaporation rate along with water availability ben neriah et al 2014 following the pattern of solar radiation air temperature partial pressure of water vapour wind speed zhang et al 2018c pps evaporation rates during the first stage have been reported up to 0 9 kg m2 h similar to the water evaporation rate of the same environment wang et at 2019a the second stage occurs when the water level can no longer support evaporation and the evaporation front fades back into the internal surface of the pps the start of the second stage depends on both the porosity and tortuosity of the materials owing to high resistance in the materials the evaporation rate will decrease and eventually reach zero aboufoul et al 2019 garcia et al 2015 table 3 exhibits the types and experimental set of typical studies on evaporative cooling performance of pps with most of them based on surface paving materials moreover indoor sample experiment using an electronic balance is the most common method for measuring evaporation rates and analysing the impact of different factors on the evaporative cooling potential novel methods based on the principle of balance have been adopted to measure heavy samples overcoming limitation of the range and accuracy of balance for instance the apparatus that hung two columns of the same weight and dimensions in balance has been adopted to study the evaporation rate of pc with one column containing pc and crushed stone and the other only containing crushed stone but with a mini low profile load cell set on the bottom to form the counterbalance once the pc has been wetted the tension gaps of these two columns can be collected at interval times to calculate the evaporation rate of the pc syrrakou and pinder 2014 however the test methods of measuring in situ evaporation rate remain limited specifically the humidity balance method through monitoring air temperatures and relative air humidity gaps between the tunnel entrance and exit at interval times has shown to be an effective way for assessing evaporation rates in field nevertheless this method requires additional verification since humidity is significantly impacted by wind speeds and temperatures starke et al 2010 table 6 presents simulation methods for estimating the evaporation rates of pps including surface energy and water balance methods and adopting regression formulas which either from experiments or refer to the method used for soil evaporation calculation with absent parameters decided by experimental data for the surface energy balance method important components of the energy balance such as the convective heat flux and downward heat flux into the ppss are coupled with the evaporation process and still need to be further tested zhang et al 2020b analogously the water balance method requires the same area of impervious permeable pavement as the reference which is difficult to find in practice brown and borst 2015 although the regression formula of evaporation resistance has been widely employed to calculate the soil evaporation rate the key coefficients i e the surface resistance and aerodynamic resistance are highly correlated to pore structure and must be regressed separately qin and hiller 2016 other methods such as direct regression of the relationship between surface wetting condition and water content of ppss have also revealed good results the standard deviation between simulated and measured surface temperature of the pps was 0 4 c wei and he 2013 however whether this method is sufficient to estimate the evaporation rate of a pps remains unclear as the surface humidity ratio is obtained through photos which is greatly impacted by the surface morphology the standardisation or regulation of pps evaporation rates remains relatively except that the chinese national standard jgj286 2013 design standard of thermal environment of urban residential areas mhurd 2013 regulates the evaporation rate of ppss should not be below 1 3 kg m2 d under typical summer days of hot humid areas in china 5 2 thermophysical properties thermal physical properties including albedo emissivity specific heat capacity heat conductivity coefficient and convective heat transfer coefficient are key parameters that affect the cooling potential of ppss and are essential for simulation table 7 presents the typical thermal properties of pps surface materials considering heterogeneity of pps the thermal properties of different pervious materials were largely divided the albedo with a range of 0 03 0 39 is not only dependent on the nature of the object itself i e surface condition including the colour and roughness but is also impacted by the practice condition e g weather and usage the albedo of pc was confirmed to be higher than that of pa with darker colour wu et al 2018 and decreased linearly with an increase of porosity ranging from 0 39 to 0 25 zhang et al 2015 meanwhile the albedo of pervious paving materials changes under varying weather conditions notably high in the early morning and late afternoons but consistently low during the mid day with a gap up to 0 10 li et al 2013b the indoor spectrophotometry test method has been widely adopted to measure the albedo referring to astm e903 12 astm 2012 and astm g159 98 astm 1998 at least three test points is suggested due to porous and uneven surface characters another field test method consists of a radiation detector li et al 2013b following the astm c1549 09 astm 2009a and astm e1918 16 standards astm 2016b but with high sample size requirement usually 4 4 m levelling the albedometer above the target and assembling a baffle around the lower detector of the albedometer to assist with receiving the reflected radiation only from the target could decrease the sample plain size to 1 1 m qin et al 2018a high emissivity also increases the cooling effects of the pps especially during night time the literature has also indicated that the emissivity of various pervious surface materials is 0 8 0 9 as most of them are cement based materials an ae1 emissometer can be adopted to measure this parameter referring to astm c1371 15 astm 2015 wang et al 2019a typical specific heat values of pervious materials in table 7 indicate that pervious paving materials have a stable but poor specific heat values that are close to 1000 j kg k empirical specific heat values were typically employed as specific test methods for pps materials have not been reported yet analogously conductive properties decrease with increasing porosity affected by the tortuosity of air voids chen et al 2019b the thermal conductivity of pervious paving materials is generally measured based on the steady state or transient heat transfer process chen et al 2019a the steady state method is relatively accurate but requires 5 6 h to reach equilibrium referring to astm c518 10 astm 2010 the transient heat transfer includes the transient plane source and thermal needle probe methods referring to astm d7984 16 astm 2016a and accuracies of both are limited due to existence of large sized pores higher roughness of pps increases the surface areas encountering air thereby increasing the convective heat transfer coefficient specific convective heat transfer coefficients of pps surface remain unqualified with most researchers instead using empirical formulas chen et al 2019a qin and hiller 2016 thus increasing the risk of deviation in simulated results due to the specific range of these formulas mirsadeghi et al 2013 5 3 structure design the structure design of ppss including layer thickness subgrade condition and the chosen aggregate should be considered to avoid surface runoff during different rainfall conditions and to optimise evaporative cooling performance to cool the surface liu et al 2021 a thicker pps structure can enlarge the infiltration path of water and effectively reduce the maximum runoff duration liu et al 2021 high underground water levels and low subgrade permeability can affect the exfiltration of water if no pipes are embedded winston et al 2018 zhang and chui 2020 moreover the appropriate aggregate would improve water flow and pollutant removal efficiency for instance rounded uniform coarse aggregate with low compaction was found to be beneficial to the hydraulic conductivity and turbulence of water flow koohmishi 2019 koohmishi and azarhoosh 2021 coarse aggregate with calcareous sources also demonstrated an improved pollutant removal of 98 99 and low leaching ability of heavy metals holmes et al 2017 in addition pps with a fine grained top layer and coarse grained bottom layer exhibited the highest evaporation rates which was 16 higher than that of pps with coarse grained aggregates indicating very low evaporation rates even lower than impermeable materials starke et al 2011 moreover specific attention was given to geofabrics one layer of pps structure made of woven or non woven permeable fabrics and usually set between the bedding layer and sub base layer or at the lower level separating the sub base from the sub grade fig 2 it was reported to have the ability to separate filter reinforce protect and drain the system scholz 2013 although geofabric can also seriously weaken the permeability of pps due to the variable properties the permeability coefficients of geotextile may range from 36 120 l m2 s boving et al 2008 according to its type weight and thickness geofabrics installed above sub grade were efficient at retaining sediment particles 33 mm in diameter a maximum of 8 3 of the total sediment mass was retained in the geofabric layer but over 90 of the sediments were trapped in the paving and bedding aggregate layers lucke and beecham 2011 moreover higher the retention of suspended solids on the geofabric the higher the risk of blocking pps similar results were confirmed by the test of two used nonwoven geotextiles used in pps with permeability coefficient of 150 and 163 mm s where the average and maximum water permeability loss was 24 6 and 51 respectively garcia casuso et al 2020 typical standards that regulate pps structure are listed in table 5 specifically three ppss are divided in the bs7533 13 2009 based on the permeability of the subgrade total partial and no permeability fig 2 once the character of the sub grade strength and permeability is evaluated the details of the materials to be used thickness of each layer and pipe sizes can be determined based on the local rainfall and loading conditions by referring to this standard 5 4 clogging resistance after the pps is installed its performance gradually reduces due to clogging therefore maintenance throughout the operational stage is essential clogging gradually decrease the connection inside the voids significantly damaging pps permeability evidence has shown that clogging could decrease the total surface runoff and peak flow reduction by 62 92 and 37 65 respectively cui et al 2019 similar field investigations on a 12 year serviced pc also revealed that only one fifth of the samples had 15 porosity which was below the expected threshold for pc and porosity near the top surface was consistently lower than that in deeper sections due to the clogging radlińska et al 2012 the interaction among clogging resources pps and climate conditions determine the clogging process among which clogging resources are widely distributed in the environment and have largely divided physical and chemical characteristics including the particulate matter from deposition e g sands and clays waterborne particulate matter that drains into pores and organic matter e g oil leak boving et al 2008 kumar et al 2016 among these particles fine particle deposits particles 38 µm readily enter the deeper pores leading to blockage kayhanian et al 2012 for instance clogging caused by fine clays per unit mass were about ten times greater than that of sands coughlin et al 2012 accordingly pps with bigger pore size and higher tortuosity are more easily clogged by fine grained materials and over 90 of the sediment is retained in the top two layers i e paving and bedding layers of ppss regardless of pavement blockage conditions cui et al 2019 kayhanian et al 2012 lucke and beecham 2011 the self collapse of voids caused by traffic aging and freezing thawing cycles are another main source of clogging chopra et al 2010 welker et al 2013 for instance ppss implemented for vehicle traffic are more easily clogged because of the heavy load high vibration frequency and input of clogging materials carried by wheels lin et al 2016 longer exposure to the sun could also accelerate the clogging process in ppss due to the erosion of pervious materials henderson and tighe 2012 kumar et al 2016 the modification of pps materials and structures in addition to adopting a cleaning method can help to avoid or reduce clogging changing the set of pps layers by using geotextile fabric one pervious material set between surface layers can stop clogging materials from percolating deeper scholz 2013 however the accumulation of deposits in the geotextile also increases the risk of permeability loss boving et al 2008 brown et al 2009 different cleaning methods such as pressure power washing vacuum sweeping surface cleaning using a stiff broom milling machine backwashing or a combination of these methods can also partially alleviate clogging table 8 however even with maintenance a certain of clogging remains unavoidable as no cleaning methods are 100 effective 6 formulating the co benefits approach of ppss towards performance synergism based on the analysis of benefits and related key parameters the largely divided properties revealed a lack of synergism between different parameters of pps during fabrication clogging illustrated improper maintenance methods during operation stage moreover the lack of effective evaluation system before and after implementation of pps is also the primary cause of biased development studies that systemically consider the permeability and evaporative cooling of ppss remains limited with only one study assessing the influence of structure on pps performance table 9 liu et al 2020 therefore it is essential to formulate the co benefits approach of ppss through quality control scheme and evaluation system during the design fabrication and operation stage based on the practice environment so as to achieve a synergistic performance of ppss for mitigating of urban flooding and uhi fig 6 this section will focus on the gaps between pps research and practice providing give suggestions for optimizing performance synergism 6 1 performance synergism of ppss during design and fabrication based on the environment 6 1 1 coordinating key parameters for achieving the best comprehensive ability most existing studies only focus on one or two pps parameters of stormwater management table 1 or uhi mitigation table 3 whereas integration of the pervious paving materials and structure to meet the quality of strength permeability and evaporative cooling performance has scarcely been investigated although the methods for achieving a high permeability with acceptable strength performance have already been realised see section 5 1 1 its inappropriate application could lead to a poor evaporative cooling performance for example high strength pc with a low tortuosity can largely increase permeability but allows for a lower levels of water storage that not enough to support the evaporation kia et al 2019 moreover elucidation of the construction of structure to the evaporative cooling performance of pps remains unclear despite the few studies indicating that the sub layers did help to improve the evaporative cooling performance nemirovsky et al 2013 starke et al 2011 also changing rules of key parameters under freeze thaw cycles are still scarce particular considering the application of pps has expanded to cold regions like canada the water in the pores of pps is cold consolidated with expanded volume resulting in local frost heaving and cracking of materials directly leading to mass loss and structural damage singh et al 2020 summaries from existing studies explain that the frost resistance of ppss can be improved by using fillers e g mineral powder and water reducing agent but data on the changes of key parameters along with the freeze thaw cycles are unavailable yang and jiang 2003 to unlock these technical barriers pps design method that balance these key parameters should be formulated during the design and fabrication stage the mix design methods of pervious paving materials and the set of structure that balance of strength permeability and evaporation is foundational to achieve the design target on the basis of clear understanding the influencing factors of each key parameter moreover the practice environment must be included in the assessment to further determine whether the pps has achieved the design goals permeability should coordinate with local rainfall conditions and the surrounding runoff to withstand the interval between rainfall especially in hot humid areas with frequent high intensity rainfall in summer surrounding runoff caused by local level and slope conditions of the terrain is the other factor that seriously impacts the penetration and should also be involved in the design stage hou et al 2019 meanwhile to achieve a good evaporative cooling performance the pps should not only be designed to contain sufficient water under rainfall to avoid frequent water replenishment but also be assessed under typical days of local climate to further check its suitability to fight against uhis since meteorological parameters have great impact on the evaporation for ppss applied in cold regions the primary structure should be implemented above the frozen line to avoid damage while allowing optimal operations in rainfall conditions nantasai and nassiri 2019 6 1 2 standards for controlling key parameters during design and fabrication although the permeability test methods have been standardised the different test procedures make the results difficult to compare e g the various water pressures used in these methods qin et al 2015 analogously the integral immersion test has been widely adopted to assess the water retention capabilities but the absorption rates have been neglected what s more despite the close correlation between these hydrological properties and rainfall density and duration all existing standardised hydrological test methods were conducted under constant water conditions which are notably distinct from different actual rainfall conditions evaporation rates have been studied by various sample or field experiments without any specific standards and are thus difficult to use for simulations and comparisons the onsite construction of ppss e g pc and pa mix composition mix delivery timing delays and queues placement practices and weather can greatly affect the above key parameters although standardised construction methods based on local climate conditions remain limited alshareedah et al 2020 putman and neptune 2011 to achieve successful practice of ppss regulations on permeability and evaporative cooling demands for each practice environment should be formulated to clarify the target design afterwards standardised test methods of permeability considering rainfall conditions and terrain features should be carried out to meet the design target further standardised rapid test methods for assessing the pps cooling performance based on key parameters must be proposed given the fact that the specific device currently used is difficult to obtain and the resulting data are often unable to be used or compared lastly the standardised construction methods based on different types of ppss should be formulated to avoid performance damage 6 2 periodic maintenance during operation 6 2 1 sufficient periodic maintenance based on the understanding of clogging process despite the investigation of various periodic maintenance methods table 8 pps performance recovery is not completely reversible and is largely dependent on the type of pps and clogging conditions coughlin et al 2012 drake and bradford 2013 however the clogging process under various practice environment is still not systemically studied although the degree of clogging and the related permeability coefficient change of ppss has been addressed by many indoor or field studies the experimental setups by using different types of pollution resources used e g sands and clays and variable permeability test methods fall head or constant head method are largely different from clogging process under local environment however field monitoring has revealed that the pps clogging processes under interval rainfalls could be divided into three stages pre clogged transitional and clogging based on the maximum relative water content 0 11 m3 m3 along the pps the maintenance should be scheduled once the transition begins razzaghmanesh and borst 2018 additionally a few predictive models have been put forth but with limited application due to the lack of sufficient long term validated support data these include the simple four parameter black box regression model for predicting the physical clogging as a function of cumulative volume and climatic conditions yong et al 2013 and an empirical theory based formulation derived from the kozeny carmen equation which considers the initial vertical permeability porosity amount of clogging material retained and an experimental empirical coefficient tan et al 2003 these findings are helpful for identifying the optimal maintenance times and methods considering the variation in clogging sediments diversified periodic maintenance methods based on a strong understanding of clogging process are necessary to fit different application conditions while more effective methods that have been readily adopted must also be further studied in addition proper maintenance methods are essential to avoid premature failure for instance vacuum sweeping may not be capable of dislodging and extracting strongly trapped clogged materials whereas pressure washing at high strengths may result in increased environmental pollution when clogged materials are pushed down into the groundwater sandoval et al 2020b 6 2 2 water supplementation to enhance pps evaporative cooling performance water supplementation methods such as artificial watering enhancing pps evaporative cooling must be further studied watering details including start time duration and water temperatures based on local climate should be integrated to derive the optimal evaporative cooling strategy while minimising water reports have shown that daily 6 mm wetting over a duration of 10 min in the morning preferentially between 08 00 10 00 guaranteed the maximum evaporative cooling for 24 h during a heat wave in zurich kubilay et al 2021 however additional studies focusing on pps watering methods in other climate regions remain relatively rare during practice water sprinkling facilities could be combined with irrigation systems of the green belt via automatic pipes or supported by local pavement cleaning staffs for applications with larger areas and without green facilities water trucks for municipal sprinklers can also be used as primary supply source hendel et al 2015 further the reclaimed water from buildings or stored rainwater can be used to further decrease irrigated water demand additionally methods such as the use of capillary columns inside the pps structure to transport the deep water up to the surface for evaporation has resulted in a surface cooling of 15 3 compared to that of the impervious pavements liu et al 2020 6 3 pre and post implementation evaluation system 6 3 1 pps pre evaluation for optimizing design existing studies on the integration of pps parameters into simulation models for design optimisation remains limited table 10 presents the pre evaluation methods for assessing pps environmental impacts among these the swmm model is widely applied to examine the runoff control capability of a pps based on different structures and rainfall conditions although this model considers sewer systems in the simulation of rainfall for complex land use areas it does not consider soil type or spatial distribution other simulation methods have also been effective in estimating stormwater management but with limited validation and few applications liu et al 2016 yang et al 2015 therefore methods of pps optimisation for meeting different local rainfall conditions remain extremely limited for locations that experience light rainfall pps permeability coefficient could relatively low as high values may compromise the strength as the duration and interval of rainfall have a significant impact on the pps surface runoff further studies must be conducted considering the soil conditions water storage and permeability of each layer fu et al 2020 regarding the evaporative cooling performance of ppss although the thermal models of pavements have been well identified the lack of thermophysical properties and hydrological data are the main obstacle to accurately predict the cooling potential under different climatic conditions qin and hiller 2014 wang et al 2019b some studies have considered a few thermal physical properties e g the albedo and emissivity however because the other properties have been overlooked the resulting accuracy of these assessment may be limited wei and he 2013 moreover these thermal properties could also change due to water content variation analogously despite the models that integrate evaporation data when estimating the thermal environmental index changes e g near surface air temperature and wet bulb globe temperature table 6 evaporation data extracted via experiments and regression formulas primarily affect the simulated accuracy as these methods were conducted under set of certain conditions and thus have an inherently limited range of application moreover the lack of calibration and validation data for these models also creates barriers in the study of the ppss a more effective pre evaluation system considering the ideal pps design e g set areas and degree of dispersion must be further studied to mitigate urban flooding and uhi effect in particular the performance of pps under dry and wet conditions as well as its effect on the thermal environment and human thermal comfort requires further exploration all such studies should be based on in depth analysis of evaporation rates and thermophysical properties of pps 6 3 2 pps post evaluation for assessing the performance changes in the system the actual performance under outdoor conditions requires post evaluation due to the large influence of clogging and ageing on ppss typical long term field monitoring showed in table 1 with an emphasis on surface runoff over a duration of 1 4 year has illustrated that clogging substantially impact pps hydrological properties with a permeability coefficient loss up to 85 kumar et al 2016 conversely changes in the evaporative cooling performance of ppss have over time not been reported similarly the changes of water absorption and retention properties due to clogging and their impacts on evaporative cooling performance has scarcely been investigated meanwhile whether periodic rainfall can supply adequate water for evaporation in addition to how best to supplement water supplies remains largely unknown given that the degrees of clogging and aging for different types of ppss under different practice environments vary a lot a long term performance monitoring system is essential to predict the attenuation of key parameters as well as formulating the most suitable periodic clean methods meanwhile the data obtained by long term field monitoring can be used to build verify or modify models and empirical equations while optimising pps design 7 summary and conclusions as a major technique for urban stormwater management and urban overheating mitigation ppss have been studied in more than 30 countries and is continuously revamped the present review provides insights regarding problems in achieving performance synergism of ppss by reviewing benefits interpreting key parameters highlighting limitations and providing pertinent suggestions in research and practice the major contributions are listed below based on the literature 570 papers ppss have been demonstrated to be an excellent system for stormwater management through the aspects of urban flooding control table 1 pollutants removal table 2 and uhi mitigation through the surface evaporative cooling table 3 it was found that the application areas of ppss are primarily located in relatively warm areas receiving ample year round precipitation and are comprised of three major types pap pcp and pip pps contribution vary by materials structures and the local environment moreover compared to the well recognised stormwater management practices 502 papers only 60 papers covered the topic of uhi and most were based on surface cooling while papers on nearby air cooling and thermal comfort remain relatively limited key parameters of pps controlling urban stormwater management and urban overheating mitigation include the hydrological properties consisting of the permeability coefficient water absorption and retention evaporation rate thermophysical properties structure design and clogging resistance were interpreted urban stormwater management showed a significant correlation with permeability coefficient and water absorption and retention in contrast water absorption and retention evaporation rate and thermophysical properties were considered for uhi mitigation these ecological benefits can be achieved by considering both the structure design of pps and its ability to prevent congestion it was observed that few studies coordinated multivariate parameters to optimise the performance of the pps however most studies only focused on the pps permeability although large and effective pore connection can improve permeability this does not indicate that the pps exhibits good cooling potential in the design and construction stages key parameters must be controlled to balance these two benefits more importantly the practice environment including the climatic and site condition pollution and functional use should be considered for its highly connectivity to the performance exhibition and maintenance methods of ppss large variations in pps features reported in previous studies also confirmed the need for standardisation in terms of permeability the standard is quite mature for cross comparison but they still vary from real conditions for the cooling performance results of existing studies are not comparable and evaluation methods remain limited notably the water absorption and retaining properties thermal properties and the local weather conditions work together to determine the evaporation rate furthermore whether the structure of the pps can promote the evaporation process requires further investigation the development of an ideal pps evaluation system must be prioritised based on the pre and post evaluation system however to build this the long term monitoring that considers both the permeability and cooling potential of the pps is required to determine whether the pps could serve well under the consideration of clogging and aging an ideal periodic maintenance method must be further studied and determined to help modify pps design and assess cost efficiency overall this review has increased the collective under understanding and provided a valid approach for improving pps performance both of which are imperative to facilitate the development

15709,many iron ii iii vi and manganese ii iv vii based oxidation processes can generate reactive iron manganese species rfes rmns i e fe iv fe v and mn iii mn v mn vi which have mild and selective reactivity toward a wide range of organic contaminants and thus have drawn significant attention the reaction mechanisms of these processes are rather complicated due to the simultaneous involvement of multiple radical and or nonradical species as a result the ambiguity in the occurrence of rfes rmns and divergence in the degradation mechanisms of trace organic contaminants in the presence of rfes rmns exist in literature in order to improve the critical understanding of the rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes the detection methods of rfes rmns and their roles in the destruction of trace organic contaminants are reviewed with special attention to some specific problems related to the scavenger and probe selection and experimental results analysis potentially resulting in some questionable conclusions moreover the influence of background constituents such as organic matter and halides on oxidation efficiency of rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes and formation of byproducts are discussed through their comparison with those in free radicals dominated oxidation processes finally the prospects of the rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes and the challenges for future applications are presented graphical abstract graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords reactive iron manganese species detection methods reaction mechanisms selective oxidation matrix effects byproducts 1 introduction trace organic contaminants trocs present in water and wastewater are necessary to be removed or transformed into less toxic byproducts one feasible option to degrade these trocs is the use of advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton and fenton like processes deborde et al 2004 miklos et al 2018 von gunten 2003 where hydroxyl radical ho or sulfate radical so4 are formed as the most important reactive oxidizing species ros over the past decades several transition metal ions such as fe ii mn ii and co ii are reported to be effective for promoting the production of ho and so4 through electron transfer to peroxides e g h2o2 and persulfates anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 chevallier et al 2004 ghanbari and moradi 2017 pignatello et al 2006 watts et al 2005 recently these transition metal based chemical oxidation reactions have been found to generate reactive metal oxo species besides radicals responsible for trocs abatement dong et al 2020a wang et al 2018c wang et al 2019b zong et al 2020 it is widely accepted that reactive metal oxo species are selective oxidants that not only can react with electron rich organic compounds cabelli and sharma 2008 drummond and waters 1953 melton and bielski 1990 pode and waters 1956 sharma 2011 sun et al 2019a but also are resistant to the interference from common coexisting matrices like chloride and bi carbonate gao et al 2021 li et al 2018a these findings inspire the efforts to generate reactive metal oxo species in various oxidation processes especially to generate reactive fe species rfes fe iv v and reactive mn species rmns mn iii v vi because both fe and mn are abundantly available environmentally friendly and redox active guo et al 2019a rfes and rmns can be generated either through oxidizing low valent fe and mn species by various oxidants e g h2o2 persulfates hclo o3 and hio4 or through reducing fe vi and mn vii by some reductants liang et al 2020 sharma et al 2022 zong et al 2021 the low valent fe and mn species present in aqueous phase or solid phase have been reported to induce the generation of both radicals e g ho so4 and o2 and nonradical species e g rfes rmns and singlet oxygen 1o2 huang et al 2021 shang et al 2021 nevertheless the presence of both radical and nonradical mediated oxidation pathways impedes the progress of clarifying the reaction mechanisms of the fe mn based oxidation processes for example the competitive reactions between the radicals and rfes rmns against the scavengers may mislead the judgement of rfes rmns generation furthermore there is a misconception that the generation of rfes rmns would definitely result in their contribution to the degradation of target trocs as a result conflicting views on the identity of the major oxidants responsible for trocs degradation exist in some investigations of fe mn based oxidation processes ho and so4 are relatively non selective and suffer from the disadvantages of consumption by ubiquitous matrix components e g halide ions and dissolved organic matter dom lee et al 2020 oh et al 2016 therefore rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes are considered as alternative to the ho so4 mediated aops in oxidizing organic trocs in water and wastewater because of the selectivity of rfes rmns nevertheless a few critical issues have been overlooked in the application of rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes i dom at certain concentrations could reduce the treatment efficiency during oxidation and subsequently may lead to toxic byproducts formation e g iodinated byproducts in the presence of i wang et al 2020a zhu et al 2021 zhu et al 2019c and ii the substrate specific reactivity of rfes rmns is sometimes a defect because water and wastewater always contain multiple refractory trocs with different structures and properties in the past few years there have been a few review papers on rfes or rmns oxidation in environmental remediation processes one review has critically examined the strategies to generate highly reactive high valent iron intermediates i e fe iv fe v through activation of ferrate vi sharma et al 2022 and another one has discussed the prospective role of fe iv in fe2 activation initiated advanced oxidation processes wang et al 2022 the reactivity of manganese iii oxides toward organic contaminants has been briefly discussed remucal and ginder vogel 2014 despite these efforts no comprehensive review has been published to extensively describe the generation and detection of rfes and rmns chemical properties of rfes and rmns once formed in aqueous solution and effect of water matrix on the reactions moreover the limitations of applying rfes rmns in water and wastewater treatment are rarely covered in the literature in addition some specific problems related to the scavenger and probe selection and experimental results analysis potentially resulting in questionable conclusions also need to be discussed accordingly this review summarizes the recent research progress on the generation and detection of rfes rmns fe iv fe v and mn iii mn v mn vi in various oxidation processes the properties of rfes rmns are presented through comparison with those of various radicals e g ho so4 and cl the approaches for distinguishing high valent fe mn species fe iv fe v and mn v mn vi from ho and or so4 are summarized moreover the influence of background constituents such as organic matter and halides on rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes and possible byproducts formation are discussed and compared with ho so4 mediated oxidation processes finally the prospects and challenges for the applications of rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes in real practice are proposed 2 generation and detection of rfes and rmns in various oxidation processes 2 1 generation of rfes and rmns the generation of rfes and rmns for oxidative degradation of trocs can be achieved in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems in homogeneous processes aqueous fe ii mn ii ions fe ii iii mn ii ligand complexes and fe vi mn vii are usually employed as the precursors of rfes rmns fe mn containing solid catalysts including supported catalysts minerals and single atom catalysts are used as the precursors of rfes rmns in the heterogeneous processes in addition the circulation between rfes rmns and low valent fe mn species is also an important way to regenerate rfes rmns this section will give a brief overview of the oxidation processes forming rfes or rmns for the abatement of trocs 2 1 1 aqueous fe ii mn ii ions and fe ii iii mn ii ligand complexes based oxidation processes the formation of fe iv has been proposed in the homogeneous reaction of aqueous fe ii with peroxides e g h2o2 peroxydisulfate pds peroxymonosulfate pms and peracetic acid paa and other oxygen atom transfer oat oxidants e g o3 hclo and periodate fig 1 a and table 1 therein the activation of h2o2 by fe ii fenton process was regarded as the bray gorin reaction to produce fe iv or the haber weiss reaction to produce ho early in the 1930s bray and gorin 1932 haber and weiss 1934 more recent research showed that fe iv was generated as an intermediate via a two electron transfer at neutral ph while highly reactive and short lived ho was produced via a one electron transfer in acidic solutions in fenton process bataineh et al 2012 hug and leupin 2003 katsoyiannis et al 2008 keenan and sedlak 2008 hereafter fe iv was suggested to be the major ros besides so4 in the fe ii persulfate process but its contribution to trocs degradation generally dropped with increasing ph dong et al 2020a dong et al 2021 wang et al 2018c wang et al 2019b this mechanism has been further verified in the fe ii paa reaction where fe iv was produced via a two electron transfer and was proposed to be one of the ros responsible for the degradation of trocs kim et al 2019 the o o bond energy of paa and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy are lower than those of h2o2 38 kcal mol 1 vs 51 kcal mol 1 0 25 ev vs 0 57 ev bokare and choi 2014 kim et al 2019 in comparison to h2o2 paa is easier to accept electrons and thus shows greater efficiency for oxidizing fe ii to fe iv kim et al 2019 in addition to aqueous fe ii aqueous mn ii has also been explored in homogeneous activation processes mn ii pms system has been shown to be inefficient for abating trocs which was ascribed to the rapid disproportionation of mn iii and the generation of caged oxidants mniii so4 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 rfes rmns could be transformed to low valent fe mn species either by oxidizing in organic compounds or by the self decomposition process the generated low valent fe mn species could be subsequently oxidized by the parent oxidant e g o3 and peroxide to rfes rmns the circulation between rfes rmns and the low valent fe mn species is significant for the catalytic removal of organics for example only small amount of fe ii was required for the fe ii catalyzed ozonation of sulfoxides because of the rapid fe iv fe ii circulation i e fe iv fe ii fe iv pestovsky and bakac 2006 but the circulation is only effective under acidic conditions with sludge formed from precipitation under neutral and alkaline conditions rastogi et al 2009a sun and pignatello 1992 a possible solution to tackle the limitation is to use ligands to inhibit the precipitation the commonly used ligands can be classified into four types including the polycarboxylates e g oxalate acid and citric acid aminocarboxylates e g nitrilotriacetic acid nta and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta phosphates ligands e g pyrophosphate pp and n4 donor based ligands e g porphyrins phthalocyanine and tetraamido macrocyclic ligand taml according to their coordination sites i e carboxyl group amino group phosphate group and n heterocycle bruice et al 1988 canals et al 2013 chanda et al 2006 checa fernandez et al 2021 jans et al 2021 kudrik and sorokin 2017 rastogi et al 2009b sen gupta et al 2007 shappell et al 2008 sorokin 2013 the ros formed in the metal ligands peroxides systems are influenced by the species of metal ions and ligands for example the complexes formed between fe ii and several ligands e g edta nta oxalate acid and citric acid tend to catalyze pds or h2o2 to generate so4 or ho rather than fe iv wang et al 2019a on the contrary gao et al 2021 found that ligands such as edta and nta could facilitate the formation of mn iii ligands upon mn ii ligands oxidation by pms and mn iii ligands could be further oxidized by pms via two electron transfer to generate mn v ligands as the dominant ros for efficient oxidation of trocs fig 1a the addition of recalcitrant ligands may be applicable in some industrial parks where both ligands containing wastewater and other organic wastewater are generated and they can be mixed easily but these ligands need further treatment to alleviate the extra environmental risks before they are discharged into the water in addition to the recalcitrant ligands humic acid ha in natural waters is capable of complexing the intermediate mn iii which is formed from the oxidation of mn ii by o2 under visible light fig 1a the resulting mn iii ha complex has been considered to be an important one electron transfer oxidant for the transformation of organics wang et al 2020b the coordination of fe iii to n4 donor based ligands greatly enhances the ability of fe iii to activate peroxides e g pms and h2o2 to generate high valent iron complexes where the iron center adopts high oxidation states feiv or fev fig 1b the most frequently used n4 donor based ligand is taml which was designed by collins t j and his co workers over 20 years ago collins and ryabov 2017 they had developed seven generations of taml catalysts by 2017 fe iii tamls can activate peroxides via peroxidase like cycles to generate fe iv oxo complex and or fe v oxo complex which can rapidly and efficiently purify water containing electron rich compounds jans et al 2021 sen gupta et al 2007 similar to the case of fe ii iii n4 donor based ligands system various studies have investigated the utilization of mn ii n4 donor based ligands to activate peroxides e g pms and h2o2 to generate rmns so as to oxidize trocs xu et al 2009 yin et al 2005 yu et al 2020 in these systems the mn ii n4 structures are firstly oxidized to mn iv oxo n4 which is apt to decompose to mn v oxo n4 and mn iii n4 via a disproportionation reaction the further oxidation of mn iii n4 by peroxide can regenerate mn v oxo n4 which is suspected to serve as the key ros xu et al 2009 prior to the application of these technologies in real practice it is necessary to develop heterogeneous catalysts e g single atom catalysts in section 2 1 2 which are easy to separate and recycle to maximize the use of catalysts and to avoid the possible secondary pollution caused by soluble n4 donor based ligands 2 1 2 fe mn containing solids based oxidation processes in order to overcome the poor stability and recyclability of homogeneous activators metal containing activators in the solid phase are used in heterogeneous activation processes iron immobilized on supports such as silica alumina titanium oxide char composites and zeolite are used to activate peroxide to produce ros gonzalez olmos et al 2011 kim et al 2020 liang et al 2021 lim et al 2006 pham et al 2009 in some of these cases surface bound fe iv has been demonstrated to be the important ros responsible for trocs degradation for example kim et al 2020 reported that the surface fe iv was generated by the heterogeneous activation of h2o2 with a tio2 supported fe catalyst the supports can not only immobilize the generated fe iv but also facilitate the fenton like reaction by affecting the coordination environment of surface fe analogous to the roles of ligands in the homogeneous fenton like reactions lim et al 2006 pham et al 2009 in addition iron hydr oxides e g fe3o4 α feooh kwan and voelker 2003 luo et al 2021a and manganese oxides e g mn2o3 mn3o4 and mno2 huang and zhang 2019 have been widely applied as activators of peroxides in aops to remove trocs typically ho and so4 are the main active species resulting from the homolytical cleavage of the o o bond of peroxides singlet oxygen 1o2 and direct electron transfer are also reported to be involved in the above mentioned processes in addition a few studies reported the generation of rfes in these reactions chen et al 2022 guo et al 2010 lai et al 2020 for example natural titanomagnetite fe2 5ti0 5 1 04o4 fetio3 and fe3o4 are primary components was reported to be able to activate pds to generate surface fe iv and fe v as the ros for atrazine removal lai et al 2020 single atom catalysts sacs with metal n4 as the catalytical active sites are attracting increasing attention in environmental catalysis due to the maximum utilization of metal atoms unique electronic features of the single atom metal sites excellent catalytic activity and structural stability qiao et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 zuo et al 2019 a variety of sacs with transition metal atoms e g co fe cu and mn have been developed as fenton like catalysts huang et al 2021 shang et al 2021 among them mn sacs are relatively rare while fe sacs are the most widely studied in the literature the active species responsible for trocs degradation in mn sacs peroxides systems are primarily free radicals and or 1o2 fan et al 2019 guo et al 2019b yang et al 2020 more research is required to elucidate the potential involvement of rmns in fe sacs peroxides systems the dominant ros depends on the type of peroxides the major ros in fe sacs h2o2 systems was reported to be ho huang et al 2021 shang et al 2021 while rfes was the predominant ros in fe sacs persulfate systems huang et al 2021 shang et al 2021 in addition the support materials may greatly affect the reactivity of sacs and also the generation of ros li et al 2018b prepared a single site fe catalyst by incorporating fe iii into g c3n4 cnf and observed that the cnf pms system was capable of selectivity degrading phenolic compounds they proposed that fev o fixated in the nitrogen sites of g c3n4 was proposed as the dominant ros qian et al 2021 fabricated a single atom material by constructing fe n4 sites on a carbon nanotube fesa n cnt to activate pms for the degradation of bisphenol a a fast removal of bisphenol a was achieved in the fesa n cnt pms system over a wide ph range 3 0 9 0 but the dominant ros was determined to be feiv o based on various evidences 2 1 3 fe vi and mn vii based oxidation processes fe vi and mn vii have been extensively investigated for the oxidative removal of trocs hu et al 2009 jiang et al 2012 sharma 2013 sharma et al 2015 song et al 2017 the reduction of fe vi and mn vii could generate high valent fe mn species as ros via either one electron transfer or two electron transfer sharma 2013 song et al 2017 these species are generally more reactive than their precursors fe vi and mn vii sharma 2013 sharma et al 2001 sharma et al 2015 simandi and zahonyi budo 1998 zahonyibudo and simandi 1994 1995 therefore the oxidation of trocs by fe vi and mn vii is possibly enhanced by inducing the generation of high valent fe mn oxo species from fe vi and mn vii the addition of reductants or materials containing electron donating functional groups e g sulfite feng et al 2018 shao et al 2020 shao et al 2019 sun et al 2016 sun et al 2015 biochar tian et al 2020 tian et al 2019 carbon nanotube pan et al 2020 sun et al 2019b wang et al 2021 and h2o2 shao et al 2019 xu and von gunten 2021 to the fe vi and mn vii oxidation systems are the most common means to trigger the generation of high valent fe mn species the activation is generally initiated with one or two electron transfer step fig 1c the reduction rates of fe vi mn vii in these processes are crucial for the yield of high valent fe mn species and subsequent trocs degradation feng et al 2018 shao et al 2020 sun et al 2015 one of the most efficient reductants for activating fe vi and mn vii is sulfite which can activate fe vi and mn vii to oxidize organic trocs with extraordinary high rates shao et al 2020 sun et al 2015 the sulfite activated oxidation processes have great potential for application in drinking water treatment and municipal wastewater reuse treatment chen et al 2021 spellman et al 2022 in addition the self decay of fe vi could also generate fe v and fe iv fig 1c lee et al 2014 accelerating the decay of fe vi to generate fe iv and or fe v is thus proposed as a method for fe vi activation the freshly generated particulate fe iii hydr oxides have been demonstrated to be able to increase the self decay rate of fe vi and catalyze the reaction of fe vi with h2o2 facilitating the generation of rfes for the enhanced degradation of trocs by fe vi jiang et al 2015 2016 luo et al 2021b shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2021c fe vi and mn vii can absorb light and be transformed into the photoexcited state followed by the decomposition into rfes and rmns respectively therefore uv irradiation were also proposed for activating fe vi and mn vii to produce rfes rmns for enhanced degradation of trocs guo et al 2018 yang et al 2022 in the uv mn vii process an excited state mno2 η 2 o2 could be formed during uv photolysis of mn vii at 254 nm and then mn v peroxide mno2 η 2 o2 might be formed via o o formation fig 1c thornley and bitterwolf 2015 2 2 detection of rfes and rmns detecting rfes and rmns is a fundamental task for clarifying the mechanisms of trocs abatement in rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes typically rfes and rmns can be analyzed i directly by characterization techniques such as uv visible spectrophotometry mössbauer spectroscopy and x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy xafs and ii indirectly by using chemical probes via the reaction with rfes and rmns producing compounds that can be easily detected just using a single method is generally not reliable to identify the generation of rfes and rmns in the oxidation process consequently multi strategies were suggested to be integrated for tracing the occurrence and evolution of rfes and rmns 2 2 1 direct detection direct detection of rfes and rmns by uv visible spectrophotometry is based on the emergence of their characteristic absorption spectrum in homogeneous solution absorption peaks of rfes rmns are presented in section 3 1 nevertheless this method has some drawbacks when applied to detect rfes rmns including the necessity for operating under homogeneous conditions the disturbance rising from surrounding matrix of other in organic compounds and the difficulty in identifying the short lived rfes rmns transient thus mössbauer spectroscopy and xafs are needed to provide solid evidence for the generation of rfes rmns since they are sensitive techniques to measure the metal transition in various oxidation processes chanda et al 2008 de oliveira et al 2007 liang et al 2021 liang et al 2020 pestovsky et al 2005 yang et al 2017 zong et al 2021 mössbauer spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique that can probe tiny changes in the energy levels of fe nucleus in response to its environment typically three types of nuclear interactions can be observed including isomeric shift quadrupole splitting and magnetic splitting graham and cohen 1976 the values of the isomer shifts δ are highly sensitive to the oxidation states of iron and decrease with an increase in oxidation state sharma et al 2015 for example the isomer shifts δ are 0 90 0 55 0 22 and 0 62 mm s 1 for k2fevio4 k3fevo4 na4feivo4 and γ feiiiooh respectively dedushenko et al 2008 rossiter and hodgson 1965 mössbauer spectroscopy is a crucial technique to identify the generation of fe iv fe v during oxidation of fe ii fe iii and reduction of fe vi for example the mössbauer spectrum of the fe2 hclo mixture was recorded at 12 k and this spectrum was identified to be a combination of the spectrum of fe ii and that of fe iv containing a singlet with δ 0 26 mm s 1 which verified the generation of fe iv in fe2 hclo process liang et al 2020 the mössbauer technique is only suitable for solid samples which can be achieved by freezing the liquid samples the key of detecting rfes with mössbauer spectroscopy is to match their lifetime with the detection speed the content of rfes in the sample is another constraint that limits their determination with mössbauer spectroscopy we have used mössbauer spectroscopy to detect generation of fe iv and fe v during the self decay of fe vi at 77 k three spectral components of fe vi fe iv and fe iii were observed fig 2 but the expected fe v was not observed the non detection of fe v might be ascribed to the low content of fe v species xafs is another widely used characterization technique for providing the information about the electronic valence state of concerned elements and the local geometric and or electronic structure of matter xafs can be divided into three regions pre edge region near edge region i e x ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy xanes and post edge region i e extended x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy exafs past xafs studies have extracted metal valence information from exafs through crystal chemical interpretations of exafs derived metal o distances manceau et al 1992 marcus et al 2004 the valence of metal is estimated from the pre edge region and xanes region cai et al 2018 chalmin et al 2009 farges 2005 haas et al 2009 qualitatively the k edge energy of xanes region is positively related to the weighted average valence of iron fig 3 a and thus the right shift of edge energy is used to represent the increase in oxidation state for example zong et al 2021 reported that the fe k edge energy of the frozen samples of fe ii periodate mixture and fe iii solution were 7127 6 and 7124 4 ev respectively and they determined the average valence of iron in the fe ii periodate mixture to be 3 8 based on the linear relationship between the edge energy of fe reference compounds i e fe0 feo fe3o4 and fe2o3 and the corresponding fe valences as for mn chalmin et al 2009 showed that the centroid position of mn k pre edge could be used to obtain the oxidation state fig 3b consequently xafs spectra are expected to be able to provide conclusive evidences for the presence of rfes rmns but the k edge energy corresponds to the average value of various oxidation states which brings challenges to provide a clear distinction between dual high oxidation states e g fe iv and fe v mn v and mn vi in the oxidation process similar to the analysis with mössbauer spectroscopy the determination of the different oxidation states of rfes and rmns with xafs techniques is limited by the content of rfes or rmns in the sample 1 wt for transmission mode and 1 wt for fluorescence mode overall both techniques can only detect rfes and rmns at elevated concentrations and thus they are only suitable for mechanistic studies specially designed to generate large amounts of rfes and rmns but they cannot meet the needs for rapid and or in situ understanding the generation and reaction behaviors of rfes rmns attributable to the requirement of specialized instruments in the laboratory 2 2 2 indirect detection with probes the method of indirect detection is based on the introduction of a molecular probe which reacts selectively with rfes and rmns to form stable derived products and the generated products can be analyzed easily thus monitoring the disappearance of probe compound and the generation of the derived byproduct is an indirect method to verify the generation of rfes and rmns sulfoxides e g dimethyl sulfoxide dmso pmso have been widely used as chemical probes since sulfoxides are known to be oxidized by high valent metal species to produce the corresponding sulfones through an oxygen transfer step which is markedly different from the radical ho and so4 mediated oxidation pathway pestovsky and bakac 2006 wang et al 2018c the detection limit for pmso2 with high performance liquid chromatography is 10 nm pang et al 2011 thus compared to the direct detection techniques the probe trapping method is able to be employed to identify the high valent fe mn species in normal treatment systems indirect detection could be affected by the presence of other reactive species that can react with the chemical probes via similar pathway for example co3 a secondary radical produced from the reaction of ho and so4 with bi carbonate can also oxidize sulfoxides to the corresponding sulfone derivatives via o atom transfer eqn r1 huang and mabury 2000 therefore other auxiliary approaches should be applied to identify the generation of high valent fe mn species in the laboratory and 18o isotope labeling technique is such a method this method is based on the feature that high valent fe mn species can exchange the oxygen atom 16o with h2 18o eqn r2 pestovsky and bakac 2006 pestovsky et al 2005 therefore the generation of 18o isotope incorporated sulfone products eqn r3 in h2 18o is critical to verify the presence of high valent fe mn species r1 r soc h 3 co 3 r s o 2 c h 3 r2 m e n 16 o h 2 18 o m e n 18 o r3 r s 16 oc h 3 m e n

ph 3 0 or basic ph 10 0 conditions in the literature at ph 3 0 fe iv feo2 could be effectively generated by the reaction of fe2 with o3 eqn r4 jacobsen et al 1998 loegager et al 1992 martire et al 2002 pestovsky et al 2005 and the absorption at 320 nm ε320 420 m 1 cm 1 was used to monitor its decay jacobsen et al 1998 the half life t 1 2 of fe iv in 0 1 m hclo4 was determined to be 7 s pestovsky and bakac 2006 the observed decay of fe iv in water is predominantly first order and the mechanism is represented by a sequence of reactions eqn r5a r5b r5c and r5d the rate determining step is reaction eqn r5a and the reaction rate increases from 0 02 s 1 to 2 0 s 1 with increasing ph from 0 0 to 3 0 jacobsen et al 1998 martire et al 2002 although fe iv is short lived the lifetime of fe iv is much larger than that of free radicals fig 4 a r4 f e 2 o 3 f e o 2 o 2 r5a f e o 2 h 2 o h f e 3 h 2 o h o r5b f e o 2 h o h f e 3 h 2 o 2 r5c f e o 2 h 2 o 2 h f e 3 h 2 o h o 2 r5d f e o 2 h o 2 h f e 3 o 2 h 2 o in basic medium the chemistry of fe iv in the presence of some inorganic complexes e g oh pyrophosphate pp and carbonate bicarbonate has been explored the fe iv complexes can be generated from the reaction of corresponding fe iii complexes with radicals e g ho o and co3 which can be achieved by the pulse radiolysis technique in aqueous solution bielski 1992 melton and bielski 1990 the fe iv complexes are also short lived and their lifetime varies with the ligand for example the half life of fe iv pp complex is in the range of 100 600 ms at ph 10 0 while fe iv carbonate complex is much more stable than fe iv pp complex and its lifetime is 0 5 1 0 s in the ph range of 8 0 11 0 melton and bielski 1990 aqueous fe v derived from the reduction of fe vi by radicals has been characterized over the ph range of 3 6 13 0 by using pulse radiolysis rush and bielski 1989 1994 the absorbance of fe v in alkaline solution has a maximum at 380 nm which undergoes a blue shift with decreasing ph rush and bielski 1989 1994 the observed disappearance of fe v was predominantly first order and the rates varied from 7 0 104 s 1 to 100 s 1 with the ph ranging from 3 6 to 7 0 the first order process was described by the hydration of tetrahedral fe v to a six coordinate octahedral species prior to loss of h2o2 in alkaline solution fe v decayed predominantly following second order kinetics which was initiated by dimerization followed by fast yield of iron iii peroxo complex at ph 7 0 12 0 the second order rate constants of fe v decay varied in the range of 105 108 m 1 s 1 and decreased with increasing ph ii rmns mn iii ion only stably exists in strongly acidic media and otherwise it undergoes hydrolysis eqn r6 wells and davies 1965 upon decreasing the acidity mn iii is apt to disproportionate to mn ii and mno2 rapidly eqn r7 rao and adinarayana 1992 mn iii can be stabilized by forming complexes with many chelating agents such as pp edta and citric acid davies 1969 klewicki and morgan 1998 for example the half life of mn iii pp is 25 530 days at ph 7 0 9 0 when the molar ratio of pp to mn iii is 25 0 klewicki and morgan 1998 the absorption spectrum of mn iii pp has a characteristic peak at 258 nm ε258 6750 m 1 cm 1 webb et al 2005 r6 m n i i i a q h 2 o m n o h 2 h r7 2 m n i i i m n i i m n i v r8 3 m n v m n v i i 2 m n i v r9 2 m n v i m n v i i m n v mn v and mn vi are unstable and are easily decomposed into stable mno4 and mno2 eqn r8 and r9 kirschenbaum and meyerstein 1981 rush and bielski 1995b the instability of mn v and mn vi in aqueous solutions is presumably related to the existence of protonated forms which undergo rapid disproportionation reactions rush and bielski 1995b mn vi is more stable than mn v under moderately basic conditions rush and bielski 1995b disproportionation of mn v and mn vi is slow under highly basic conditions 6 9 m 1 s 1 for mn v in 3 m koh and 4 9 m 1 s 1 for mn vi at ph 11 0 but very rapid under moderately basic or acid conditions e g 104 m 1 s 1 for mn v at ph 11 0 and 1 27 107 m 1 s 1 for mn vi at ph 1 0 lee and chen 1989 mn v can exist for 2 3 days in solution with koh concentration greater than 8 0 m and mn vi can exist for several weeks in solution containing 1 0 5 0 m koh carrington and symons 1956 pode and waters 1956 the absorbance at 660 nm and 610 nm was used to monitor the decay of mn v and that of mn vi with ε660 1500 m 1 cm 1 ph 9 0 carrington and symons 1956 simandi et al 1985 and ε610 910 m 1 cm 1 koh 12 0 m rush and bielski 1995b respectively 3 2 reactivity of rfes and rmns the data on redox potentials for rfes rmns and second order rate constants of rfes rmns with organic compounds are very limited in the literature and the available data are summarized in fig 4b c the redox potentials for feivo2 fe3 fe v fe iv and mn iii mn ii couples are 2 0 v 1 8 v and 1 51 v respectively the presence of ligands significantly lowers their redox potentials e g 1 0 1 35 v and 1 15 v for fe iv pp fe iii pp and mn iii pp mn ii pp respectively fig 4b in comparison to ho so4 cl and cl2 fe iv fe v and mn iii are mild oxidants with moderate redox potentials generally the second order rate constants k for rfes rmns with organic compounds range from 100 to 106 m 1 s 1 except for the reaction of fe v with cysteine most of which are several orders of magnitude lower than those with regard to free radicals rfes rmns prefer to react with organosulfur compounds phenols aliphatic alcohols and amino acids but they are less reactive toward aldehydes ketones ether nitriles and aromatics containing only electron withdrawing groups such as carboxylic acids with k 104 m 1 s 1 the selectivity of rfes rmns is similar to that of cl2 and co3 3 3 reaction mechanisms of rfes and rmns mn iii usually oxidizes organic compounds via one electron transfer with mn ii being the final product kostka et al 1995 sun et al 2019a wang et al 2020b but fe iv fe v and mn v mn vi can react with organic compounds by diverse reaction pathways such as o atom transfer park et al 2011 pestovsky and bakac 2006 electron transfer sharma 2010 electrophilic addition martire et al 2002 rush et al 1995 and hydrogen abstraction jacobsen et al 1998 pestovsky and bakac 2004 rush and bielski 1995a depending on the nature of substrates this section will mainly focus on the reaction of high valent fe iv fe v and mn v mn vi with organic compounds to illustrate the different oxidation mechanisms i o atom transfer o atom transfer is unique to the reaction of high valent metal species with organic compounds as shown in fig 5 sulfoxide ars o r is formed either by direct o atom transfer from high valent metal species men o to sulfide arsr or by electron transfer from arsr to men o followed by o atom transfer from me n 1 o to the radical cation arsr chellamani et al 1999 park et al 2011 further oxidation of the sulfoxide e g methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso by men o form corresponding sulfone e g methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 via o atom transfer pestovsky and bakac 2006 which is different from the products e g biphenyl compounds of the oxidation of pmso by ho and so4 wang et al 2018c ii electron transfer this is the main pathway for many organic compounds that react with rfes and rmns including amines phenols carboxylic acids and alcohols both one electron and two electron transfer mechanisms have been proposed in the oxidation reactions which reasonably account for the observed products of the reactions for example phenols could be oxidized by mn iii to form phenoxyl radicals i e one electron transfer which could form various cross linked dimers trimers and tetramers or undergo further oxidation to yield benzoquinones fig 5 gao et al 2018 martire et al 2002 nevertheless the oxidation of oh containing organic compounds by high valent fe mn species undergoes the formation of o bridged compounds fig 5 which offers a convenient path for subsequent inner sphere electron transfer to generate catechol and ketone for the oxidation of phenol and alcohol respectively pestovsky and bakac 2004 rush et al 1995 zahonyibudo and simandi 1995 the reactivity of rfes and rmns toward aromatic compounds can be modulated by the substituent groups martire et al 2002 which can change the electron density at particular reactive sites of molecules for example the aromatic primary amine group in p toluidine is activated by the electron donating methyl group at the para position and becomes reactive toward bicarbonate complexed fe v while the aromatic primary amine in n n dimethylaniline is substituted with two methyl groups which obstructs the reaction of n n dimethylaniline with bicarbonate complexed fe v due to the steric hindrance effect luo et al 2019 the substituent effects can be reflected by a correlation of the reaction rate constants with the hammett constants for example the apparent rate constants of substituted phenols degradation in feiv taml mediated oxidation process was negatively correlated to hammett constants log k obs ρσ ρ 3 63 for variable σ su et al 2018 iii electrophilic addition aromatic compounds could also react with high valent metal species via electrophilic addition mechanism for example high valent fe species can attack the aromatic ring of phenolic compounds to yield hydroxycyclo hexadienyl radical via electrophilic addition fig 5 martire et al 2002 rush et al 1995 the formed hydroxycyclo hexadienyl radical further decomposed to generate catechol quinone or hydroquinone martire et al 2002 rush et al 1995 it has not been documented that whether electrophilic addition is a preferred reaction pathway during the oxidation of aromatic compounds by high valent metal species however addition is the main process taking place with ho in the presence of aromatic compounds gligorovski et al 2015 iv hydrogen abstraction hydrogen abstraction is also a possible route for the reaction of high valent fe mn species with substrates pirovano and mcdonald 2018 a series of aliphatic alcohols aldehydes acetonitrile and ethers could react with aqueous fe iv by hydrogen atom transfer pestovsky and bakac 2004 the first step of aliphatic alcohol oxidation is hydrogen abstraction from carbons to produce carbon centered radicals fig 5 which further form various products by oxygen addition louwerse et al 2008 pestovsky and bakac 2004 experimental data of products distribution enabled the understanding of the reaction pathways in solution and the assessment of their relative importance for example in the oxidation of cyclobutanol by aqueous fe iv a smaller fraction of the reaction takes place by hydrogen transfer believed to yield ring opened products while the reaction generates cyclobutanone in 70 yield by a two electron process pestovsky and bakac 2004 4 role of multiple oxidants in the abatement of trocs 4 1 are rfes and rmns major oxidants a summary of the rfes rmns involved oxidation processes is listed in table 1 besides rfes and rmns free radicals e g so4 and ho are often reported to contribute to the oxidation of trocs in many rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes both free radicals e g so4 and ho and high valent fe mn species were usually proposed as the ros in these processes in this case the degradation pathways of trocs were somehow complicated considering the presence of both radical and nonradical species in the oxidation process the degradation kinetics of the target compound is related to the intrinsic reactivity of rfes rmns the concentration of rfes rmns in aqueous solution and or the transport of trocs to the surface of heterogeneous catalysts to achieve sufficient exposure to rfes rmns chen et al 2022 yang et al 2021 the contributions of rfes and rmns to the degradation of trocs in many rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes were overestimated since the formation of rfes and rmns does not necessarily suggest that they played an important role in the degradation of various trocs in water the case of the fe ii pds system is quite indicative by using pmso as the probe compound wang et al demonstrated that in the fe ii pds system fe iv was the dominant reactive species under acidic conditions based on the results that the yield of pmso2 was close to 100 wang et al 2018c however dong et al argued that both fe iv and free radicals so4 and ho were all generated in the fe ii pds system and these ros contributed differently to the transformation of different trocs by using multiple probes e g dmso pmso p nitrobenzoic acid and ba dong et al 2020a free radicals and fe iv were the major roc for the degradation of benzoic acid and amoxicillin respectively dong et al 2020a different interpretations of the mechanism of the fe ii pds process present in the literature may be ascribed to the mild and selective reactivity of fe iv it is well documented that fe iv is very reactive with pmso e g k 1 2 105 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2006 and the electron rich trocs such as phenol chlorophenols and antibiotics whereas organic compounds such as nitrobenzene and ibuprofen with the benzene ring functioned with deactivating groups or electron withdrawing groups such as no2 are not favorable for a nonradical reaction duan et al 2018 thus it is not proper to use only one probe to identify the contributions of rfes rmns in many oxidation processes 4 2 identifying different reactive species identifying different reactive species is very crucial for optimizing the process of trocs removal by a rfes rmns mediated oxidation process generally electron paramagnetic resonance epr using dmpo as a spin trapping agent and quenching experiments using excess alcohol based scavengers were the most widely used methods to verify the role of so4 and or ho as main oxidant s unfortunately these two techniques could not exclusively identify the generation of so4 and or ho or discriminate the role of so4 and or ho from that of rfes and rmns during the abatement of trocs in rfes rmns mediated oxidation process first it has been unveiled that high valent fe mn species can react with dmpo to produce dmpo ho adducts shao et al 2019 xu et al 2017 thus the epr spectrum of dmpo ho adducts did not necessarily reflect the generation of ho in the rfes rmns mediated oxidation process second high valent fe mn species are also sensitive to some commonly used radical quenching agents such as methanol and ethanol in this regard further study should evaluate the product distribution of by using target probe compound e g sulfoxides to verify the generation of rfes rmns and radicals or employ organic compounds with the benzene ring functioned with deactivating groups as scavengers such as p chlorobenzoic acid nitrobenzene and ba which are susceptible to oxidation by so4 and or ho but are resistant to rfes rmns oxidation chen et al 2020 dong et al 2020a in addition competition kinetics method could be used to distinguish rfes rmns from radicals by comparing the reactivities toward solutes present together in the same solution and under identical conditions for example the ratio of the reaction rate constant of c6h12 with high valent iron species to that of c6d12 with high valent iron species k h k d 1 4 is larger than that with ho k h k d 1 12 which had been taken as evidence for the presence of high valent iron species in photo assisted fenton reaction pignatello et al 1999 besides high valent fe mn species 1o2 can be induced by metal carbon catalysts in persulfate based aops duan et al 2018 huang et al 2021 shang et al 2021 both high valent fe mn species and 1o2 are selective toward trocs and exhibit moderate oxidative potential compared to free radicals but there are few methods available at this stage to distinguish the contributions of various nonradical species to the degradation of trocs 5 matrix effects on rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes researchers are currently focusing on developing the oxidation processes with rfes rmns as the main oxidant to selectively degrade the target organic contaminants in complicated water matrixes however there is a lack of scrutiny of some issues about the matrix effects on the oxidation efficiency of trocs and on the formation of byproducts in the rfes rmns mediated oxidation process the focus of this section is to summarize the effects of water matrix on trocs oxidation by rfes rmns with special attention to the comparison with ho so4 mediated aops 5 1 effect of halide ions cl is the most abundant halide ions in wastewaters it is widely believed that one of the major advantages of rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes originates from the weak reactivity of rfes rmns toward cl for example the rate constant of the reaction of fe iv with cl is as low as 100 10 m 1 s 1 in 0 1 m hclo4 jacobsen et al 1998 as for br and i their reactivity with rfes rmns and their influence on the performance of many rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes are unknown but several studies suggested that the oxidation of br and i by fe vi mn vii generated hobr and hoi respectively and found the formation of bromate bro3 and brominated iodinated byproducts through the halogenation of dom and phenols by in situ formed hobr hoi dong et al 2018 huang et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 li et al 2018c wang et al 2020c since rfes rmns are more reactive than fe vi mn vii br and i might influence the oxidation of trocs and facilitate byproducts formation in rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes for example spellman et al 2022 showed that the sub stoichiometric sulfite fe vi 0 5 activated fe vi treatment approach where fe v was the major active oxidant could generate bro3 120 μg l 1 after oxidation of br 200 μm in spiked municipal wastewater effluents but the yield of bro3 was lower than that resulting from ozonation under similar conditions comparatively both ho and so4 react rapidly with halide ions but with different reaction pathways the reactions of ho with cl and br at concentrations of interest to fresh water and most hazardous wastewater are reversible under neutral conditions ho x xoh while xoh could be further transformed to x under acidic conditions xoh h cl h2o or x2 at high halide concentrations xoh x x2 oh e g saline waters grebel et al 2010 in contrast so4 reacts with cl and br to produces cl and br respectively through one electron transfer yang et al 2014 similar to rfes rmns these reactive halogen species e g x and x2 are also selective and can oxidize trocs containing electron rich moieties lei et al 2019 lian et al 2017 thus they can compensate for the loss of oxidation capacity of ho and so4 due to their consumption by background halide ions the halide ions could in some cases even enhance the decomposition of trocs in aops with ho so4 as the major ros depending on the reactivity of the formed reactive halogen species toward trocs lian et al 2017 moreover these reactive halogen species are sometimes more reactive than rfes rmns in oxidizing organics for example the second order rate constants of cl with many trocs at ph 7 0 are reported to range from 109 to 1010 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2019 much larger than those of rfes rmns with trocs thus the selective oxidation of trocs electron rich moieties in the presence of cl could be achieved in both rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes and ho so4 mediated aops 5 2 effect of oxyanions rfes rmns are inert to phosphate and bi carbonate but phosphate might exhibit negative or positive influence on the oxidation ability of rfes rmns after its complexation with rfes rmns for example the coordination of fe v with phosphate ligands might induce steric hindrance limiting the fe v complex to associate with target compounds and thus impacting the electron transfer process huang et al 2018 in contrast the complexation of mn iii by phosphate increases the stability of mn iii and favors the oxidation of phenolic compounds jiang et al 2009 2010 the two oxyanions however often scavenge ho so4 and decrease the oxidation efficiency of ho so4 mediated aops lee et al 2020 yang et al 2014 in addition the oxidation of bi carbonate by ho so4 generates co3 which is also selective and prefers to react with electron rich organics but the overall treatment efficiency generally decreases since the reactivities of co3 toward organic compounds are much lower than those of ho so4 fig 4c unlike phosphate and bi carbonate nitrite might be able to be oxidized by rfes rmns since it is readily to be oxidized by fe vi mn vii sharma 2010 song et al 2017 and rfes rmns are more reactive than fe vi mn vii for example the rate constant of nitrite oxidation by fe iv is 105 m 1 s 1 0 1 m hclo4 jacobsen et al 1998 as a result high concentrations of nitrite in secondary wastewater effluents can scavenge rfes rmns and cause inhibitory effect on trocs degradation moreover the oxidation of nitrite by rfes rmns can generate no2 through one electron transfer jacobsen et al 1998 similar to the oxidation of nitrite by ho so4 the generated no2 may further oxidize the organic matter to form nitrogenous organic disinfection byproducts lee et al 2020 nevertheless ozonation of nitrite containing waters can generate nitrate rather than nitrogenous organic disinfection byproducts hu et al 2010 5 3 effect of dom although rfes rmns are resistant to many coexisting anions they are not such ideal selective reactive species in some water treatment scenarios with high concentrations of dom rfes rmns may suffer from the disadvantages of consumption by dom which contains abundant phenolic moieties 2 86 0 71 mmol phenol gc aeschbacher et al 2012 onnby et al 2018 walpen et al 2016 and is generally present at concentrations much higher than those of trocs in natural water and wastewater schwarzenbach et al 2006 therefore dom is also a typical scavenger of rfes rmns although the second order rate constants for the reactions between rfes rmns and dom are unknown in addition antioxidant moieties in dom can reduce intermediate radicals of organics back to their parent compounds canonica and schonenberger 2019 wenk et al 2011 it should be noted that the consumption of various oxidants e g ozone fe vi and mn vii by reactive dom moieties can generate assimilable organic carbon aoc which may lead to enhanced toxicity ramseier et al 2011 the formation of aoc is related to the reactivity of used oxidants ramseier et al 2011 since rfes rmns are more reactive than fe vi mn vii particular attention should be paid to the possible aoc formation in rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes 6 prospects and challenges compared to other oxidation processes rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes have some special merits and may be applicable in water and industrial wastewater treatment i rfes rmns could be used in a catalytic manner through the cycle between rfes rmns and low valent fe mn ions which is significant for minimizing the generation of fe and mn rich solids when rfes rmns are ros in pre oxidation treatment process the residual fe and mn rich solids once formed can be efficiently removed in the following coagulation sedimentation and filtration units and will not cause concern in the treated drinking water ii rfes and rmns seem likely to provide an opportunity for the selective removal of organics when the anions are present at high concentrations e g saline wastewater the formation of some harmful byproducts such as chlorate and chlorinated byproducts can be avoided when rfes rmns are the major ros which is a significant advantage of rfes rmns over radicals e g ho so4 and cl and traditional oxidants e g chlorine dioxide and chlorine iii because of the substrate specific reactivity rfes rmns are likely to be suitable for the treatment of specific type of wastewaters containing phenols and aniline although many established methods such as ozonation and uv h2o2 based aops are also effective for these contaminants several disadvantages exist such as relatively complex equipment for onsite generation of ozone and energy consumption comparatively some rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes can oxidize organic contaminants with extraordinary high rates e g mn vii sulfite process and thus the oxidation can be completed within the pipe equipped with a rapid mixer this makes these oxidation processes superior to many other established methods with regard to the footprint and equipment investment despite the progress of developing rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes there are still some challenges for the application of these processes in real practice i we believe that the rfes rmns dominated oxidation process is difficult to achieve selective oxidation of trocs in municipal wastewater treatment scenarios since rfes rmns can be affected by the complicated water matrix such as nitrite and dom moreover rfes rmns are selective to the electron rich contaminants which is a defect because most wastewater always contain multiple refractory contaminants with different structures and properties which requires broadband treatment options including physical removal e g activated carbon reverse osmosis and nanofiltration or a less selective oxidation method ii although there have been numerous studies concerning the generation of rfes rmns for the oxidation of organic contaminants there is no quantitative study on the yields of rfes rmns during the decomposition of parent oxidants e g persulfate if the molar ratio of rfes rmns effective for degrading trocs to the consumed parent oxidants is very small large amount of parent oxidants have to be applied to achieve the removal of little amount of trocs therefore the information on oxidant yields of rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes is particularly expected and efforts should be made to increase the electron efficiency of parent oxidants and rfes rmns to achieve highly efficient decomposition of trocs iii recent rfes rmns involved processes are mostly discovered in the persulfate based systems whereas the investigations with h2o2 are still limited although h2o2 is much more environmentally friendly than persulfate there is an environmental risk that high concentrations of sulfate and h remain in treated water after the application of persulfates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

15709,many iron ii iii vi and manganese ii iv vii based oxidation processes can generate reactive iron manganese species rfes rmns i e fe iv fe v and mn iii mn v mn vi which have mild and selective reactivity toward a wide range of organic contaminants and thus have drawn significant attention the reaction mechanisms of these processes are rather complicated due to the simultaneous involvement of multiple radical and or nonradical species as a result the ambiguity in the occurrence of rfes rmns and divergence in the degradation mechanisms of trace organic contaminants in the presence of rfes rmns exist in literature in order to improve the critical understanding of the rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes the detection methods of rfes rmns and their roles in the destruction of trace organic contaminants are reviewed with special attention to some specific problems related to the scavenger and probe selection and experimental results analysis potentially resulting in some questionable conclusions moreover the influence of background constituents such as organic matter and halides on oxidation efficiency of rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes and formation of

degrade these trocs is the use of advanced oxidation processes aops such as fenton and fenton like processes deborde et al 2004 miklos et al 2018 von gunten 2003 where hydroxyl radical ho or sulfate radical so4 are formed as the most important reactive oxidizing species ros over the past decades several transition metal ions such as fe ii mn ii and co ii are reported to be effective for promoting the production of ho and so4 through electron transfer to peroxides e g h2o2 and persulfates anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 chevallier et al 2004 ghanbari and moradi 2017 pignatello et al 2006 watts et al 2005 recently these transition metal based chemical oxidation reactions have been found to generate reactive metal oxo species besides radicals responsible for trocs abatement dong et al 2020a wang et al 2018c wang et al 2019b zong et al 2020 it is widely accepted that reactive metal oxo species are selective oxidants that not only can react with electron rich organic compounds cabelli and sharma 2008 drummond and waters 1953 melton and bielski 1990 pode and waters 1956 sharma 2011 sun et al 2019a but also are resistant to the interference from common coexisting matrices like chloride and bi carbonate gao et al 2021 li et al 2018a these findings inspire the efforts to generate reactive metal oxo species in various oxidation processes especially to generate reactive fe species rfes fe iv v and reactive mn species rmns mn iii v vi because both fe and mn are abundantly available environmentally friendly and redox active guo et al 2019a rfes and rmns can be generated either through oxidizing low valent fe and mn species by various oxidants e g h2o2 persulfates hclo o3 and hio4 or through reducing fe vi and mn vii by some reductants liang et al 2020 sharma et al 2022 zong et al 2021 the low valent fe and mn species present in aqueous phase or solid phase have been reported to induce the generation of both radicals e g ho so4 and o2 and nonradical species e g rfes rmns and singlet oxygen 1o2 huang et al 2021 shang et al 2021 nevertheless the presence of both radical and nonradical mediated oxidation pathways impedes the progress of clarifying the reaction mechanisms of the fe mn based oxidation processes for example the competitive reactions between the radicals and rfes rmns against the scavengers may mislead the judgement of rfes rmns generation furthermore there is a misconception that the generation of rfes rmns would definitely result in their contribution to the degradation of target trocs as a result conflicting views on the identity of the major oxidants responsible for trocs degradation exist in some investigations of fe mn based oxidation processes ho and so4 are relatively non selective and suffer from the disadvantages of consumption by ubiquitous matrix components e g halide ions and dissolved organic matter dom lee et al 2020 oh et al 2016 therefore rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes are considered as alternative to the ho so4 mediated aops in oxidizing organic trocs in water and wastewater because of the selectivity of rfes rmns nevertheless a few critical issues have been overlooked in the application of rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes i dom at certain concentrations could reduce the treatment efficiency during oxidation and subsequently may lead to toxic byproducts formation e g iodinated byproducts in the presence of i wang et al 2020a zhu et al 2021 zhu et al 2019c and ii the substrate specific reactivity of rfes rmns is sometimes a defect because water and wastewater always contain multiple refractory trocs with different structures and properties in the past few years there have been a few review papers on rfes or rmns oxidation in environmental remediation processes one review has critically examined the strategies to generate highly reactive high valent iron intermediates i e fe iv fe v through activation of ferrate vi sharma et al 2022 and another one has discussed the prospective role of fe iv in fe2 activation initiated advanced oxidation processes wang et al 2022 the reactivity of manganese iii oxides toward organic contaminants has been briefly discussed remucal and ginder vogel 2014 despite these efforts no comprehensive review has been published to extensively describe the generation and detection of rfes and rmns chemical properties of rfes and rmns once formed in aqueous solution and effect of water matrix on the reactions moreover the limitations of applying rfes rmns in water and wastewater treatment are rarely covered in the literature in addition some specific problems related to the scavenger and probe selection and experimental results analysis potentially resulting in questionable conclusions also need to be discussed accordingly this review summarizes the recent research progress on the generation and detection of rfes rmns fe iv fe v and mn iii mn v mn vi in various oxidation processes the properties of rfes rmns are presented through comparison with those of various radicals e g ho so4 and cl the approaches for distinguishing high valent fe mn species fe iv fe v and mn v mn vi from ho and or so4 are summarized moreover the influence of background constituents such as organic matter and halides on rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes and possible byproducts formation are discussed and compared with ho so4 mediated oxidation processes finally the prospects and challenges for the applications of rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes in real practice are proposed 2 generation and detection of rfes and rmns in various oxidation processes 2 1 generation of rfes and rmns the generation of rfes and rmns for oxidative degradation of trocs can be achieved in homogeneous and heterogeneous systems in homogeneous processes aqueous fe ii mn ii ions fe ii iii mn ii ligand complexes and fe vi mn vii are usually employed as the precursors of rfes rmns fe mn containing solid catalysts including supported catalysts minerals and single atom catalysts are used as the precursors of rfes rmns in the heterogeneous processes in addition the circulation between rfes rmns and low valent fe mn species is also an important way to regenerate rfes rmns this section will give a brief overview of the oxidation processes forming rfes or rmns for the abatement of trocs 2 1 1 aqueous fe ii mn ii ions and fe ii iii mn ii ligand complexes based oxidation processes the formation of fe iv has been proposed in the homogeneous reaction of aqueous fe ii with peroxides e g h2o2 peroxydisulfate pds peroxymonosulfate pms and peracetic acid paa and other oxygen atom transfer oat oxidants e g o3 hclo and periodate fig 1 a and table 1 therein the activation of h2o2 by fe ii fenton process was regarded as the bray gorin reaction to produce fe iv or the haber weiss reaction to produce ho early in the 1930s bray and gorin 1932 haber and weiss 1934 more recent research showed that fe iv was generated as an intermediate via a two electron transfer at neutral ph while highly reactive and short lived ho was produced via a one electron transfer in acidic solutions in fenton process bataineh et al 2012 hug and leupin 2003 katsoyiannis et al 2008 keenan and sedlak 2008 hereafter fe iv was suggested to be the major ros besides so4 in the fe ii persulfate process but its contribution to trocs degradation generally dropped with increasing ph dong et al 2020a dong et al 2021 wang et al 2018c wang et al 2019b this mechanism has been further verified in the fe ii paa reaction where fe iv was produced via a two electron transfer and was proposed to be one of the ros responsible for the degradation of trocs kim et al 2019 the o o bond energy of paa and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital lumo energy are lower than those of h2o2 38 kcal mol 1 vs 51 kcal mol 1 0 25 ev vs 0 57 ev bokare and choi 2014 kim et al 2019 in comparison to h2o2 paa is easier to accept electrons and thus shows greater efficiency for oxidizing fe ii to fe iv kim et al 2019 in addition to aqueous fe ii aqueous mn ii has also been explored in homogeneous activation processes mn ii pms system has been shown to be inefficient for abating trocs which was ascribed to the rapid disproportionation of mn iii and the generation of caged oxidants mniii so4 2 anipsitakis and dionysiou 2004 rfes rmns could be transformed to low valent fe mn species either by oxidizing in organic compounds or by the self decomposition process the generated low valent fe mn species could be subsequently oxidized by the parent oxidant e g o3 and peroxide to rfes rmns the circulation between rfes rmns and the low valent fe mn species is significant for the catalytic removal of organics for example only small amount of fe ii was required for the fe ii catalyzed ozonation of sulfoxides because of the rapid fe iv fe ii circulation i e fe iv fe ii fe iv pestovsky and bakac 2006 but the circulation is only effective under acidic conditions with sludge formed from precipitation under neutral and alkaline conditions rastogi et al 2009a sun and pignatello 1992 a possible solution to tackle the limitation is to use ligands to inhibit the precipitation the commonly used ligands can be classified into four types including the polycarboxylates e g oxalate acid and citric acid aminocarboxylates e g nitrilotriacetic acid nta and ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid edta phosphates ligands e g pyrophosphate pp and n4 donor based ligands e g porphyrins phthalocyanine and tetraamido macrocyclic ligand taml according to their coordination sites i e carboxyl group amino group phosphate group and n heterocycle bruice et al 1988 canals et al 2013 chanda et al 2006 checa fernandez et al 2021 jans et al 2021 kudrik and sorokin 2017 rastogi et al 2009b sen gupta et al 2007 shappell et al 2008 sorokin 2013 the ros formed in the metal ligands peroxides systems are influenced by the species of metal ions and ligands for example the complexes formed between fe ii and several ligands e g edta nta oxalate acid and citric acid tend to catalyze pds or h2o2 to generate so4 or ho rather than fe iv wang et al 2019a on the contrary gao et al 2021 found that ligands such as edta and nta could facilitate the formation of mn iii ligands upon mn ii ligands oxidation by pms and mn iii ligands could be further oxidized by pms via two electron transfer to generate mn v ligands as the dominant ros for efficient oxidation of trocs fig 1a the addition of recalcitrant ligands may be applicable in some industrial parks where both ligands containing wastewater and other organic wastewater are generated and they can be mixed easily but these ligands need further treatment to alleviate the extra environmental risks before they are discharged into the water in addition to the recalcitrant ligands humic acid ha in natural waters is capable of complexing the intermediate mn iii which is formed from the oxidation of mn ii by o2 under visible light fig 1a the resulting mn iii ha complex has been considered to be an important one electron transfer oxidant for the transformation of organics wang et al 2020b the coordination of fe iii to n4 donor based ligands greatly enhances the ability of fe iii to activate peroxides e g pms and h2o2 to generate high valent iron complexes where the iron center adopts high oxidation states feiv or fev fig 1b the most frequently used n4 donor based ligand is taml which was designed by collins t j and his co workers over 20 years ago collins and ryabov 2017 they had developed seven generations of taml catalysts by 2017 fe iii tamls can activate peroxides via peroxidase like cycles to generate fe iv oxo complex and or fe v oxo complex which can rapidly and efficiently purify water containing electron rich compounds jans et al 2021 sen gupta et al 2007 similar to the case of fe ii iii n4 donor based ligands system various studies have investigated the utilization of mn ii n4 donor based ligands to activate peroxides e g pms and h2o2 to generate rmns so as to oxidize trocs xu et al 2009 yin et al 2005 yu et al 2020 in these systems the mn ii n4 structures are firstly oxidized to mn iv oxo n4 which is apt to decompose to mn v oxo n4 and mn iii n4 via a disproportionation reaction the further oxidation of mn iii n4 by peroxide can regenerate mn v oxo n4 which is suspected to serve as the key ros xu et al 2009 prior to the application of these technologies in real practice it is necessary to develop heterogeneous catalysts e g single atom catalysts in section 2 1 2 which are easy to separate and recycle to maximize the use of catalysts and to avoid the possible secondary pollution caused by soluble n4 donor based ligands 2 1 2 fe mn containing solids based oxidation processes in order to overcome the poor stability and recyclability of homogeneous activators metal containing activators in the solid phase are used in heterogeneous activation processes iron immobilized on supports such as silica alumina titanium oxide char composites and zeolite are used to activate peroxide to produce ros gonzalez olmos et al 2011 kim et al 2020 liang et al 2021 lim et al 2006 pham et al 2009 in some of these cases surface bound fe iv has been demonstrated to be the important ros responsible for trocs degradation for example kim et al 2020 reported that the surface fe iv was generated by the heterogeneous activation of h2o2 with a tio2 supported fe catalyst the supports can not only immobilize the generated fe iv but also facilitate the fenton like reaction by affecting the coordination environment of surface fe analogous to the roles of ligands in the homogeneous fenton like reactions lim et al 2006 pham et al 2009 in addition iron hydr oxides e g fe3o4 α feooh kwan and voelker 2003 luo et al 2021a and manganese oxides e g mn2o3 mn3o4 and mno2 huang and zhang 2019 have been widely applied as activators of peroxides in aops to remove trocs typically ho and so4 are the main active species resulting from the homolytical cleavage of the o o bond of peroxides singlet oxygen 1o2 and direct electron transfer are also reported to be involved in the above mentioned processes in addition a few studies reported the generation of rfes in these reactions chen et al 2022 guo et al 2010 lai et al 2020 for example natural titanomagnetite fe2 5ti0 5 1 04o4 fetio3 and fe3o4 are primary components was reported to be able to activate pds to generate surface fe iv and fe v as the ros for atrazine removal lai et al 2020 single atom catalysts sacs with metal n4 as the catalytical active sites are attracting increasing attention in environmental catalysis due to the maximum utilization of metal atoms unique electronic features of the single atom metal sites excellent catalytic activity and structural stability qiao et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 zhao et al 2019 zuo et al 2019 a variety of sacs with transition metal atoms e g co fe cu and mn have been developed as fenton like catalysts huang et al 2021 shang et al 2021 among them mn sacs are relatively rare while fe sacs are the most widely studied in the literature the active species responsible for trocs degradation in mn sacs peroxides systems are primarily free radicals and or 1o2 fan et al 2019 guo et al 2019b yang et al 2020 more research is required to elucidate the potential involvement of rmns in fe sacs peroxides systems the dominant ros depends on the type of peroxides the major ros in fe sacs h2o2 systems was reported to be ho huang et al 2021 shang et al 2021 while rfes was the predominant ros in fe sacs persulfate systems huang et al 2021 shang et al 2021 in addition the support materials may greatly affect the reactivity of sacs and also the generation of ros li et al 2018b prepared a single site fe catalyst by incorporating fe iii into g c3n4 cnf and observed that the cnf pms system was capable of selectivity degrading phenolic compounds they proposed that fev o fixated in the nitrogen sites of g c3n4 was proposed as the dominant ros qian et al 2021 fabricated a single atom material by constructing fe n4 sites on a carbon nanotube fesa n cnt to activate pms for the degradation of bisphenol a a fast removal of bisphenol a was achieved in the fesa n cnt pms system over a wide ph range 3 0 9 0 but the dominant ros was determined to be feiv o based on various evidences 2 1 3 fe vi and mn vii based oxidation processes fe vi and mn vii have been extensively investigated for the oxidative removal of trocs hu et al 2009 jiang et al 2012 sharma 2013 sharma et al 2015 song et al 2017 the reduction of fe vi and mn vii could generate high valent fe mn species as ros via either one electron transfer or two electron transfer sharma 2013 song et al 2017 these species are generally more reactive than their precursors fe vi and mn vii sharma 2013 sharma et al 2001 sharma et al 2015 simandi and zahonyi budo 1998 zahonyibudo and simandi 1994 1995 therefore the oxidation of trocs by fe vi and mn vii is possibly enhanced by inducing the generation of high valent fe mn oxo species from fe vi and mn vii the addition of reductants or materials containing electron donating functional groups e g sulfite feng et al 2018 shao et al 2020 shao et al 2019 sun et al 2016 sun et al 2015 biochar tian et al 2020 tian et al 2019 carbon nanotube pan et al 2020 sun et al 2019b wang et al 2021 and h2o2 shao et al 2019 xu and von gunten 2021 to the fe vi and mn vii oxidation systems are the most common means to trigger the generation of high valent fe mn species the activation is generally initiated with one or two electron transfer step fig 1c the reduction rates of fe vi mn vii in these processes are crucial for the yield of high valent fe mn species and subsequent trocs degradation feng et al 2018 shao et al 2020 sun et al 2015 one of the most efficient reductants for activating fe vi and mn vii is sulfite which can activate fe vi and mn vii to oxidize organic trocs with extraordinary high rates shao et al 2020 sun et al 2015 the sulfite activated oxidation processes have great potential for application in drinking water treatment and municipal wastewater reuse treatment chen et al 2021 spellman et al 2022 in addition the self decay of fe vi could also generate fe v and fe iv fig 1c lee et al 2014 accelerating the decay of fe vi to generate fe iv and or fe v is thus proposed as a method for fe vi activation the freshly generated particulate fe iii hydr oxides have been demonstrated to be able to increase the self decay rate of fe vi and catalyze the reaction of fe vi with h2o2 facilitating the generation of rfes for the enhanced degradation of trocs by fe vi jiang et al 2015 2016 luo et al 2021b shao et al 2019 zhang et al 2021c fe vi and mn vii can absorb light and be transformed into the photoexcited state followed by the decomposition into rfes and rmns respectively therefore uv irradiation were also proposed for activating fe vi and mn vii to produce rfes rmns for enhanced degradation of trocs guo et al 2018 yang et al 2022 in the uv mn vii process an excited state mno2 η 2 o2 could be formed during uv photolysis of mn vii at 254 nm and then mn v peroxide mno2 η 2 o2 might be formed via o o formation fig 1c thornley and bitterwolf 2015 2 2 detection of rfes and rmns detecting rfes and rmns is a fundamental task for clarifying the mechanisms of trocs abatement in rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes typically rfes and rmns can be analyzed i directly by characterization techniques such as uv visible spectrophotometry mössbauer spectroscopy and x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy xafs and ii indirectly by using chemical probes via the reaction with rfes and rmns producing compounds that can be easily detected just using a single method is generally not reliable to identify the generation of rfes and rmns in the oxidation process consequently multi strategies were suggested to be integrated for tracing the occurrence and evolution of rfes and rmns 2 2 1 direct detection direct detection of rfes and rmns by uv visible spectrophotometry is based on the emergence of their characteristic absorption spectrum in homogeneous solution absorption peaks of rfes rmns are presented in section 3 1 nevertheless this method has some drawbacks when applied to detect rfes rmns including the necessity for operating under homogeneous conditions the disturbance rising from surrounding matrix of other in organic compounds and the difficulty in identifying the short lived rfes rmns transient thus mössbauer spectroscopy and xafs are needed to provide solid evidence for the generation of rfes rmns since they are sensitive techniques to measure the metal transition in various oxidation processes chanda et al 2008 de oliveira et al 2007 liang et al 2021 liang et al 2020 pestovsky et al 2005 yang et al 2017 zong et al 2021 mössbauer spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique that can probe tiny changes in the energy levels of fe nucleus in response to its environment typically three types of nuclear interactions can be observed including isomeric shift quadrupole splitting and magnetic splitting graham and cohen 1976 the values of the isomer shifts δ are highly sensitive to the oxidation states of iron and decrease with an increase in oxidation state sharma et al 2015 for example the isomer shifts δ are 0 90 0 55 0 22 and 0 62 mm s 1 for k2fevio4 k3fevo4 na4feivo4 and γ feiiiooh respectively dedushenko et al 2008 rossiter and hodgson 1965 mössbauer spectroscopy is a crucial technique to identify the generation of fe iv fe v during oxidation of fe ii fe iii and reduction of fe vi for example the mössbauer spectrum of the fe2 hclo mixture was recorded at 12 k and this spectrum was identified to be a combination of the spectrum of fe ii and that of fe iv containing a singlet with δ 0 26 mm s 1 which verified the generation of fe iv in fe2 hclo process liang et al 2020 the mössbauer technique is only suitable for solid samples which can be achieved by freezing the liquid samples the key of detecting rfes with mössbauer spectroscopy is to match their lifetime with the detection speed the content of rfes in the sample is another constraint that limits their determination with mössbauer spectroscopy we have used mössbauer spectroscopy to detect generation of fe iv and fe v during the self decay of fe vi at 77 k three spectral components of fe vi fe iv and fe iii were observed fig 2 but the expected fe v was not observed the non detection of fe v might be ascribed to the low content of fe v species xafs is another widely used characterization technique for providing the information about the electronic valence state of concerned elements and the local geometric and or electronic structure of matter xafs can be divided into three regions pre edge region near edge region i e x ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy xanes and post edge region i e extended x ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy exafs past xafs studies have extracted metal valence information from exafs through crystal chemical interpretations of exafs derived metal o distances manceau et al 1992 marcus et al 2004 the valence of metal is estimated from the pre edge region and xanes region cai et al 2018 chalmin et al 2009 farges 2005 haas et al 2009 qualitatively the k edge energy of xanes region is positively related to the weighted average valence of iron fig 3 a and thus the right shift of edge energy is used to represent the increase in oxidation state for example zong et al 2021 reported that the fe k edge energy of the frozen samples of fe ii periodate mixture and fe iii solution were 7127 6 and 7124 4 ev respectively and they determined the average valence of iron in the fe ii periodate mixture to be 3 8 based on the linear relationship between the edge energy of fe reference compounds i e fe0 feo fe3o4 and fe2o3 and the corresponding fe valences as for mn chalmin et al 2009 showed that the centroid position of mn k pre edge could be used to obtain the oxidation state fig 3b consequently xafs spectra are expected to be able to provide conclusive evidences for the presence of rfes rmns but the k edge energy corresponds to the average value of various oxidation states which brings challenges to provide a clear distinction between dual high oxidation states e g fe iv and fe v mn v and mn vi in the oxidation process similar to the analysis with mössbauer spectroscopy the determination of the different oxidation states of rfes and rmns with xafs techniques is limited by the content of rfes or rmns in the sample 1 wt for transmission mode and 1 wt for fluorescence mode overall both techniques can only detect rfes and rmns at elevated concentrations and thus they are only suitable for mechanistic studies specially designed to generate large amounts of rfes and rmns but they cannot meet the needs for rapid and or in situ understanding the generation and reaction behaviors of rfes rmns attributable to the requirement of specialized instruments in the laboratory 2 2 2 indirect detection with probes the method of indirect detection is based on the introduction of a molecular probe which reacts selectively with rfes and rmns to form stable derived products and the generated products can be analyzed easily thus monitoring the disappearance of probe compound and the generation of the derived byproduct is an indirect method to verify the generation of rfes and rmns sulfoxides e g dimethyl sulfoxide dmso pmso have been widely used as chemical probes since sulfoxides are known to be oxidized by high valent metal species to produce the corresponding sulfones through an oxygen transfer step which is markedly different from the radical ho and so4 mediated oxidation pathway pestovsky and bakac 2006 wang et al 2018c the detection limit for pmso2 with high performance liquid chromatography is 10 nm pang et al 2011 thus compared to the direct detection techniques the probe trapping method is able to be employed to identify the high valent fe mn species in normal treatment systems indirect detection could be affected by the presence of other reactive species that can react with the chemical probes via similar pathway for example co3 a secondary radical produced from the reaction of ho and so4 with bi carbonate can also oxidize sulfoxides to the corresponding sulfone derivatives via o atom transfer eqn r1 huang and mabury 2000 therefore other auxiliary approaches should be applied to identify the generation of high valent fe mn species in the laboratory and 18o isotope labeling technique is such a method this method is based on the feature that high valent fe mn species can exchange the oxygen atom 16o with h2 18o eqn r2 pestovsky and bakac 2006 pestovsky et al 2005 therefore the generation of 18o isotope incorporated sulfone products eqn r3 in h2 18o is critical to verify the presence of high valent fe mn species r1 r soc h 3 co 3 r s o 2 c h 3 r2 m e n 16 o h 2 18 o m e n 18 o r3 r s 16 oc h 3 m e n

ph 3 0 or basic ph 10 0 conditions in the literature at ph 3 0 fe iv feo2 could be effectively generated by the reaction of fe2 with o3 eqn r4 jacobsen et al 1998 loegager et al 1992 martire et al 2002 pestovsky et al 2005 and the absorption at 320 nm ε320 420 m 1 cm 1 was used to monitor its decay jacobsen et al 1998 the half life t 1 2 of fe iv in 0 1 m hclo4 was determined to be 7 s pestovsky and bakac 2006 the observed decay of fe iv in water is predominantly first order and the mechanism is represented by a sequence of reactions eqn r5a r5b r5c and r5d the rate determining step is reaction eqn r5a and the reaction rate increases from 0 02 s 1 to 2 0 s 1 with increasing ph from 0 0 to 3 0 jacobsen et al 1998 martire et al 2002 although fe iv is short lived the lifetime of fe iv is much larger than that of free radicals fig 4 a r4 f e 2 o 3 f e o 2 o 2 r5a f e o 2 h 2 o h f e 3 h 2 o h o r5b f e o 2 h o h f e 3 h 2 o 2 r5c f e o 2 h 2 o 2 h f e 3 h 2 o h o 2 r5d f e o 2 h

generated from the reaction of corresponding fe iii complexes with radicals e g ho o and co3 which can be achieved by the pulse radiolysis technique in aqueous solution bielski 1992 melton and bielski 1990 the fe iv complexes are also short lived and their lifetime varies with the ligand for example the half life of fe iv pp complex is in the range of 100 600 ms at ph 10 0 while fe iv carbonate complex is much more stable than fe iv pp complex and its lifetime is 0 5 1 0 s in the ph range of 8 0 11 0 melton and bielski 1990 aqueous fe v derived from the reduction of fe vi by radicals has been characterized over the ph range of 3 6 13 0 by using pulse radiolysis rush and bielski 1989 1994 the absorbance of fe v in alkaline solution has a maximum at 380 nm which undergoes a blue shift with decreasing ph rush and bielski 1989 1994 the observed disappearance of fe v was predominantly first order and the rates varied from 7 0 104 s 1 to 100 s 1 with the ph ranging from 3 6 to 7 0 the first order process was described by the hydration of tetrahedral fe v to a six coordinate octahedral species prior to loss of h2o2 in alkaline solution fe v decayed predominantly following second order kinetics which was initiated by dimerization followed by fast yield of iron iii peroxo complex at ph 7 0 12 0 the second order rate constants of fe v decay varied in the range of 105 108 m 1 s 1 and decreased with increasing ph ii rmns mn iii ion only stably exists in strongly acidic media and otherwise it undergoes hydrolysis eqn r6 wells and davies 1965 upon decreasing the acidity mn iii is apt to disproportionate to mn ii and mno2 rapidly eqn r7 rao and adinarayana 1992 mn iii can be stabilized by forming complexes with many chelating agents such as pp edta and citric acid davies 1969 klewicki and morgan 1998 for example the half life of mn iii pp is 25 530 days at ph 7 0 9 0 when the molar ratio of pp to mn iii is 25 0 klewicki and morgan 1998 the absorption spectrum of mn iii pp has a characteristic peak at 258 nm ε258 6750 m 1 cm 1 webb et al 2005 r6 m n i i i a q h 2 o m n o h 2 h r7 2 m n i i i m n i i m n i v r8 3 m n v m n v i i 2 m n i v r9 2 m n v i m n v i i m n v mn v and mn vi are unstable and are easily decomposed into stable mno4 and mno2 eqn r8 and r9 kirschenbaum and meyerstein 1981 rush and bielski 1995b the instability of mn v and mn vi in aqueous solutions is presumably related to the existence of protonated forms which undergo rapid disproportionation reactions rush and bielski 1995b mn vi is more stable than mn v under moderately basic conditions rush and bielski 1995b disproportionation of mn v and mn vi is slow under highly basic conditions 6 9 m 1 s 1 for mn v in 3 m koh and 4 9 m 1 s 1 for mn vi at ph 11 0 but very rapid under moderately basic or acid conditions e g 104 m 1 s 1 for mn v at ph 11 0 and 1 27 107 m 1 s 1 for mn vi at ph 1 0 lee and chen 1989 mn v can exist for 2 3 days in solution with koh concentration greater than 8 0 m and mn vi can exist for several weeks in solution containing 1 0 5 0 m koh carrington and symons 1956 pode and waters 1956 the absorbance at 660 nm and 610 nm was used to monitor

rfes and rmns the data on redox potentials for rfes rmns and second order rate constants of rfes rmns with organic compounds are very limited in the literature and the available data are summarized in fig 4b c the redox potentials for feivo2 fe3 fe v fe iv and mn iii mn ii couples are 2 0 v 1 8 v and 1 51 v respectively the presence of ligands significantly lowers their redox potentials e g 1 0 1 35 v and 1 15 v for fe iv pp fe iii pp and mn iii pp mn ii pp respectively fig 4b in comparison to ho so4 cl and cl2 fe iv fe v and mn iii are mild oxidants with moderate redox potentials generally the second order rate constants k for rfes rmns with organic compounds range from 100 to 106 m 1 s 1 except for the reaction of fe v with cysteine most of which are several orders of magnitude lower than those with regard to free radicals rfes rmns prefer to react with organosulfur compounds phenols aliphatic alcohols and amino acids but they are less reactive toward aldehydes ketones ether nitriles and aromatics containing only electron withdrawing groups such as carboxylic acids with k 104 m 1 s 1 the selectivity of rfes rmns is similar to that of cl2 and co3 3 3 reaction mechanisms of rfes and rmns mn iii usually oxidizes organic compounds via one electron transfer with mn ii being the final product kostka et al 1995 sun et al 2019a wang et al 2020b but fe iv fe v and mn v mn vi can react with organic compounds by diverse reaction pathways such as o atom transfer park et al 2011 pestovsky and bakac 2006 electron transfer sharma 2010 electrophilic addition martire et al 2002 rush et al 1995 and hydrogen abstraction jacobsen et al 1998 pestovsky and bakac 2004 rush and bielski 1995a depending on the nature of substrates this section will mainly focus on the reaction of high valent fe iv fe v and mn v mn vi with organic compounds to illustrate the different oxidation mechanisms i o atom transfer o atom transfer is unique to the reaction of high valent metal species with organic compounds as shown in fig 5 sulfoxide ars o r is formed either by direct o atom transfer from high valent metal species men o to sulfide arsr or by electron transfer from arsr to men o followed by o atom transfer from me n 1 o to the radical cation arsr chellamani et al 1999 park et al 2011 further oxidation of the sulfoxide e g methyl phenyl sulfoxide pmso by men o form corresponding sulfone e g methyl phenyl sulfone pmso2 via o atom transfer pestovsky and bakac 2006 which is different from the products e g biphenyl compounds of the oxidation of pmso by ho and so4 wang et al 2018c ii electron transfer this is the main pathway for many organic compounds that react with rfes and rmns including amines phenols carboxylic acids and alcohols both one electron and two electron transfer mechanisms have been proposed in the oxidation reactions which reasonably account for the observed products of the reactions for example phenols could be oxidized by mn iii to form phenoxyl radicals i e one electron transfer which could form various cross linked dimers trimers and tetramers or undergo further oxidation to yield benzoquinones fig 5 gao et al 2018 martire et al 2002 nevertheless the oxidation of oh containing organic compounds by high valent fe mn species undergoes the formation of o bridged compounds fig 5 which offers a convenient path for subsequent inner sphere electron transfer to generate catechol and ketone for the oxidation of phenol and alcohol respectively pestovsky and bakac 2004 rush et al 1995 zahonyibudo and simandi 1995 the reactivity of rfes and rmns toward aromatic compounds can be modulated by the substituent groups martire et al 2002 which can change the electron density at particular reactive sites of molecules for example the aromatic primary amine group in p toluidine is activated by the electron donating methyl group at the para position and becomes reactive toward bicarbonate complexed fe v while the aromatic primary amine in n n dimethylaniline is substituted with two methyl groups which obstructs the reaction of n n dimethylaniline with bicarbonate complexed fe v due to the steric hindrance effect luo et al 2019 the substituent effects can be reflected by a correlation of the reaction rate constants with the hammett constants for example the apparent rate constants of substituted phenols degradation in feiv taml mediated oxidation process was negatively correlated to hammett constants log k obs ρσ ρ 3 63 for variable σ su et al 2018 iii electrophilic addition aromatic compounds could also react with high valent metal species via electrophilic addition mechanism for example high valent fe species can attack the aromatic ring of phenolic compounds to yield hydroxycyclo hexadienyl radical via electrophilic addition fig 5 martire et al 2002 rush et al 1995 the formed hydroxycyclo hexadienyl radical further decomposed to generate catechol quinone or hydroquinone martire et al 2002 rush et al 1995 it has not been documented that whether electrophilic addition is a preferred reaction pathway during the oxidation of aromatic compounds by high valent metal species however addition is the main process taking place with ho in the presence of aromatic compounds gligorovski et al 2015 iv hydrogen abstraction hydrogen abstraction is also a possible route for the reaction of high valent fe mn species with substrates pirovano and mcdonald 2018 a series of aliphatic alcohols aldehydes acetonitrile and ethers could react with aqueous fe iv by hydrogen atom transfer pestovsky and bakac 2004 the first step of aliphatic alcohol oxidation is hydrogen abstraction from carbons to produce carbon centered radicals fig 5 which further form various products by oxygen addition louwerse et al 2008 pestovsky and bakac 2004 experimental data of products distribution enabled the understanding of the reaction pathways in solution and the assessment of their relative importance for example in the oxidation of cyclobutanol by aqueous fe iv a smaller fraction of the reaction takes place by hydrogen transfer believed to yield ring opened products while the reaction generates cyclobutanone in 70 yield by a two electron process pestovsky and bakac 2004 4 role of multiple oxidants in the abatement of trocs 4 1 are rfes and rmns major oxidants a summary of the rfes rmns involved oxidation processes is listed in table 1 besides rfes and rmns free radicals e g so4 and ho are often reported to contribute to the oxidation of trocs in many rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes both free radicals e g so4 and ho and high valent fe mn species were usually proposed as the ros in these processes in this case the degradation pathways of trocs were somehow complicated considering the presence of both radical and nonradical species in the oxidation process the degradation kinetics of the target compound is related to the intrinsic reactivity of rfes rmns the concentration of rfes rmns in aqueous solution and or the transport of trocs to the surface of heterogeneous catalysts to achieve sufficient exposure to rfes rmns chen et al 2022 yang et al 2021 the contributions of rfes and rmns to the degradation of trocs in many rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes were overestimated since the formation of rfes and rmns does not necessarily suggest that they played an important role in the degradation of various trocs in water the case of the fe ii pds system is quite indicative by using pmso as the probe compound wang et al demonstrated that in the fe ii pds system fe iv was the dominant reactive species under acidic conditions based on the results that the yield of pmso2 was close to 100 wang et al 2018c however dong et al argued that both fe iv and free radicals so4 and ho were all generated in the fe ii pds system and these ros contributed differently to the transformation of different trocs by using multiple probes e g dmso pmso p nitrobenzoic acid and ba dong et al 2020a free radicals and fe iv were the major roc for the degradation of benzoic acid and amoxicillin respectively dong et al 2020a different interpretations of the mechanism of the fe ii pds process present in the literature may be ascribed to the mild and selective reactivity of fe iv it is well documented that fe iv is very reactive with pmso e g k 1 2 105 m 1 s 1 pestovsky and bakac 2006 and the electron rich trocs such as phenol chlorophenols and antibiotics whereas organic compounds such as nitrobenzene and ibuprofen with the benzene ring functioned with deactivating groups or electron withdrawing groups such as no2 are not favorable for a nonradical reaction duan et al 2018 thus it is not proper to use only one probe to identify the contributions of rfes rmns in many oxidation processes 4 2 identifying different reactive species identifying different reactive species is very crucial for optimizing the process of trocs removal by a rfes rmns mediated oxidation process generally electron paramagnetic resonance epr using dmpo as a spin trapping agent and quenching experiments using excess alcohol based scavengers were the most widely used methods to verify the role of so4 and or ho as main oxidant s unfortunately these two techniques could not exclusively identify the generation of so4 and or ho or discriminate the role of so4 and or ho from that of rfes and rmns during the abatement of trocs in rfes rmns mediated oxidation process first it has been unveiled that high valent fe mn species can react with dmpo to produce dmpo ho adducts shao et al 2019 xu et al 2017 thus the epr spectrum of dmpo ho adducts did not necessarily reflect the generation of ho in the rfes rmns mediated oxidation process second high valent fe mn species are also sensitive to some commonly used radical quenching agents such as methanol and ethanol in this regard further study should evaluate the product distribution of by using target probe compound e g sulfoxides to verify the generation of rfes rmns and radicals or employ organic compounds with the benzene ring functioned with deactivating groups as scavengers such as p chlorobenzoic acid nitrobenzene and ba which are susceptible to oxidation by so4 and or ho but are resistant to rfes rmns oxidation chen et al 2020 dong et al 2020a in addition competition kinetics method could be used to distinguish rfes rmns from radicals by comparing the reactivities toward solutes present together in the same solution and under identical conditions for example the ratio of the reaction rate constant of c6h12 with high valent iron species to that of c6d12 with high valent iron species k h k d 1 4 is larger than that with ho k h k d 1 12 which had been taken as evidence for the presence of high valent iron species in photo assisted fenton reaction pignatello et al 1999 besides high valent fe mn species 1o2 can be induced by metal carbon catalysts in persulfate based aops duan et al 2018 huang et al 2021 shang et al 2021 both high valent fe mn species and 1o2 are selective toward trocs and exhibit moderate oxidative potential compared to free radicals but there are few methods available at this stage to distinguish the contributions of various nonradical species to the degradation of trocs 5 matrix effects on rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes researchers are currently focusing on developing the oxidation processes with rfes rmns as the main oxidant to selectively degrade the target organic contaminants in complicated water matrixes however there is a lack of scrutiny of some issues about the matrix effects on the oxidation efficiency of trocs and on the formation of byproducts in the rfes rmns mediated oxidation process the focus of this section is to summarize the effects of water matrix on trocs oxidation by rfes rmns with special attention to the comparison with ho so4 mediated aops 5 1 effect of halide ions cl is the most abundant halide ions in wastewaters it is widely believed that one of the major advantages of rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes originates from the weak reactivity of rfes rmns toward cl for example the rate constant of the reaction of fe iv with cl is as low as 100 10 m 1 s 1 in 0 1 m hclo4 jacobsen et al 1998 as for br and i their reactivity with rfes rmns and their influence on the performance of many rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes are unknown but several studies suggested that the oxidation of br and i by fe vi mn vii generated hobr and hoi respectively and found the formation of bromate bro3 and brominated iodinated byproducts through the halogenation of dom and phenols by in situ formed hobr hoi dong et al 2018 huang et al 2016 jiang et al 2016 li et al 2018c wang et al 2020c since rfes rmns are more reactive than fe vi mn vii br and i might influence the oxidation of trocs and facilitate byproducts formation in rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes for example spellman et al 2022 showed that the sub stoichiometric sulfite fe vi 0 5 activated fe vi treatment approach where fe v was the major active oxidant could generate bro3 120 μg l 1 after oxidation of br 200 μm in spiked municipal wastewater effluents but the yield of bro3 was lower than that resulting from ozonation under similar conditions comparatively both ho and so4 react rapidly with halide ions but with different reaction pathways the reactions of ho with cl and br at concentrations of interest to fresh water and most hazardous wastewater are reversible under neutral conditions ho x xoh while xoh could be further transformed to x under acidic conditions xoh h cl h2o or x2 at high halide concentrations xoh x x2 oh e g saline waters grebel et al 2010 in contrast so4 reacts with cl and br to produces cl and br respectively through one electron transfer yang et al 2014 similar to rfes rmns these reactive halogen species e g x and x2 are also selective and can oxidize trocs containing electron rich moieties lei et al 2019 lian et al 2017 thus they can compensate for the loss of oxidation capacity of ho and so4 due to their consumption by background halide ions the halide ions could in some cases even enhance the decomposition of trocs in aops with ho so4 as the major ros depending on the reactivity of the formed reactive halogen species toward trocs lian et al 2017 moreover these reactive halogen species are sometimes more reactive than rfes rmns in oxidizing organics for example the second order rate constants of cl with many trocs at ph 7 0 are reported to range from 109 to 1010 m 1 s 1 lei et al 2019 much larger than those of rfes rmns with trocs thus the selective oxidation of trocs electron rich moieties in the presence of cl could be achieved in both rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes and ho so4 mediated aops 5 2 effect of oxyanions rfes rmns are inert to phosphate and bi carbonate but phosphate might exhibit negative or positive influence on the oxidation ability of rfes rmns after its complexation with rfes rmns for example the coordination of fe v with phosphate ligands might induce steric hindrance limiting the fe v complex to associate with target compounds and thus impacting the electron transfer process huang et al 2018 in contrast the complexation of mn iii by phosphate increases the stability of mn iii and favors the oxidation of phenolic compounds jiang et al 2009 2010 the two oxyanions however often scavenge ho so4 and decrease the oxidation efficiency of ho so4 mediated aops lee et al 2020 yang et al 2014 in addition the oxidation of bi carbonate by ho so4 generates co3 which is also selective and prefers to react with electron rich organics but the overall treatment efficiency generally decreases since the reactivities of co3 toward organic compounds are much lower than those of ho so4 fig 4c unlike phosphate and bi carbonate nitrite might be able to be oxidized by rfes rmns since it is readily to be oxidized by fe vi mn vii sharma 2010 song et al 2017 and rfes rmns are more reactive than fe vi mn vii for example the rate constant of nitrite oxidation by fe iv is 105 m 1 s 1 0 1 m hclo4 jacobsen et al 1998 as a result high concentrations of nitrite in secondary wastewater effluents can scavenge rfes rmns and cause inhibitory effect on trocs degradation moreover the oxidation of nitrite by rfes rmns can generate no2 through one electron transfer jacobsen et al 1998 similar to the oxidation of nitrite by ho so4 the generated no2 may further oxidize the organic matter to form nitrogenous organic disinfection byproducts lee et al 2020 nevertheless ozonation of nitrite containing waters can generate nitrate rather than nitrogenous organic disinfection byproducts hu et al 2010 5 3 effect of dom although rfes rmns are resistant to many coexisting anions they are not such ideal selective reactive species in some water treatment scenarios with high concentrations of dom rfes rmns may suffer from the disadvantages of consumption by dom which contains abundant phenolic moieties 2 86 0 71 mmol phenol gc aeschbacher et al 2012 onnby et al 2018 walpen et al 2016 and is generally present at concentrations much higher than those of trocs in natural water and wastewater schwarzenbach et al 2006 therefore dom is also a typical scavenger of rfes rmns although the second order rate constants for the reactions between rfes rmns and dom are unknown in addition antioxidant moieties in dom can reduce intermediate radicals of organics back to their parent compounds canonica and schonenberger 2019 wenk et al 2011 it should be noted that the consumption of various oxidants e g ozone fe vi and mn vii by reactive dom moieties can generate assimilable organic carbon aoc which may lead to enhanced toxicity ramseier et al 2011 the formation of aoc is related to the reactivity of used oxidants ramseier et al 2011 since rfes rmns are more reactive than fe vi mn vii particular attention should be paid to the possible aoc formation in rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes 6 prospects and challenges compared to other oxidation processes rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes have some special merits and may be applicable in water and industrial wastewater treatment i rfes rmns could be used in a catalytic manner through the cycle between rfes rmns and low valent fe mn ions which is significant for minimizing the generation of fe and mn rich solids when rfes rmns are ros in pre oxidation treatment process the residual fe and mn rich solids once formed can be efficiently removed in the following coagulation sedimentation and filtration units and will not cause concern in the treated drinking water ii rfes and rmns seem likely to provide an opportunity for the selective removal of organics when the anions are present at high concentrations e g saline wastewater the formation of some harmful byproducts such as chlorate and chlorinated byproducts can be avoided when rfes rmns are the major ros which is a significant advantage of rfes rmns over radicals e g ho so4 and cl and traditional oxidants e g chlorine dioxide and chlorine iii because of the substrate specific reactivity rfes rmns are likely to be suitable for the treatment of specific type of wastewaters containing phenols and aniline although many established methods such as ozonation and uv h2o2 based aops are also effective for these contaminants several disadvantages exist such as relatively complex equipment for onsite generation of ozone and energy consumption comparatively some rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes can oxidize organic contaminants with extraordinary high rates e g mn vii sulfite process and thus the oxidation can be completed within the pipe equipped with a rapid mixer this makes these oxidation processes superior to many other established methods with regard to the footprint and equipment investment despite the progress of developing rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes there are still some challenges for the application of these processes in real practice i we believe that the rfes rmns dominated oxidation process is difficult to achieve selective oxidation of trocs in municipal wastewater treatment scenarios since rfes rmns can be affected by the complicated water matrix such as nitrite and dom moreover rfes rmns are selective to the electron rich contaminants which is a defect because most wastewater always contain multiple refractory contaminants with different structures and properties which requires broadband treatment options including physical removal e g activated carbon reverse osmosis and nanofiltration or a less selective oxidation method ii although there have been numerous studies concerning the generation of rfes rmns for the oxidation of organic contaminants there is no quantitative study on the yields of rfes rmns during the decomposition of parent oxidants e g persulfate if the molar ratio of rfes rmns effective for degrading trocs to the consumed parent oxidants is very small large amount of parent oxidants have to be applied to achieve the removal of little amount of trocs therefore the information on oxidant yields of rfes rmns mediated oxidation processes is particularly expected and efforts should be made to increase the electron efficiency of parent oxidants and rfes rmns to achieve highly efficient decomposition of trocs iii recent rfes rmns involved processes are mostly discovered in the persulfate based systems whereas the investigations with h2o2 are still limited although h2o2 is much more environmentally friendly than persulfate there is an environmental risk that high concentrations of sulfate and h remain in treated water after the application of persulfates declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work
