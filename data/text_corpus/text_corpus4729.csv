23645,flettner rotors are spinning cylinders which produce lift force by utilizing wind power today due to global warming and necessity of reducing emissions renewable energy resources such as wind energy become more significant than ever before this study presents the influence of flettner rotors on roll motion of ships and the effects of roll motion on performance of flettner rotors in beam waves the calculations are carried out by using xflow cfd program the sample rotor has a 4 m diameter 27 m height and a thom disc the calculations are performed with 0 20 40 and 60 heel angles to obtain the heeling moment function and driving force function with respect to heeling angle the results of roll responses of the sample ship with and without flettner rotors are presented in time and frequency domain comparatively the results from the calculations show that the lift power performance of flettner rotors decreased with increasing of heeling angle after adding flettner rotor contribution on heeling moment function it is seen that flettner rotors do not increase the nonlinearity of roll motion also it was found that at large heel angles the driving force becomes almost zero 1 introduction flettner rotors are spinning cylinders which produce lift force by utilizing wind power this phenomenon is called as magnus effect magnus effect is the observed effect in which a spinning cylinder generation of forces due to differential pressures german physicist heinrich gustav magnus described the effect in 1852 flettner rotor system was firstly used for vessels in the 1920 s by flettner flettner rotors are used for modern ships nowadays there are two ships which have flettner rotors one of them is e ship1 built by enercon company in 2010 and the other one is estraden which is a modified rotor ship there are many studies about rotating cylinders behaviours those studies are on different reynolds numbers and spin ratios which is the ratio of the surface speed to the free stream flow speed one of those studies is a research by aoki and ito 2001 who studied the characteristics of lift and drag forces strouhal number flow patterns behind a rotating cylinder in terms of spin rate ratio by numerical and experimental analysis in their study the spin rate ratio is varied from 0 to 1 0 for reynolds numbers between re 60000 and 140000 the lift coefficient cl increases with increasing spin rate ratio mittal and kumar 2003 also studied the characteristics of lift and drag forces in a reynolds number range between re 200 and re 1000 their paper showed that for low re numbers between the spin ratio of 0 and 2 cl has a sinusoidal relation with flow time with increasing spin ratio except between 4 2 and 4 8 the cl is constant cl values are irregular between 4 2 and 4 8 they compared their numerical studies with the experimental studies by chen et al 1993 there are also some papers about the usage of rotor in some other marine applications one of those studies was belonged to de marco et al 2015 who studied the varying geometric factors of flettner rotors such as length and diameter they tried to propose a systematic approach identifying effectiveness and industrial usefulness of flettner rotors traut et al 2014 compared wind kite and flettner rotors they searched the propulsive power contribution on five selected shipping routes with various wind velocities and wind directions they showed the wind can in some cases provide a major share of required propulsive power katoh and umegaki 2016 have attempted to come up with an experimental approach on the effect of flettner rotors on stability in this study the stability characteristics such as the restoration angle and the roll angle for different rotor speeds and different wind velocities were investigated with a single rotor placed on a model the results were then compared with the non rotor case there are many studies on roll motion of ships linear and nonlinear formulation of roll motion can be found in the literature blagoveshchensky 1962 bhattacharyya 1978 nonlinearity of the motion is often related with damping and restoring terms various roll motion models containing nonlinear terms have been studied by many researchers de kat and paulling 1989 denise 1983 these models are differed from each other with various damping terms and degree of restoring moment representation damping and its components were studied by ikeda et al 1978 himeno 1981 schmitke 1978 cumming et al 1990 haddara and zhang 1994 influence of various damping term expressions on the nonlinearity of roll motion have been researched by wellicome 1975 wright and marshfield 1979 odabasi and vince 1982 and taylan 1990 1996 2000 in the present study restoring term is chosen as a cubic polynomial and damping term is chosen as a quintic form taylan 1996 damping coefficients are calculated at all time steps with respect to roll angle and roll frequency this paper aims at incorporating the heeling moment term due to the effect of flettner rotors into the nonlinear roll motion model many studies have been conducted on the characteristics of rotating cylinders and their application in marine field as flettner rotors however there are not sufficient research readily found in the literature about the influence of flettner rotors on roll motion and their effects on flettner rotor performance this study presents the influence of flettner rotors on roll motion of ships and the effects of roll motion on performance of flettner rotors in beam waves with a chosen test vessel to this end a test case is detailed and a procedure is outlined this study is carried out by using computational fluid dynamics the program which is used to perform the required calculations with 4 logical processors is xflow 14 0 release the underlying principle of xflow is based on lattice boltzmann methods unlike classical cfd methods this program is a meshless particle based kinetic solver which does not require mesh building 2 features of the test vessel the test vessel is a multipurpose merchant vessel the geometric form of vessel and main dimensions are given in fig 1 and table 1 respectively the general arrangement of the ship can be seen in fig 2 two flettner rotors which are assumed to be ineffective on each other were utilized as tandem position for analysis the distance between two rotors is 60 m the calculations for a single rotor are considered the same for the other one 3 numerical setup and conditions the numerical calculations are conducted in a virtual wind tunnel which measures100 m in length 100 m in height and 100 m in width the test rotor has a 4 m diameter 27 m height and a thom disc with 8 m in diameter and 0 08 m in height thom disc is used with rotor to eliminate the end effects of the rotor and to obtain a higher lift force thom 1934 the rotor is arranged on a mounting part representing the hull of the ship to settle the effects of ship hull on the heeled position the width of the mounting part has same the width of the test vessel the test case is arranged using a vessel which has two flettner rotors and 12 knots speed this vessel rolls under the influence of beam waves and starboard bow wind velocity of the true wind is assumed 12 m s so apparent wind is 16 m s resulting in 12 knots ship speed the basic scheme of the test case is given in fig 3 the calculations for single rotor are doubled in roll motion analysis the virtual wind tunnel can be seen in fig 4 during the tests three dimensional characteristics of the rotor were measured the coordinate system adopted throughout the virtual wind tunnel is shown in fig 4 the model was installed at the center of the virtual wind tunnel angular velocity of the rotor is constant at 300 rpm and the wave steepness is chosen as h Î» 1 25 the geometry is kept constant and angle of wind direction is rotated according to x axis as 0 20 40 60 and in the opposite direction 20 40 60 to observe heeling effects various wind angles of cfd cases can be seen in fig 6 air is used as the working fluid medium and operating temperature of the air is 288 15 k the flow around the rotor is re 4 38 106 the analysis type is external the flow model is single phase and the turbulence model is smagorinsky model to be sure to obtain correct results from cfd calculations the output values must be independent from particle density resolutions to clarify that calculations are carried out with various particle density resolutions those calculations have same feature with 0 case after the calculations are completed heeling force coefficients cz are compared for each different particle density resolutions the results can be seen from fig 5 after finding independent results from particle density resolution the maximum resolved scale of particles is taken as 1 m and the minimum scale which is distance between particles near object densest region of calculations area is taken as 0 125 m it is an adaptive refinement particle adaptation so that near geometry and wake area detail the particle density the particle density resolution can be seen in fig 7 xflow cfd program has automatic time step adjustment according to courant number courant number is smaller than 1 and the program take the time step as 0 001 s at the beginning the calculations are carried out during a 50 s of simulation time the resolved wall model is used driving and heeling forces are calculated for each of 7 cases 4 validation for cfd analysis and studies validation is one of the most important criteria validation is important because of reliability and accuracy in cfd works oberkampf and trucano 2002 in this study the validation is performed with comparing the cfd results with the experimental data the comparison is carried out using the experimental study of aoki and ito 2001 in their study the lift and characteristics of a rotating cylinder are clarified using both experimental and numerical calculation methods the dimensions of the virtual wind tunnel and rotating cylinder are the same with the experimental case for re 60000 lift coefficient cl from experimental and numerical studies of swanson 1961 and aoki and ito 2001 were compared with the results of xflow the calculations are carried out with 2d domain same with original case every feature are same with study of aoki and ito 2001 only the turbulence model which is used for xflow computations is smagorinsky model the computations are carried out with four processors fig 8 shows the change of the lift coefficient cl as a function of the spin rate ratio Î± it can be seen that the experimental results compare well with the results of the computations the results also indicate that xflow reveals better results with compared to aoki s numerical calculations to make clear the validation process a comparison with another study was also needed the reference experimental data are taken from the study of reid 1924 the graphic which is given in fig 9 is shown that our results are highly agree with experimental data in our main case spinning velocity is 300 rpm 62 83 m s stream velocity is16 m s spin ratio ut v Î± is 3 926 and cylinder coefficient l d is 6 75 also after calculations with various turbulence models it s found that average lift coefficient with spalart allmaras model is 8 6 with wall adapting local eddy wale model is 6 82 with smagorinsky is 8 7 it s clear that the values of our cfd results agree with the experimental data and can be seen the results are acceptable especially smagorinsky turbulence model provides a better result it has to be noted that the calculations are carried out with same case such as same geometry flow velocity spin ratio and particle density resolution etc of the main study which can be seen at numerical setup and conditions part above 5 results and discussion forces acting on a flettner rotor were calculated by xflow software the driving force which contributes to propulsion of the vessel is the component of magnus effect force along x axis in other words the direction of the vessel fig 7 the heeling force which acts as the excitation for roll motion is the component of magnus effect force along y axis as shown in fig 10 figs 9 and 10 show the velocity of the rotor at seven different angles of wind direction namely 0 20 40 60 20 40 and 60 the flow velocity vector gradient fig 11 and the streamlines fig 12 are shown at each angle of flow direction as measured by xflow the velocity vector gradients fig 11 are given in a 2d plane from the middle of the rotor the streamlines fig 12 are given with 3d perspective when the vessel heels to port side it can be seen that flow velocity gradients and streamlines are similar with the ones of an upright vessel however when the vessel heels to starboard side the flow around of the rotor and wake region become more turbulent and unstable the magnus effect can be seen also from each of the directions in figs 11 and 12 5 1 driving forces the magnitudes of driving forces are proportional with the performance of flettner rotors performance of flettner rotors are affected by the wind speed wind direction ship speed trim angle and heel angle in this study wind speed wind direction ship speed and trim are taken as constant it is primarily focused on the heel angle the driving forces with respect to time are calculated with lattice boltzmann method based cfd program as shown in fig 12 with port side heel angles 20 40 60 and starboard side heel angles 20 40 60 the forces which are given in fig 13 depend on time the average driving force for each heel angle is calculated as shown in fig 14 as negative sign represents the port side and positive sign represents the starboard side the driving forces are not symmetric in roll motion wind direction is assumed from starboard to port the results indicate that rotors have higher driving forces when heeling to starboard than heeling to port especially at heeling angle 60 to port side the driving force is negative so the rotors work as brakes 5 2 heeling forces the test case is prepared so that the heeling force and lateral component of wind having the same direction to enhance magnitude of the heeling force calculated heeling force values are supplied in fig 15 it is observed that the variation of forces for angles heeling to starboard a have wider band than heeling to port the heeling force is approximately 1 2 105 n to starboard 60 but it is approximately 1 7 105 n to port 60 the average of heeling forces for each heeling angle are calculated and shown in fig 16 the figure shows that heeling forces are not symmetric in roll motion 5 3 roll motion analysis heeling moment values induced by the rotors should be determined in order to investigate the influence of flettner rotors on roll motion heeling force values were calculated for various heel angles by cfd program as indicated in section 5 2 pressure variations along the rotors were calculated by cfd program as shown in fig 17 the heeling moment levers are determined by adding distance between center of areas under pressure function and main deck on distance between center of gravity of vessel and main deck the heeling moment lever variation of a single rotor with respect to heel angle is shown in fig 18 heeling moment variation which is calculated by multiplying heeling forces and moment levers for each angle is presented in fig 19 in this study one degree of freedom nonlinear roll motion equation eq 1 is used the damping term of the equation is considered quadratic and nonlinear the damping coefficients are calculated at each time step with respect to roll angle and frequency by the work of ikeda et al 1978 and himeno 1981 quintic restoring moment term is preferred for the analysis the restoring moment values of the vessel are shown in fig 20 heeling moment term induced by the magnus effect is added on the right hand side of the equation as the excitation term heeling moment term of magnus effect determined by a fourth degree polynomial fitted to heeling moment variation is given in fig 19 heeling moment due to wind is neglected in order to investigate solely the effect of rotors on roll motion 1 i x x a x x Ï b Ï c Ï e Ï t m Ï w Ï i x x a x x is sum of moment of inertia and added mass of vessel in eq

responses having maximum roll angle in the limit cycle part of motion were plotted in fig 21 with respect to wave frequencies the results indicate that rotors did not affect nonlinear characteristics of roll motion in other words the existence of rotors did not cause any bifurcation however it is clear that they cause a jump in maximum roll angles time domain results of roll motion are given in fig 22 fig 23 and fig 24 for wave frequencies Ï w 0 5Ï 0 Ï w Ï 0 and Ï w 1 5Ï 0 respectively the results show that flettner rotors almost act as constant heeling force in roll motion between 25 starboard and 25 port heel angles almost constant approximately 2 3500 knm heel moment causes 5 heel angle as shown in figures below it implies that the influence of heel angle on heeling moment can be neglected zero heel angle can be used as constant within the range of 25 roll angles 6 conclusions in this study the relationship between roll motion and performance of flettner rotors has been investigated it has been observed that the driving force performance of flettner rotors decrease in roll motion the effect of roll motion on rotor performances was neglected in the study the relationship between the effect of the roll motion and the driving force is given by graphs the results reveal that this effect is much higher than expected the decrease in driving force can be explained by the decrease of the projection area of rotors with increasing heel angles furthermore the heeling forces of the cylindrical rotors have been examined it has been observed that the maximum heel angle is increased in roll motion of non rotor ship case these findings indicate that roll motion characteristics would change in the presence rotors the results further show that there is no non linear effect imposed by the rotors on roll motion in other words the presence of rotors does not cause any bifurcation in the solution the effect of the flettner rotors can only be noticed as a constant external force as a future study an analysis of the roll motion may be carried out for different spin ratios additionally by increasing the degree of freedom the influence of ship motions such as trimming on flettner rotors performance can be also examined on a more advanced realistic level it would be interesting to study performance analysis of flettner rotors on a ship with 6 degrees of freedom in irregular seas

the main study which can be seen at numerical setup and conditions part above 5 results and discussion forces acting on a flettner rotor were calculated by xflow software the driving force which contributes to propulsion of the vessel is the component of magnus effect force along x axis in other words the direction of the vessel fig 7 the heeling force which acts as the excitation for roll motion is the component of magnus effect force along y axis as shown in fig 10 figs 9 and 10 show the velocity of the rotor at seven different angles of wind direction namely 0 20 40 60 20 40 and 60 the flow velocity vector gradient fig 11 and the streamlines fig 12 are shown at each angle of flow direction as measured by xflow the velocity vector gradients fig 11 are given in a 2d plane from the middle of the rotor the streamlines fig 12 are given with 3d perspective when the vessel heels to port side it can be seen that flow velocity gradients and streamlines are similar with the ones of an

in fig 13 depend on time the average driving force for each heel angle is calculated as shown in fig 14 as negative sign represents the port side and positive sign represents the starboard side the driving forces are not symmetric in roll motion wind direction is assumed from starboard to port the results indicate that rotors have higher driving forces when heeling to starboard than heeling to port especially at heeling angle 60 to port side the driving force is negative so the rotors work as brakes 5 2 heeling forces the test case is prepared so that the heeling force and lateral component

starboard a have wider band than heeling to port the heeling force is approximately 1 2 105 n to starboard 60 but it is approximately 1 7 105 n to port 60 the average of heeling forces for each heeling angle are calculated and shown in fig 16 the figure shows that heeling forces are not symmetric in roll motion 5 3 roll motion analysis heeling moment values induced by the rotors should be determined in order to investigate the influence of flettner rotors on roll motion heeling force values were calculated for various heel angles by cfd program as indicated in section 5 2 pressure variations along the rotors were calculated by cfd program as shown in fig 17 the heeling moment levers are determined by adding distance between center of areas under pressure function and main deck on distance between center of gravity of vessel and main deck the heeling moment lever variation of a single rotor with respect to heel angle is shown in fig 18 heeling moment variation which is calculated by multiplying heeling forces and moment levers for each angle is presented in fig 19 in this study one degree of freedom nonlinear roll motion equation eq 1 is used the damping term of the equation is considered quadratic and nonlinear the damping coefficients are calculated at each time step with respect to roll angle and frequency by the work of ikeda et al 1978 and himeno 1981 quintic restoring moment term is preferred for the analysis the restoring moment values of the vessel are shown in fig 20 heeling moment term induced by the magnus effect is added on the right hand side of the equation as the excitation term heeling moment term of magnus effect determined by a fourth degree polynomial fitted to heeling moment variation is given in fig 19 heeling moment due to

code prepared with matlab compiler roll motion of the vessel was determined in time and frequency domains for different waves analyses were performed for the vessel both with and without rotors roll responses having maximum roll angle in the limit cycle part of motion were plotted in fig 21 with respect to wave frequencies the results indicate that rotors did not affect nonlinear characteristics of roll motion in other words the existence of rotors did not cause any bifurcation however it is clear that they cause a jump in maximum roll angles time domain results of roll motion are given in

be neglected zero heel angle can be used as constant within the range of 25 roll angles 6 conclusions in this study the relationship between roll motion and performance of flettner rotors has been investigated it has been observed that the driving force performance of flettner rotors decrease in roll motion the effect of roll motion on rotor performances was neglected in the study the relationship between the effect of the roll motion and the driving force is given by graphs the results reveal that this effect is much higher than expected the decrease in driving force can be explained by the decrease of the projection area of rotors with increasing heel angles furthermore the heeling forces of the cylindrical rotors have been examined it has been observed that the maximum heel angle is increased in roll motion of non rotor ship case these findings indicate that roll motion characteristics would change in the presence rotors the results further show that there is no non linear effect imposed by the rotors on roll motion in other words the presence of rotors does not cause any bifurcation in the solution the effect of the flettner rotors can only be noticed as a constant external force as a future study an analysis of the roll motion may be carried out for different spin ratios additionally by increasing the degree of freedom the influence of ship motions such as trimming on flettner rotors performance can be also examined on a more advanced realistic level it would be interesting to study performance analysis of flettner rotors on a ship with 6 degrees of freedom in irregular seas

selective roughness are drawn with respect to the flow speed damping ratios and the ptc locations angle at the end keywords viv galloping asymmetric turbulence stimulation selective surface roughness variable location of turbulence stimulation 2d urans 1 introduction flow induced vibrations fiv of elongated bodies with bluff cross sections is a powerful destructive phenomenon frequently encountered especially in the areas of ocean and wind engineering marine risers pipelines legs of offshore platforms cables and ropes for mooring and underwater towing in the ocean heat exchanger tubes tall buildings and large span bridges may be subjected to fiv the alternating vortex shedding in the bluff body wake induces large unsteady forces that in turn lead to large structural vibrations if the body is flexibly mounted such as viv vortex induced vibrations zdravkovich 1997 galloping is another form of fiv with a different driving mechanism than alternating vortices smooth cylinder being a typical bluff body has been investigated by a large number of researchers and results were reviewed by sarpkaya 2004 and williamson and govardhan 2004 early reviews of roughness effect and flow regimes were provided by niemann and hoelscher 1990 and zdravkovich 1990 previous research also studied circular cylinders with local roughness called ptc passive turbulence control by park et al 2012 2013 2017 with ptc selectively distributed surface roughness is introduced along the entire span of a circular cylinder to alter fiv or forces in search of a physical understanding of the flow in the presence of ptc several investigators have turned their attention to two dimensional geometric disturbances in the form of a span wise straight tripwire studying a circular cylinder with a single or two symmetrically situated straight wires or roughness strips is a step towards understanding the physics involved in more complicated configurations park et al 2013 early investigation on the effect of wires was performed on cylinders fitted with two longitudinal tripwires placed at 65 from the front stagnation point in the sub critical regime ekmekci and rockwell 2010 which showed that tripwires may lead to reduction in the drag force and change of the pressure distribution on the cylinder these effects were more pronounced at higher reynolds numbers further an increase in the wire diameter led to transitional characteristics of a higher reynolds number flow at lower reynolds numbers the effect of wire location angle was not considered nebres et al 1993 studied the frequency response of a circular cylinder with a single span wise wire and found that the vortex shedding frequency varies from its reference value within a certain range of wire location angles they also found that the flow topology on the wire side of the cylinder has been shown to undergo significant alterations as the wire is applied at different angular locations on the cylinder surface at subcritical reynolds numbers depending on the wire location angle four flow regimes were identified based on the transition and separation characteristics of the boundary layer the work by ekmekci and rockwell 2010 identified two locations Î¸c1 55o and Î¸c2 65o that are critical for the implementation of a single span wise wire on the basis of the near wake characteristics they showed that a surface wire d d 0 029 at Î¸c1 location leads to extension in the stream wise length of the time averaged near wake bubble while a wire at Î¸c2 yields contraction for re 10 000 ekmekci and rockwell 2010 also found that the spectral amplitude of velocity fluctuation at the von kÃ¡rmÃ¡n frequency is significantly reduced when a wire larger than the unperturbed boundary layer thickness is placed at Î¸c1 and amplifies when the same wire is at Î¸c2 that is the coherence and strength of von kÃ¡rmÃ¡n vortex shedding can be altered by applying a large scale span wise surface wire at critical locations at re 10 000 however a wire smaller than the unperturbed boundary layer thickness has no significant effect on the coherence and strength of the kÃ¡rmÃ¡n instability at critical locations ekmekci and rockwell 2011 tayfun and ekmekci 2014 controlled experimentally the flow past a circular cylinder using a single tripwire with parameters the wire angular location the wire to cylinder diameter ratio 0 029 d d 0 059 and reynolds number 5000 re 30 000 they found that the spectral amplitude and frequency of the velocity fluctuations corresponding to the von kÃ¡rmÃ¡n instability can be controlled by a single wire they also confirmed the existence of two critical angular locations and the resumption of the periodic development of kÃ¡rmÃ¡n vortex clusters dhanwani et al 2013 proposed a simplified lumped mass mathematical model to study the two degree of freedom oscillator via that model they explored the dependence of stream wise displacement on mass and damping and also explored the cause of cross flow displacement magnification due to freedom to move in stream wise direction bernitsas et al 2006a introduced the concept of the vivace converter to harness hydrokinetic energy through fiv and presented experimental data bernitsas et al 2006b showing the potential of energy generation over the entire synchronization range in viv subsequently the range was expanded to the entire fiv range of viv and galloping chang et al 2011 sun et al 2016 huynh et al 2015 widened the resonance range of the viv energy converter with nonlinear springs ma et al 2016 and sun et al 2018 increased the harnessed power through galloping using nonlinear springs for various values of spring stiffness and damping although the flow around an asymmetric body has attracted much attention most of the studies focused on the general performance of the asymmetric body especially for a stationary cylinder the asymmetric flow field and the effect on the motion of the cylinder have received little attention galloping is another form of flow induced vibration fiv that non circular cylinders undergo due to asymmetry or upstream turbulence blevins 1990 flow asymmetry caused either by incoming flow or geometric modification of the cylinder may induce galloping which is an instability phenomenon not driven by vortex shedding but motion of the shear layers on either side of the cylinder fivs are suppressed in engineering applications because of their destructive nature on the other hand by enhancing and controlling fiv the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab at the university of michigan developed the vivace converter bernitsas and raghavan 2009 2011 2014 bernitsas 2016 to convert marine hydrokinetic mhk energy to electricity passive turbulence control ptc in the form of sand strips is used both in experiments and simulations chang et al 2011 attached local surface roughness which they called passive turbulence control covering a small and variable part of the cylinder surface between 10 and 60 measured from the forward stagnation point along the entire span of the cylinder soft galloping response was observed in a circular cylinder with ptc since galloping is caused by flow geometric asymmetry park et al 2012 2013 2017 extended selective circumferential application of surface roughness to the cylinder surface and found that the cylinder response is closely connected to the ptc sandpaper location depending on the location various forms of fiv such as weak suppression strong suppression hard galloping and soft galloping were observed in the ptc to fiv map the map in the flow regime trsl3 is a guide for placement of sand strips on the surface of the cylinder to alter fiv in this paper a rigid circular cylinder on springs with one sided ptc and one degree of freedom in the direction transverse to a steady flow is studied to investigate the effect of asymmetric turbulence stimulation ptc on the oscillatory response of the cylinder flow field details are presented to explain the cylinder motion and the influence of flow velocity damping ratio and ptc location angle the physical model and grid generation are presented in section 2 in section 3 the numerical approach and running parameters are described validation of the computational method is presented in section 4 the simulation results of amplitude and flow field details are shown in section 5 conclusions are drawn at the end all the experiments are conducted in the low turbulence free surface water ltfsw channel of the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab of the university of michigan computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed in the mrelab and compared to experimental data 2 computational model 2 1 geometry and boundary conditions the computational domain is set as a rectangular area of 33d diameters in line with the flow by 9d transversely to the flow for the single one sided ptc cylinder as shown in fig 1 the entire domain includes five boundaries inflow outflow top bottom and the ptc cylinder the initial position which is the equilibrium position of the cylinder is located at the center of the domain in the y direction the distance between the inlet boundary and the center of the cylinder is set equal to 8d the downstream length of the domain is set equal to 25d this domain set up achieves two goals a it ensures that the conditions at the flow outlet are close to the assumed fully developed flow conditions u x 0 p x c b it simulates adequately the channel conditions with the exception of the free surface which is maintained at least four diameters away from the cylinder a uniform and constant velocity profile is applied at the inlet boundary the zero velocity gradient condition which is the fully developed condition is set for the outflow boundary the bottom condition is defined as a wall boundary to match the experimental condition the effect of the free surface present in the experiments was not considered in the numerical study thus the top boundary is simplified by modeling it as a wall which is the conclusion of previous studies ding et al 2015 2016 the detailed experimental setup can be found in the paper by sun et al 2016 the ptc cylinder is treated as a moving wall and its velocity and displacement are dictated by the oscillator equation which is described in section 2 3 ptc in the form of sandpaper strips was introduced in the mrelab to increase the efficiency and power density of vivace a pair of straight roughness strips were pasted on the surface of the cylinder symmetrically with respect to the forward stagnation point covering circumferential surface area equivalent to 16 on a d 3 5 0 0889 cm cylinder the location angle Î± ptc 20 is measured in degrees from the forward stagnation point in the corresponding ideal flow based on previous research by park et al 2012 2013 2017 sand strips with roughness designation p60 are used as ptc in this study for one sided ptc a 16 degree p60 strip is applied as shown in fig 1 b table 1 shows the details of the roughness strip used in this studt 2 2 mesh configuration a two dimensional structured computational grid was generated in each case with the multi block grid generation technique to develop a non uniform grid which guarantees satisfactory calculation precision with moderate computational time corresponding to the multi block technique the interface technique which is shown in fig 1 as two dashed lines and in fig 2 as two red lines is used in the overlapping of two neighboring zones the subdomain in the vicinity of the cylinder is a 2d 2d square block where the grid density for the near wall region is enhanced to solve for high resolution in flow properties the cylinder and the 2d 2d square block fig 2 move synchronously to make sure the grid near the cylinder remains the same in the whole moving process for comparatively more accurate results especially for the integration of the pressure on the cylinder surface a at the interface we make sure the grid density on the two sides of the interface is the same we use multi block grid technique to refine the interface zone compared to ding et al 2016 with 60252 cells the grid in the present work with a total of 126327 cells is fine enough to generate convergent results b for the boundary layer on the wall of the ptc cylinder comparisons are made using a stationary cylinder to investigate the influence of the boundary layer as shown in table 2 due to the nature of the flow in the boundary layer the boundary layer grid adaption technique was used to make sure that y of the near wall grid was less than 16 in the present study y is not constant during the calculations for each case finally we adopted the two layer resolution in table 2 where there is a two layer mesh on the step with corresponding maximum y equal to 16 a close up of the grid of near cylinder region is shown in fig 3 the simulated reynolds number range for which experiments were conducted in the mrelab is 30 000 re 110 000 falls in the high lift trsl3 flow regime zdravkovich 1997 at high speeds galloping was observed and the maximum amplitude reached was nearly 2 5d in the cfd simulations large mesh deformations occur with the cylinder undergoing galloping in order to minimize the mesh deformation a dynamic mesh technique of topological change the layering method is used in the present study the cylinder and the 2d 2d square block move up and down along their side edges and their moving velocity is determined by the user defined function udf programming ansys 2015 the cell height adjacent to the moving block is properly set to ensure that the grid density remains almost the same with the initially generated grid as the block is moved 2 3 mathematical model the time dependent viscous flow solutions are obtained by numerical approximation of the incompressible 2d urans equations in conjunction with the one equation spalart and allmaras 1994 turbulence model the model is as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 Ï p x i x j 2 v s i j u j u i where v is the molecular kinematic viscosity and s i j is the mean strain rate tensor 3 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i where u i is the mean flow velocity vector the quantity Ï i j u i u j is known as the reynolds stress tensor which is symmetric in the spalart allmaras model a common method employs the boussinesq approximation to relate the reynolds stresses to the mean velocity gradient as 4 Ï i j 2 Ï t s i j where Ï t is the kinetic eddy

following transport equation 5 Ï t u j Ï x j c b 1 s Ï c w 1 f w Ï d 2 1 Ï x j Ï Ï Ï x j c b 2 Ï x i Ï x i additional definitions of functions and constants can be found in kinaci 2016 spalart and allmaras 1994 the classical linear time invariant mass damper spring oscillator model is used to describe the cylinder dynamics in fiv the one degree of freedom equation of motion can be expressed as 6 m y x y k y f where m is the total oscillating mass of the cylinder and attachments including one third of the spring mass and f is the total vertical lift force which is calculated by d f p d y this is the forced oscillation equation the left hand side models the cylinder vibration while the right hand side is the force applied on the cylinder by the fluid solving for the acceleration term y equation 6 becomes 7 y f c y k y m when the acceleration of the cylinder is known its velocity and displacement can be calculated by 8 y t 1 y t u t 1 Î´ t 9 u t 1 u t a t 1 Î´ t the displacement of the cylinder in viv can therefore be written as 10 y t 1 y t u t Î´ t a t 1 Î´ t 2 where a t 1 in equation 9 is calculated using equation 7 thus in numerical form 11 a t 1 f t 1 c u t k y t m returning to equation 9 and rewriting the numerical displacement equation will read 12 y t 1 y t u t Î´ t f t 1 c u t k y t m Î´ t 2 equation 12 gives the displacement of the cylinder at each time step the force applied by the fluid will commence the oscillatory movement of the cylinder the cylinder is assumed to be at the origin y 0 and stable at t 0 the initial conditions in mathematical terms are 13 y 0 u 0 0 just after the flow starts the displacement of the cylinder will therefore be 14 y 1 y 0 u 0 Î´ t f 1 c u 0 k y 0 m Î´ t 2 f 1 m Î´ t 2 fiv is a fluid structure interaction fsi problem at each time step the cylinder is assumed to be stationary and the force acting on the cylinder is integrated to get the transverse lift force which is then used to find the new displacement of the cylinder at the next time step as the cylinder moves it also modifies the flow field thus the flow also is affected by the cylinder s movement this is the second part of the fsi so the cylinder is excited by the fluid and in return it moves and affects the flow the force f is calculated by integrating the pressure at every time step the pressure field is calculated followed by surface integration to produce the force on the cylinder then the acceleration velocity and displacement are calculated next the velocity and displacement are imposed on the cylinder and the cylinder moves a distance according to the velocity and time step after the movement the flow field is changed and the pressure is recalculated to begin the next time step so the change of the force depends on the change of the flow field and in equation 12 the value of f is changed in every time step the data transfer process between fluid and solid is not modelled in equation 12 2 4 physical model in the mrelab of the university of michigan a virtual damper spring vck system has been introduced to replace the physical dampers and springs of the oscillators the vck system provides the damper and spring forces based on displacement and velocity feedback and thus simulates two of the three elements of the mechanical oscillator the third being the mass details on the vck system can be found in sun et al 2015 the most important features of vck are a the hydrodynamic force is not included in the control loop b the system damping is identified using a detailed system identification process and removed for the system to add a predetermined function and value a linear damping function is implemented in experiments emulating a linear viscous damping system the cylinder is constrained to oscillate in the y direction which is perpendicular to its axis and to the flow velocity in the x direction a virtual spring of stiffness k 600 n m is selected in the experimental system the total damping c is defined as 15 c c s t r u c t u r e c h a r n e s s where c s t r u c t u r e is the existing system damping due to energy losses in the transmission system in this research c s t r u c t u r e is maintained to correspond to Î¶ s t r u c t u r e 0 02 Î¶ h a r n e s s is the damping added through vck that converts the mechanical energy in the oscillating cylinder to electrical energy simulating a power take off pto system the relation between c and Î¶ can be expressed using the following equation 16 Î¶ c 2 m o s c k the parameters of the experimental apparatus are listed in table 3 3 validation of the numerical solution 3 1 validation of cfd results by comparison to experiments fig 4 presents a comparison of amplitude ratio a d between the current numerical study and experimental data the former is based on the average positive and negative values after simulations have reached steady state the experimental a d is calculated by averaging the absolute values of the 30 highest positive and 30 highest negative peaks in 60 s of running time past the transient the one sided ptc cylinder is not a symmetric body the amplitude response is not symmetrical around the equilibrium position in general the positive amplitude is higher than the negative amplitude the asymmetrical displacement time histories are shown in figs 8 and 10 three kinds of amplitude are calculated in each case the positive amplitude upward amplitude on smooth side of the cylinder shown in fig 2 named a positive the negative amplitude downward amplitude on the ptc side of the cylinder shown in fig 2 named a negative and the average amplitude named a average which is determined by the following equation 17 a a v e r a g e a p o s i t i v e a n e g a t i v e in fig 4 a and b the asymmetric cylinder response can be observed clearly as the damping increases the asymmetry in oscillations is observed at flow velocity higher than 0 8 m s fig 4 b the simulated negative amplitude shows good agreement with the experimental results the numerical calculation of the positive amplitude does not capture the transition from viv to galloping well starting around 0 8 m s in transition the calculated amplitude is higher than the experimental especially for the low damping ratio at the initial viv branch simulation results are much closer to experimental measurements in fig 4 a simulation and experiment nearly coincide completely in fig 4 b simulations show that viv initiates at 0 3 m s while experimentally the cylinder viv initiates at u 0 4 m s this is attributed to the difference between the theoretical linear viscous damping in equation 6 and the real one as specified by the vck fig 4 c shows the comparison of the average amplitude between experimental and simulation results it is observed that the simulation results at the initial and upper viv branches and the galloping branch all show good agreement with the experimental results the results differ in the transition region from the upper viv branch to galloping as the lower branch and desynchronization regions are cut short due to the relative position of the end of viv and beginning of galloping bernitsas 2016 from the experimental results in fig 4 c we also observe that in the transition region the standard deviation is comparatively higher which means that the amplitude in the transition region is not steady and harder to capture numerically the reason for the simulation not capturing well the transition range around 25 difference is attributed to the 2d urans turbulence model which is based on an isotropic hypothesis and cannot predict well the behavior of random small vortices similar conclusion and discussion can be also found in wu et al 2014 kinaci et al 2016 and ding et al 2016 the positive amplitude is underestimated by about 10 by simulation compared with experimental data in the high flow velocities this is partially due to the free surface being approximated as a wall which introduces a blockage effect to the cylinder motion generally it is reasonable to believe that the simulation work in the present paper is accurate enough to predict the performance of flow induced motion for one sided ptc 3 2 discussion on validation and differences the following discussion is important in interpreting simulation results and comparing them to experimental data this includes comparing results between smooth one sided and two sided cylinders in sections 4 and 5 discussions on viv galloping and transition from viv to galloping are separated as the destabilizing hydrodynamic mechanism is totally different i experiments vs cfd in viv as stated in wu et al 2014 and explained by bernitsas 2016 2d urans codes fail to predict accurately the separation point in cylinders for re 10 000 they predict that the separation point occurs at 90 and remains stationary in subcritical flows experiments show that the separation point for flows past circular cylinders oscillates by as much as 5 reaching up to the maximum of 81 right before vortex shedding this is a vital piece of experimental information against which all cfd codes should be validated if the location of the separation point is not predicted correctly by a cfd code the vortex structures and lift coefficient will not be predicted correctly either when ptc is introduced the flow separation point is set at the same point both experimentally and numerically resulting in very good agreement between cfd and experiments wu et al 2014 ding et al 2015 2016 in the case of one sided ptc the separation on the side of the ptc is calculated accurately while on the smooth side it is not thus on the ptc side of the cylinder flow separation is calculated correctly vortex strength and vortex roll up calculations are improved but to a point as discussed in point 2 below as a result the upward force calculation is improved when the vortex sheds on the lower side of the cylinder one sided ptc the resulting lift force is more accurate inducing an upward lift force that reverses the cylinder direction properly this does not occur at the upper end of the cylinder resulting in a reduced lift the net effect is some loss in overall flow circulation around the cylinder and per the kutta joukowski theorem reduction in lift the cylinder then a reaches positive amplitudes that are 5 higher than negative amplitudes b this observation holds both experimentally and numerically as shown in fig 4 c both positive and negative computed amplitudes are a little lower than experimental measurements ii comparison of smooth one sided two sided cylinders in viv the roughness in the turbulence stimulation sand paper in the trsl3 flow regime reduces the strength of the formed and shed vortices in trsl3 the shear layer is fully saturated and the surface roughness does not add more turbulence on the contrary surface roughness slows down the flow and skin friction on a smooth surface generating vorticity in the boundary layer is replaced by form drag on the individual roughness particles which are perpendicular to the cylinder surface this experimental conclusion was derived from experiments on a flat plate parallel to the flow in the 1950 s and 1960 s with increasing reynolds number the skin friction coefficient of a flat plate with surface roughness stops decreasing and reaches a plateau as the boundary layer thickness decreases with higher flow speeds higher re the roughness elements start sticking out of the boundary layer in that case the drag from the rough plate is not dominated by the plate skin friction but by the drag of the roughness elements those have cross section of a bluff body perpendicular to the flow for cylinders the drag consists of about 95 form drag and only 5 skin friction since each individual roughness element is small the roughness re not the body re is about 1000 2000 where the drag coefficient in subcritical flows is constant and equal to about 1 05 for roughness re up to 300 000 that results in a constant drag coefficient for the plate determined by the form drag of the roughness elements this fact explains the following two observations in fig 5 a in viv the smooth cylinder has higher response than the one sided cylinder b in viv the one sided cylinder has higher response than the two sided cylinder iii experiments vs cfd in galloping the counterpart observations to i are a the cylinder reaches positive amplitudes that are significantly higher than negative amplitudes b this observation holds both experimentally and numerically as shown in fig 4 c positive computed amplitudes are a little lower than experimental measurements negative computed amplitudes are very close to experimental measurements iv comparison of smooth one sided two sided cylinders in galloping the amplitude response between the three cylinders is reversed in comparison to viv that is the two sided cylinder exhibits higher a d than the one sided cylinder of course the smooth cylinder does not exhibit galloping the explanation for iii and iv follows the driving hydrodynamic mechanism in galloping is an instability induced by geometric asymmetry and resulting in negative lift in viv at the end of the travel as the cylinder reverses direction a vortex sheds and pushes the cylinder away in galloping the instability pulls the cylinder in the direction of the motion until the direction is reversed by the springs that is the force to direction relation is similar regardless of the fact that forcing is applied at a different part of the cycle and the excitation mechanism is completely different at the positive end smooth of the travel in viv a vortex will shed and will contribute to the reversal in galloping the reversal is due only to the spring force the geometric asymmetry of the cylinder has a higher angle of attack blevins 1990 when the cylinder moves up resulting in higher negative damping and higher lift accordingly the positive amplitude of the cylinder in galloping is higher than the negative amplitude fig 4 v experiments vs cfd in transition for this particular set of experiments cfd and experiments agree on the average fig 4 c but not on whether the positive or the negative amplitude is higher in transition both mechanisms coexist at the beginning the instability mechanism form galloping and the periodic excitation from the viv lock in are in phase as the amplitude increases the viv lock in is desynchronized and some vortices act against the galloping excitation while others support the galloping excitation this combination of excitation mechanisms is not captured exactly by cfd resulting in an understandable small discrepancy past transition in fully developed galloping timing of vortex shedding is such that alternating vortices do not synchronize with the galloping motion bernitsas 2016 vi comparison of smooth one sided two sided cylinders in transition if viv and galloping are brought back to back so that the onset of galloping occurs right after the viv upper branch the lower branch and desynchronization of viv do not appear fig 4 and fig 5a when damping is increased the onset of galloping is delayed to higher velocity values and a gap between viv and galloping occurs fig 5 b thus in cases like fig 4 and fig 5 a a transition region exists where vortex shedding remains in synchronization with the galloping oscillation and assists galloping in summary a the presence of the one sided ptc on the lower side of the cylinder only defines the separation point and the geometric asymmetry accurately both experimentally and numerically resulting in good agreement on the negative side of displacement the inaccurate definition of the separation point at the upper side of the cylinder defines poorly the galloping inducing asymmetry which is now due not to pure geometry but to shear layer definition initiating at an incorrect separation point b the more roughness the less the amplitude in viv and the more the amplitude in galloping for ptc thickness on the order of the boundary layer thickness in the flow regime tested this is concluded when a smooth cylinder a one sided ptc and a two sided ptc cylinder are compared 4 results and discussion following the discussion in section 3 2 above it is easier to explain and rationalize the observations below 4 1 experimental amplitude response asymmetric vs symmetric ptc cylinders fig 5 compares experimental measurements of the average dimensionless amplitude a d of one sided asymmetric ptc cylinder with the corresponding two sided ptc cylinder in fiv the following observations can be made a for the low damping ratio in fig 5 a the amplitude velocity curves of the two configurations have similar trends and do not exhibit a gap between viv and galloping b one sided ptc results in earlier initiation of viv and higher amplitude due to lower overall roughness compared to the two sided ptc this is consistent with the observations on total roughness and ptc thickness by chang et al 2011 bernitsas 2016 c for the same reason in the upper branch the one sided ptc cylinder has higher amplitude than the two sided ptc cylinder d in the galloping range the one sided ptc cylinder shows a lower amplitude and delayed onset of galloping the less pronounced geometric deviation of one sided ptc from the smooth cylinder than the two sided ptc cylinder explains this observation as discussed in section 3 2 e as expected increase in damping has the following effects on fiv bernitsas 2016 ma et al 2017 i it shrinks the viv response curve by a small delay in initiation a reduction in amplitude and an earlier desynchronization ii it delays onset of galloping to higher velocities iii it reduces galloping response just like viv amplitude iv it results in a gap between viv and galloping f in galloping on the contrary the increased deviation of the two sided ptc cylinder from the smooth cylinder compared to the one sided ptc results in higher amplitude detailed experimental data about two sided ptc cylinders can be found in sun et al 2016 bernitsas 2016 4 2 numerical investigation of flow velocity effect fig 6 shows the vortex formation at different velocities for Î¶ 0 02 the near wake vortex pattern has been classified by williamson and govardhan 2004 govardhan and williamson 2000 for the trsl2 flow regime some important observations are listed below a for re 44 185 u 0 5 m s u 5 14 initial viv branch the classical von kÃ¡rmÃ¡n street can be observed with the 2s mode of vortex shedding as shown in fig 6 a and b in fig 6 c and d two dominant vortices are observed shedding from the cylinder in one cycle b starting from re 53 022 u 0 6 m s beginning of upper branch in fig 6 c a significant difference in vortex patterns is observed compared to the 2s mode in fig 6 a for re 35 348 u 0 4 m s an additional vortex is captured near each shedding vortex that is two pairs of vortices shed per cycle in each pair one vortex is much weaker than the other and disperses sooner as the fluid flows downstream this vortex pattern is quasi 2p which is observed during transition from 2s to 2p c staring from re 70 696 u 0 8 m s upper viv branch in fig 6 e and f the 2p vortex pattern is observed one pair of vortices is shed on each side of the cylinder four vortices are shed from the cylinder in one oscillation cycle d for higher re it is hard to observe vortex structures experimentally using a high speed camera and extensive post processing vortex structures can be studied sun et al 2016 at the high end of the channel motor capacity however air may be trapped in the channel hindering clear laser imaging thus there are no consistent conclusions about the vortex structure in high flow velocity above 1 10 m s nevertheless the following observations can be made the upper part of the cylinder is smooth and thus the separation point oscillates by 5 in the present simulations we observe that for re 80 000 an elongated cluster of vortices emerges this exhibits similarities to the symmetric ptc cylinder simulations by ding et al 2015 2016 albeit a small separation between the vortices in the immediate wake the high velocity and the constraints of the channel wall have a stretching effect on the vortex specifically due to the high speed irrotational flow does not flow upstream between the positive and negative vortices in the immediate cylinder wake thus delaying separation gerard s vortex shedding mechanism requires coalescence of all three elements positive negative and zero vorticity at the same point for shedding to occur thus the vortices in the immediate wake of the cylinder at high speed become elongated and do not separate until irrotational flow coalesces with positive and negative vorticity at a point between the positive and negative vortices 4 3 computational temporal evolution of vortex shedding of the asymmetric ptc cylinder two typical cases at u 0 7 m s re 62 600 and u 1 1 m s re 89 147 are selected to elaborate on the flow field using time histories referring to fig 5 the two cases selected and studied are in the upper branch u 0 7 m s and galloping branch u 1 1 m s the parameters were selected in such a way that hydrokinetic energy can be harnessed over all values of flow velocity u the displacement time curve y t is periodic with the predominant mode being sinusoidal as shown in figs 8 and 10 in order to study the evolution process of the vortex formation in one period four positions a b c d in fig 7 in a cycle are selected to study the flow field details as in figs 9 and 11 fig 8 shows the time history of the nondimensional displacement y t d and lift coefficient c l t at u 0 7 m s re 61 859 this is in the viv range and the asymmetry in c l t is more obvious than the asymmetry in the displacement history the upward lift force is higher than the downward lift force correspondingly the positive amplitude is higher than the negative amplitude although the asymmetry in the amplitude is not very obvious at this velocity fig 9 a and b present the evolution of vortex when Î¶ 0 02 and 0 14 respectively in the low damping ratio which allows higher amplitude the quasi 2p vortex mode is manifested as the damping ratio increases to Î¶ 0 14 the amplitude of oscillation reduces and the cylinder wake changes to the 2s vortex structure fig 10 shows the time history of the nondimensional displacement y t d and lift coefficient c l t when u 1 1 m s re 89 147 this is in the galloping range compared to viv galloping shows stronger asymmetry both in nondimensional displacement y t d and in the lift coefficient the c l t time histories are very useful in understanding the galloping response as shown in fig 10 galloping is an instability phenomenon pulling the cylinder in the direction of the motion as the corresponding damping coefficient is negative in galloping that instability drives the cylinder motion as explained in section 3 2 the lift is stronger when the cylinder moves up due to the higher angle of attack blevins 1990 vortex shedding of course is present since a bluff body is exposed to a uniform flow nevertheless the vortex shedding mechanism does not drive the cylinder as in the case of viv because vortex shedding is no longer in synchronization with the motion past the end of viv as vortices shed they push the cylinder away that force may or may not be in the direction of the galloping motion and it may assist or oppose the motion respectively the higher frequency observed in fig 10 a and b is due to vortex shedding as the velocity is high and past the end of the viv range vortices shed in patterns that do not follow the wake frequency any more bernitsas 2016 thus some vortices oppose the galloping motion and some assist it the corresponding vortex modes for u 1 1 m s are shown in fig 11 the higher amplitude at Î¶ 0 02 makes the wake wider for high damping the wake becomes narrower as the damping increases the amplitude decreases narrowing the wake the high incoming flow velocity and the narrower wake contribute to the elongated cluster of vortices 4 4 numerical investigation of the effect of roughness location for the 20â° ptc location angle because the angle is small the boundary layer separates at the step point and re attaches to the cylinder surface just as shown in fig 14 which makes the width of the wake of the ptc cylinder similar with that of the smooth cylinder when the ptc location angle becomes larger while remaining below the typical separation point of 81â° in subcritical flows as mentioned in section 3 2 the flow will separate at the step point but will not re attach to the cylinder surface hence the separation point for the ptc side and the smooth side will be different which affects the motion of the cylinder fig 12 shows the ptc to fiv map developed by park et al 2012 fig 12 shows that the 20â° ptc angle is located in the soft galloping zone soft galloping is self initiated as opposed to the hard galloping phenomenon where a threshold amplitude is required to initiate it to compare the influence of different ptc location angles three ptc location angles are considered for meaningful comparison all the location angles are selected in the same soft galloping zone 20â° 30â° 40â° the same ptc coverage of 16â° is adopted as in the map equivalent to 0 2 0 00508 m on a d 3 5 cylinder 0 0889m although the map is for two sided ptc it can still serve as a guide for the selection of the range of the ptc location fig 13 shows the amplitude comparison for a positive a negative and a average for the three selected location angles in the two typical cases of flow velocity u 0 7 m s viv and u 1 1 m s galloping the positive amplitude increases almost linearly with the increase of the ptc location angle on the contrary the negative amplitude almost remains independent of the ptc location angle based on equation 14 the average amplitude increases linearly as well the difference between the a positive and a negative becomes more obvious with the increase of the ptc location angle for both damping ratios 4 5 asymmetry in amplitude response due to the geometric asymmetry created by the one sided ptc the flow around the cylinder in fiv is not symmetric inducing unequal a positive and a negative as in fig 4 as discussed in section 3 in all fiv cases whether in viv or galloping a positive is numerically greater than a negative experimentally though there is an interval near the end of viv and before the onset of galloping where a positive is less than a negative fig 4 in this section by studying the flow field details additional insight is provided into understanding the relation between geometric asymmetry flow asymmetry due to the geometry and the induced amplitude response asymmetry from figs 4 5 and 13 we observe that the higher the incoming flow velocity the bigger is the difference between a positive and a negative thus the case of u 1 1 m s is selected to elaborate on the details of the flow field theoretically if the cylinder is symmetrical the highest displacement position fig 7 point d and the lowest position fig 7 point b should have symmetrical flow field properties averaged over an extended time period time local discrepancies may exist because of vortex shedding variation consequently these two positions will be used to study the effects of geometric asymmetry of the one sided ptc cylinder on the flow and the cylinder response for passive control techniques that influence only one of the separating shear layers from the cylinder as is the present study the issue becomes the extent to which the modified shear layer affects the entire near wake which of course is formed between the two separating shear layers 4 5 1 streamlines at 1 1 m s for Î¶ 0 02 2d urans generally provides a good understanding of the flow in terms of quantitative data like the lift force and the amplitude as long as the corresponding experimental data are obtained from well designed two dimensional experiments a better understanding about the wake boundary layer shear layer interaction can be achieved by simulating viv with les and dns sarpkaya 2004 though the latter is computationally prohibitive in the trsl3 flow regime in this study given the agreement and explainable differences between experiments and computations discussed in section 3 2 we can still find the influence of the step location angle with the same 2d urans simulation method from fig 13 the 40â° ptc configuration exhibits the strongest asymmetry in amplitude response among the three angles tested this can be clearly seen in figs 14 and 15 the reattachment that occurs after the ptc for a placement angle of 20â° makes the influence of the step smaller and the wake narrower wider wake relates to higher amplitude the highest position fig 14 has wider wake with the increase of the step location angle but the lowest position has almost the same wake width for all angle values further the wake is narrower than that of the highest position so the a positive has an obvious increase with the location angle increase but the a negative remains almost the same fig 13 at the highest position the wider wake relates to the highest amplitude at the lowest position the constant wake width relates to constant amplitude with respect to the ptc angle of course as explained in section 3 2 the underlying factor is the angle of attack which increases with increasing angle of ptc the interpretation of the observations on fig 15 follows the flow velocity is high enough for the flow to be in the high lift trsl3 flow regime the upper side of the cylinder with no ptc exhibits a separation point around 90â° in the cfd calculations in spite of the fact that this is not quite correct as explained in section 3 2 the flow characteristics are closer to those of subctirical flow and thus wider wake the lower side of the cylinder with the ptc exhibits post critical flow characteristics due to the turbulence stimulation by the ptc specifically there is enough momentum at this higher velocity to narrow the wake behind the cylinder that reduces both the drag and the lift on the cylinder 4 5 2 streamlines at 1 1 m s for Î¶ 0 14 figs 16 and 17 show the wake structure for the three ptc angle locations for Î¶ 0 14 at the lowest position fig 17 the separation point on the lower side of the cylinder almost remains constant with respect to the ptc angle the width of the wake still stays the same for the three configurations as in the case of Î¶ 0 02 at the highest position fig 16 the separation point of the upper side of the cylinder is at the same location for all three angles but on the lower cylinder side the separation point depends on the ptc location angle and the reattachment is not obvious with the increase of the location angle fig 16 the observation of wider wake at higher location angle is still valid 4 5 3 pressure coefficient distribution at 1 1 m s the surface pressure coefficients c p at the highest and lowest position of the cylinder for high flow velocity u 1 1 m s galloping region for the cylinders with one side ptc and placement angles 20 30 and 40 are given in figs 18 and 19 the difference in amplitudes can be confirmed by the pressure differences between the upper and lower parts of the cylinder as well at the highest position the pressure difference is higher than that of the lowest position which is in agreement with the higher positive amplitude than the negative amplitude with the increase of the ptc location angle the pressure difference for the highest position increases too while the pressure difference for the lowest position remains almost the same which can explain the asymmetry distribution of the amplitude and shows good correspondence with the different wake width shown in figs 14 17 it can be noticed directly that there is a higher pressure gradient at the rear part of the cylinder where vortex shedding occurs higher pressure gradients are associated with stronger vortex shedding and closer to the cylinder resulting in higher amplitude the discontinuity in the pressure coefficient graph is where the roughness strip is placed 5 conclusions the flow induced vibrations of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder with one sided turbulence stimulation named ptc was investigated both numerically and experimentally at reynolds number in the range 30 000 re 110 000 stiffness mass and damping parameters were selected so that the cylinder responds in the entire range of viv transition from viv to galloping and galloping three different ptc locations were studied experimentally and numerically positive negative and average amplitude were measured detailed flow field images were presented for two different damping ratios and three ptc locations to understand better the effect of one sided ptc and explain the results measured experimentally and calculated using 2d urans the work in the paper can be considered as a generic step towards understanding the underlying physics in one sided turbulence stimulation and other more complex configurations that may be difficult to test experimentally or numerically the following observations conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in this study the underlying concepts that explain those were presented in section 3 2 1 in viv the smooth cylinder has the highest average amplitude followed by the one sided asymmetric ptc cylinder while the two sided ptc cylinder exhibits the smallest amplitude 2 in galloping the order is reversed the more total roughness induces higher average response 3 in viv the amplitude of a one sided ptc cylinder is not symmetric around the equilibrium position the positive amplitude smooth side is larger than the negative amplitude ptc side 4 the same is true in galloping the positive amplitude is larger than the negative amplitude 5 in the transition region between viv and galloping the one sided ptc exhibits a flatter vibration curve in transition the one sided ptc maintains its oscillation even at higher damping while the two sided ptc ceases to oscillate 6 the asymmetry in the amplitude response becomes stronger with increasing flow velocity increasing actual ptc location angle as long as the ptc remains inside the galloping zone and decreasing damping ratio 7 since 2d urans codes fail to predict accurately the separation point in cylinders for re 10 000 in viv in the case of one sided ptc the separation on the side of the ptc is calculated accurately while on the smooth side it is not as a result flow separation vortex strength and vortex roll up are calculated correctly resulting in accurate prediction of the upward force when the vortex sheds on the lower side of the cylinder which has the one sided ptc thus the difference between the computed and the experimentally measured negative ptc side amplitude is smaller than the corresponding difference for the positive amplitude smooth side 8 in galloping which is driven by geometric asymmetry the driving force is also computed more accurately on the ptc side of the cylinder thus the difference between the computed and the experimentally measured negative ptc side amplitude is also smaller than the corresponding difference for the positive amplitude smooth side 9 for different angle of ptc locations the upper side of the cylinder with no ptc exhibits incorrectly a separation point around 90â° in the cfd calculations the flow characteristics are closer to those of subcritical flow and thus wider wake the lower side of the cylinder with the ptc exhibits post critical flow characteristics due to the turbulence stimulation by the ptc specifically there is enough momentum at this higher velocity to narrow the wake behind the cylinder that reduces both the drag and the lift on the cylinder 10 as the ptc location angle increases the width of the wake at the highest oscillation position increases but remains almost the same at the lowest position acknowledgements supported by a cooperative agreement no de ee0006780 between vortex hydro energy and the u s department of energy the

selective roughness are drawn with respect to the flow speed damping ratios and the ptc locations angle at the end keywords viv galloping asymmetric turbulence stimulation selective surface roughness variable location of turbulence stimulation 2d urans 1 introduction flow induced vibrations fiv of elongated bodies with bluff cross sections is a powerful destructive phenomenon frequently encountered especially in the areas of ocean and wind engineering marine risers pipelines legs of offshore platforms cables and ropes for mooring and underwater towing in the ocean heat exchanger tubes tall buildings and large span bridges may be subjected to fiv the alternating vortex shedding in the bluff body wake induces large unsteady forces that in turn lead to large structural vibrations if the body is flexibly mounted such as viv vortex induced vibrations zdravkovich 1997 galloping is another form of fiv with a different driving mechanism than alternating vortices smooth cylinder being a typical bluff body has been investigated by a large number of researchers and results were reviewed by sarpkaya 2004 and williamson and govardhan 2004 early reviews of roughness effect and flow regimes were provided by niemann and hoelscher 1990 and zdravkovich 1990 previous research also studied circular cylinders with local roughness called ptc passive turbulence control by park et al 2012 2013 2017 with ptc selectively distributed surface roughness is introduced along the entire span of a circular cylinder to alter fiv or forces in search of a physical understanding of the flow in the presence of ptc several investigators have turned their attention to two dimensional geometric disturbances in the form of a span wise straight tripwire studying a circular cylinder with a single or two symmetrically situated straight wires or roughness strips is a step towards understanding the physics involved in more complicated configurations park et al 2013 early investigation on the effect of wires was performed on cylinders fitted with two longitudinal tripwires placed at 65 from the front stagnation point in the sub critical regime ekmekci and rockwell 2010 which showed that tripwires may lead to reduction in the drag force and change of the pressure distribution on the cylinder these effects were more pronounced at higher reynolds numbers further an increase in the wire diameter led to transitional characteristics of a higher reynolds number flow at lower reynolds numbers the effect of wire location angle was not considered nebres et al 1993 studied the frequency response of a circular cylinder with a single span wise wire and found that the vortex shedding frequency varies from its reference value within a certain range of wire location angles they also found that the flow topology on the wire side of the cylinder has been shown to undergo significant alterations as the wire is applied at different angular locations on the cylinder surface at subcritical reynolds numbers depending on the wire location angle four flow regimes were identified based on the transition and separation characteristics of the boundary layer the work by ekmekci and rockwell 2010 identified two locations Î¸c1 55o and Î¸c2 65o that are critical for the implementation of a single span wise wire on the basis of the near wake characteristics they showed that a surface wire d d 0 029 at Î¸c1 location leads to extension in the stream wise length of the time averaged near wake bubble while a wire at Î¸c2 yields contraction for re 10 000 ekmekci and rockwell 2010 also found that the spectral amplitude of velocity fluctuation at the von kÃ¡rmÃ¡n frequency is significantly reduced when a wire larger than the unperturbed boundary layer thickness is placed at Î¸c1 and amplifies when the same wire is at Î¸c2 that is the coherence and strength of von kÃ¡rmÃ¡n vortex shedding can be altered by applying a large scale span wise surface wire at critical locations at re 10 000 however a wire smaller than the unperturbed boundary layer thickness has no significant effect on the coherence and strength of the kÃ¡rmÃ¡n instability at critical locations ekmekci and rockwell 2011 tayfun and ekmekci 2014 controlled experimentally the flow past a circular cylinder using a single tripwire with parameters the wire angular location the wire to cylinder diameter ratio 0 029 d d 0 059 and reynolds number 5000 re 30 000 they found that the spectral amplitude and frequency of the velocity fluctuations corresponding to the von kÃ¡rmÃ¡n instability can be controlled by a single wire they also confirmed the existence of two critical angular locations and the resumption of the periodic development of kÃ¡rmÃ¡n vortex clusters dhanwani et al 2013 proposed a simplified lumped mass mathematical model to study the two degree of freedom oscillator via that model they explored the dependence of stream wise displacement on mass and damping and also explored the cause of cross flow displacement magnification due to freedom to move in stream wise direction bernitsas et al 2006a introduced the concept of the vivace converter to harness hydrokinetic energy through fiv and presented experimental data bernitsas et al 2006b showing the potential of energy generation over the entire synchronization range in viv subsequently the range was expanded to the entire fiv range of viv and galloping chang et al 2011 sun et al 2016 huynh et al 2015 widened the resonance range of the viv energy converter with nonlinear springs ma et al 2016 and sun et al 2018 increased the harnessed power through galloping using nonlinear springs for various values of spring stiffness and damping although the flow around an asymmetric body has attracted much attention most of the studies focused on the general performance of the asymmetric body especially for a stationary cylinder the asymmetric flow field and the effect on the motion of the cylinder have received little attention galloping is another form of flow induced vibration fiv that non circular cylinders undergo due to asymmetry or upstream turbulence blevins 1990 flow asymmetry caused either by incoming flow or geometric modification of the cylinder may induce galloping which is an instability phenomenon not driven by vortex shedding but motion of the shear layers on either side of the cylinder fivs are suppressed in engineering applications because of their destructive nature on the other hand by enhancing and controlling fiv the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab at the university of michigan developed the vivace converter bernitsas and raghavan 2009 2011 2014 bernitsas 2016 to convert marine hydrokinetic mhk energy to electricity passive turbulence control ptc in the form of sand strips is used both in experiments and simulations chang et al 2011 attached local surface roughness which they called passive turbulence control covering a small and variable part of the cylinder surface between 10 and 60 measured from the forward stagnation point along the entire span of the cylinder soft galloping response was observed in a circular cylinder with ptc since galloping is caused by flow geometric asymmetry park et al 2012 2013 2017 extended selective circumferential application of surface roughness to the cylinder surface and found that the cylinder response is closely connected to the ptc sandpaper location depending on the location various forms of fiv such as weak suppression strong suppression hard galloping and soft galloping were observed in the ptc to fiv map the map in the flow regime trsl3 is a guide for placement of sand strips on the surface of the cylinder to alter fiv in this paper a rigid circular cylinder on springs with one sided ptc and one degree of freedom in the direction transverse to a steady flow is studied to investigate the effect of asymmetric turbulence stimulation ptc on the oscillatory response of the cylinder flow field details are presented to explain the cylinder motion and the influence of flow velocity damping ratio and ptc location angle the physical model and grid generation are presented in section 2 in section 3 the numerical approach and running parameters are described validation of the computational method is presented in section 4 the simulation results of amplitude and flow field details are shown in section 5 conclusions are drawn at the end all the experiments are conducted in the low turbulence free surface water ltfsw channel of the marine renewable energy laboratory mrelab of the university of michigan computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed in the mrelab and compared to experimental data 2 computational model 2 1 geometry and boundary conditions the computational domain is set as a rectangular area of 33d diameters in line with the flow by 9d transversely to the flow for the single one sided ptc cylinder as shown in fig 1 the entire domain includes five boundaries inflow outflow top bottom and the ptc cylinder the initial position which is the equilibrium position of the cylinder is located at the center of the domain in the y direction the distance between the inlet boundary and the center of the cylinder is set equal to 8d the downstream length of the domain is set equal to 25d this domain set up achieves two goals a it ensures that the conditions at the flow outlet are close to the assumed fully developed flow conditions u x 0 p x c b it simulates adequately the channel conditions with the exception of the free surface which is maintained at least four diameters away from the cylinder a uniform and constant velocity profile is applied at the inlet boundary the zero velocity gradient condition which is the fully developed condition is set for the outflow boundary the bottom condition is defined as a wall boundary to match the experimental condition the effect of the free surface present in the experiments was not considered in the numerical study thus the top boundary is simplified by modeling it as a wall which is the conclusion of previous studies ding et al 2015 2016 the detailed experimental setup can be found in the paper by sun et al 2016 the ptc cylinder is treated as a moving wall and its velocity and displacement are dictated by the oscillator equation which is described in section 2 3 ptc in the form of sandpaper strips was introduced in the mrelab to increase the efficiency and power density of vivace a pair of straight roughness strips were pasted on the surface of the cylinder symmetrically with respect to the forward stagnation point covering circumferential surface area equivalent to 16 on a d 3 5 0 0889 cm cylinder the location angle Î± ptc 20 is measured in degrees from the forward stagnation point in the corresponding ideal flow based on previous research by park et al 2012 2013 2017 sand strips with roughness designation p60 are used as ptc in this study for one sided ptc a 16 degree p60 strip is applied as shown in fig 1 b table 1 shows the details of the roughness strip used in this studt 2 2 mesh configuration a two dimensional structured computational grid was generated in each case with the multi block grid generation technique to develop a non uniform grid which guarantees satisfactory calculation precision with moderate computational time corresponding to the multi block technique the interface technique which is shown in fig 1 as two dashed lines and in fig 2 as two red lines is used in the overlapping of two neighboring zones the subdomain in the vicinity of the cylinder is a 2d 2d square block where the grid density for the near wall region is enhanced to solve for high resolution in flow properties the cylinder and the 2d 2d square block fig 2 move synchronously to make sure the grid near the cylinder remains the same in the whole moving process for comparatively more accurate results especially for the integration of the pressure on the cylinder surface a at the interface we make sure the grid density on the two sides of the interface is the same we use multi block grid technique to refine the interface zone compared to ding et al 2016 with 60252 cells the grid in the present work with a total of 126327 cells is fine enough to generate convergent results b for the boundary layer on the wall of the ptc cylinder comparisons are made using a stationary cylinder to investigate the influence of the boundary layer as shown in table 2 due to the nature of the flow in the boundary layer the boundary layer grid adaption technique was used to make sure that y of the near wall grid was less than 16 in the present study y is not constant during the calculations for each case finally we adopted the two layer resolution in table 2 where there is a two layer mesh on the step with corresponding maximum y equal to 16 a close up of the grid of near cylinder region is shown in fig 3 the simulated reynolds number range for which experiments were conducted in the mrelab is 30 000 re 110 000 falls in the high lift trsl3 flow regime zdravkovich 1997 at high speeds galloping was observed and the maximum amplitude reached was nearly 2 5d in the cfd simulations large mesh deformations occur with the cylinder undergoing galloping in order to minimize the mesh deformation a dynamic mesh technique of topological change the layering method is used in the present study the cylinder and the 2d 2d square block move up and down along their side edges and their moving velocity is determined by the user defined function udf programming ansys 2015 the cell height adjacent to the moving block is properly set to ensure that the grid density remains almost the same with the initially generated grid as the block is moved 2 3 mathematical model the time dependent viscous flow solutions are obtained by numerical approximation of the incompressible 2d urans equations in conjunction with the one equation spalart and allmaras 1994 turbulence model the model is as follows 1 u i x i 0 2 u i t u j u i x j 1 Ï p x i x j 2 v s i j u j u i where v is the molecular kinematic viscosity

spalart and allmaras 1994 the classical linear time invariant mass damper spring oscillator model is used to describe the cylinder dynamics in fiv the one degree of freedom equation of motion can be expressed as 6 m y x y k y f where m is the total oscillating mass of the cylinder and attachments including one third of the spring mass and f is the total vertical lift force which is calculated by d f p d y this is the forced oscillation equation the left hand side models the cylinder vibration while the right hand side is the force applied on the cylinder by the fluid solving for the acceleration term y equation 6 becomes 7 y f c y k y m when the acceleration of the cylinder is known its velocity and displacement can be calculated by 8 y t 1 y t u t 1 Î´ t 9 u t 1 u t a t 1 Î´ t the displacement of the cylinder in viv can therefore be written as 10 y t 1 y t u t Î´ t a t 1 Î´ t 2 where a t 1 in equation 9 is calculated using equation 7 thus in numerical form 11 a t 1 f t 1 c u t k y t m returning to equation 9 and rewriting the numerical displacement equation will read 12 y t 1 y t u t Î´ t f t 1 c u t k y t m Î´ t 2 equation 12 gives the displacement of the cylinder at each time step the force applied by the fluid will commence the oscillatory movement of the cylinder the cylinder is assumed to be at the origin y 0 and stable at t 0 the initial conditions in mathematical terms are 13 y 0 u 0 0 just after the flow starts the displacement of the cylinder will therefore be 14 y 1 y 0 u 0 Î´ t f 1 c u 0 k y 0 m Î´ t 2 f 1 m Î´ t 2 fiv is a fluid structure interaction fsi problem at each time step the cylinder is assumed to be stationary and the force acting on the cylinder is integrated to get the transverse lift force which is then used to find the new displacement of the cylinder at the next time step as the cylinder moves it also modifies the flow field thus the flow also is affected by the cylinder s movement this is the second part of the fsi so the cylinder is excited by the fluid and in return it moves and affects the flow the force f is calculated by integrating the pressure at every time step the pressure field is calculated followed by surface integration to produce the force on the cylinder then the acceleration velocity and displacement are calculated next the velocity and displacement are imposed on the cylinder and the cylinder moves a distance according to the velocity and time step after the movement the flow field is changed and the pressure is recalculated to begin the next time step so the change of the force depends on the change of the flow field and in equation 12 the value of f is changed in every time step the data transfer process between fluid and solid is not modelled in equation 12 2 4 physical model in the mrelab of the university of michigan a virtual damper spring vck system has been introduced to replace the physical dampers and springs of the oscillators the vck system provides the damper and spring forces based on displacement and velocity feedback and thus simulates two of the three elements of the mechanical oscillator the third being the mass details on the vck system can be found in sun et al 2015 the most important features of vck are a the hydrodynamic force is not included in the control loop b the system damping is identified using a detailed system identification process and removed for the system to add a predetermined function and value a linear damping function is implemented in experiments emulating a linear viscous damping system the cylinder is constrained to oscillate in the y direction which is perpendicular to its axis and to the flow velocity in the x direction a virtual spring of stiffness k 600 n m is selected in the experimental system the total damping c is defined as 15 c c s t r u c t u r e c h a r n e s s where c s t r u c t u r e is the existing system damping due to energy losses in the transmission system in this research c s t r u c t u r e is maintained to correspond to Î¶ s t r u c t u r e 0 02 Î¶ h a r n e s s is the damping added through vck that converts the mechanical energy in the oscillating cylinder to electrical energy simulating a power take off pto system the relation between c and Î¶ can be expressed using the following equation 16 Î¶ c 2 m o s c k the parameters of the experimental apparatus are listed in table 3 3 validation of the numerical solution 3 1 validation of cfd results by comparison to experiments fig 4 presents a comparison of amplitude ratio a d between the current numerical study and experimental data the former is based on the average positive and negative values after simulations have reached steady state the experimental a d is calculated by averaging the absolute values of the 30 highest positive and 30 highest negative peaks in 60 s of running time past the transient the one sided ptc cylinder is not a symmetric body the amplitude response is not symmetrical around the equilibrium position in general the positive amplitude is higher than the negative amplitude the asymmetrical displacement time histories are shown in figs 8 and 10 three kinds of amplitude are calculated in each case the positive amplitude upward amplitude on smooth side of the cylinder shown in fig 2 named a positive the negative amplitude downward amplitude on the ptc side of the cylinder shown in fig 2 named a negative and the average amplitude named a average which is determined by the following equation 17 a a v e r a g e a p o s i t i v e a n e g a t i v e in fig 4 a and b the asymmetric cylinder response can be observed clearly as the damping increases the asymmetry in oscillations is observed at flow velocity higher than 0 8 m s fig 4 b the simulated negative amplitude shows good agreement with the experimental results the numerical calculation of the positive amplitude does not capture the transition from viv to galloping well starting around 0 8 m s in transition the calculated amplitude is higher than the experimental especially for the low damping ratio at the initial viv branch simulation results are much closer to experimental measurements in fig 4 a simulation and experiment nearly coincide completely in fig 4 b simulations show that viv initiates at 0 3 m s while experimentally the cylinder viv initiates at u 0 4 m s this is attributed to the difference between the theoretical linear viscous damping in equation 6 and the real one as specified by the vck fig 4 c shows the comparison of the average amplitude between experimental and simulation results it is observed that the simulation results at the initial and upper viv branches and the galloping branch all show good agreement with the experimental results the results differ in the transition region from the upper viv branch to galloping as the lower branch and desynchronization regions are cut short due to the relative position of the end of viv and beginning of galloping bernitsas 2016 from the experimental results in fig 4 c we also observe that in the transition region the standard deviation is comparatively higher which means that the amplitude in the transition region is not steady and harder to capture numerically the reason for the simulation not capturing well the transition range around 25 difference is attributed to the 2d urans turbulence model which is based on an isotropic hypothesis and cannot predict well the behavior of random small vortices similar conclusion and discussion can be also found in wu et al 2014 kinaci et al 2016 and ding et al 2016 the positive amplitude is underestimated by about 10 by simulation compared with experimental data in the high flow velocities this is partially due to the free surface being approximated as a wall which introduces a blockage effect to the cylinder motion generally it is reasonable to believe that the simulation work in the present paper is accurate enough to predict the performance of flow induced motion for one sided ptc 3 2 discussion on validation and differences the following discussion is important in interpreting simulation results and comparing them to experimental data this includes comparing results between smooth one sided and two sided cylinders in sections 4 and 5 discussions on viv galloping and transition from viv to galloping are separated as the destabilizing hydrodynamic mechanism is totally different i experiments vs cfd in viv as stated in wu et al 2014 and explained by bernitsas 2016 2d urans codes fail to predict accurately the separation point in cylinders for re 10 000 they predict that the separation point occurs at 90 and remains stationary in subcritical flows experiments show that the separation point for flows past circular cylinders oscillates by as much as 5 reaching up to the maximum of 81 right before vortex shedding this is a vital piece of experimental information against which all cfd codes should be validated if the location of the separation point is not predicted correctly by a cfd code the vortex structures and lift coefficient will not be predicted correctly either when ptc is introduced the flow separation point is set at the same point both experimentally and numerically resulting in very good agreement between cfd and experiments wu et al 2014 ding et al 2015 2016 in the case of one sided ptc the separation on the side of the ptc is calculated accurately while on the smooth side it is not thus on the ptc side of the cylinder flow separation is calculated correctly vortex strength and vortex roll up calculations are improved but to a point as discussed in point 2 below as a result the upward force calculation is improved when the vortex sheds on the lower side of the cylinder one sided ptc the resulting lift force is more accurate inducing an upward lift force that reverses the cylinder direction properly this does not occur at the upper end of the cylinder resulting in a reduced lift the net effect is some loss in overall flow circulation around the cylinder and per the kutta joukowski theorem reduction in lift the cylinder then a reaches positive amplitudes that are 5 higher than negative amplitudes b this observation holds both experimentally and numerically as shown in fig 4 c both positive and negative computed amplitudes are a little lower than experimental measurements ii comparison of smooth one sided two sided cylinders in viv the roughness in the turbulence stimulation sand paper in the trsl3 flow regime reduces the strength of the formed and shed vortices in trsl3 the shear layer is fully saturated and the surface roughness does not add more turbulence on the contrary surface roughness slows down the flow and skin friction on a smooth surface generating vorticity in the boundary layer is replaced by form drag on the individual roughness particles which are perpendicular to the cylinder surface this experimental conclusion was derived from experiments on a flat plate parallel to the flow in the 1950 s and 1960 s with increasing reynolds number the skin friction coefficient of a flat plate with surface roughness stops decreasing and reaches a plateau as the boundary layer thickness decreases with higher flow speeds higher re the roughness elements start sticking out of the boundary layer in that case the drag from the rough plate is not dominated by the plate skin friction but by the drag of the roughness elements those have cross section of a bluff body perpendicular to the flow for cylinders the drag consists of about 95 form drag and only 5 skin friction since each individual roughness element is small the roughness re not the body re is about 1000 2000 where the drag coefficient in subcritical flows is constant and equal to about 1 05 for roughness re up to 300 000 that results in a constant drag coefficient for the plate determined by the form drag of the roughness elements this fact explains the following two observations in fig 5 a in viv the smooth cylinder has higher response than the one sided cylinder b in viv the one sided cylinder has higher response than the two sided cylinder iii experiments vs cfd in galloping the counterpart observations to i are a the cylinder reaches positive amplitudes that are significantly higher than negative amplitudes b this observation holds both experimentally and numerically as shown in fig 4 c positive computed amplitudes are a little lower than experimental measurements negative computed amplitudes are very close to experimental measurements iv comparison of smooth one sided two sided cylinders in galloping the amplitude response between the three cylinders is reversed in comparison to viv that is the two sided cylinder exhibits higher a d than the one sided cylinder of course the smooth cylinder does not exhibit galloping the explanation for iii and iv follows the driving hydrodynamic mechanism in galloping is an instability induced by geometric asymmetry and resulting in negative lift in viv at the end of the travel as the cylinder reverses direction a vortex sheds and pushes the cylinder away in galloping the instability pulls the cylinder in the direction of the motion until the direction is reversed by the springs that is the force to direction relation is similar regardless of the fact that forcing is applied at a different part of the cycle and the excitation mechanism is completely different at the positive end smooth of the travel in viv a vortex will shed and will contribute to the reversal in galloping the reversal is due only to the spring force the geometric asymmetry of the cylinder has a higher angle of attack blevins 1990 when the cylinder moves up resulting in higher negative damping and higher lift accordingly the positive amplitude of the cylinder in galloping is higher than the negative amplitude fig 4 v experiments vs cfd in transition for this particular set of experiments cfd and experiments agree on the average fig 4 c but not on whether the positive or the negative amplitude is higher in transition both mechanisms coexist at the beginning the instability mechanism form galloping and the periodic excitation from the viv lock in are in phase as the amplitude increases the viv lock in is desynchronized and some vortices act against the galloping excitation while others support the galloping excitation this combination of excitation mechanisms is not captured exactly by cfd resulting in an understandable small discrepancy past transition in fully developed galloping timing of vortex shedding is such that alternating vortices do not synchronize with the galloping motion bernitsas 2016 vi comparison of smooth one sided two sided cylinders in transition if viv and galloping are brought back to back so that the onset of galloping occurs right after the viv upper branch the lower branch and desynchronization of viv do not appear fig 4 and fig 5a when damping is increased the onset of galloping is delayed to higher velocity values and a gap between viv and galloping occurs fig 5 b thus in cases like fig 4 and fig 5 a a transition region exists where vortex shedding remains in synchronization with the galloping oscillation and assists galloping in summary a the presence of the one sided ptc on the lower side of the cylinder only defines the separation point and the geometric asymmetry accurately both experimentally and numerically resulting in good agreement on the negative side of displacement the inaccurate definition of the separation point at the upper side of the cylinder defines poorly the galloping inducing asymmetry which is now due not to pure geometry but to shear layer definition initiating at an incorrect separation point b the more roughness the less the amplitude in viv and the more the amplitude in galloping for ptc thickness on the order of the boundary layer thickness in the flow regime tested this is concluded when a smooth cylinder a one sided ptc and a two sided ptc cylinder are compared 4 results and discussion following the discussion in section 3 2 above it is easier to explain and rationalize the observations below 4 1 experimental amplitude response asymmetric vs symmetric ptc cylinders fig 5 compares experimental measurements of the average dimensionless amplitude a d of one sided asymmetric ptc cylinder with the corresponding two sided ptc cylinder in fiv the following observations can be made a for the low damping ratio in fig 5 a the amplitude velocity curves of the two configurations have similar trends and do not exhibit a gap between viv and galloping b one sided ptc results in earlier initiation of viv and higher amplitude due to lower overall roughness compared to the two sided ptc this is consistent with the observations on total roughness and ptc thickness by chang et al 2011 bernitsas 2016 c for the same reason in the upper branch the one sided ptc cylinder has higher amplitude than the two sided ptc cylinder d in the galloping range the one sided ptc cylinder shows a lower amplitude and delayed onset of galloping the less pronounced geometric deviation of one sided ptc from the smooth cylinder than the two sided ptc cylinder explains this observation as discussed in section 3 2 e as expected increase in damping has the following effects on fiv bernitsas 2016 ma et al 2017 i it shrinks the viv response curve by a small delay in initiation a reduction in amplitude and an earlier desynchronization ii it delays onset of galloping to higher velocities iii it reduces galloping response just like viv amplitude iv it results in a gap between viv and galloping f in galloping on the contrary the increased deviation of the two sided ptc cylinder from the smooth cylinder compared to the one sided ptc results in higher amplitude detailed experimental data about two sided ptc cylinders can be found in sun et al 2016 bernitsas 2016 4 2 numerical investigation of flow velocity effect fig 6 shows the vortex formation at different velocities for Î¶ 0 02 the near wake vortex pattern has been classified by williamson and govardhan 2004 govardhan and williamson 2000 for the trsl2 flow regime some important observations are listed below a for re 44 185 u 0 5 m s u 5 14 initial viv branch the classical von kÃ¡rmÃ¡n street can be observed with the 2s mode of vortex shedding as shown in fig 6 a and b in fig 6 c and d two dominant vortices are observed shedding from the cylinder in one cycle b starting from re 53 022 u 0 6 m s beginning of upper branch in fig 6 c a significant difference in vortex patterns is observed compared to the 2s mode in fig 6 a for re 35 348 u 0 4 m s an additional vortex is captured near each shedding vortex that is two pairs of vortices shed per cycle in each pair one vortex is much weaker than the other and disperses sooner as the fluid flows downstream this vortex pattern is quasi 2p which is observed during transition from 2s to 2p c staring from re 70 696 u 0 8 m s upper viv branch in fig 6 e and f the 2p vortex pattern is observed one pair of vortices is shed on each side of the cylinder four vortices are shed from the cylinder in one oscillation cycle d for higher re it is hard to observe vortex structures experimentally using a high speed camera and extensive post processing vortex structures can be studied sun et al 2016 at the high end of the channel motor capacity however air may be trapped in the channel hindering clear laser imaging thus there are no consistent conclusions about the vortex structure in high flow velocity above 1 10 m s nevertheless the following observations can be made the upper part of the cylinder is smooth and thus the separation point oscillates by 5 in the present simulations we observe that for re 80 000 an elongated cluster of vortices emerges this exhibits similarities to the symmetric ptc cylinder simulations by ding et al 2015 2016 albeit a small separation between the vortices in the immediate wake the high velocity and the constraints of the channel wall have a stretching effect on the vortex specifically due to the high speed irrotational flow does not flow upstream between the positive and negative vortices in the immediate cylinder wake thus delaying separation gerard s vortex shedding mechanism requires coalescence of all three elements positive negative and zero vorticity at the same point for shedding to occur thus the vortices in the immediate wake of the cylinder at high speed become elongated and do not separate until irrotational flow coalesces with positive and negative vorticity at a point between the positive and negative vortices 4 3 computational temporal evolution of vortex shedding of the asymmetric ptc cylinder two typical cases at u 0 7 m s re 62 600 and u 1 1 m s re 89 147 are selected to elaborate on the flow field using time histories referring to fig 5 the two cases selected and studied are in the upper branch u 0 7 m s and galloping branch u 1 1 m s the parameters were selected in such a way that hydrokinetic energy can be harnessed over all values of flow velocity u the displacement time curve y t is periodic with the predominant mode being sinusoidal as shown in figs 8 and 10 in order to study the evolution process of the vortex formation in one period four positions a b c d in fig 7 in a cycle are selected to study the flow field details as in figs 9 and 11 fig 8 shows the time history of the nondimensional displacement y t d and lift coefficient c l t at u 0 7 m s re 61 859 this is in the viv range and the asymmetry in c l t is more obvious than the asymmetry in the displacement history the upward lift force is higher than the downward lift force correspondingly the positive amplitude is higher than the negative amplitude although the asymmetry in the amplitude is not very obvious at this velocity fig 9 a and b present the evolution of vortex when Î¶ 0 02 and 0 14 respectively in the low damping ratio which allows higher amplitude the quasi 2p vortex mode is manifested as the damping ratio increases to Î¶ 0 14 the amplitude of oscillation reduces and the cylinder wake changes to the 2s vortex structure fig 10 shows the time history of the nondimensional displacement y t d and lift coefficient c l t when u 1 1 m s re 89 147 this is in the galloping range compared to viv galloping shows stronger asymmetry both in nondimensional displacement y t d and in the lift coefficient the c l t time histories are very useful in understanding the galloping response as shown in fig 10 galloping is an instability phenomenon pulling the cylinder in the direction of the motion as the corresponding damping coefficient is negative in galloping that instability drives the cylinder motion as explained in section 3 2 the lift is stronger when the cylinder moves up due to the higher angle of attack blevins 1990 vortex shedding of course is present since a bluff body is exposed to a uniform flow nevertheless the vortex shedding mechanism does not drive the cylinder as in the case of viv because vortex shedding is no longer in synchronization with the motion past the end of viv as vortices shed they push the cylinder away that force may or may not be in the direction of the galloping motion and it may assist or oppose the motion respectively the higher frequency observed in fig 10 a and b is due to vortex shedding as the velocity is high and past the end of the viv range vortices shed in patterns that do not follow the wake frequency any more bernitsas 2016 thus some vortices oppose the galloping motion and some assist it the corresponding vortex modes for u 1 1 m s are shown in fig 11 the higher amplitude at Î¶ 0 02 makes the wake wider for high damping the wake becomes narrower as the damping increases the amplitude decreases narrowing the wake the high incoming flow velocity and the narrower wake contribute to the elongated cluster of vortices 4 4 numerical investigation of the effect of roughness location for the 20â° ptc location angle because the angle is small the boundary layer separates at the step point and re attaches to the cylinder surface just as shown in fig 14 which makes the width of the wake of the ptc cylinder similar with that of the smooth cylinder when the ptc location angle becomes larger while remaining below the typical separation point of 81â° in subcritical flows as mentioned in section 3 2 the flow will separate at the step point but will not re attach to the cylinder surface hence the separation point for the ptc side and the smooth side will be different which affects the motion of the cylinder fig 12 shows the ptc to fiv map developed by park et al 2012 fig 12 shows that the 20â° ptc angle is located in the soft galloping zone soft galloping is self initiated as opposed to the hard galloping phenomenon where a threshold amplitude is required to initiate it to compare the influence of different ptc location angles three ptc location angles are considered for meaningful comparison all the location angles are selected in the same soft galloping zone 20â° 30â° 40â° the same ptc coverage of 16â° is adopted as in the map equivalent to 0 2 0 00508 m on a d 3 5 cylinder 0 0889m although the map is for two sided ptc it can still serve as a guide for the selection of the range of the ptc location fig 13 shows the amplitude comparison for a positive a negative and a average for the three selected location angles in the two typical cases of flow velocity u 0 7 m s viv and u 1 1 m s galloping the positive amplitude increases almost linearly with the increase of the ptc location angle on the contrary the negative amplitude almost remains independent of the ptc location angle based on equation 14 the average amplitude increases linearly as well the difference between the a positive and a negative becomes more obvious with the increase of the ptc location angle for both damping ratios 4 5 asymmetry in amplitude response due to the geometric asymmetry created by the one sided ptc the flow around the cylinder in fiv is not symmetric inducing unequal a positive and a negative as in fig 4 as discussed in section 3 in all fiv cases whether in viv or galloping a positive is numerically greater than a negative experimentally though there is an interval near the end of viv and before the onset of galloping where a positive is less than a negative fig 4 in this section by studying the flow field details additional insight is provided into understanding the relation between geometric asymmetry flow asymmetry due to the geometry and the induced amplitude response asymmetry from figs 4 5 and 13 we observe that the higher the incoming flow velocity the bigger is the difference between a positive and a negative thus the case of u 1 1 m s is selected to elaborate on the details of the flow field theoretically if the cylinder is symmetrical the highest displacement position fig 7 point d and the lowest position fig 7 point b should have symmetrical flow field properties averaged over an extended time period time local discrepancies may exist because of vortex shedding variation consequently these two positions will be used to study the effects of geometric asymmetry of the one sided ptc cylinder on the flow and the cylinder response for passive control techniques that influence only one of the separating shear layers from the cylinder as is the present study the issue becomes the extent to which the modified shear layer affects the entire near wake which of course is formed between the two separating shear layers 4 5 1 streamlines at 1 1 m s for Î¶ 0 02 2d urans generally provides a good understanding of the flow in terms of quantitative data like the lift force and the amplitude as long as the corresponding experimental data are obtained from well designed two dimensional experiments a better understanding about the wake boundary layer shear layer interaction can be achieved by simulating viv with les and dns sarpkaya 2004 though the latter is computationally prohibitive in the trsl3 flow regime in this study given the agreement and explainable differences between experiments and computations discussed in section 3 2 we can still find the influence of the step location angle with the same 2d urans simulation method from fig 13 the 40â° ptc configuration exhibits the strongest asymmetry in amplitude response among the three angles tested this can be clearly seen in figs 14 and 15 the reattachment that occurs after the ptc for a placement angle of 20â° makes the influence of the step smaller and the wake narrower wider wake relates to higher amplitude the highest position fig 14 has wider wake with the increase of the step location angle but the lowest position has almost the same wake width for all angle values further the wake is narrower than that of the highest position so the a positive has an obvious increase with the location angle increase but the a negative remains almost the same fig 13 at the highest position the wider wake relates to the highest amplitude at the lowest position the constant wake width relates to constant amplitude with respect to the ptc angle of course as explained in section 3 2 the underlying factor is the angle of attack which increases with increasing angle of ptc the interpretation of the observations on fig 15 follows the flow velocity is high enough for the flow to be in the high lift trsl3 flow regime the upper side of the cylinder with no ptc exhibits a separation point around 90â° in the cfd calculations in spite of the fact that this is not quite correct as explained in section 3 2 the flow characteristics are closer to those of subctirical flow and thus wider wake the lower side of the cylinder with the ptc exhibits post critical flow characteristics due to the turbulence stimulation by the ptc specifically there is enough momentum at this higher velocity to narrow the wake behind the cylinder that reduces both the drag and the lift on the cylinder 4 5 2 streamlines at 1 1 m s for Î¶ 0 14 figs 16 and 17 show the wake structure for the three ptc angle locations for Î¶ 0 14 at the lowest position fig 17 the separation point on the lower side of the cylinder almost remains constant with respect to the ptc angle the width of the wake still stays the same for the three configurations as in the case of Î¶ 0 02 at the highest position fig 16 the separation point of the upper side of the cylinder is at the same location for all three angles but on the lower cylinder side the separation point depends on the ptc location angle and the reattachment is not obvious with the increase of the location angle fig 16 the observation of wider wake at higher location angle is still valid 4 5 3 pressure coefficient distribution at 1 1 m s the surface pressure coefficients c p at the highest and lowest position of the cylinder for high flow velocity u 1 1 m s galloping region for the cylinders with one side ptc and placement angles 20 30 and 40 are given in figs 18 and 19 the difference in amplitudes can be confirmed by the pressure differences between the upper and lower parts of the cylinder as well at the highest position the pressure difference is higher than that of the lowest position which is in agreement with the higher positive amplitude than the negative amplitude with the increase of the ptc location angle the pressure difference for the highest position increases too while the pressure difference for the lowest position remains almost the same which can explain the asymmetry distribution of the amplitude and shows good correspondence with the different wake width shown in figs 14 17 it can be noticed directly that there is a higher pressure gradient at the rear part of the cylinder where vortex shedding occurs higher pressure gradients are associated with stronger vortex shedding and closer to the cylinder resulting in higher amplitude the discontinuity in the pressure coefficient graph is where the roughness strip is placed 5 conclusions the flow induced vibrations of an elastically mounted rigid cylinder with one sided turbulence stimulation named ptc was investigated both numerically and experimentally at reynolds number in the range 30 000 re 110 000 stiffness mass and damping parameters were selected so that the cylinder responds in the entire range of viv transition from viv to galloping and galloping three different ptc locations were studied experimentally and numerically positive negative and average amplitude were measured detailed flow field images were presented for two different damping ratios and three ptc locations to understand better the effect of one sided ptc and explain the results measured experimentally and calculated using 2d urans the work in the paper can be considered as a generic step towards understanding the underlying physics in one sided turbulence stimulation and other more complex configurations that may be difficult to test experimentally or numerically the following observations conclusions can be drawn from the results presented in this study the underlying concepts that explain those were presented in section 3 2 1 in viv the smooth cylinder has the highest average amplitude followed by the one sided asymmetric ptc cylinder while the two sided ptc cylinder exhibits the smallest amplitude 2 in galloping the order is reversed the more total roughness induces higher average response 3 in viv the amplitude of a one sided ptc cylinder is not symmetric around the equilibrium position the positive amplitude smooth side is larger than the negative amplitude ptc side 4 the same is true in galloping the positive amplitude is larger than the negative amplitude 5 in the transition region between viv and galloping the one sided ptc exhibits a flatter vibration curve in transition the one sided ptc maintains its oscillation even at higher damping while the two sided ptc ceases to oscillate 6 the asymmetry in the amplitude response becomes stronger with increasing flow velocity increasing actual ptc location angle as long as the ptc remains inside the galloping zone and decreasing damping ratio 7 since 2d urans codes fail to predict accurately the separation point in cylinders for re 10 000 in viv in the case of one sided ptc the separation on the side of the ptc is calculated accurately while on the smooth side it is not as a result flow separation vortex strength and vortex roll up are calculated correctly resulting in accurate prediction of the upward force when the vortex sheds on the lower side of the cylinder which has the one sided ptc thus the difference between the computed and the experimentally measured negative ptc side amplitude is smaller than the corresponding difference for the positive amplitude smooth side 8 in galloping which is driven by geometric asymmetry the driving force is also computed more accurately on the ptc side of the cylinder thus the difference between the computed and the experimentally measured negative ptc side amplitude is also smaller than the corresponding difference for the positive amplitude smooth side 9 for different angle of ptc locations the upper side of the cylinder with no ptc exhibits incorrectly a separation point around 90â° in the cfd calculations the flow characteristics are closer to those of subcritical flow and thus wider wake the lower side of the cylinder with the ptc exhibits post critical flow characteristics due to the turbulence stimulation by the ptc specifically there is enough momentum at this higher velocity to narrow the wake behind the cylinder that reduces both the drag and the lift on the cylinder 10 as the ptc location angle increases the width of the wake at the highest oscillation position increases but remains almost the same at the lowest position acknowledgements supported by a cooperative agreement no de ee0006780 between vortex hydro energy and the u s department of energy the

et al 2010 musharraf et al 2013 song et al 2016 according to the united states geological survey usgs world petroleum assessment 2000 usgs world assessment team 2000 the sum of the mean estimates for each province indicates that about 13 of the mean estimated global undiscovered oil resource and about 30 of the gas one may be contained in the arctic approximately 84 of such sources is expected to be found in offshore areas bird et al 2008 the arctic area presents significant technical logistical and safety challenges regarding construction and operation including a lack of detailed standard optimization with respect to winterization and data scarcity khan et al 2015a the primary factors that make activities in the arctic peculiar are the presence of ice in many different forms and snow as well as a seasonal darkness such harsh climate is associated with remoteness long distances from customer and supplier s markets moreover rich and important ecosystems were identified in the arctic and sub arctic regions barabadi et al 2015 gao et al 2010 these factors have a considerable influence on the choice of design as well as operations and maintenance barabadi et al 2015 operability may be critical maintenance may be ineffective and components may deteriorate relatively quickly due to severe conditions barabadi et al 2015 gao et al 2010 landucci et al 2017 the norwegian arctic shelf is unique in this respect due to the gulf stream ocean currents ice is relatively less present and access to infrastructure may be facilitated norheim 2010 on the other hand particular attention must be focused on the environment of such areas recent major accidents increased public concern on o g for instance the crude oil spill accidentally released in 2004 from the terra nova fpso floating production storage and offloading unit in newfoundland canada affected cape st mary s ecological reserve and caused the death of thousands seabirds wilhelm et al 2007 moreover the deepwater horizon oil spill occurred in 2010 in the gulf of mexico and described as the worst environmental disaster in the united states released about 0 78 mm3 of crude oil and caused extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats bp 2010 deepwater horizon study group 2011 therefore the need for improved safety and environmental assessment in this sensitive area claims for advanced tools for risk estimation and evaluation despite the fact that several methods are available for personnel risk evaluation lees 1996 paltrinieri and khan 2016 and for environmental risk assessment epa 1998 guo 2017 valdor et al 2015 integrating the peculiar aspects of both frameworks is a challenging task and requires research developments moreover the analysis and management of safety barriers 1 1 according to sklet 2006 a safety barrier is a physical or non physical mean planned to prevent control or mitigate undesired events or accidents may not be systematically undertaken despite being requested by local competent authorities such as in the case of the norwegian petroleum safety authority psa requirements psa 2013a the present study is aimed at providing a methodology for the integrated safety and environmental assessment dedicated to offshore o g facilities located in sensitive areas firstly a methodology for dynamic risk assessment the risk barometer rb paltrinieri and khan 2016 was adapted in order to develop a barrier management model the aim was to investigate how barrier performance might influence the overall level of risk during the lifecycle of the facility considering specific risk worsening elements induced by harsh environment secondarily environmental risk assessment was performed using an approach based on simulation of oil spill evolution this is aimed at the verification of safety barriers effectiveness for offshore facilities located in sensitive areas the methodology was applied to a real reference case study in the goliat oil field norway which represents a relevant example of innovative facility operating offshore in the arctic sensitive region information about goliat are gathered exclusively from public sources and the results obtained are derived from theoretical simulations 2 definition of the reference case study 2 1 characteristics of the oil field the goliat field is the first oil field to be developed in the barents sea eni norge 2015a it is located 85 km northwest of hammerfest north of russia and norway fig 1 the production license is owned by eni norge with 65 and by statoil with 35 goliat field has two separate main reservoirs kobbe and realgrunnen characterized by low pressure the recoverable reserves amount to 174 million barrels 28 mm3 the field is expected to be in production for fifteen years but field life may be extended with new discoveries compared to the neighbour arctic sea the barents sea is relatively shallow and free from ice all through the year due to warm gulf stream currents from the north atlantic and high salt level average ocean depth in the area is between 200 and 300 m larsen et al 2004 goliat field water depth varies from 325 to 390 m eni norge 2015b the barents sea and the kara sea belong to one of the marine ecoregions included in the world wide fund for nature wwf global 200 olson and dinerstein 2002 wwf biologists defined the norwegian coast fig 1 as a very high priority area for maintenance of biodiversity based on the following criteria larsen et al 2004 naturalness representativeness high biological diversity high productivity ecological significance for species source area for essential ecological processes or life support systems uniqueness and sensitivity the ecoregion supports abundant fish stocks as well as high concentration of nesting seabirds and a diverse community of sea mammals larsen et al 2004 2 2 characteristics of the installation goliat installation is a circular geostationary fpso unit it is the largest and most complex of its kind and it was specifically designed to ensure safe and reliable production in the harsh conditions of the barents sea eni norge 2016 it is possible to identify seven main areas on the fpso as schematized in fig 2 adapted from rekdal and hansen 2015 production is facilitated by subsea system consisting of 22 wells 12 production wells 7 water injectors and 3 gas injectors the extracted crude oil is processed stabilized stored and then directly offloaded from the fpso to shuttle tankers through the offloading station bjornbom 2011 the offloading system is one of the safest and most reliable offloading system ever fabricated for offshore operations the distance between the shuttle tanker and the platform is greater than in similar installations and video cameras and a light system are in place for frequent status monitoring of the offloading hose eni norge 2015a 3 improved safety and environmental assessment for sensitive areas 3 1 need for dynamic risk assessment quantitative risk assessment qra in the framework of o g upstream operations is based on consolidated procedures and methods crawley 1999 crawley and grant 1997 iso international standardization organization 2009 khan et al 2002 nevertheless the challenges associated with the operation in harsh and sensitive environment claim for more advanced tools for risk estimation and evaluation in particular operational and organizational factors often may affect risk in terms of likelihood of undesired failure ale et al 2014 attwood et al 2006 griffin et al 2014 landucci and paltrinieri 2016 vinnem et al 2012 training workload motivation to safety culture procedures are aspects that may be disregarded by conventional qra techniques which are traditionally focusing on technical aspects paltrinieri and khan 2016 moreover periodic evaluation and update of the system risk picture is not commonly performed static risk estimation in a frozen instant of the system life represents the basis on which everyday operations are planned without capturing customary risk fluctuations during the lifecycle of a production plant yet pole et al 2009 kalantarnia et al 2009 paltrinieri et al 2014 pasman and reniers 2014 pitblado et al 2011 international standards e g iso 31 000 on risk management iso international standardization organization 2009 and norsok z 013 on risk and emergency preparedness analysis norsok standards 2001 and relevant regulations e g eu seveso directives on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances european commission 2012 suggest updates of risk analysis only in conjunction with major changes in the plant organization or every five years falck et al 2015 2000 share such concern and affirm that risk assessment performed for the design phase of a plant is not suitable for the following operation phases therefore real time data and periodical risk evaluation may be considered as a key improvement to allow for effective decision making support a tool translating system data into the quasi real time risk picture is required new techniques of dynamic risk assessment are necessary to overcome qra staticity by considering the process behaviour khakzad et al 2016 paltrinieri et al 2016 scarponi et al 2016 scarponi and paltrinieri 2016 in the present work the rb methodology paltrinieri et al 2016 scarponi et al 2016 represents a preliminary response to this need and was chosen to support the dynamic risk evaluation for the analysis of the reference case described in section 2 3 2 need for advanced environmental assessment in the marine environment it is estimated that about 14 million barrels 2 2 mm3 of oil are released in the sea annually about 18 of this comes from refineries offshore operations and tanker activities ivshina et al 2015 the average number of severe oil spills during 2010s to date in particular larger than 800 m3 according to the international tanker owner pollution federation itopf 2016 is about 7 of the total oil spills released in the 1970s itopf 2016 this reduction is due to the combined efforts of the oil industry and government to improve safety and pollution prevention itopf 2016 nevertheless there are very limited research efforts in developing effective and integrated decision making frameworks and systems to support oil spill response particularly in cold and harsh environment li et al 2016 mccoy and salerno 2010 walker et al 1994 1995 the environmental impact of a spill depends on a large number of parameters such as its size and type of released substance itopf 2013 this work refers only to petroleum spill such as kerosene gasoline and crude oil the location at which the oil spill occurs has also a fundamental importance as the severity depends on the ambient conditions and the sensitivity of the affected organisms and their habitats to the oil itopf 2013 spills in sensitive areas have serious biological impact on vegetation birds and mammals duke 2016 bejarano and michel 2016 therefore particular attention should be paid to environmental issues concerning an installation in the barents sea hasle et al 2009 warn about a series of environmental and safety challenges related to o g exploration in this area one of these challenges the risk of oil spills may also apply to goliat harsh environmental conditions such as low temperatures long periods of darkness and scarce onshore infrastructure represent operational challenges potentially increasing the frequency of accidents khan et al 2015b such events may lead to consequences for the environment and subsistence of economy activities moreover they may represent important economic and reputation losses kyaw and paltrinieri 2015 due to the increased costs of remedial action the media coverage and the possibility of a moratorium on petroleum activities in that area in these conditions environmental risk assessment is a critical issue the approach proposed in this analysis involves a computational advanced tool able to track the oil spreading on the ocean surface due to wind currents and diffusion processes 4 methodology 4 1 overview of the methodology the methodology described in the flowchart in fig 3 has been applied to the reference case of section 2 the rb methodology has been implemented and preliminary environmental analysis based on a risk screening matrix has been conducted on the evaluated frequency of oil spill to sea fig 3 4 2 dynamic risk assessment 4 2 1 improved rb the rb methodology paltrinieri and khan 2016 was extended in order to develop a dynamic risk assessment framework rb is based on the definition of relevant indicators for the real time monitoring of safety barrier performance contemplating technical elements and associated operational and organizational systems in this way the health of safety barriers is assessed and their probability of failure is evaluated further description of the method is reported elsewhere paltrinieri and hokstad 2015 paltrinieri and khan 2016 the rb is established as an iterative process with seven major steps summarized in table 1 major accident scenarios are typically gathered from the qra of the specific installation the major accident scenarios for a floating offshore installation such as the case study include process leaks ship collisions with visiting vessels well leaks blowout etc these events have a significant contribution to the major accident risk to personnel and or environment in order to identify relevant hazards step 1 defining the associated barrier functions step 3 and their relative importance step 4 various information sources are required and they must be collected and made available step 2 a single source of information is not able to provide the whole required information it is necessary to combine several different input such as the specific installation qra event and investigation reports barrier analyses and strategies various qualitative safety analyses results from interviews or discussion with expert and operational personnel real time information about barrier performances should be collected their availability varies based on their age type novelty of safety and automations systems the status of the barriers and of the barrier elements is assessed using specific indicators hence information that can be made automatically available for such elements represent relevant indicator candidates step 5 the most challenging step is establishing a risk model based on the logical relationship between the status of the barrier indicators and the risk level of an area step 6 the risk pictures are shown in an established visualization format step 7 by means of two diagrams a plot of risk over time highlighting the risk trend and the rb diagram which has a circular shape and where the traffic light analogy is adopted to show immediately and effectively changes in the risk level 4 2 2 safety barrier description in order to comply with the requirements of psa barriers must be established and maintained to handle the risk faced at any given time by preventing an undesirable incident from occurring or by limiting the consequences should such an incident occur psa 2013b according to the psa definition the barrier function bf is the task or role of a barrier examples include preventing leaks or ignition reducing fire loads ensuring acceptable evacuation and preventing hearing damage bow tie diagrams may be used to represent a sequential qualitative overview of the potential defined situation of hazard and accidents dshas defined by psa and initiating events ies including the bfs relevant to prevent and or mitigate them the target of interest is represented by the end consequences ecs bow tie diagrams were defined for each area of goliat fpso shown in fig 2 bow tie diagrams represent a basis for the execution of step 6 of the rb methodology aiming to provide a quantitative model to show risk variation over time due to the performance of safety barriers fig 4 shows an example concerning the goliat process area dshas ies and ecs and bfs are represented respectively by red and blue boxes in particular in the example shown in fig 4 bf1 aims at protecting the process module of the floating installation from potential dropped objects from crane operation bf2 prevents the occurrence of hydrocarbon release while bf3 is a mitigating barrier that limits and controls the size of the spill bf4 represents the task of ignition prevention and finally bf5 aims at preventing the escalation of the release to other areas of the installation each bf is organized into an articulated hierarchical structure graphically represented by means of a barrier tree shown in fig 5 the bf is decomposed into sub functions the lowest level in the barrier hierarchy is represented by barrier elements these are measures or solutions which play a part in realizing a bf and they may be classified according to psa as technical operational or organizational technical barrier elements may correspond with safety instrumented system sis a sis is composed of any combination of sensors logic solvers and final elements according to iec 61 511 standard internationa electrotechnical commission 2003 a sis implements a function which is intended to achieve or maintain a safe state for the process with respect to a specific hazardous event is defined as safety instrumented function sif suitable indicators are collected in order to assess the performance of technical operational and organizational barrier elements results of this monitoring process are visualized in a barrier status panel and will support critical decision making 4 2 3 definition of risk model the application of the rb methodology requires the definition of a specific risk model see table 2 such model is based on the logical relationship between the status of the barriers and the area risk level bow tie diagrams and related barrier trees represent the baseline for the modelling of the present analysis the aggregation rules defining the risk model are listed in table 2 which allowed for the analysis of o g facilities operating in sensitive areas frequencies of ies may be retrieved from several data sources such as the purple book by tno uijt de haag and ale 2005 api rp 581 standard american petroleum institute 2000 and norsok standard norsok 2008 and allow defining the baseline for the failure probabilities of the related bfs focusing on both risk to personnel and environmental risk allows assessing barrier performance for the most critical issues encountered in a sensitive area such as the barents sea relative importance of safety barriers may be evaluated to facilitate risk based selection of indicators sensitivity analysis may be performed on the barrier function bf j by assessing its birnbaum like measure i b b f j scarponi et al 2016 this represents the partial derivate of the risk measure r with respect to the parameter describing the barrier which in this case coincides with the failure probability of the bf fprob bf j 1 i b b f j t r t f p r o b b f j t thus generic risk at time t is defined as 2 r t r 0 i i b b f j t Î´ f p r o b b f j t r 0 Î´ r t where r 0 value of risk at a reference time 0 e g the time in which the qra is performed Î´ f p r o b b f j f p r o b b f j t f p r o b b f j t 0 a birnbaum like measure based on risk to personnel will presumably differ from a birnbaum like measure based on environmental risk for this reason both the evaluations should be performed for this case section 4 2 4 shows the technical features adopted in establishing the rb procedure results of the dynamic risk assessment are presented in section 5 the simulation performed in this study is referred to a sample period of five years 4 2 4 rb settings in the present section the features of the rb methodology and the settings used for the goliat case are described in detail the section presents the settings according to the different steps of the rb methodology 4 2 4 1 define major accident scenarios review relevant information sources and establish bfs and barrier systems steps 1 2 3 the collection of relevant information concerning major accident scenarios and the related safety system in place on goliat preventing or mitigating them step 1 3 table 1 results in specific bow tie diagrams according to the approach of the present work the contribution of safety barriers to the installation risk level is linked to a parameter in the qra qra parameter particularly in this case to the potential loss of life pll value and to the frequency of oil spill to sea 4 2 4 2 evaluate relative importance of the barrier systems step 4 a relative ranking was established in order identify the bfs defined in the bow tie diagrams which mostly affect the risk level in order to determine the most critical bfs sensitivity analyses were conducted both at bf and barrier element level according to the barrier structure described in fig 5 results obtained from sensitivity analyses considering safety devices fully impaired are shown in fig 6 the bf that mostly influences pll trend is prevent hc leak while the effect of safety barriers prevent hc leak from offloading hose during offloading operations and limit size of hc leak from offloading hose during offloading operations on the pll trend could be neglected even if these barriers are fully impaired instead the bf that mostly influence spill frequency are almost at the same manner prevent hc leak and prevent hydrocarbon leak from offloading hose during offloading operations the effect of safety barriers prevent ignition and prevent escalation to other equipment on the spill to sea frequency is negligible 4 2 4 3 establish barrier performance indicator step 5 information about the status of the barrier and barrier elements can be retrieved from various information systems each type of barrier element namely technical operational and organizational elements is considered in the rb analysis information concerning technical elements may be captured automatically in real time depending on the age of the installation data on operational and organizational elements are typically difficult to gather and manual input e g from audits and reviews is often required Ã¸ien et al 2011a 2011b the information concerning the technical elements include data gathered from the maintenance system as results from functional tests alarms condition monitoring systems on failed or degraded elements information about elements that are blocked or supressed from process control systems information about deviations temporary degradations and risk reducing measures findings and actions from inspection systems information related to operational and organizational barrier elements include for example the status on required courses and training for offshore personnel the current age of governing documents that describe e g the execution of the safety critical tasks results from scenario based simulator training each barrier element is described by a structure which includes technical operational and organizational measures the generic structure of a barrier is schematized in fig 7 a while fig 7b shows a specific example of barrier structure i e the emergency shut down esd valve which includes both technical and operational measures the rb focuses on indicators for the status of the barrier and barrier elements a suitable indicator is identified to show whether the measure can deliver the desired outcome or it has failed a different weight is preliminarily assigned to each measure according to zipf s law zipf 1949 adamic and huberman 2002 due to scarcity of data the model developed in the present analysis was tested on typical indicator trends depending on the type of barrier measure to which the indicator itself is related the simulation performed in this study is referred to a sample period of five years the indicators related to each barrier measure are checked every two months for a total of thirty checks in the defined period of interest technical indicators are simulated considering the well known bathtub curve model see ccps center of chemical process safety 2000 lees 1996 for more details while operational indicators as homographic function exemplified results including disturbances are shown in fig 8 the range in which the indicator values may vary is 1 6 where 1 represents the situation in which the measure works perfectly while 6 the worst scenario in which the measure is fully impaired it is worth noticing that the extreme values of the interval are not considered as credible scenarios in assessing the indicators trend 4 2 4 4 establish risk model based on barrier indicators step 6 the barrier element performances assessed through the indicators are input values to the risk model shown in table 2 barrier performances assessed by the indicators are translated in risk variations through the risk model and expressed in absolute terms through the pll 4 2 4 5 establish risk visualization format step 7 risk variations are shown in visualization formats easy to read and use these consist of a representation of risk over time and a rb diagram that applies the traffic light analogy results are shown in figs 10 and 11 in section 5 4 3 environmental impact assessment environmental risk estimation requires assessing both the severity and the frequency of hazardous events risk matrixes are convenient methods of ranking and presenting the results hse 2006 and are widely espoused approach to assess and analysing risk in o g industry due to their intuitive appeal and simplicity thomas et al 2013 in order to assess the environmental risk level associated with a defined scenario five severity classes and six frequency categories are defined according to risk matrix approach suggested in iso 17 776 2002 iso 2002 the matrix adopted in this study is shown in fig 9 and allowed defining tolerability criteria dedicated to offshore o g installations in sensitive areas three risk matrix regions identify the limits of risk tolerability according to the aramis accidental risk assessment methodology for industries research project andersen et al 2004 the green area negligible effects zone represents the continuous improvement region the risk level is broadly acceptable and generic control measures are required aimed at avoiding deterioration the yellow area medium effects zone represents the risk reduction measures region the risk level can be tolerable only once a structured review of risk reduction measures has been carried out the red area high effects zone represents the intolerable risk region the risk level is not acceptable and risk control measures are required to move the risk figures to the previous regions risk matrixes are easy to use and do not require extensive training however they suffer from limitations due to lack of standardization focusing only on the identified hazardous event and analysing them one by one rather than in accumulation rausand 2011 these issues cannot be overcome because they are inherent in the risk matrix structure thomas et al 2013 a critical issue to perform the qra is the definition of quantitative ranges for consequences and frequencies in the matrix the ranking is usually based on arbitrary values set by company standards since unified references to quantify risk matrixes are lacking thomas et al 2013 five classes of consequences in terms of effects on the environment are defined as shown in fig 9 the severity class was assigned to each scenario according to the released oil inventory m3 and impact area km2 considering that the installation is located in an environmental sensitive area and then more stringent criteria should be applied each severity class is defined considering a range of area involved in the spill and of released oil inventory since these range of data are sensitive the present analysis shows the results ranked in normalized classes according to aramis project andersen et al 2004 six classes are then defined for frequency based on expert judgement in fig 9 the screening matrix applied in the preliminary environmental risk assessment is shown in the present analysis hydrocarbon spilt to sea is considered to cause severe environmental impact because of the location of the reference facility according to the bow tie analysis described in fig 4 environmental damage may be caused by both process leaks and leaks from offloading station analysing the two contributions the frequency of occurrence of a release from the offloading station is one order of magnitude lower than the one from the process deck furthermore the analysis of the bow tie diagram considers generic releases from the offloading station but as for environmental risk assessment the consequences have to be estimated on the basis of quantitative data the approach is to consider random ruptures of the offloading hose see fig 2 and applying to these standard release categories random ruptures may be devoted to thermal stress corrosion vibrations etc and are normally associated with standard release categories pitblado et al 1990 spouge 2005 for this purpose the api rp 581 american petroleum institute 2000 random rupture frequency assessment was performed according to api 581 four rupture categories were considered based on the release equivalent diameter i e 0 25 6 35 mm 1 25 4 mm 4 101 6 mm and full bore where the release diameter is taken equal to the pipe diameter for each of these rupture categories two different release time are considered depending on if the scenarios are mitigated or not for big rupture s5 and s6 a release time of 600 s is not considered as credible according to api 581 the scenarios considered in the present analysis are summarized in table 3 while the spill characterization is reported in table 4 to each category an expected frequency was associated and consequence assessment of potential spills was carried out source term was estimated through conventional integral models van den bosh and weterings 2005 while the dynamic development of contaminated area was simulated trough the adoption of the modelling tool gnome general noaa operational modelling environment developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa zelenke et al 2012 gnome is a eulerian lagrangian model extensively applied in the framework of oil spill impact assessment studies which was previously verified and validated gnome simulates the particle trajectories only on the ocean surface cheng et al 2011 marta almeida et al 2013 farzingohar et al 2011 and is written using the latest object oriented programming methodologies in the c programming language beegle krause 2001 the oil spills are modelled as lagrangian elements les advected with the surface eulerian current velocity field and the diffusion is simulated as a random walk marta almeida et al 2013 spilled substances are modelled as point masses namely the les further information about models implemented in gnome are available in technical documentation zelenke et al 2012 provided by noaa noaa has developed gnome to investigate the effects of different pollutants and environmental condition on trajectory results cheng et al 2011 gnome supports the noaa national ocean service nos office of response and restoration or r emergency response division erd standard for best guess and minimum regret trajectories by providing information about where the spill is most likely to go namely best guess solution and the uncertainty bound namely minimum regret solution compared with other models the gnome model can be used anywhere in the world and requires fewer input parameters than most other models cheng et al 2011 the details of the gnome simulations performed for the present case study are collected and described in the dedicated section 4 3 1 4 3 1 gnome simulation setup gnome http response restoration noaa gov provides the capability of simulating the behaviour of a spilled amount of oil under different weather conditions the gnome version applied in the simulations of this study is the 1 3 9 more details related to the code may be found in the technical documentation zelenke et al 2012 provided by noaa hereby the key elements supporting the evaluation of the case study are discussed each release scenario was located at goliat coordinate i e 71 30 north and 22 30 east windage parameters were kept as default settings according to zelenke et al 2012 the simulations performed in the present studies refer to a sample period adopting real data of march 2016 each simulation was started at 8 00 a m of march 9th 2016 and was run for 108 h 4 days and 12 h this period was selected for demonstration purposes of the present methodology other meteorological data when available may as well be implemented in the software the impact assessment results are shown in section 5 2 during each simulation the minimum regret solution is calculated the beaching algorithm include the prevent land jumping box 4 3 1 1 spill characterization spilled substances are modelled as point masses called lagrangian elements les in order that the quality of the statistics do not suffer it is best to use at least 1000 les the present analysis considers 1000 les to each point mass the location age and status is assigned over time the simulation runs the computational time step was set to 15 min as indicated in zelenke et al 2012 the movement of the les is either to remain on the water to evaporate to be beached to be weathered and disappear or to travel out of the modelling space domain the evaporation process is modelled with a simplified algorithm that does not take into account of temperature variation and strong wind effect on the evaporation simplified assumptions are adopted in order to simulate the adhesiveness of the oil to the shoreline in particular an empirical parameter namely the half life was adopted in the simulations the half life is a function of substrate porosity the presence or the absence of vegetation the inherent stickiness of the oil and other physical properties and processes of the environment as well the refloat half life is set as 1 h zelenke et al 2012 the source term quantified through integral models lees 1996 van den bosh and weterings 2005 was implemented in gnome as an oil spill point source to set this type of spill it is necessary to provide information including name of the spill location of the spill pollutant type amount released release start and stop dates and times the characterization of the spill adopted in the simulations of the present analysis is shown in table 7 the spill name the amount and the release times change in the different simulations the summary of the simulations performed is reported in table 3 4 3 1 2 maps and movers the settings related to map and movers allow defining the region of interest for the oil spill impact assessment study and the related movers e g wind currents tides etc which allow promoting the oil spread and transport table 5 summarize the procedure and data adopted to characterize the region of interest in gnome simulations more details on the parameters and models adopted in gnome are reported elsewhere zelenke et al 2012 4 3 1 3 best estimate and minimum regret trajectories two different trajectory pictures are obtained in each gnome simulation as shown in fig 12 in section 5 a best guess and a minimum regret trajectory the best guess trajectory represents the most likely movement path of the spill whereas the minimum regret trajectory provides an uncertainty bound this second solution allows the model to predict other possible trajectories that are less likely to occur but which may have higher associated risks the minimum regret trajectory gives information about areas that could be impacted if for example the wind blows from somewhat different direction than the one specified or if the currents in the area flow somewhat faster or slower than expected all of the movers have default uncertainty parameters diffusion currents winds and the component mover zelenke et al 2012 forecast wind and currents are usually not accurate to generate trajectories within 1 5 km of accuracy after 48 h therefore gnome supports user specified uncertainty parameters which are set according to the uncertainty in the input data the currents and wind dataset and the diffusion coefficient mentioned in table 5 have parameters for start time and duration of the uncertainty which is treated according to the scheme shown in table 6 the start time in the model run indicates the time at which the winds and currents forecast starts the duration indicates how long an le will keep the given uncertainty value before having it randomly reset since the reference case does not deal with the modelling of large object drift default setting were kept for duration and uncertainty parameters as recommended in zelenke et al 2012 5 results and discussion results are described in the following sections it is necessary to stress that every finding is derived from theoretical simulations performed during the development of this research 5 1 dynamic risk assessment results of dynamic risk assessment are shown in fig 10 according to the rb established visualization format table 1 human and environmental risks were respectively assessed and expressed as pll fig 10a and frequency of oil spill to sea fig 10b pll is a widely used risk metric describing the expected value of human fatalities per year johansen and rausand 2014 due to scarcity of data the model was tested on simulated indicator trends in order to evaluate its response as shown in fig 10 the trend over time of the two risk indexes decreases in the first months of the performed five year simulation after the first months the risk indexes vary around an average value due to simulated deviations of indicators fig 11 shows an example of rb diagram indicating the risk level worst condition thus associated with the maximum pll value 5 2 environmental impact assessment fig 12 show the results obtained through the application of gnome to scenario s5 see table 3 with the settings described in section 4 3 1 the figure shows the potential impact of the oil spill the movers wind currents and other factors affecting the behaviour of spilled oil are represented by arrows which indicate direction and intensity of the vectors that promote the transport of oil during the simulated period the black dots represent the best guess solution while the red dots show the uncertainty bound namely minimum regret solution fig 12 a shows the oil spreading in the first few hours after the spill the physical and chemical characteristics of petroleum change almost immediately when spilled in the marine environment due to oil weathering processes evans et al 2002 in the first hours the slick is fairly compact and a small percentage of oil spilled is evaporated the oil spread area is extended for more than 250 km2 advancing in time the oil slick expands due to ocean currents wind effects and diffusion processes as shown in fig 12 panels b c and d the slick moves away from the release source meanwhile evaporates affecting a larger impact area more than 450 km2 the results of the environmental risk assessment using the screening matrix are shown in table 7 large spills may lead to intermediate risk values due to the severe consequences shown in fig 12 therefore monitoring of environmental safety barriers is of crucial importance to control risk at acceptable levels oil spill preparedness in the region may be improved through implementation of increased measures as remote sensing and detection offshore helicopter stand by and supply vessel and specialized operational units for the coastal and shore zone holand 2012 ipieca and iogp 2013 furthermore a system is in place for frequent status monitoring of the hose enabling it to be inspected in a variety of ways during loading operations each time the hose is reeled in its entire length is scanned by a video camera and light system ensuring the safety of operations bjornbom 2011 5 3 discussion the study is an example of integrated evaluation of risk for operators and environment associated with installations in sensitive areas and harsh environment the rb application allowed demonstrating that capturing real time information on the most critical safety barriers may be translated into the variation of the overall risk level in this way risk may be periodically evaluated by analysing the barrier conditions supporting decision making and eventually improvements actions however the methodology also resulted in some limitations which may be object of further development since the rb is strongly based on the periodical update of qra parameters the preliminary step identification of reference qra parameters is of utmost importance and it affects the overall risk evaluation process on one side incorporating a large number of parameters and the correspondent monitoring indicators induces higher data collection costs on the other side neglecting relevant parameters may induce to underestimating risk therefore despite the preliminary rb step is based on the analysis qra documentation which may be considered fixed and well defined assumptions and approximations should be carefully and knowingly carried out similar considerations may be extended to the selection of indicators since they strongly affect the periodical variation of qra parameters and the final risk picture it is also worth mentioning that if the reference qra is periodically updated the effect on risk of each indicator should be remodelled in order to limit costs and efforts related to data gathering and monitoring without losing a representative risk evaluation a sensitivity analysis was performed to drive the selection of the most critical bfs and barrier elements section 4 2 4 shows the details of the sensitivity analyses performed where it is evidenced how the most critical elements are shared among multiple critical bfs such as the emergency shut down system the monitoring of critical safety barriers provides more information about the risk evolution rather than the indiscriminate measuring of every device performance in that perspective the rb aggregation rules described in table 2 represent a more sophisticated tool for barrier monitoring than the simple collection of information for each single barrier element in fact the mere collection of data about the status of the components does not support the operator in taking risk oriented decisions and moreover it may be a source of underestimation and misperception of the actual risk level due to computational reason the rb simulation of this study considers a sample amount of critical barrier elements this explains the limited variations in the pll and in the frequency of spilt oil respectively shown in fig 10a and b firstly it is worth noticing that the reference installation features several thousands of barrier elements the performance variations of many of them would not affect the risk performance in a substantial way in fact as shown in fig 11 the risk level of the installation is not changing during the simulation low risk however as the elements considered are addressed as critical the risk variations shown in fig 10 are meaningful the risk profile changes due to performance variation of a small set of critical barrier elements another limitation of the rb technique concerns the use of linear functions to measure risk paltrinieri et al 2014 when the contribution from each indicator is taken into account using a weighted sum two issues are neglected the first is that the aggregation of indicator scores may not correspond to the complete risk picture associated with a scenario since the effect of having several failed barriers features a higher impact than simply summing the individual effects on the basis of defence in depth principle iaea international atomic energy agency 1996 this effect may adopt an exponential trend hauge et al 2015 the second issue addresses the combinations of degraded states and condition which result more dangerous than others therefore further research developments may be addressed at including a dedicated approach to develop indicators which reflect the issue of common cause failure such as bayesian approaches khakzad et al 2013a b the results of the rb simulation have been validated using the reality check approach suggested by suokas 1985 this method investigates the risk analysis approach in term of quality of its hazard identification the backbone of the qra it is based on the comparison with occurred accidents suokas 1988 tested the effectiveness of different accident identification techniques comparing the output of these processes with the insights given from accident descriptions the validation of the rb approach proposed in this work follows the insights suggested by goerlandt et al 2017 the rb technique is based on a bow tie approach different contributors to the accident in that case the hc release are identified by hazard and operability hazop studies and by reviewing past accidents in the petroleum offshore industry according to the comparison analysis performed by suokas 1988 hazop technique is the most effective in identifying accidents and their contributors appropriate barriers are considered and addressed in the bow tie analysis a series of sensitivity analyses has been performed in order to assess the criticality of the different barrier elements this showed that the esd is the most critical barrier system in agreement with the results of different accident investigations and reports pearson 1992 psa 2017 2015 moreover it shows that the rb risk model correctly reflects the effect of esd valve performance on the accident risk the analysis of the safety issues through rb allowed for integration with the conventional procedures for oil spill risk assessment see section 3 2 the results shown in section 5 2 clearly show the importance of a deeper investigation of safety barriers performance in order to prevent oil spill scenarios featuring large impact and thus high risk level the main limitation of oil spill frequency evaluation for the environmental risk assessment is related to the selection of conservative standard values american petroleum institute 2000 leak frequency tailorization bagster and pitblado 1991 pitblado et al 2011 and its periodical update may be an effective approach in order to integrate the operational organizational and technical aspects affecting the likelihood of oil spill and to update the environmental risk level landucci and paltrinieri 2016 2015 dynamic leak frequency evaluation may be also achieved through advanced approaches such as dynamic fault trees dugan et al 1992 manno et al 2012 merle et al 2016 markov chain models for the life cycle analysis howard 1971 limnios and oprisan 2001 yevkin 2016 and weibull failure analysis hall and strutt 2003 khakzad et al 2012 moreover complex system modelling involving the effect of safety barriers alarms backups redundancy of components interlocks etc may be also based on advanced tools such as bayesian networks kalantarnia et al 2009b khakzad et al 2013a b or montecarlo simulation chiacchio et al 2016 das and samuel 2014 noh et al 2014 savage et al 2013 concerning the limitations of consequence evaluation it is worth mentioning that the impact of oil spill was simulated through gnome imposing predefined meteorological conditions lasting for 108 h thus results are specific for the wind and ocean currents conditions implemented which can be also the result of data averaged over prolonged period of observation cheng et al 2011 marta almeida et al 2013 ventikos and psaraftis 2004 nevertheless the development of a tool able to capture and forecast the comprehensive behaviour of movers in the region of interest was out of the scope of the present study moreover despite the effect of the shut down system intervention was accounted for determining of oil spilt quantitates the possible effect of mitigation barriers was not included in the consequence assessment thus the present study may provide support to the situation in which clean up techniques are performed in this way removing oil from water may be facilitated by monitoring where the spill moves and predicting potential impact on sensitive areas 6 conclusions the present work illustrates the development an innovative approach for the integrated safety and environmental risk assessment for the analysis of offshore o g plants in sensitive areas such as the first oil production platform in the barents sea safety assessment was conducted by applying a novel tool for dynamic risk assessment the rb methodology which allowed to relate the risk level of the installation to the performance of critical safety barriers environmental risk assessment has been conducted using the risk matrix approach evaluating both frequency of crude oil spill occurrence and severity the latter has been assessed using the general noaa operational modelling environment gnome software the analysis of the case study evidenced the potentialities of the present method that relies on advanced methods for safety assessment of o g facilities operating in sensitive areas in which environmental risk assessment is integrated the introduction of periodic revision and time update of relevant indicators may be adopted to drive identification of critical safety issues in a facility integrating

23647,oil and gas installations in sensitive areas with harsh environmental conditions may require improved risk management intensified monitoring assessment and mitigation of risk on a quasi real time basis would advantage not only the operators but also the surrounding environment a systematic tool for continuous quantitative evaluation of safety and environmental issues is still lacking the present work introduces a novel methodology for the integrated assessment of human and environmental risk a dynamic perspective is adopted to systematically consider the performance of safety barriers environmental risk is further investigated by using the risk matrix approach which evaluates both frequency and severity of oil spill the methodology is applied to the case of a real oil platform in the barents sea a set of simulations on how the platform is conducted demonstrated that the proposed method may be suitable for risk analysis in such critical conditions it also showed that dynamic risk assessment may allow identifying critical safety barrier elements whose correct performance needs to be prioritized to control risk this is also supported by environmental risk assessment showing that further safety measures may be considered for biological and environmental conservation keywords risk barometer oil spill risk assessment safety barriers harsh environment sensitive areas 1 introduction the oil and gas o g industry is focusing its attention north in the arctic and sub arctic regions as they represent promising production sources barabadi et al 2015 bercha et al 2003 gao et al 2010 musharraf et al 2013 song et al 2016 according to the united states geological survey usgs world petroleum assessment 2000 usgs world assessment team 2000 the sum of the mean estimates for each province indicates that about 13 of the mean estimated global undiscovered oil resource and about 30 of the gas one may be contained in the arctic approximately 84 of such sources is expected to be found in offshore areas bird et al 2008 the arctic area presents significant technical logistical and safety challenges regarding construction and operation including a lack of detailed standard optimization with respect to winterization and data scarcity khan et al 2015a the primary factors that make activities in the arctic peculiar are the presence of ice in many different forms and snow as well as a seasonal darkness such harsh climate is associated with remoteness long distances from customer and supplier s markets moreover rich and important ecosystems were identified in the arctic and sub arctic regions barabadi et al 2015 gao et al 2010 these factors have a considerable influence on the choice of design as well as operations and maintenance barabadi et al 2015 operability may be critical maintenance may be ineffective and components may deteriorate relatively quickly due to severe conditions barabadi et al 2015 gao et al 2010 landucci et al 2017 the norwegian arctic shelf is unique in this respect due to the gulf stream ocean currents ice is relatively less present and access to infrastructure may be facilitated norheim 2010 on the other hand particular attention must be focused on the environment of such areas recent major accidents increased public concern on o g for instance the crude oil spill accidentally released in 2004 from the terra nova fpso floating production storage and offloading unit in newfoundland canada affected cape st mary s ecological reserve and caused the death of thousands seabirds wilhelm et al 2007 moreover the deepwater horizon oil spill occurred in 2010 in the gulf of mexico and described as the worst environmental disaster in the united states released about 0 78 mm3 of crude oil and caused extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats bp 2010 deepwater horizon study group 2011 therefore the need for improved safety and environmental assessment in this sensitive area claims for advanced tools for risk estimation and evaluation despite the fact that several methods are available for personnel risk evaluation lees 1996 paltrinieri and khan 2016 and for environmental risk assessment epa 1998 guo 2017 valdor et al 2015 integrating the peculiar aspects of both frameworks is a challenging task and requires research developments moreover the analysis and management of safety barriers 1 1 according to sklet 2006 a safety barrier is a physical or non physical mean planned to prevent control or mitigate undesired events or accidents may not be systematically undertaken despite being requested by local competent authorities such as in the case of the norwegian petroleum safety authority psa requirements psa 2013a the present study is aimed at providing a methodology for the integrated safety and environmental assessment dedicated to offshore o g facilities located in sensitive areas firstly a methodology for dynamic risk assessment the risk barometer rb paltrinieri and khan 2016 was adapted in order to develop a barrier management model the aim was to investigate how barrier performance might influence the overall level of risk during the lifecycle of the facility considering specific risk worsening elements induced by harsh environment secondarily environmental risk assessment was performed using an approach based on simulation of oil spill evolution this is aimed at the verification of safety barriers effectiveness for offshore facilities located in sensitive areas the methodology was applied to a real reference case study in the goliat oil field norway which represents a relevant example of innovative facility operating offshore in the arctic sensitive region information about goliat are gathered exclusively from public sources and the results obtained are derived from theoretical simulations 2 definition of the reference case study 2 1 characteristics of the oil field the goliat field is the first oil field to be developed in the barents sea eni norge 2015a it is located 85 km northwest of hammerfest north of russia and norway fig 1 the production license is owned by eni norge with 65 and by statoil with 35 goliat field has two separate main reservoirs kobbe and realgrunnen characterized by low pressure the recoverable reserves amount to 174 million barrels 28 mm3 the field is expected to be in production for fifteen years but field life may be extended with new discoveries compared to the neighbour arctic sea the barents sea is relatively shallow and free from ice all through the year due to warm gulf stream currents from the north atlantic and high salt level average ocean depth in the area is between 200 and 300 m larsen et al 2004 goliat field water depth varies from 325 to 390 m eni norge 2015b the barents sea and the kara sea belong to one of the marine ecoregions included in the world wide fund for nature wwf global 200 olson and dinerstein 2002 wwf biologists defined the norwegian coast fig 1 as a very high priority area for maintenance of biodiversity based on the following criteria larsen et al 2004 naturalness representativeness high biological diversity high productivity ecological significance for species source area for essential ecological processes or life support systems uniqueness and sensitivity the ecoregion supports abundant fish stocks as well as high concentration of nesting seabirds and a diverse community of sea mammals larsen et al 2004 2 2 characteristics of the installation goliat installation is a circular geostationary fpso unit it is the largest and most complex of its kind and it was specifically designed to ensure safe and reliable production in the harsh conditions of the barents sea eni norge 2016 it is possible to identify seven main areas on the fpso as schematized in fig 2 adapted from rekdal and hansen 2015 production is facilitated by subsea system consisting of 22 wells 12 production wells 7 water injectors and 3 gas injectors the extracted crude oil is processed stabilized stored and then directly offloaded from the fpso to shuttle tankers through the offloading station bjornbom 2011 the offloading system is one of the safest and most reliable offloading system ever fabricated for offshore operations the distance between the shuttle tanker and the platform is greater than in similar installations and video cameras and a light system are in place for frequent status monitoring of the offloading hose eni norge 2015a 3 improved safety and environmental assessment for sensitive areas 3 1 need for dynamic risk assessment quantitative risk assessment qra in the framework of o g upstream operations is based on consolidated procedures and methods crawley 1999 crawley and grant 1997 iso international standardization organization 2009 khan et al 2002 nevertheless the challenges associated with the operation in harsh and sensitive environment claim for more advanced tools for risk estimation and evaluation in particular operational and organizational factors often may affect risk in terms of likelihood of undesired failure ale et al 2014 attwood et al 2006 griffin et al 2014 landucci and paltrinieri 2016 vinnem et al 2012 training workload motivation to safety culture procedures are aspects that may be disregarded by conventional qra techniques which are traditionally focusing on technical aspects paltrinieri and khan 2016 moreover periodic evaluation and update of the system risk picture is not commonly performed static risk estimation in a frozen instant of the system life represents the basis on which everyday operations are planned without capturing customary risk fluctuations during the lifecycle of a production plant yet pole et al 2009 kalantarnia et al 2009 paltrinieri et al 2014 pasman and reniers 2014 pitblado et al 2011 international standards e g iso 31 000 on risk management iso international standardization organization 2009 and norsok z 013 on risk and emergency preparedness analysis norsok standards 2001 and relevant regulations e g eu seveso directives on the control of major accident hazards involving dangerous substances european commission 2012 suggest updates of risk analysis only in conjunction with major changes in the plant organization or every five years falck et al 2015 2000 share such concern and affirm that risk assessment performed for the design phase of a plant is not suitable for the following operation phases therefore real time data and periodical risk evaluation may be considered as a key improvement to allow for effective decision making support a tool translating system data into the quasi real time risk picture is required new techniques of dynamic risk assessment are necessary to overcome qra staticity by considering the process behaviour khakzad et al 2016 paltrinieri et al 2016 scarponi et al 2016 scarponi and paltrinieri 2016 in the present work the rb methodology paltrinieri et al 2016 scarponi et al 2016 represents a preliminary response to this need and was chosen to support the dynamic risk evaluation for the analysis of the reference case described in section 2 3 2 need for advanced environmental assessment in the marine environment it is estimated that about 14 million barrels 2 2 mm3 of oil are released in the sea annually about 18 of this comes from refineries offshore operations and tanker activities ivshina et al 2015 the average number of severe oil spills during 2010s to date in particular larger than 800 m3 according to the international tanker owner pollution federation itopf 2016 is about 7 of the total oil spills released in the 1970s itopf 2016 this reduction is due to the combined efforts of the oil industry and government to improve safety and pollution prevention itopf 2016 nevertheless there are very limited research efforts in developing effective and integrated decision making frameworks and systems to support oil spill response particularly in cold and harsh environment li et al 2016 mccoy and salerno 2010 walker et al 1994 1995 the environmental impact of a spill depends on a large number of parameters such as its size and type of released substance itopf 2013 this work refers only to petroleum spill such as kerosene gasoline and crude oil the location at which the oil spill occurs has also a fundamental importance as the severity depends on the ambient conditions and the sensitivity of the affected organisms and their habitats to the oil itopf 2013 spills in sensitive areas have serious biological impact on vegetation birds and mammals duke 2016 bejarano and michel 2016 therefore particular attention should be paid to environmental issues concerning an installation in the barents sea hasle et al 2009 warn about a series of environmental and safety challenges related to o g exploration in this area one of these challenges the risk of oil spills may also apply to goliat harsh environmental conditions such as low temperatures long periods of darkness and scarce onshore infrastructure represent operational challenges potentially increasing the frequency of accidents khan et al 2015b such events may lead to consequences for the environment and subsistence of economy activities moreover they may represent important economic and reputation losses kyaw and paltrinieri 2015 due to the increased costs of remedial action the media coverage and the possibility of a moratorium on petroleum activities in that area in these conditions environmental risk assessment is a critical issue the approach proposed in this analysis involves a computational advanced tool able to track the oil spreading on the ocean surface due to wind currents and diffusion processes 4 methodology 4 1 overview of the methodology the methodology described in the flowchart in fig 3 has been applied to the reference case of section 2 the rb methodology has been implemented and preliminary environmental analysis based on a risk screening matrix has been conducted on the evaluated frequency of oil spill to sea fig 3 4 2 dynamic risk assessment 4 2 1 improved rb the rb methodology paltrinieri and khan 2016 was extended in order to develop a dynamic risk assessment framework rb is based on the definition of relevant indicators for the real time monitoring of safety barrier performance contemplating technical elements and associated operational and organizational systems in this way the health of safety barriers is assessed and their probability of failure is evaluated further description of the method is reported elsewhere paltrinieri and hokstad 2015 paltrinieri and khan 2016 the rb is established as an iterative process with seven major steps summarized in table 1 major accident scenarios are typically gathered from the qra of the specific installation the major accident scenarios for a floating offshore installation such as the case study include process leaks ship collisions with visiting vessels well leaks blowout etc these events have a significant contribution to the major accident risk to personnel and or environment in order to identify relevant hazards step 1 defining the associated barrier functions step 3 and their relative importance step 4 various information sources are required and they must be collected and made available step 2 a single source of information is not able to provide the whole required information it is necessary to combine several different input such as the specific installation qra event and investigation reports barrier analyses and strategies various qualitative safety analyses results from interviews or discussion with expert and operational personnel real time information about barrier performances should be collected their availability varies based on their age type novelty of safety and automations systems the status of the barriers and of the barrier elements is assessed using specific indicators hence information that can be made automatically available for such elements represent relevant indicator candidates step 5 the most challenging step is establishing a risk model based on the logical relationship between the status of the barrier indicators and the risk level of an area step 6 the risk pictures are shown in an established visualization format step 7 by means of two diagrams a plot of risk over time highlighting the risk trend and the rb diagram which has a circular shape and where the traffic light analogy is adopted to show immediately and effectively changes in the risk level 4 2 2 safety barrier description in order to comply with the requirements of psa barriers must be established and maintained to handle the risk faced at any given time by preventing an undesirable incident from occurring or by limiting the consequences should such an incident occur psa 2013b according to the psa definition the barrier function bf is the task or role of a barrier examples include preventing leaks or ignition reducing fire loads ensuring acceptable evacuation and preventing hearing damage bow tie diagrams may be used to represent a sequential qualitative overview of the potential defined situation of hazard and accidents dshas defined by psa and initiating events ies including the bfs relevant to prevent and or mitigate them the target of interest is represented by the end consequences ecs bow tie diagrams were defined for each area of goliat fpso shown in fig 2 bow tie diagrams represent a basis for the execution of step 6 of the rb methodology aiming to provide a quantitative model to show risk variation over time due to the performance of safety barriers fig 4 shows an example concerning the goliat process area dshas ies and ecs and bfs are represented respectively by red and blue boxes in particular in the example shown in fig 4 bf1 aims at protecting the process module of the floating installation from potential dropped objects from crane operation bf2 prevents the occurrence of hydrocarbon release while bf3 is a mitigating barrier that limits and controls the size of the spill bf4 represents the task of ignition prevention and finally bf5 aims at preventing the escalation of the release to other areas of the installation each bf is organized into an articulated hierarchical structure graphically represented by means of a barrier tree shown in fig 5 the bf is decomposed into sub functions the lowest level in the barrier hierarchy is represented by barrier elements these are measures or solutions which play a part in realizing a bf and they may be classified according to psa as technical operational or organizational technical barrier elements may correspond with safety instrumented system sis a sis is composed of any combination of sensors logic solvers and final elements according to iec 61 511 standard internationa electrotechnical commission 2003 a sis implements a function which is intended to achieve or maintain a safe state for the process with respect to a specific hazardous event is defined as safety instrumented function sif suitable indicators are collected in order to assess the performance of technical operational and organizational barrier elements results of this monitoring process are visualized in a barrier status panel and will support critical decision making 4 2 3 definition of risk model the application of the rb methodology requires the definition of a specific risk model see table 2 such model is based on the logical relationship between the status of the barriers and the area risk level bow tie diagrams and related barrier trees represent the baseline for the modelling of the present analysis the aggregation rules defining the risk model are listed in table 2 which allowed for the analysis of o g facilities operating in sensitive areas frequencies of ies may be retrieved from several data sources such as the purple book by tno uijt de haag and ale 2005 api rp 581 standard american petroleum institute 2000 and norsok standard norsok 2008 and allow defining the baseline for the failure probabilities of the related bfs focusing on both risk to personnel and environmental risk allows assessing barrier performance for the most critical issues encountered in a sensitive area such as the barents sea relative importance of safety barriers may be evaluated to facilitate risk based selection of indicators sensitivity analysis may be performed on the barrier function bf j by assessing its birnbaum like measure i b b f j scarponi et al 2016 this represents the partial derivate of the risk measure r with respect to the parameter describing the barrier which in this case coincides with the failure probability of the bf fprob bf j 1 i b b f j t r t f p r o b b f j t thus generic risk at time t is defined as 2 r t r 0 i i b b f j t Î´ f p r o b b f j t r 0 Î´ r t where r 0 value of risk at a reference time 0 e g the time in which the qra is performed Î´ f p r o b b f j f p r o b b f j t f p r o b b f j t 0 a birnbaum like measure based on risk to personnel will presumably differ from a birnbaum like measure based on environmental risk for this reason both the evaluations should be performed for this case section 4 2 4 shows the technical features adopted in establishing the rb procedure results of the dynamic risk assessment are presented in section 5 the simulation performed in this study is referred to a sample period of five years 4 2 4 rb settings in the present section the features of the rb methodology and the settings used for the goliat case are described in detail the section presents the settings according to the different steps of the rb methodology 4 2 4 1 define major accident scenarios review relevant information sources and establish bfs and barrier systems steps 1 2 3 the collection of relevant information concerning major accident scenarios and the related safety system in place on goliat preventing or mitigating them step 1 3 table 1 results in specific bow tie diagrams according to the approach of the present work the contribution of safety barriers to the installation risk level is linked to a parameter in the qra qra parameter particularly in this case to the potential loss of life pll value and to the frequency of oil spill to sea 4 2 4 2 evaluate relative importance of the barrier systems step 4 a relative ranking was established in order identify the bfs defined in the bow tie diagrams which mostly affect the risk level in order to determine the most critical bfs sensitivity analyses were conducted both at bf and barrier element level according to the barrier structure described in fig 5 results obtained from sensitivity analyses considering safety devices fully impaired are shown in fig 6 the bf that mostly influences pll trend is prevent hc leak while the effect of safety barriers prevent hc leak from offloading hose during offloading operations and limit size of hc leak from offloading hose during offloading operations on the pll trend could be neglected even if these barriers are fully impaired instead the bf that mostly influence spill frequency are almost at the same manner prevent hc leak and prevent hydrocarbon leak from offloading hose during offloading operations the effect of safety barriers prevent ignition and prevent escalation to other equipment on the spill to sea frequency is negligible 4 2 4 3 establish barrier performance indicator step 5 information about the status of the barrier and barrier elements can be retrieved from various information systems each type of barrier element namely technical operational and organizational elements is considered in the rb analysis information concerning technical elements may be captured automatically in real time depending on the age of the installation data on operational and organizational elements are typically difficult to gather and manual input e g from audits and reviews is often required Ã¸ien et al 2011a 2011b the information concerning the technical elements include data gathered from the maintenance system as results from functional tests alarms condition monitoring systems on failed or degraded elements information about elements that are blocked or supressed from process control systems information about deviations temporary degradations and risk reducing measures findings and actions from inspection systems information related to operational and organizational barrier elements include for example the status on required courses and training for offshore personnel the current age of governing documents that describe e g the execution of the safety critical tasks results from scenario based simulator training each barrier element is described by a structure which includes technical operational and organizational measures the generic structure of a barrier is schematized in fig 7 a while fig 7b shows a specific example of barrier structure i e the emergency shut down esd valve which includes both technical and operational measures the rb focuses on indicators for the status of the barrier and barrier elements a suitable indicator is identified to show whether the measure can deliver the desired outcome or it has failed a different weight is preliminarily assigned to each measure according to zipf s law zipf 1949 adamic and huberman 2002 due to scarcity of data the model developed in the present analysis was tested on typical indicator trends depending on the type of barrier measure to which the indicator itself is related the simulation performed in this study is referred to a sample period of five years the indicators related to each barrier measure are checked every two months for a total of thirty checks in the defined period of interest technical indicators are simulated considering the well known bathtub curve model see ccps center of chemical process safety 2000 lees 1996 for more details while operational indicators as homographic function exemplified results including disturbances are shown in fig 8 the range in which the indicator values may vary is 1 6 where 1 represents the situation in which the measure works perfectly while 6 the worst scenario in which the measure is fully impaired it is worth noticing that the extreme values of the interval are not considered as credible scenarios in assessing the indicators trend 4 2 4 4 establish risk model based on barrier indicators step 6 the barrier element performances assessed through the indicators are input values to the risk model shown in table 2 barrier performances assessed by the indicators are translated in risk variations through the risk model and expressed in absolute terms through the pll 4 2 4 5 establish risk visualization format step 7 risk variations are shown in visualization formats easy to read and use these consist of a representation of risk over time and a rb diagram that applies the traffic light analogy results are shown in figs 10 and 11 in section 5 4 3 environmental impact assessment environmental risk estimation requires assessing both the severity and the frequency of hazardous events risk matrixes are convenient methods of ranking and presenting the results hse 2006 and are widely espoused approach to assess and analysing risk in o g industry due to their intuitive appeal and simplicity thomas et al 2013 in order to assess the environmental risk level associated with a defined scenario five severity classes and six frequency categories are defined according to risk matrix approach suggested in iso 17 776 2002 iso 2002 the matrix adopted in this study is shown in fig 9 and allowed defining tolerability criteria dedicated to offshore o g installations in sensitive areas three risk matrix regions identify the limits of risk tolerability according to the aramis accidental risk assessment methodology for industries research project andersen et al 2004 the green area negligible effects zone represents the continuous improvement region the risk level is broadly acceptable and generic control measures are required aimed at avoiding deterioration the yellow area medium effects zone represents the risk reduction measures region the risk level can be tolerable only once a structured review of risk reduction measures has been carried out the red area high effects zone represents the intolerable risk region the risk level is not acceptable and risk control measures are required to move the risk figures to the previous regions risk matrixes are easy to use and do not require extensive training however they suffer from limitations due to lack of standardization focusing only on the identified hazardous event and analysing them one by one rather than in accumulation rausand 2011 these issues cannot be overcome because they are inherent in the risk matrix structure thomas et al 2013 a critical issue to perform the qra is the definition of quantitative ranges for consequences and frequencies in the matrix the ranking is usually based on arbitrary values set by company standards since unified references to quantify risk matrixes are lacking thomas et al 2013 five classes of consequences in terms of effects on the environment are defined as shown in fig 9 the severity class was assigned to each scenario according to the released oil inventory m3 and impact area km2 considering that the installation is located in an environmental sensitive area and then more stringent criteria should be applied each severity class is defined considering a range of area involved in the spill and of released oil inventory since these range of data are sensitive the present analysis shows the results ranked in normalized classes according to aramis project andersen et al 2004 six classes are then defined for frequency based on expert judgement in fig 9 the screening matrix applied in the preliminary environmental risk assessment is shown in the present analysis hydrocarbon spilt to sea is considered to cause severe environmental impact because of the location of the reference facility according to the bow tie analysis described in fig 4 environmental damage may be caused by both process leaks and leaks from offloading station analysing the two contributions the frequency of occurrence of a release from the offloading station is one order of magnitude lower than the one from the process deck furthermore the analysis of the bow tie diagram considers generic releases from the offloading station but as for environmental risk assessment the consequences have to be estimated on the basis of quantitative data the approach is to consider random ruptures of the offloading hose see fig 2 and applying to these standard release categories random ruptures may be devoted to thermal stress corrosion vibrations etc and are normally associated with standard release categories pitblado et al 1990 spouge 2005 for this purpose the api rp 581 american petroleum institute 2000 random rupture frequency assessment was performed according to api 581 four rupture categories were considered based on the release equivalent diameter i e 0 25 6 35 mm 1 25 4 mm 4 101 6 mm and full bore where the release diameter is taken equal to the pipe diameter for each of these rupture categories two different release time are considered depending on if the scenarios are mitigated or not for big rupture s5 and s6 a release time of 600 s is not considered as credible according to api 581 the scenarios considered in the present analysis are summarized in table 3 while the spill characterization is reported in table 4 to each category an expected frequency was associated and consequence assessment of potential spills was carried out source term was estimated through conventional integral models van den bosh and weterings 2005 while the dynamic development of contaminated area was simulated trough the adoption of the modelling tool gnome general noaa operational modelling environment developed by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa zelenke et al 2012 gnome is a eulerian lagrangian model extensively applied in the framework of oil spill impact assessment studies which was previously verified and validated gnome simulates the particle trajectories only on the ocean surface cheng et al 2011 marta almeida et al 2013 farzingohar et al 2011 and is written using the latest object oriented programming methodologies in the c programming language beegle krause 2001 the oil spills are modelled as lagrangian elements les advected with the surface eulerian current velocity field and the diffusion is simulated as a random walk marta almeida et al 2013 spilled substances are modelled as point masses namely the les further information about models implemented in gnome are available in technical documentation zelenke et al 2012 provided by noaa noaa has developed gnome to investigate the effects of different pollutants and environmental condition on trajectory results cheng et al 2011 gnome supports the noaa national ocean service nos office of response and restoration or r emergency response division erd standard for best guess and minimum regret trajectories by providing information about where the spill is most likely to go namely best guess solution and the uncertainty bound namely minimum regret solution compared with other models the gnome model can be used anywhere in the world and requires fewer input parameters than most other models cheng et al 2011 the details of the gnome simulations performed for the present case study are collected and described in the dedicated section 4 3 1 4 3 1 gnome simulation setup gnome http response restoration noaa gov provides the capability of simulating the behaviour of a spilled amount of oil under different weather conditions the gnome version applied in the simulations of this study is the 1 3 9 more details related to the code may be found in the technical documentation zelenke et al 2012 provided by noaa hereby the key elements supporting the evaluation of the case study are discussed each release scenario was located at goliat coordinate i e 71 30 north and 22 30 east windage parameters were kept as default settings according to zelenke et al 2012 the simulations performed in the present studies refer to a sample period adopting real data of march 2016 each simulation was started at 8 00 a m of march 9th 2016 and was run for 108 h 4 days and 12 h this period was selected for demonstration purposes of the present methodology other meteorological data when available may as well be implemented in the software the impact assessment results are shown in section 5 2 during each simulation the minimum regret solution is calculated the beaching algorithm include the prevent land jumping box 4 3 1 1 spill characterization spilled substances are modelled as point masses called lagrangian elements les in order that the quality of the statistics do not suffer it is best to use at least 1000 les the present analysis considers 1000 les to each point mass the location age and status is assigned over time the simulation runs the computational time step was set to 15 min as indicated in zelenke et al 2012 the movement of the les is either to remain on the water to evaporate to be beached to be weathered and disappear or to travel out of the modelling space domain the evaporation process is modelled with a simplified algorithm that does not take into account of temperature variation and strong wind effect on the evaporation simplified assumptions are adopted in order to simulate the adhesiveness of the oil to the shoreline in particular an empirical parameter namely the half life was adopted in the simulations the half life is a function of substrate porosity the presence or the absence of vegetation the inherent stickiness of the oil and other physical properties and processes of the environment as well the refloat half life is set as 1 h zelenke et al 2012 the source term quantified through integral models lees 1996 van den bosh and weterings 2005 was implemented in gnome as an oil spill point source to set this type of spill it is necessary to provide information including name of the spill location of the spill pollutant type amount released release start and stop dates and times the characterization of the spill adopted in the simulations of the present analysis is shown in table 7 the spill name the amount and the release times change in the different simulations the summary of the simulations performed is reported in table 3 4 3 1 2 maps and movers the settings related to map and movers allow defining the region of interest for the oil spill impact assessment study and the related movers e g wind currents tides etc which allow promoting the oil spread and transport table 5 summarize the procedure and data adopted to characterize the region of interest in gnome simulations more details on the parameters and models adopted in gnome are reported elsewhere zelenke et al 2012 4 3 1 3 best estimate and minimum regret trajectories two different trajectory pictures are obtained in each gnome simulation as shown in fig 12 in section 5 a best guess and a minimum regret trajectory the best guess trajectory represents the most likely movement path of the spill whereas the minimum regret trajectory provides an uncertainty bound this second solution allows the model to predict other possible trajectories that are less likely to occur but which may have higher associated risks the minimum regret trajectory gives information about areas that could be impacted if for example the wind blows from somewhat different direction than the one specified or if the currents in the area flow somewhat faster or slower than expected all of the movers have default uncertainty parameters diffusion currents winds and the component mover zelenke et al 2012 forecast wind and currents are usually not accurate to generate trajectories within 1 5 km of accuracy after 48 h therefore gnome supports user specified uncertainty parameters which are set according to the uncertainty in the input data the currents and wind dataset and the diffusion coefficient mentioned in table 5 have parameters for start time and duration of the uncertainty which is treated according to the scheme shown in table 6 the start time in the model run indicates the time at which the winds and currents forecast starts the duration indicates how long an le will keep the given uncertainty value before having it randomly reset since the reference case does not deal with the modelling of large object drift default setting were kept for duration and uncertainty parameters as recommended in zelenke et al 2012 5 results and discussion results are described in the following sections it is necessary to stress that every finding is derived from theoretical simulations performed during the development of this research 5 1 dynamic risk assessment results of dynamic risk assessment are shown in fig 10 according to the rb established visualization format table 1 human and environmental risks were respectively assessed and expressed as pll fig 10a and frequency of oil spill to sea fig 10b pll is a widely used risk metric describing the expected value of human fatalities per year johansen and rausand 2014 due to scarcity of data the model was tested on simulated indicator trends in order to evaluate its response as shown in fig 10 the trend over time of the two risk indexes decreases in the first months of the performed five year simulation after the first months the risk indexes vary around an average value due to simulated deviations of indicators fig 11 shows an example of rb diagram indicating the risk level worst condition thus associated with the maximum pll value 5 2 environmental impact assessment fig 12 show the results obtained through the application of gnome to scenario s5 see table 3 with the settings described in section 4 3 1 the figure shows the potential impact of the oil spill the movers wind currents and other factors affecting the behaviour of spilled oil are represented by arrows which indicate direction and intensity of the vectors that promote the transport of oil during the simulated period the black dots represent the best guess solution while the red dots show the uncertainty bound namely minimum regret solution fig 12 a shows the oil spreading in the first few hours after the spill the physical and chemical characteristics of petroleum change almost immediately when spilled in the marine environment due to oil weathering processes evans et al 2002 in the first hours the slick is fairly compact and a small percentage of oil spilled is evaporated the oil spread area is extended for more than 250 km2 advancing in time the oil slick expands due to ocean currents wind effects and diffusion processes as shown in fig 12 panels b c and d the slick moves away from the release source meanwhile evaporates affecting a larger impact area more than 450 km2 the results of the environmental risk assessment using the screening matrix are shown in table 7 large spills may lead to intermediate risk values due to the severe consequences shown in fig 12 therefore monitoring of environmental safety barriers is of crucial importance to control risk at acceptable levels oil spill preparedness in the region may be improved through implementation of increased measures as remote sensing and detection offshore helicopter stand by and supply vessel and specialized operational units for the coastal and shore zone holand 2012 ipieca and iogp 2013 furthermore a system is in place for frequent status monitoring of the hose enabling it to be inspected in a variety of ways during loading operations each time the hose is reeled in its entire length is scanned by a video camera and light system ensuring the safety of operations bjornbom 2011 5 3 discussion the study is an example of integrated evaluation of risk for operators and environment associated with installations in sensitive areas and harsh environment the rb application allowed demonstrating that capturing real time information on the most critical safety barriers may be translated into the variation of the overall risk level in this way risk may be periodically evaluated by analysing the barrier conditions supporting decision making and eventually improvements actions however the methodology also resulted in some limitations which may be object of further development since the rb is strongly based on the periodical update of qra parameters the preliminary step identification of reference qra parameters is of utmost importance and it affects the overall risk evaluation process on one side incorporating a large number of parameters and the correspondent monitoring indicators induces higher data collection costs on the other side neglecting relevant parameters may induce to underestimating risk therefore despite the preliminary rb step is based on the analysis qra documentation which may be considered fixed and well defined assumptions and approximations should be carefully and knowingly carried out similar considerations may be extended to the selection of indicators since they strongly affect the periodical variation of qra parameters and the final risk picture it is also worth mentioning that if the reference qra is periodically updated the effect on risk of each indicator should be remodelled in order to limit costs and efforts related to data gathering and monitoring without losing a representative risk evaluation a sensitivity analysis was performed to drive the selection of the most critical bfs and barrier elements section 4 2 4 shows the details of the sensitivity analyses performed where it is evidenced how the most critical elements are shared among multiple critical bfs such as the emergency shut down system the monitoring of critical safety barriers provides more information about the risk evolution rather than the indiscriminate measuring of every device performance in that perspective the rb aggregation rules described in table 2 represent a more sophisticated tool for barrier monitoring than the simple collection of information for each single barrier element in fact the mere collection of data about the status of the components does not support the operator in taking risk oriented decisions and moreover it may be a source of underestimation and misperception of the actual risk level due to computational reason the rb simulation of this study considers a sample amount of critical barrier elements this explains the limited variations in the pll and in the frequency of spilt oil respectively shown in fig 10a and b firstly it is worth noticing that the reference installation features several thousands of barrier elements the performance variations of many of them would not affect the risk performance in a substantial way in fact as shown in fig 11 the risk level of the installation is not changing during the simulation low risk however as the elements considered are addressed as critical the risk variations shown in fig 10 are meaningful the risk profile changes due to performance variation of a small set of critical barrier elements another limitation of the rb technique concerns the use of linear functions to measure risk paltrinieri et al 2014 when the contribution from each indicator is taken into account using a weighted sum two issues are neglected the first is that the aggregation of indicator scores may not correspond to the complete risk picture associated with a scenario since the effect of having several failed barriers features a higher impact than simply summing the individual effects on the basis of defence in depth principle iaea international atomic energy agency 1996 this effect may adopt an exponential trend hauge et al 2015 the second issue addresses the combinations of degraded states and condition which result more dangerous than others therefore further research developments may be addressed at including a dedicated approach to develop indicators which reflect the issue of common cause failure such as bayesian approaches khakzad et al 2013a b the results of the rb simulation have been validated using the reality check approach suggested by suokas 1985 this method investigates the risk analysis approach in term of quality of its hazard identification the backbone of the qra it is based on the comparison with occurred accidents suokas 1988 tested the effectiveness of different accident identification techniques comparing the output of these processes with the insights given from accident descriptions the validation of the rb approach proposed in this work follows the insights suggested by goerlandt et al 2017 the rb technique is based on a bow tie approach different contributors to the accident in that case the hc release are identified by hazard and operability hazop studies and by reviewing past accidents in the petroleum offshore industry according to the comparison analysis performed by suokas 1988 hazop technique is the most effective in identifying accidents and their contributors appropriate barriers are considered and addressed in the bow tie analysis a series of sensitivity analyses has been performed in order to assess the criticality of the different barrier elements this showed that the esd is the most critical barrier system in agreement with the results of different accident investigations and reports pearson 1992 psa 2017 2015 moreover it shows that the rb risk model correctly reflects the effect of esd valve performance on the accident risk the analysis of the safety issues through rb allowed for integration with the conventional procedures for oil spill risk assessment see section 3 2 the results shown in section 5 2 clearly show the importance of a deeper investigation of safety barriers performance in order to prevent oil spill scenarios featuring large impact and thus high risk level the main limitation of oil spill frequency evaluation for the environmental risk assessment is related to the selection of conservative standard values american petroleum institute 2000 leak frequency tailorization bagster and pitblado 1991 pitblado et al 2011 and its periodical update may be an effective approach in order to integrate the operational organizational and technical aspects affecting the likelihood of oil spill and to update the environmental risk level landucci and paltrinieri 2016 2015 dynamic leak frequency evaluation may be also achieved through advanced approaches such as dynamic fault trees dugan et al 1992 manno et al 2012 merle et al 2016 markov chain models for the life cycle analysis howard 1971 limnios and oprisan 2001 yevkin 2016 and weibull failure analysis hall and strutt 2003 khakzad et al 2012 moreover complex system modelling involving the effect of safety barriers alarms backups redundancy of components interlocks etc may be also based on advanced tools such as bayesian networks kalantarnia et al 2009b khakzad et al 2013a b or montecarlo simulation chiacchio et al 2016 das and samuel 2014 noh et al 2014 savage et al 2013 concerning the limitations of consequence evaluation it is worth mentioning that the impact of oil spill was simulated through gnome imposing predefined meteorological conditions lasting for 108 h thus results are specific for the wind and ocean currents conditions implemented which can be also the result of data averaged over prolonged period of observation cheng et al 2011 marta almeida et al 2013 ventikos and psaraftis 2004 nevertheless the development of a tool able to capture and forecast the comprehensive behaviour of movers in the region of interest was out of the scope of the present study moreover despite the effect of the shut down system intervention was accounted for determining of oil spilt quantitates the possible effect of mitigation barriers was not included in the consequence assessment thus the present study may provide support to the situation in which clean up techniques are performed in this way removing oil from water may be facilitated by monitoring where the spill moves and predicting potential impact on sensitive areas 6 conclusions the present work illustrates the development an innovative approach for the integrated safety and environmental risk assessment for the analysis of offshore o g plants in sensitive areas such as the first oil production platform in the barents sea safety assessment was conducted by applying a novel tool for dynamic risk assessment the rb methodology which allowed to relate the risk level of the installation to the performance of critical safety barriers environmental risk assessment has been conducted using the risk matrix approach evaluating both frequency of crude oil spill occurrence and severity the latter has been assessed using the general noaa operational modelling environment gnome software the analysis of the case study evidenced the potentialities of the present method that relies on advanced methods for safety assessment of o g facilities operating in sensitive areas in which environmental risk assessment is integrated the introduction of periodic revision and time update of relevant indicators may be adopted to drive identification of critical safety issues in a facility integrating

23648,degradation of subsea pipelines in the presence of corrosive agents and cyclic loads may lead to the failure of these structures in order to improve their reliability the deterioration process through pitting and corrosion fatigue phenomena should be considered simultaneously for prognosis this process starts with pitting nucleation transits to fatigue damage and leads to fracture and is influenced by many factors such as material and process conditions each incorporating a high level of uncertainty this study proposes a novel probabilistic methodology for integrated modelling of pitting and corrosion fatigue degradation processes of subsea pipelines the entire process is modelled using a dynamic bayesian network dbn methodology representing its temporal nature and varying growth rates the model also takes into account the factors influencing each stage of the process to demonstrate its application the methodology is applied to estimate the remaining useful life of high strength steel pipelines this information along with bayesian updating based on monitoring results can be adopted for the development of effective maintenance strategies keywords corrosion fatigue probabilistic modelling dynamic bayesian network subsea pipelines 1 introduction one of the major causes of failure of offshore structures such as oil and gas pipelines is degradation of structural properties during their lifespan dey and gupta 2001 sulaiman and tan 2014 yang et al 2017 corrosion is the most well known form of steel deterioration resulting in generation of pits or more extended damage bhandari et al 2015b 2016 2017 fatigue on the other hand is the disintegration of material due to cyclic loads applied on the structure coupled corrosion fatigue results from applied cyclic stresses in tandem with presence of corrosive agents where localized corrosion in the form of pits may provide the required conditions for initiation of fatigue crack initiation many parameters including material properties and environmental conditions influence this process these factors each incorporating a level of uncertainty may be adopted to estimate the remaining useful life of the structure while these predictions will provide reliable measures for improving maintenance strategies a dynamic framework is also required for updating the estimations based on new observations during the service life a great deal of research has been conducted to predict the state of damage and fatigue life in steel and aluminum alloy structures that are subjected to pitting and corrosion fatigue kondo 1989 developed a model for the prediction of fatigue crack initiation time based on pit growth however the damage process was not entirely simulated goswami and hoeppner 1995 proposed a seven stage model that considers the effect of electrochemical processes on pit formation as well as the role of pitting in fatigue crack initiation this model however was conceptual and failed to provide a computational framework a probabilistic model was developed by harlow and wei 1994 for prediction of corrosion fatigue life comprising the time for crack initiation surface crack growth and the growth of damage to the critical size this model however does not consider the time of pit nucleation as well as the effect of short cracks in service life modelling kaynak and baker 1996 assessed the effect of short cracks on fatigue life of steel structures concluding that the growth rates of short cracks are different usually smaller from those of long cracks shi and mahadevan 2001 proposed a mechanics based probabilistic model of the entire pitting and corrosion fatigue process suggested by goswami and hoeppner 1995 they adopted monte carlo simulations and the first order reliability method form approach to conduct the probabilistic analysis although their framework provides a guideline for estimating fatigue life application of form may result in computational complications alternatively bayesian network bn as an advanced probabilistic model has widely been applied to reliability analysis of complex systems application of bn significantly reduces the method complexity and computational time of inference by factorizing the joint probability distribution of the parameters of interest based on local dependencies various applications of bn in risk and reliability engineering can be found in weber et al 2012 abbassi et al 2016 bhandari et al 2015 yeo et al 2016 and abaei et al 2017 however only a few studies adopted bns for modelling deterioration processes in structures friis hansen 2000 studied the application of dynamic bayesian network dbn in modelling fatigue crack growth of offshore jacket structures the developed probabilistic network was also used to identify optimum inspection plans straub 2009 developed a generic computational framework using dbn for modelling deterioration processes with potential applications in inspection maintenance and repair planning arzaghi et al 2017 developed a methodology for probabilistic modelling of fatigue crack growth using bn the model was extended to an influence diagram for finding the optimum maintenance plan among multiple repair alternatives with different economic impacts in the present study a probabilistic methodology is developed for modelling corrosion fatigue deterioration in offshore structures this methodology consolidates the entire damage process including pit nucleation pit growth transited to short and long fatigue cracks and the fracture of structure to improve the accuracy of corrosion fatigue life estimations the model incorporates the randomness in the parameters influencing the process for this purpose dbn is adopted as an efficient probabilistic tool the advantages of this methodology are illustrated through the remaining useful life assessment of an offshore pipeline subjected to pitting and corrosion fatigue 2 bayesian networks 2 1 conventional bayesian network bns are directed acyclic graphs used for reasoning under uncertainty by considering the causal relationships represented by directed edges among a number of random variables represented by chance nodes pearl 1988 bn estimates the joint probability distribution of a set of random variables based on the conditional independencies and the chain rule as in eq 1 1 p u p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i p a x i where p u is the joint probability distribution and p a x i is the parent set of random variables x i fig 1 depicts a conventional bn comprising random variables x 1 x 4 the main advantage of bayesian networks is that when new information about any of the chance nodes becomes available the model can update the probabilities for a more efficient knowledge elicitation for instance if variable x 2 is observed to be in state e the joint probability distribution is updated based on bayes theorem 2 p x 1 x 3 x 4 e p x 1 x 3 x 4 e x 1 x 3 x 4 p x 1 x 3 x 4 e dynamic bayesian networks dbns particularly represent stochastic processes and enable explicit modelling of the evolution process of a set of random variables jensen and nielsen 2007 a dbn divides the time line into a discrete number of time slices t 0 t and allows a node in time slice i 1 to be conditionally dependent on a node in time slice i as well as its parents in time slice i 1 fig 2 illustrates a dbn in which the evolving process of the variable y t is modelled this variable in time slice t is dependent on y t 1 as well as x t in order to establish a dbn the conditional probability tables for evolving nodes should be completed for instance p y t y t 1 x t for variable y t in the dbn presented in fig 2 the transition between two consecutive time slices may for instance be dependent upon the physical features of the stochastic process being modelled a detailed explanation of inference algorithms developed specifically for dbn structures can be found in murphy 2002 3 pitting and corrosion fatigue modelling methodology to develop the probabilistic model it is first necessary to assess the entire damage process identifying the physics behind pitting and the corrosion fatigue phenomena this will also facilitate developing the computational framework for predicting damage states and establishing the dbn the seven stage model proposed by goswami and hoeppner 1995 is adopted as the basis for analyzing the service life in the present study fig 3 illustrates the total corrosion fatigue life t f l initiated with pit nucleation time t p n and eventually resulting in fracture this process also includes three damage growth times for pit t p g short crack t s c and long crack t l c as well as two transition stages i e pit to crack transition and short crack to long crack transition 3 t f l t p n t p g t s c t l c the proposed methodology models the entire deterioration process including pitting corrosion and fatigue damage growth fig 4 presents an overview of the entire methodology and its key elements the computational methods for each component of the total failure time represented in eq 3 will be discussed in the following subsections 3 1 pit nucleation the time for pit initiation has attracted a great deal of research yet the dependence on many influencing factors such as materials and electrochemical has not been fully investigated hence the developed model considers this stage of damage life as a random variable modelled by a lognormal distribution the adopted distribution parameters suggested by shi and mahadevan 2001 are provided later in the following sections 3 2 pit growth according to kondo 1989 and harlow and wei 1994 pits are assumed to remain in a hemispherical shape while growing at a constant volumetric rate this yields a pit growth rate given by 4 d c d t c p 2 Ï c 2 5 c p m i p 0 n f Ï exp Î´ h r t where c is the pit radius m is the molecular weight of the material i p 0 is the pitting current constant n is the valence number f 96 514 c mol is faraday s constant Ï is density Î´ h is the activation energy r 8 314 j molk is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature the transition from pit growth to crack initiation is dependent on mechanical characteristics such as stress intensity factor Î´ k two criteria are considered as the boundary conditions for crack initiation 1 the stress intensity factor for the equivalent surface crack growth of the pit reaches the threshold stress intensity factor of the fatigue crack growth eq 6 and 2 the fatigue crack growth rate exceeds the pit growth rate 6 Î´ k p i t Î´ k c r a c k kondo 1989 suggests that the critical crack length c c r that satisfies the conditions for transition from pit growth and crack initiation can be calculated as 7 c c r 1 2 2 q Ï Î± Î´ k c r 2 24 Î´ Ï 2 where q 1 464 Î± 1 65 is the shape factor Î± a c 0 7 is the aspect ratio of pit c and a are half the length of the major and minor axes of pit shape Î´ k c r 2 4 m p a m is the threshold stress intensity factor and Î´ Ï is the stress range experienced by the structure 3 3 short and long crack growth long cracks are usually considered when using fracture mechanics for fatigue analysis and paris law is widely used for estimating damage sizes the effect of short cracks on fatigue life has attracted the attention of researchers however there is no explicit formula derived for short crack growth according to kaynak and baker 1996 and shi and mahadevan 2001 a probabilistic model based on paris law that accounts for the uncertainty of parameters such as stress intensity factor may be applied eq 8 represents the empirical formula for damage growth 8 d a d n c Î´ k 3 where n is the number of applied load cycles c and m are material parameters specifically obtained for short and long cracks resulting in two identical growth rates from the equation Î´k is the stress intensity factor which can be expressed empirically as 9 Î´ k y c Î´ Ï Ï c where y c is the geometry function dependent on the crack depth and Î´ Ï is the stress range while the explicit solution of eq 8 is not possible by assuming that the geometry function is independent of crack depth c and the stress range Î´ Ï follows a weibull distribution an analytical solution can be achieved madsen et al 1986 10 a t 1 a t 2 m m m u s a m 2 2 m m 2 11 s c n Î³ 1 m b y m Ï m 2 1 m 2 where a and b are the scale and shape parameters of the weibull distribution respectively and Î³ is the gamma function eq 10 enables the computation of crack size in current time step as a function of crack size in the previous time step and the material constants m and c where these parameters are obtained from empirical models for short and long cracks different methods are developed to identify the transition size c t h from short crack growth to long crack growth kaynak and baker 1996 suggested this value is about 1 2 mm for en7a steel similarly in this study the critical size is regarded as a random variable with a mean value of 2 mm 3 4 probabilistic analysis and bn model the probability analysis was performed using monte carlo simulations in tandem with implementation of a dbn to estimate the time for the initial part of damage life where pitting corrosion is dominant 104 samples where generated from random variables involved in eq 4 5 and 7 the distributions of these variables are listed in table 1 it should be noted that initial pit size c 0 was considered as the initial condition when solving eq 4 the remainder of service life where fatigue damage progresses is estimated using a dbn for this purpose the generic dbn developed by straub 2009 was adopted to model each of the two growth processes indicated in fig 5 the developed network qualitatively represents a deterioration process describing the state of damage over the life time divided into a discrete number of slices that is the damage size is a function of the initial condition node c c r which is followed by the process of short crack growth nodes c 1 s c to c n s c transition to long crack at a critical crack size node c t h and eventually the long crack growth process nodes c 1 l c to c m l c the occurrence of failure event is assessed by defining a limit state g as 12 g c f c i where c i and c f are the actual and critical crack size respectively 4 application corrosion fatigue damage of a subsea pipeline to demonstrate the applicability of the developed method in predicating corrosion fatigue service life a numerical study is carried out on the failure of an offshore pipeline the mechanical properties of the structure are listed in table 2 it is assumed that n 10 6 load cycles are experienced by the pipeline every year and critical size of damage for failure is c f 10 10 3 m the results of monte carlo simulation showed that the critical pit size for transition to short crack has a mean of e c c r 8 10 4 m the cumulative probability distribution of this variable is presented in fig 6 this distribution was discretized into 20 exponentially growing intervals which form the upper bounds of states of damage size nodes in the dbn this was performed to avoid rounding errors caused by uniform interval lengths in the last intervals where the probabilities are significantly low as illustrated in fig 5 the dbn model contained two consecutive periods corresponding to corrosion fatigue cracks with different growth rates an adequate number of time slices were included in the short crack growth process so that the mean size of predicted damage equals the critical transition size c t h before long crack growth is initiated the long crack process was then extended for a number of time slices each representing a year until fracture occurred p f 1 1 the results of the case study presented in fig 7 suggest that within the third year of operation the grown pits will satisfy the conditions required for initiation of fatigue cracks and damage will be growing in the form of short cracks the prediction of pipeline corrosion fatigue life indicates that the transition from short crack to long crack takes place in year 12 after which the damage develops at a significantly faster rate 15 years after the start of the operation the extent of damage will be significantly increasing where the probability of failure is about 0 1 in the 20th year given no repairs were performed this probability will increase to almost 0 5 in the 25th year of operation and approximately 10 years later the structure is extremely close to failure event p f 1 0 95 these results highlight the strength of the methodology for predicting the service life of a corroded subsea pipeline subjected to cyclic loads the proposed methodology can be readily used to update the predictions based on new damage size inspection results and also provides a great potential for optimization of maintenance plans moreover by enhancing the dbn model with a monitoring capacity the predictions can be updated during the operation period with observation of influencing parameters 5 conclusion this paper presents a probabilistic methodology for prediction of pitting and corrosion fatigue service life in offshore pipelines for this purpose monte carlo simulations are used to analyze the time of pit growth as well as estimating the size of pit in which transition to short crack growth occurs it was observed that pits with mean size of about 0 8 mm have the required condition for crack initiation in steel pipelines a dbn model was implemented for simulating short and long crack growth which may lead to fracture the predictions suggest that in the 20th year of operation probability of failure event is about 0 1 where this value reaches to about 0 95 in 15 years given that no maintenance is performed on the pipeline the results of this study highlights the capability of the method in prediction of corrosion fatigue life considering the randomness of the parameters

23648,degradation of subsea pipelines in the presence of corrosive agents and cyclic loads may lead to the failure of these structures in order to improve their reliability the deterioration process through pitting and corrosion fatigue phenomena should be considered simultaneously for prognosis this process starts with pitting nucleation transits to fatigue damage and leads to fracture and is influenced by many factors such as material and process conditions each incorporating a high level of uncertainty this study proposes a novel probabilistic methodology for integrated modelling of pitting and corrosion fatigue degradation processes of subsea pipelines the entire process is modelled using a dynamic bayesian network dbn methodology representing its temporal nature and varying growth rates the model also takes into account the factors influencing each stage of the process to demonstrate its application the methodology is applied to estimate the remaining useful life of high strength steel pipelines this information along with bayesian updating based on monitoring results can be adopted for the development of effective maintenance strategies keywords corrosion fatigue probabilistic modelling dynamic bayesian network subsea pipelines 1 introduction one of the major causes of failure of offshore structures such as oil and gas pipelines is degradation of structural properties during their lifespan dey and gupta 2001 sulaiman and tan 2014 yang et al 2017 corrosion is the most well known form of steel deterioration resulting in generation of pits or more extended damage bhandari et al 2015b 2016 2017 fatigue on the other hand is the disintegration of material due to cyclic loads applied on the structure coupled corrosion fatigue results from applied cyclic stresses in tandem with presence of corrosive agents where localized corrosion in the form of pits may provide the required conditions for initiation of fatigue crack initiation many parameters including material properties and environmental conditions influence this process these factors each incorporating a level of uncertainty may be adopted to estimate the remaining useful life of the structure while these predictions will provide reliable measures for improving maintenance strategies a dynamic framework is also required for updating the estimations based on new observations during the service life a great deal of research has been conducted to predict the state of damage and fatigue life in steel and aluminum alloy structures that are subjected to pitting and corrosion fatigue kondo 1989 developed a model for the prediction of fatigue crack initiation time based on pit growth however the damage process was not entirely simulated goswami and hoeppner 1995 proposed a seven stage model that considers the effect of electrochemical processes on pit formation as well as the role of pitting in fatigue crack initiation this model however was conceptual and failed to provide a computational framework a probabilistic model was developed by harlow and wei 1994 for prediction of corrosion fatigue life comprising the time for crack initiation surface crack growth and the growth of damage to the critical size this model however does not consider the time of pit nucleation as well as the effect of short cracks in service life modelling kaynak and baker 1996 assessed the effect of short cracks on fatigue life of steel structures concluding that the growth rates of short cracks are different usually smaller from those of long cracks shi and mahadevan 2001 proposed a mechanics based probabilistic model of the entire pitting and corrosion fatigue process suggested by goswami and hoeppner 1995 they adopted monte carlo simulations and the first order reliability method form approach to conduct the probabilistic analysis although their framework provides a guideline for estimating fatigue life application of form may result in computational complications alternatively bayesian network bn as an advanced probabilistic model has widely been applied to reliability analysis of complex systems application of bn significantly reduces the method complexity and computational time of inference by factorizing the joint probability distribution of the parameters of interest based on local dependencies various applications of bn in risk and reliability engineering can be found in weber et al 2012 abbassi et al 2016 bhandari et al 2015 yeo et al 2016 and abaei et al 2017 however only a few studies adopted bns for modelling deterioration processes in structures friis hansen 2000 studied the application of dynamic bayesian network dbn in modelling fatigue crack growth of offshore jacket structures the developed probabilistic network was also used to identify optimum inspection plans straub 2009 developed a generic computational framework using dbn for modelling deterioration processes with potential applications in inspection maintenance and repair planning arzaghi et al 2017 developed a methodology for probabilistic modelling of fatigue crack growth using bn the model was extended to an influence diagram for finding the optimum maintenance plan among multiple repair alternatives with different economic impacts in the present study a probabilistic methodology is developed for modelling corrosion fatigue deterioration in offshore structures this methodology consolidates the entire damage process including pit nucleation pit growth transited to short and long fatigue cracks and the fracture of structure to improve the accuracy of corrosion fatigue life estimations the model incorporates the randomness in the parameters influencing the process for this purpose dbn is adopted as an efficient probabilistic tool the advantages of this methodology are illustrated through the remaining useful life assessment of an offshore pipeline subjected to pitting and corrosion fatigue 2 bayesian networks 2 1 conventional bayesian network bns are directed acyclic graphs used for reasoning under uncertainty by considering the causal relationships represented by directed edges among a number of random variables represented by chance nodes pearl 1988 bn estimates the joint probability distribution of a set of random variables based on the conditional independencies and the chain rule as in eq 1 1 p u p x 1 x 2 x n i 1 n p x i p a x i where p u is the joint probability distribution and p a x i is the parent set of random variables x i fig 1 depicts a conventional bn comprising random variables x 1 x 4 the main advantage of bayesian networks is that when new information about any of the chance nodes becomes available the model can update the probabilities for a more efficient knowledge elicitation for instance if variable x 2 is observed to be in state e the joint probability distribution is updated based on bayes theorem 2 p x 1 x 3 x 4 e p x 1 x 3 x 4 e x 1 x 3 x 4 p x 1 x 3 x 4 e dynamic bayesian networks dbns particularly represent stochastic processes and enable explicit modelling of the evolution process of a set of random variables jensen and nielsen 2007 a dbn divides the time line into a discrete number of time slices t 0 t and allows a node in time slice i 1 to be conditionally dependent on a node in time slice i as well as its parents in time slice i 1 fig 2 illustrates a dbn in which the evolving process of the variable y t is modelled this variable in time slice t is dependent on y t 1 as well as x t in order to establish a dbn the conditional probability tables for evolving nodes should be completed for instance p y t y t 1 x t for variable y t in the dbn presented in fig 2 the transition between two consecutive time slices may for instance be dependent upon the physical features of the stochastic process being modelled a detailed explanation of inference algorithms developed specifically for dbn structures can be found in murphy 2002 3 pitting and corrosion fatigue modelling methodology to develop the probabilistic model it is first necessary to assess the entire damage process identifying the physics behind pitting and the corrosion fatigue phenomena this will also facilitate developing the computational framework for predicting damage states and establishing the dbn the seven stage model proposed by goswami and hoeppner 1995 is adopted as the basis for analyzing the service life in the present study fig 3 illustrates the total corrosion fatigue life t f l initiated with pit nucleation time t p n and eventually resulting in fracture this process also includes three damage growth times for pit t p g short crack t s c and long crack t l c as well as two transition stages i e pit to crack transition and short crack to long crack transition 3 t f l t p n t p g t s c t l c the proposed methodology models the entire deterioration process including pitting corrosion and fatigue damage growth fig 4 presents an overview of the entire methodology and its key elements the computational methods for each component of the total failure time represented in eq 3 will be discussed in the following subsections 3 1 pit nucleation the time for pit initiation has attracted a great deal of research yet the dependence on many influencing factors such as materials and electrochemical has not been fully investigated hence the developed model considers this stage of damage life as a random variable modelled by a lognormal distribution the adopted distribution parameters suggested by shi and mahadevan 2001 are provided later in the following sections 3 2 pit growth according to kondo 1989 and harlow and wei 1994 pits are assumed to remain in a hemispherical shape while growing at a constant volumetric rate this yields a pit growth rate given by 4 d c d t c p 2 Ï c 2 5 c p m i p 0 n f Ï exp Î´ h r t where c is the pit radius m is the molecular weight of the material i p 0 is the pitting current constant n is the valence number f 96 514 c mol is faraday s constant Ï is density Î´ h is the activation energy r 8 314 j molk is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature the transition from pit growth to crack initiation is dependent on mechanical characteristics such as stress intensity factor Î´ k two criteria are considered as the boundary conditions for crack initiation 1 the stress intensity factor for the equivalent surface crack growth of the pit reaches the threshold stress intensity factor of the fatigue crack growth eq 6 and 2 the fatigue crack growth rate exceeds the pit growth rate 6 Î´ k p i t Î´ k c r a c k kondo 1989 suggests that the critical crack length c c r that satisfies the conditions for transition from pit growth and crack initiation can be calculated as 7 c c r 1 2 2 q Ï Î±

threshold stress intensity factor and Î´ Ï is the stress range experienced by the structure 3 3 short and long crack growth long cracks are usually considered when using fracture mechanics for fatigue analysis and paris law is widely used for estimating damage sizes the effect of short cracks on fatigue life has attracted the attention of researchers however there is no explicit formula derived for short crack growth according to kaynak and baker 1996 and shi and mahadevan 2001 a probabilistic model based on paris law that accounts for the uncertainty of parameters such as stress intensity factor may be applied eq 8 represents the empirical formula for damage growth 8 d a d n c Î´ k 3 where n is the number of applied load cycles c and m are material parameters specifically obtained for short and long cracks resulting in two identical growth rates from the equation Î´k is the stress intensity factor which can be expressed empirically as 9 Î´ k y c Î´ Ï Ï c where y c is the geometry function dependent on the crack depth and Î´ Ï is the stress range while the explicit solution of eq 8 is not possible by assuming that the geometry function is independent of crack depth c and the stress range Î´ Ï follows a weibull distribution an analytical solution can be achieved madsen et al 1986 10 a t 1 a t 2 m m m u s a m 2 2 m m 2 11 s c n Î³ 1 m b y m Ï m 2 1 m 2 where a and b are the scale and shape parameters of the weibull distribution respectively and Î³ is the gamma function eq 10 enables the computation of crack size in current time step as a function of crack size in the previous time step and the material constants m and c where these parameters are obtained from empirical models for short and long cracks different methods are developed to identify the transition size c t h from short crack growth to long crack growth kaynak and baker 1996 suggested this value is about 1 2 mm for en7a steel similarly in this study the critical size is regarded as a random variable with a mean value of 2 mm 3 4 probabilistic analysis and bn model the probability analysis was performed using monte carlo simulations in tandem with implementation of a dbn to estimate the time for the initial part of damage life where pitting corrosion is dominant 104 samples where generated from random variables involved in eq 4 5 and 7 the distributions of these variables are listed in table 1 it should be noted that initial pit size c 0 was considered as the initial condition when solving eq 4 the remainder of service life where fatigue damage progresses is estimated using a dbn for this purpose the generic dbn developed by straub 2009 was adopted to model each of the two growth processes indicated in fig 5 the developed network qualitatively represents a deterioration process describing the state of damage over the life time divided into a discrete number of slices that is the damage size is a function of the initial condition node c c r which is followed by the process of short crack growth nodes c 1 s c to c n s c transition to long crack at a critical crack size node c t h and eventually the long crack growth process nodes c 1 l c to c m l c the occurrence of failure event is assessed by defining a limit state g as 12 g c f c i where c i and c f are the actual and critical crack size respectively 4 application corrosion fatigue damage of a subsea pipeline to demonstrate the applicability of the developed method in predicating corrosion fatigue service life a numerical study is carried out on the failure of an offshore pipeline the mechanical properties of the structure are listed in table 2 it is assumed that n 10 6 load cycles are experienced by the pipeline every year and critical size of damage for failure is c f 10 10 3 m the results of monte carlo simulation showed that the critical pit size for transition to short crack has a mean of e c c r 8 10 4 m the cumulative probability distribution of this variable is presented in fig 6 this distribution was discretized into 20 exponentially growing intervals which form the upper bounds of states of damage size nodes in the dbn this was performed to avoid rounding errors caused by uniform interval lengths in the last intervals where the probabilities are significantly low as illustrated in fig 5 the dbn model contained two consecutive periods corresponding to corrosion fatigue cracks with different growth rates an adequate number of time slices were included in the short crack growth process so that the mean size of predicted damage equals the critical transition size c t h before long crack growth is initiated the long crack process was then extended for a number of time slices each representing a year until fracture occurred p f 1 1 the results of the case study presented in fig 7 suggest that within the third year of operation the grown pits will satisfy the conditions required for initiation of fatigue cracks and damage will be growing in the form of short cracks the prediction of pipeline corrosion fatigue life indicates that the transition from short crack to long crack takes place in year 12 after which the damage develops at a significantly faster rate 15 years after the start of the operation the extent of damage will be significantly increasing where the probability of failure is about 0 1 in the 20th year given no repairs were performed this probability will increase to almost 0 5 in the 25th year of operation and approximately 10 years later the structure is extremely close to failure event p f 1 0 95 these results highlight the strength of the methodology for predicting the service life of a corroded subsea pipeline subjected to cyclic loads the proposed methodology can be readily used to update the predictions based on new damage size inspection results and also provides a great potential for optimization of maintenance plans moreover by enhancing the dbn model with a monitoring capacity the predictions can be updated during the operation period with observation of influencing parameters 5 conclusion this paper presents a probabilistic methodology for prediction of pitting and corrosion fatigue service life in offshore pipelines for this purpose monte carlo simulations are used to analyze the time of pit growth as well as estimating the size of pit in which transition to short crack growth occurs it was observed that pits with mean size of about 0 8 mm have the required condition for crack initiation in steel pipelines a dbn model was implemented for simulating short and long

23649,marine floating structures may experience harsh environmental conditions during their operational life span in order to maintain a safe operation it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the structure in extreme conditions such as storm previously various approaches were introduced to analyse the response of an offshore structure in different sea states however the proposed methods are computationally time consuming requiring a large number of simulations and it is not the most realistic approach to analyse the dynamic behavior of a structure by separately replicating each level of storm in this study a novel numerical model of storm is developed based on endurance wave analysis ewa concept the developed model will reduce the computational cost to only one storm record of 1100 s taking into account the randomness of sea environment the application of this method is demonstrated by assessing a floating storage unit fsu responses encountering a storm in the north sea the results show that the response of structure is likely to exceed the survival condition while encountering storm level 10 corresponding to a wave height of 12 56 m the proposed method is beneficial for future risk and reliability analyses that require a great deal of data keywords harsh environment floating structures reliability wave analysis 1 introduction one of the prerequisites for improving the safety and reliability of offshore structure is to evaluate dynamic behavior of a structure in severe environmental loads such as storm condition which the structure might become exposed during its lifetime arzaghi et al 2017 abaei et al 2017 bhandari et al 2015 2016 diznab et al 2014 zeinoddini et al 2012 environmental loads including waves loading play a dominant role in the design of offshore structures in various stages of construction transportation installation and operation zeinoddini et al 2012 sea waves has a random nature which cause non linear forces on the floating structures therefore time history analysis will become necessary to obtain more accurate results for the structural response during extreme loading conditions catastrophic hurricanes such as ivan katrina and rita in the gulf of mexico highlighted the importance of considering the impact of extreme environmental loads on all types of offshore structures consequently there has been an increasing focus on the analysis of extreme waves in the past few years cox et al 2005 hennig 2005 kim and zhang 2009 wang et al 2011 conventional dynamic analysis of marine structure is a time consuming approach as it needs a longer simulation time to generate data for conducting statistical analysis agarwal and manuel 2009 for instance chen and moan 2004 carried out a study with twenty different 3 h simulations to generate time domain responses later ren et al 2015 implemented 84 480 times of 1 h short numerical simulations for investigating the performance of a spar torus combination stc system it is therefore necessary to rely on more optimum solutions for dynamic analysis of structure to reduce the large time of simulations recently endurance time analysis eta method is developed by riahi and estekanchi 2010 and later improved by riahi and estekanchi 2010 to reduce the computatioanl cost the basic concept of this method was first introduced by estekanchi et al 2004 in which the structure is exposed to an artificial intensifying acceleration time history results of the studies carried out by estekanchi et al 2007 2011 riahi and estekanchi 2010 indicate the efficiency and accuracy of this method in the dynamic evaluation of structures subjected to natural disasters such as earthquakes it should be noted that the principles of structural performance under seismic loads and sea wave excitaions are so called similar to each other regardless of the fact that the time duration of storm loads is about several hours compared to seismic loads that take place in a short time 5 10 s zeinoddini et al 2012 according to these differences endurance wave analysis ewa method has beed introduced by diznab et al 2014 jahanmard et al 2015 zeinoddini et al 2012 in order to evaluate non linear dynamic analysis of marine floating structures subjected to irregular wave forces this paper aims at developing a novel approach for developing storm condition to evaluate performance of marine floating structures analysing dynamic behavior of the structure is the main key point for examining the performance of the vessel in harsh environment this will clarify that as the structure subjected to the storm when the behavior of the vessel will be in safe condition or when it will exceed its survival limit conditions for this purpose intensifying dynamic modelling of the structure based on ewa considered for performance analysis of the structure which develops an extensive range of storm conditions considering the optimum simulation time in order to illustrate the advantages of the developed methodology a floating storage unit fsu is considered as a real case study the approach has the capability to be applied for critical analysis of any types of marine structure such as commercial displacement vessels mooring structures and marine renewable devices which is subjected to storm also it is helpful for future risk and reliability analysis of these structure for improving safety of the marine structure in harsh environment the remainder of this paper is divided into the following sections section 2 explains the concept of eva for developing different level of storm condition considering only one simulation time section 3 discusses the developed methodology and its elements section 4 presents the application of the methodology in a real case study and section 5 highlights the main findings of the present work providing few recommendations for possible future studies 2 endurance wave analysis the ewa is a simulation based approach to evaluating the hydrodynamic performance of offshore structures when encountering a wave profile with stepwise increases of wave height this method that simulates storm conditions is based on the concept adopted from eta in seismic engineering assisting in reduction of the time required for analysis of marine structures in multiple sea states in ewa method different sea states are provided in a single time domain by representing wave spectrum into intensifying wave train function iwtf this function is a relatively short duration time series of the irregular water surface elevation zeinoddini et al 2012 tried to put forward short duration irregular wave time histories such as constrained new wave cnw which had no fixed frequency but were delivering a desirable maximum crest height the final wave train function will then be defined as intensifying cnw icnw accordingly this approach can be adopted for simulating the increasing trend of storms levels over time which even goes well beyond the design sea state accounting for the random nature of sea waves the icnw wave function is then introduced as a single input of the external excitations for a long term evaluation of non linear dynamic analysis the performance of the structures and the limit states of failures can be investigated based on the ewa results the ability of considering spectral features of the sea state and different significant wave heights and frequencies in a single dynamic analysis taking into account the irregularity and randomness of the sea waves and requiring relatively short simulation time are among the advantages offered by ewa zeinoddini et al 2012 more details on the description of the basics of this concept and progressive analysis methodology for assessment of marine structures under extreme waves can be found in diznab et al 2014 jahanmard et al 2015 zeinoddini et al 2012 fig 1 illustrates the three different levels of icnw profile with different sea states that are adopted for the hydrodynamic simulations of the floating structure at the beginning the structure is subjected to a time history wave loading corresponding to a certain significant wave height hs and peak spectral period tp derived from first sea state spectrum s1 w since the amplitude of the excitation is quite low the structure remains stable while experiencing this loading case 1 in the second stage the significant wave height increases linearly for a same time duration as case 1 at some point during this stage of storm the sturcture will exceed its survival limit causing intolerable situation for the crew on board case 2 in the last stage the excitation becomes severe such that the floating structure is anticipated to capsize and there will be no choice for the crew rather than evacuating the structure urgently case 3 ewa will help to evaluate the performance of the structure for any desired level of storm conditions and any reasonable edps for future risk assessment and decision making processes 2 1 intensifying constrained new wave model icnwm cnw is a type of gaussian process used to model random wave elevations constrained to the most probable new wave crest at a specific time by considering sea spectrum in addition to its shorter analysis time cnw has the capability to model the random nature of the sea waves the application of this method in determining the extreme response of the structures under wave loadings is proved by previous researches diznab et al 2014 jahanmard et al 2015 zeinoddini et al 2012 further details about cnw and its application is provided by taylor et al 1997 to model of the storm condition cnw is used for generating the intensifying wave train functions iwtfs for this purpose using the sea spectrum m separate time series of intensifying cnws each with a specific sea state and constant duration time td are joined together to form a standalone time history of the random sea elevation the kth cnw profile Î· r k t represents the sea state k 1 k m which is itself constructed based on the wave energy density spectrum s k Ï at a specific site the kth cnw covers a time period of k 1 t d t k t d s k Ï by stepwisely increasing the level of wave spectrum with a linear trend as k increases from 1 to k the intensifying storm profile will be generated the target operational and survival significant wave height h s and its corresponding energy density spectrum s Ï should be placed somewhere halfway and last stepwise profile through the sea states 1 to m this assists in conducting risk escalation assessment since the performance of the structure can be evaluated when the storm condition exceeds the operational and survival limits of a marine floating structure the first generation of icnw in which the growth function is linear can be expressed as follows diznab et al 2014 zeinoddini et al 2012 1 Î· i c n w t Î· r 1 t Ï 1 t Î± 1 Î· r 1 t c Ï 1 t Î» 1 2 Î· r 1 t c 0 t t d s 1 Ï Î· r 2 t Ï 2 t Î±

storm 3 developed methodology the novel methodology developed in this study will contribute as a powerful tool for hydrodynamic analysis of marine structures during storm conditions to evaluate their critical performance the outcome of the proposed methodology will assist the designer and vessel operators during harsh conditions to understand a better view of the structural behavior encountered storm therefore the approach has the capability for future risk and reliability analysis for improving the safety of the marine operation this methodology in general illustrated in fig 2 and discussed in the following to evaluate performance of marine floating structures in severe environmental conditions it is necessary to analyse the stochastic dynamic behavior of the structure in various sea states however an extensive number of time domain simulations is essential to evaluate extreme loads affecting the system this study devotes to develop a novel methodology for hydrodynamic analysis of the floating structure under storm conditions the approach is capable to generate the essential data for investigating the behavior of structure stochastically and it can use as the basis for future statistical analysis efficiently for this purpose ewa method is considered to develop icnw function for two reasons 1 to minimize the duration of the hydrodynamic time domain simulation by representing a unique wave train function 2 to reduce the extent of edp data necessary for performance analysis of the structure therefore the dynamic behavior of the system can be evaluated stochastically with only one simulation time which is more efficient computationally in order to develop storm profile firstly a number of different sea states according to their sea spectrum should be defined then ewa approach will apply to design intensifying wave train for harsh environment that representing storm situation the fundamentals of ewa method is discussed in section 2 clarifying all relevant hydrodynamic theories used in this paper fig 1 presents an overview of the hydrodynamic analysis for generating icnw function based on ewa afterwards the structure will encountered with storm for hydrodynamic modelling of a floating system the final response results are then adopted for estimating the edp for each storm condition to evaluate performance of the structure the results will show that possible situation that the structure will exceed the survival condition during storm 4 application of the developed methodology a case study 4 1 scenario development to demonstrate the application of developed methodology a case study is adopted for performance analysis of sevan 1000 floating storage unit fsu encountering storm this unit was intended to operate on the mariner field in the united kingdom sector of the north sea hanssen 2013 previously a number of conventional studies were carried out to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of this unit focusing on its performance however not in harsh environment and storm condition anundsen 2008 hanssen 2013 in the present paper sevan hull encountered to designed storm profile due to extreme environmental loads for evaluating the dynamic behavior of the structure in survival condition according to brindley and comley 2014 a number of catastrophic failures are occurred on these structures operating in the north sea due to its harsh environmental conditions this highlights the need for developing a robust methodology that evaluate performance of the structure more realistically in storm conditions 4 2 developing icnw storm profile step 1 in order to develop the icnw storm wave profile eleven sea state thresholds are considered the sea states used in implementing the icnw profile respect to each sea state are presented in table 1 to model the random and irregular nature of sea wave elevationsjonswap spectrum is used for different sea state each sea states represent a spectrum s k Ï for different kth level of storm which is shown as sea states in table 1 the considered survival limits for fsu operation based on the suggestions by anundsen 2008 are defined as maximum wave height of 19 m maximum roll angle of 9 maximum surge and heave responses of 12 m and 13 m respectively using the icnw profile and considering these operational safety limits hydrodynamic analysis of the fsu conducted to evaluate the performance of the structure under different level of storm condition moreover to show the advantage of this method in reducing the simulation time the superimposed conventional random sea elevation rse is compared with icnw as presented in fig 3 as illustrated in the figure the rse profile needs more simulation time to observe extreme wave heights it is usual to run numerical simulation of hydrodynamic analysis for 3 h for each sea states to observe desired extreme wave heights as recommended by chen and moan 2004 ren et al 2015 veritas 2007 that is for each sea state eleven 3 h simulations are needed to be carried out in order to obtain a realistic representation of storm however to generate icnw profile for this site only 1100 s of simulation time is required to observe different level of extreme storm conditions in one individual simulation for hydrodynamic analysis as an example sea states five and eleven are illustrated individually in fig 3 to emphasize differences between these two approaches and how the time domain in icnw reaches its highest level in a much shorter time in the figure the wave spectrum for these sea states are shown above the surface elevation profile providing a qualitative representation of eq 1 and eq 2 described in 2 1 4 3 hydrodynamic analysis step 2 in this study orcaflex software is used to conduct the hydrodynamic analysis icnw wave profile is inputted manually in the software to conduct the simulation process and time domain analysis the simulations are then carried out to investigate performance of the fsu to explore the dynamic behavior of the fsu in details the most critical angle of attack considered as the performance analysis by the conducted simulations in different angles it is found that 45 has the most extrem response which adopted for the perfromance analysis to evalaute dynamic behaviure of fsu in extreme condition the time history of surge roll and heave angle extracted from the results and represneted in fig 4 also the relevant survival limit states are illustrated in each plot to show the effect of intensifying level of storm in each sea state on the performance of the structure it is found that when the storm reach to the significant wave height of 12 56 m which is 9th level in the designed wave profile then the heave and surge motion exceed the survival condition limit this limit for roll degree will surpass in 10th level in significant wave height of 14 15 m in general the vessel can survive for a wide range of incident waves lower than 9th level to being in safe zone these criteria are essential for future risk and reliability analysis of the marine floating structure during their operation to minimize any possible structural failure such as capsizing the vessel due to harsh conditions it is also essential to investigate the coupled motions of the structure during storm to define the situations that exceed the survival limit for this purpose trajectory plot of transition and rotational motion are considered to illustrate the stochastic dynamic behavior of the vessel fig 5 represents the trajectory motions of roll pitch and surge sway degrees respectively the results highlight the critical borders in which the vessel will experience extreme responses resulting in capsizing or major damage on the structure due to impact of sea loads moreover the graph shows the frequency of the cases that vessel exceed its safe limit for example during the storm condition in the simulation time of 1100 s the vessel pass the safe border three times for pitch angle and nine times for sway direction these are imperative values for future risk and reliability analysis to estimate the likelihood that a structure remains in the unsafe zone the survival conditions are shown in the plots to clarify structure exceed the critical limits these graphs are important for future failure analysis of the structure as it shows the number of occurrence that the structure exceed the survival condition by intensifying the storm level the discrepancy of the coupled responses will increase drastically this means that the structure will experience extreme responses that will affect the marine operation the border that is highlighted in both figures show the safe region during the storm the coupled response of surge sway is more likely to exceed the survival limit condition while the dispersion of the roll pitch motion increase by intensifying the storm all these stochastic behaviours will cause intolerable operation situation due to large motions either for structure or human life these response should be considered to improve the safety of the operation and to examine the safety of the structural performance in different levels of the storm 5 conclusion a new approach for hydrodynamic analysis of marine floating structure developed in this paper with the aim at elaborating performance of the object during storm the methodology starts with designing a user defined storm profile by superimposing through intensifying wave train function in different sea states this approach has the advantage of evaluating hydrodynamic response of the structure encounter with storm in a single time history with the fact that reducing computation cost of simulations the advantages of the proposed framework were demonstrated through simulating a fsu in storm condition the results of the analysis indicate that the structure will exceed the survival condition if the storm pass the significant wave height level of 12 65 m in addition the global trajectory of the vessel for transition and rotational response demonstrates the effect of storm on the performance of the structure the results of this study highlight that the proposed methodology can be used as a useful framework for future risk and reliability analysis considering the dynamic behavior of a floating structure to minimize the possible failures such as capsizing this analysis enables the designers and operators to assess the reliability of the structures encountering extreme sea state conditions acknowledgment authors thankfully acknowledge support provided by national centre for

23649,marine floating structures may experience harsh environmental conditions during their operational life span in order to maintain a safe operation it is necessary to evaluate the performance of the structure in extreme conditions such as storm previously various approaches were introduced to analyse the response of an offshore structure in different sea states however the proposed methods are computationally time consuming requiring a large number of simulations and it is not the most realistic approach to analyse the dynamic behavior of a structure by separately replicating each level of storm in this study a novel numerical model of storm is developed based on endurance wave analysis ewa concept the developed model will reduce the computational cost to only one storm record of 1100 s taking into account the randomness of sea environment the application of this method is demonstrated by assessing a floating storage unit fsu responses encountering a storm in the north sea the results show that the response of structure is likely to exceed the survival condition while encountering storm level 10 corresponding to a wave height of 12 56 m the proposed method is beneficial for future risk and reliability analyses that require a great deal of data keywords harsh environment floating structures reliability wave analysis 1 introduction one of the prerequisites for improving the safety and reliability of offshore structure is to evaluate dynamic behavior of a structure in severe environmental loads such as storm condition which the structure might become exposed during its lifetime arzaghi et al 2017 abaei et al 2017 bhandari et al 2015 2016 diznab et al 2014 zeinoddini et al 2012 environmental loads including waves loading play a dominant role in the design of offshore structures in various stages of construction transportation installation and operation zeinoddini et al 2012 sea waves has a random nature which cause non linear forces on the floating structures therefore time history analysis will become necessary to obtain more accurate results for the structural response during extreme loading conditions catastrophic hurricanes such as ivan katrina and rita in the gulf of mexico highlighted the importance of considering the impact of extreme environmental loads on all types of offshore structures consequently there has been an increasing focus on the analysis of extreme waves in the past few years cox et al 2005 hennig 2005 kim and zhang 2009 wang et al 2011 conventional dynamic analysis of marine structure is a time consuming approach as it needs a longer simulation time to generate data for conducting statistical analysis agarwal and manuel 2009 for instance chen and moan 2004 carried out a study with twenty different 3 h simulations to generate time domain responses later ren et al 2015 implemented 84 480 times of 1 h short numerical simulations for investigating the performance of a spar torus combination stc system it is therefore necessary to rely on more optimum solutions for dynamic analysis of structure to reduce the large time of simulations recently endurance time analysis eta method is developed by riahi and estekanchi 2010 and later improved by riahi and estekanchi 2010 to reduce the computatioanl cost the basic concept of this method was first introduced by estekanchi et al 2004 in which the structure is exposed to an artificial intensifying acceleration time history results of the studies carried out by estekanchi et al 2007 2011 riahi and estekanchi 2010 indicate the efficiency and accuracy of this method in the dynamic evaluation of structures subjected to natural disasters such as earthquakes it should be noted that the principles of structural performance under seismic loads and sea wave excitaions are so called similar to each other regardless of the fact that the time duration of storm loads is about several hours compared to seismic loads that take place in a short time 5 10 s zeinoddini et al 2012 according to these differences endurance wave analysis ewa method has beed introduced by diznab et al 2014 jahanmard et al 2015 zeinoddini et al 2012 in order to evaluate non linear dynamic analysis of marine floating structures subjected to irregular wave forces this paper aims at developing a novel approach for developing storm condition to evaluate performance of marine floating structures analysing dynamic behavior of the structure is the main key point for examining the performance of the vessel in harsh environment this will clarify that as the structure subjected to the storm when the behavior of the vessel will be in safe condition or when it will exceed its survival limit conditions for this purpose intensifying dynamic modelling of the structure based on ewa considered for performance analysis of the structure which develops an extensive range of storm conditions considering the optimum simulation time in order to illustrate the advantages of the developed methodology a floating storage unit fsu is considered as a real case study the approach has the capability to be applied for critical analysis of any types of marine structure such as commercial displacement vessels mooring structures and marine renewable devices which is subjected to storm also it is helpful for future risk and reliability analysis of these structure for improving safety of the marine structure in harsh environment the remainder of this paper is divided into the following sections section 2 explains the concept of eva for developing different level of storm condition considering only one simulation time section 3 discusses the developed methodology and its elements section 4 presents the application of the methodology in a real case study and section 5 highlights the main findings of the present work providing few recommendations for possible future studies 2 endurance wave analysis the ewa is a simulation based approach to evaluating the hydrodynamic performance of offshore structures when encountering a wave profile with stepwise increases of wave height this method that simulates storm conditions is based on the concept adopted from eta in seismic engineering assisting in reduction of the time required for analysis of marine structures in multiple sea states in ewa method different sea states are provided in a single time domain by representing wave spectrum into intensifying wave train function iwtf this function is a relatively short duration time series of the irregular water surface elevation zeinoddini et al 2012 tried to put forward short duration irregular wave time histories such as constrained new wave cnw which had no fixed frequency but were delivering a desirable maximum crest height the final wave train function will then be defined as intensifying cnw icnw accordingly this approach can be adopted for simulating the increasing trend of storms levels over time which even goes well beyond the design sea state accounting for the random nature of sea waves the icnw wave function is then introduced as a single input of the external excitations for a long term evaluation of non linear dynamic analysis the performance of the structures and the limit states of failures can be investigated based on the ewa results the ability of considering spectral features of the sea state and different significant wave heights and frequencies in a single dynamic analysis taking into account the irregularity and randomness of the sea waves and requiring relatively short simulation time are among the advantages offered by ewa zeinoddini et al 2012 more details on the description of the basics of this concept and progressive analysis methodology for assessment of marine structures under extreme waves can be found in diznab et al 2014 jahanmard et al 2015 zeinoddini et al 2012 fig 1 illustrates the three different levels of icnw profile with different sea states that are adopted for the hydrodynamic simulations of the floating structure at the beginning the structure is subjected to a time history wave loading corresponding to a certain significant wave height hs and peak spectral period tp derived from first sea state spectrum s1 w since the amplitude of the excitation is quite low the structure remains stable while experiencing this loading case 1 in the second stage the significant wave height increases linearly for a same time duration as case 1 at some point during this stage of storm the sturcture will exceed its survival limit causing intolerable situation for the crew on board case 2 in the last stage the excitation becomes severe such that the floating structure is anticipated to capsize and there will be no choice for the crew rather than evacuating the structure urgently case 3 ewa will help to evaluate the performance of the structure for any desired level of storm conditions and any reasonable edps for future risk assessment and decision making processes 2 1 intensifying constrained new wave model icnwm cnw is a type of gaussian process used to model random wave elevations constrained to the most probable new wave crest at a specific time by considering sea spectrum in addition to its shorter analysis time cnw has the capability to model the random nature of the sea waves the application of this method in determining the extreme response of the structures under wave loadings is proved by previous researches diznab et al 2014 jahanmard et al 2015 zeinoddini et al 2012 further details about cnw and its application is provided by taylor et al 1997 to model of the storm condition cnw is used for generating the intensifying wave train functions iwtfs for this purpose using the sea spectrum m separate time series of intensifying cnws each with a specific sea state and constant duration time td are joined together to form a standalone time history of the random sea elevation the kth cnw profile Î· r k t represents the sea state k 1 k m which is itself constructed based on the wave energy density spectrum s k Ï at a specific site the kth cnw covers a time period of k 1 t d t k t d s k Ï by stepwisely increasing the level of wave spectrum with a linear trend as k increases from 1 to k the intensifying storm profile will be generated the target operational and survival significant wave height h s and its corresponding energy density spectrum s Ï should be placed somewhere halfway and last stepwise profile through the sea states 1 to m this assists in conducting risk escalation assessment since the performance of the structure can be evaluated when the storm condition exceeds the operational and survival limits of a marine floating structure the first generation of icnw in which the growth function is linear can be expressed as follows diznab et al 2014 zeinoddini et al 2012 1 Î· i c n w t Î· r 1 t Ï 1 t Î± 1 Î· r 1 t c Ï 1 t Î» 1 2 Î· r 1 t c 0 t t d s 1 Ï Î· r 2 t Ï 2 t Î±

storm 3 developed methodology the novel methodology developed in this study will contribute as a powerful tool for hydrodynamic analysis of marine structures during storm conditions to evaluate their critical performance the outcome of the proposed methodology will assist the designer and vessel operators during harsh conditions to understand a better view of the structural behavior encountered storm therefore the approach has the capability for future risk and reliability analysis for improving the safety of the marine operation this methodology in general illustrated in fig 2 and discussed in the following to evaluate performance of marine floating structures in severe environmental conditions it is necessary to analyse the stochastic dynamic behavior of the structure in various sea states however an extensive number of time domain simulations is essential to evaluate extreme loads affecting the system this study devotes to develop a novel methodology for hydrodynamic analysis of the floating structure under storm conditions the approach is capable to generate the essential data for investigating the behavior of structure stochastically and it can use as the basis for future statistical analysis efficiently for this purpose ewa method is considered to develop icnw function for two reasons 1 to minimize the duration of the hydrodynamic time domain simulation by representing a unique wave train function 2 to reduce the extent of edp data necessary for performance analysis of the structure therefore the dynamic behavior of the system can be evaluated stochastically with only one simulation time which is more efficient computationally in order to develop storm profile firstly a number of different sea states according to their sea spectrum should be defined then ewa approach will apply to design intensifying wave train for harsh environment that representing storm situation the fundamentals of ewa method is discussed in section 2 clarifying all relevant hydrodynamic theories used in this paper fig 1 presents an overview of the hydrodynamic analysis for generating icnw function based on ewa afterwards the structure will encountered with storm for hydrodynamic modelling of a floating system the final response results are then adopted for estimating the edp for each storm condition to evaluate performance of the structure the results will show that possible situation that the structure will exceed the survival condition during storm 4 application of the developed methodology a case study 4 1 scenario development to demonstrate the application of developed methodology a case study is adopted for performance analysis of sevan 1000 floating storage unit fsu encountering storm this unit was intended to operate on the mariner field in the united kingdom sector of the north sea hanssen 2013 previously a number of conventional studies were carried out to investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics of this unit focusing on its performance however not in harsh environment and storm condition anundsen 2008 hanssen 2013 in the present paper sevan hull encountered to designed storm profile due to extreme environmental loads for evaluating the dynamic behavior of the structure in survival condition according to brindley and comley 2014 a number of catastrophic failures are occurred on these structures operating in the north sea due to its harsh environmental conditions this highlights the need for developing a robust methodology that evaluate performance of the structure more realistically in storm conditions 4 2 developing icnw storm profile step 1 in order to develop the icnw storm wave profile eleven sea state thresholds are considered the sea states used in implementing the icnw profile respect to each sea state are presented in table 1 to model the random and irregular nature of sea wave elevationsjonswap spectrum is used for different sea state each sea states represent a spectrum s k Ï for different kth level of storm which is shown as sea states in table 1 the considered survival limits for fsu operation based on the suggestions by anundsen 2008 are defined as maximum wave height of 19 m maximum roll angle of 9 maximum surge and heave responses of 12 m and 13 m respectively using the icnw profile and considering these operational safety limits hydrodynamic analysis of the fsu conducted to evaluate the performance of the structure under different level of storm condition moreover to show the advantage of this method in reducing the simulation time the superimposed conventional random sea elevation rse is compared with icnw as presented in fig 3 as illustrated in the figure the rse profile needs more simulation time to observe extreme wave heights it is usual to run numerical simulation of hydrodynamic analysis for 3 h for each sea states to observe desired extreme wave heights as recommended by chen and moan 2004 ren et al 2015 veritas 2007 that is for each sea state eleven 3 h simulations are needed to be carried out in order to obtain a realistic representation of storm however to generate icnw profile for this site only 1100 s of simulation time is required to observe different level of extreme storm conditions in one individual simulation for hydrodynamic analysis as an example sea states five and eleven are illustrated individually in fig 3 to emphasize differences between these two approaches and how the time domain in icnw reaches its highest level in a much shorter time in the figure the wave spectrum for these sea states are shown above the surface elevation profile providing a qualitative representation of eq 1 and eq 2 described in 2 1 4 3 hydrodynamic analysis step 2 in this study orcaflex software is used to conduct the hydrodynamic analysis icnw wave profile is inputted manually in the software to conduct the simulation process and time domain analysis the simulations are then carried out to investigate performance of the fsu to

represneted in fig 4 also the relevant survival limit states are illustrated in each plot to show the effect of intensifying level of storm in each sea state on the performance of the structure it is found that when the storm reach to the significant wave height of 12 56 m which is 9th level in the designed wave profile then the heave and surge motion exceed the survival condition limit this limit for roll degree will surpass in 10th level in significant wave height of 14 15 m in general the vessel can survive for a wide range of incident waves lower than 9th level to being in safe zone these criteria are essential for future risk and reliability analysis of the marine floating structure during their operation to minimize any possible structural failure such as capsizing the vessel due to harsh conditions it is also essential to investigate the coupled motions of the structure during storm to define the situations that exceed the survival limit for this purpose trajectory plot of transition and rotational motion are considered to illustrate the stochastic dynamic behavior of the vessel fig 5 represents the trajectory motions of roll pitch and surge sway degrees respectively the results highlight the critical borders in which the vessel will experience extreme responses resulting in capsizing or major damage on the structure due to impact of sea loads moreover the graph shows the frequency of the cases that vessel exceed its safe limit for example during the storm condition in the simulation time of 1100 s the vessel pass the safe border three times for pitch angle and nine times for sway direction these are imperative values for future risk and reliability analysis to estimate the likelihood that a structure remains in the unsafe zone the survival conditions are shown in the plots to clarify structure exceed the critical limits these graphs are important for future failure analysis of the structure as it shows the number of occurrence that the structure exceed the survival condition by intensifying the storm level the discrepancy of the coupled responses will increase drastically this means that the structure will experience extreme responses that will affect the marine operation the border that is highlighted in both figures show the safe region during the storm the coupled response of surge sway is more likely to exceed the survival limit condition while the dispersion of the roll pitch motion increase by intensifying the storm all these stochastic behaviours will cause intolerable operation situation due to large motions either for structure or human life these response should be considered to improve the safety of the operation and to examine the safety of the structural performance in different levels of the storm 5 conclusion

the vessel for transition and rotational response demonstrates the effect of storm on the performance of the structure the results of this study highlight that the proposed methodology can be used as a useful framework for future risk and reliability analysis considering the dynamic behavior of a floating structure to minimize the possible failures such as capsizing this analysis enables the
