11660,uttarakhand maharashtra assam meghalaya are the potential areas to study the precipitation perform trend analysis and calculate the probable maximum precipitation probable maximum precipitation pmp has virtually zero risk of being exceeded for a given catchment area over a certain duration of time the present work applies hershfield method to determine the pmp for rainfall data for the high rainfall regions of uttarakhand maharashtra assam meghalaya assam and meghalaya are considered as one region gumbel method which is an extreme value distribution function is used to obtain the extreme value ev of precipitation further the obtained pmp and ev values are compared with high rainfall months of la niña years observation of the results showed that the obtained values from hershfield method are greater than the la niña years precipitation values that have been observed till 2017 thus validating the obtained results the outcomes from probable maximum precipitation pmp works give insights into the extreme rainfall that can ever happen in a given catchment the result obtained serves as indispensable input data for designing structures like dams reservoirs spillways flood protection walls sluice gates weirs etc the design life of hydraulic structures is worked out using probable maximum precipitation pmf the adopted technique and results of this study can be directly used as a design parameter for design as well as for water resources management graphical abstract image 1 keywords pmp hershfield method gumbel ev1 distribution annual maximum series data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction structures such as dams barrages weirs flood protection walls etc serve the purpose of storing water regulating floods hydropower generation and maintaining a continuous supply of water throughout the year floodwater regulation is one of the important functions of these structures for safety storing surplus water and compensating for water deficiency india has precipitation diversity in its regions therefore the structures should be designed in such a way that they can accommodate maximum discharge without compromising safety and economy one of the most common causes of flood is uncontrolled intense precipitation in a short span of time hence the flood discharge in many areas is highly dependent on the precipitation received in the catchment for example floods in the brahmaputra river floodplains have occurred regularly in assam since 1998 heavy rains in higher reaches and floodplains of uttarakhand have been reasoned for significant flooding in the ganga river basin somil swarnkar et al 2021 the probable maximum flood pmf is used to define the maximum flood discharge that can occur in a certain period however the calculation of probable maximum precipitation pmp is preferred due to the unavailability of data on flood discharge kulkarni et al 2010a b pmp is a safety value considered while designing the structures and can be calculated using different methods which depend on area and precipitation data sometimes kunkel et al 2013 pmp values with a very high return period and low frequency of occurrence are not taken into account for designing the structure may be over designed for the other lower values of precipitation and lead to ignorance of economic parameters casas et al 2011 the pmp values of the study areas give the safe value of the required capacity for structures that can be used to allow safe and economic design this may be useful in the determination of the return periods between which the estimated pmp lies the present study was undertaken for different regions to achieve the following objectives i calculate probable maximum precipitation using gumbel method and hershfield method and ii compare these values with the maximum ever observed precipitation for uttarakhand maharashtra assam and meghalaya region assam and meghalaya considered as one 2 literature review over time several existing studies suggest how pmp calculations have changed over time mean pmp calculations for the krishna river basin using the hershfield method and gumbel extreme value ev type 1 distribution showed that the value is highly dependent upon available rainfall data and the frequency factor for each station considering the long term rainfall the coefficient of variation is used to smoothen out large errors and to maintain continuity statistical and wmo methods 1986 used for quality control of meteorological data used to observe a wide disparity in pmp calculated by a statistical approach showed that the minimum feasible time of observation for pmp calculation to observe the certain trend is 20 years trinidad region and the considered areal reductions lead to an increase in the degree of correction jaggernath and shrivastava 2006 certain new methods were tried and tested out such as the storm precipitation analysis system with nexrad and storm based approaches with grid point methodology for the trinidad region tomlinson et al 2008 the study area was subjected to study this time with depth duration depth area duration dad and storm transposition method with help of the barrier correction grid method another study jaggernath and shrivastava 2006 was seen using the same method as of 2006 for trinidad region to get the same observations analysis of the mae surai river was carried out using storm maximization and transposition to observe that pmp values determined by the statistical method were significantly underestimated due to the unavailability of daily rainfall records tingsanchali and tanmanee 2012 the pmp from storm maximization and transposition were used as representative values due to their consistency further analysis of pmf was carried out using wrf weather research and forecasting region configurations weather control sensitivity simulations and post processing of gcm global circulation method projects liu et al 2022 panday and kumar 2022 for the mahanadi river basin the storm model approach and hershfield with a statistical approach were used and observations on the same suggested that the hershfield approach tends to give higher pmp estimates when compared to storm model sagar rohidas chavan et al 2015 for the alabama coosa tallapoosa river located in georgia united states the conventional hmr hydro meteorological risk approach with the rhm method and moisture maximization were used for the analysis both methods provided comparable results for a 6 h storm duration but when numerically sorted pmp was greater than the conventional one deeksha rastogi et al 2017 a similar method was adopted for the dartmouth catchment present in victoria that is important to stochastic storm regression and stochastic storm transposition results and it was seen that both of the methods gave similar estimates the considerable variation in the results was seen due to the locations nathan et al 2016 statistical techniques the gumbel method chow frequency factor method and burr distribution were used for analysis at brazos river and results concluded that burr distribution is the best method for the different duration on an average basis a study showed that among generalized extreme value distribution log normal log pearson type iii and gumbel ev1 log normal gave a comparatively almost realistic result closer to the observed one for the return period if data is larger with moderate values kamal et al 2017 agro ecological regions of sri lanka were

ultimately comparing the statistical and physical methods south african region was studied using a generalized technique of hershfield and gumbel method meteorological methods pmp takes into account the physical characteristics of the atmosphere but it may give a very high value of pmp a study in north america calculated operational frequency using the bivariate extreme value analysis

in respective years to obtain mean median standard deviation and variance table 1 fig 1 indicates indian regions picked up for study purposes namely uttarakhand maharashtra meghalaya and assam also show the variation of time series for the three regions 1918 2017 uttarakhand formerly known as uttaranchal is an indian state located in the country s northwest region it is primarily bounded by himachal pradesh in the northwest the chinese tibet autonomous region in the northeast nepal in the southeast and uttar pradesh in the south and southwest the zone is separated into two linear ranges the mussoorie and the nag tibba the kumaun himalayas comprise himadri himachal and siwalik ranges the siwalik range s southern border meets the bhabar a narrow bed of gravel and alluvium that links to the swampy tarai to the southeast northern soil types range from gravel to heavy clay in the south direction shallow and gravelly brown forest soil with a high organic content can be found according to observed rainfall variability and changes over uttarakhand state the southwest monsoon that usually occurs from july to september causes most of the annual precipitation in uttarakhand and amounts to around 1500 mm floods and landslides are common in low lying areas during the season july is the wettest month in uttarakhand that receives 35 of southwest monsoon rainfall followed by august with 33 of the same during this time 79 of the annual rainfall falls between june and september chamoli and uttarkashi districts located in uttarakhand receive 70 of their annual rainfall while pauri garhwal and champawat districts in uttarakhand receive 90 93 other regions of uttarakhand such as pittorgarh chapawat and dehradun receive the most annual rainfall 1400 mm 1600mm while uttarkashi and almora receive the least 800 900 mm udham singh nagar receives the least 962 mm while pittorgarh district receives about 2045 10 mm over the year nainital bageshwar chamoli and rudraprayag districts have seen considerable increases whereas pauri garhwal district has seen significant decreases as per the studies conducted for years 1989 2018 maharashtra has a geographical range of 15⁰45 north to 22⁰00 north latitude and 72⁰45 east to 80⁰45 east longitude it has a unique geomorphic unit the deccan plateau covers a considerable portion of maharashtra the state s plateau character is its most prominent significant feature the konkan and the western ghat west coast of india as well as the plateau are the three natural divisions of this state physio graphically maharashtra gets most of its rain from the south west monsoon panday et al 2021 maharashtra s geography is quite flat maharashtra s most dominant structure is the western ghats the state s backbone is the sahyadri mountain range the mountains are higher in the northern regions of the state specifically mahabaleshwar 1438 m it is an essential feature of the state s physiology since it blocks monsoon bearing winds and causes rain in the eastern section of the maharashtra region the ranges serve as the primary drainage basin for western river systems the mountains are the most important drainage basin for western and central india s river systems the deccan plateau which is flanked on the west and east by the western and eastern ghats covers the majority of india s peninsular region maharashtra encompasses the majority of the northern deccan the plateau s elevation can range from 450 to 750 m the study area covers the assam meghalaya region which lies in the northeastern region of india although the two regions are approximately 320 km apart but receive rainfall almost in the same pattern irrespective of the intensity or amount meghalaya state was formed from two districts of assam namely united khasi hills and jaintia hills on january 21 1972 the area is housed in ganol daring sanda bandra and simsang rivers the state is the wettest region of india with the wettest area in the south khasi hills the khasi hills have recorded rainfall of 12000 mm of rain in a year 70 of the land is covered with forest the western part of the plateau comprises garo hills with lower level experiencing the hottest temperature the lower range of temperature is experienced by shillong where the temperature barely goes above 28 c whereas sub zero temperatures are common in winter it has an area of 22 429 km2 several streams and rivers flow out of the plateau some major hydraulic structures such as umiam baramani i e the major source of hydroelectric power for the assam meghalaya area also present in the region the state has a large number of untapped resources including coal limestone mica quartz and other minerals the electricity for the state is produced wholly by hydroelectric power due to heavy showers of rainfall and in the extremely scarce rainfall condition it needs to be imported therefore hydropower is highly important in the state and also the need to study the area s rainfall pattern the rainfall in the country varies substantially there is inadequate rainfall in rain shadow regions withinside the significant part the maximum crucial aspect which impacts the weather is the massive presence of the western ghats which block the monsoon bearing winds coming from the arabian sea and which reasons rainfall the area of the northeast will be of interest to the government in future years and may experience foreign investment from japan fan and huang 2020 being a region with heavy rainfall throughout the year and packing major potential for future development moves our topic of research from myopic to a matter of public interest acknowledging extreme rainfall and carrying out corresponding calculations to predict the pmp and disaster return periods to design structures with a sufficient value of safety factors to minimize loss of life and property the scope of the study is to give the values of discharge and return period which can be used for economic planning safe design of bridges and construction of flood hazard zones located at the periphery of rivers and streams with large catchments in all study regions as mentioned earlier present in india 4 methodology there are many methods used for the calculation of pmp which could be categorized as hydro meteorological and statistical methods these methods use the approach of moisture maximization storm transposition generalized storm separation depth area method etc among the methods mentioned above the statistical methods include the hershfield method as well as its variants probabilistic approach and multifractal method the concept behind the hershfield method is that it provides the physical upper limit to the precipitation that can fall over a specific area in a given duration it gives the probably super safe structure that cannot fail the other methods available for the estimation of pmp require other meteorological data also like temperature wind speed humidity etc sarkar et al 2020 hershfield s method requires only long term precipitation data the long time series data ensures that pmp estimates are closer to the other physical models like moisture maximization storm transportation etc the study areas are selected to get results that belong to different flood plains in india uttarakhand maharashtra assam meghalaya and have different drainage areas i e 70 614 17 840 and 53 483 km2 respectively the annual and monthly rainfall data from 1918 to 2017 was sorted and essential statistical data values were calculated for the calculation of pmp using the hershfield method including the frequency the time series is analysed for any trend using the mann kendall test rainfall versus time for peak monsoon months average rainfall versus time frequency histograms and la niña events for all respective years in duration from 1918 to 2017 were plotted and the data was again box plotted to convert the recorded observations into a presentable form based on statistical tools the probable maximum precipitation for each region was calculated brief detail about the statistical method used is presented below to detect the trend in the present hydrological time series the non parametric mann kendall mk statistical test is used the test requires serially independent sample data the presence of serial correlation in time series will influence the capacity of the test to appropriately determine the significance of the trend when sample data are serially correlated 1 s z 1 n 1 j z 1 n s g n x j x z 2 s g n x j x z 1 i f x j x z 0 0 i f x j x z 0 1 i f x j x z 0 where n is the length of the sample x z and x j are from z 1 2 n 1 and j z 1 n if n is bigger than 8 statistic s approximates to normal distribution the mean of s is 0 and the variance of s can be acquired as follows 3 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 18 then the test statistic z is denoted by 4 z s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 if z 0 it indicates an increasing trend and vice versa given a confidence level α the sequential data would be supposed to experience a statistically significant trend if z z 1 α 2 where z 1 α 2 is the corresponding value of p α 2 following the standard normal distribution a positive auto correlation in the time series hampers the power of mk test to detect the trend autocorrelation in the dataset needs to be calculated hamed and rao 1998 have highlighted the importance of calculating the autocorrelation while applying mann kendall test if the autocorrelation is detected in the first lag then modified mk test hamed and rao modified mk test should be applied to detect the underlying trend these changes have incorporated in the manuscript in the present analysis we are having very low value of autocorrelation and hence original mk test is sufficient for the trend analysis the dataset is subjected to the mann kendall test to identify the possible trend the result of the mann kendall test is summarized in table 2 hershfield method 5 p m p x k σ n 1 6 k p m p m 1 s m 1 x average of annual maximum series σn 1 standard deviation pm maximum value of annual maximum series pm 1 mean of annual maximum series excluding the maximum value sm 1 standard deviation of annual maximum series excluding the maximum value the method of estimating the probability of occurrence of maximum precipitation for hydrologic design is to fit a pre calculated distribution cycle of maximum rainfall the second method followed in the study is gumbel extreme value distribution for return period calculation using the above gumbel extreme value distribution to annual maximum rainfall data series for 50 100 and 1000 years these values are then plotted on base maps of study regions n sample size yn reduced variate sn reduced standard deviation 7 y t ln ln t t

results attained from the gumbel method the sample data was then arranged for the weibull probability distribution method involves the statistical ranking of data and calculating the probability of exceedance the obtained probabilities are then used to calculate the return period once return periods are calculated the respective discharge for obtained pmp values is also calculated the most popular method is hershfield method as of now fig 3 explains the methodology used for the present study in the form of a flowchart it lists the stepwise flow of the work 5 results and discussion the values of mean standard deviation and the highest observed value of precipitation were calculated and the descriptive statistics are given in table 1 a similar pattern is seen for median and variance this gives a rough idea that the long term precipitation would be behaving in the same way for all three regions although correlation analysis must be done to confirm the same fig 2 shows the box plot of the given data the box plot of assam and meghalaya is higher as compared to the other regions highlighting the fact that it receives more rain as compared to the other two regions the result shows no trend in the case of maharashtra assam and meghalaya while there is a decreasing trend in uttarakhand this dataset is cleaned of the trend using linear detrending it involves subtracting each value of the time series at time t with the previous value at time t 1 the resultant dataset is linear fig 4 shows the frequency distribution for the dataset the distribution shows skewness as compared to the standard normal distribution this is expected of the long term precipitation dataset finally the utility of pmp values and return period values from all three approaches are evaluated also the comparison of pmp values with the la niña years shows that the pmp predicted is expected to be more than the discharge obtained in the previous la niña years the precipitation values for 50 100 and 1000 return periods were obtained and it was interpreted that the pmp value for uttarakhand and maharashtra will have a return period of more than 50 years while that for assam meghalaya will have a return period of more than 100 years the pmp value of uttarakhand was found to be 696 61 mm which when compared to the discharges obtained for different return periods allows interpretation that the return period of this value lies between 50 and 100 years similarly assam meghalaya shows values of 1035 22 mm which lies between return periods of 100 1000 years the same can be known about the pmp of 427 57 mm for maharashtra which may have a return period of fewer than 50 years the pmp is compared with precipitation observed in either la niña years showing that it is close to or more than it fig 5 table 2 summarises the results obtained la niña years are associated with the largest floods in india afzali gorouh et al 2018 and hencecomparison of obtained pmp values will be the required validation of the results obtained the obtained result hence also validates the definition of pmp the precipitation value which theoretically cannot be exceeded therefore the findings in this study are justified the present analysis uses the hershfield method which is based entirely on the precipitation data the is one limitation of the hershfield method but as clear from the methodology section studies by sarkar et al 2020 show that if the length of the time series is very large 100 years in the present case and hence more than appropriate the estimates of the hershfield method closely relate with the storm transportation and the moisture maximization method hence this limitation is resolved this makes the hershfield method a very popular choice for pmp analysis 6 conclusion the pmp value serves as important design input for the design of structures especially dams the present work has analysed the precipitation data for the high rainfall regions of india the selected states for the study are uttarakhand maharashtra assam and meghalaya the trend analysis showed no trends for assam meghalaya and maharashtra while there was a decreasing trend for uttarakhand neglecting the trend the resulting annual maximum series was subjected to statistical analysis for the calculation of pmp the results obtained from hershfield statistical method and gumbel method are compared with the la niña years rainfall the precipitation values are found to be greater than those obtained during the la niña years for all the study regions ideally any hydraulic structure designed using pmp has zero risk of failure the idea over here is to come up with the safest design value that can be used to design hydraulic structures economically from the study it can be concluded that the pmp value and the maximum observed la niña value is not drastic this present study can be directly used to design the hydraulic structures for the study regions considered without the risk of failure

khasi hills and jaintia hills on january 21 1972 the area is housed in ganol daring sanda bandra and simsang rivers the state is the wettest region of india with the wettest area in the south khasi hills the khasi hills have recorded rainfall of 12000 mm of rain in a year 70 of the land is covered with forest the western part of the plateau comprises garo hills with lower level experiencing the hottest temperature the lower range of temperature is experienced by shillong where the temperature barely goes above 28 c whereas sub zero temperatures are common in winter it has an area of 22 429 km2 several streams and rivers flow out of the plateau some major hydraulic structures such as umiam baramani i e the major source of hydroelectric power for the assam meghalaya area also present in the region the state has a large number of untapped resources including coal limestone mica quartz and other minerals the electricity for the state is produced wholly by hydroelectric power due to heavy showers of rainfall and in the extremely scarce rainfall condition it needs to be imported therefore hydropower is highly important in the state and also the need to study the area s rainfall pattern the rainfall in the country varies substantially there is inadequate rainfall in rain shadow regions withinside the significant part the maximum crucial aspect which impacts the weather is the massive presence of the western ghats which block the monsoon bearing winds coming from the arabian sea and which reasons rainfall the area of the northeast will be of interest to the government in future years and may experience foreign investment from japan fan and huang 2020 being a region with heavy rainfall throughout the year and packing major potential for future development moves our topic of research from myopic to a matter of public interest acknowledging extreme rainfall and carrying out corresponding calculations to predict the pmp and disaster return periods to design structures with a sufficient value of safety factors to minimize loss of life and property the scope of the study is to give the values of discharge and return period which can be used for economic planning safe design of bridges and construction of flood hazard zones located at the periphery of rivers and streams with large catchments in all study regions as mentioned earlier present in india 4 methodology there are many methods used for the calculation of pmp which could be categorized as hydro meteorological and statistical methods these methods use the approach of moisture maximization storm transposition generalized storm separation depth area method etc among the methods mentioned above the statistical methods include the hershfield method as well as its variants probabilistic approach and multifractal method the concept behind the hershfield method is that it provides the physical upper limit to the precipitation that can fall over a specific area in a given duration it gives the probably super safe structure that cannot fail the other methods available for the estimation of pmp require other meteorological data also like temperature wind speed humidity etc sarkar et al 2020 hershfield s method requires only long term precipitation data the long time series data ensures that pmp estimates are closer to the other physical models like moisture maximization storm transportation etc the study areas are selected to get results that belong to different flood plains in india uttarakhand maharashtra assam meghalaya and have different drainage areas i e 70 614 17 840 and 53 483 km2 respectively the annual and monthly rainfall data from 1918 to 2017 was sorted and essential statistical data values were calculated for the calculation of pmp using the hershfield method including the frequency the time series is analysed for any trend using the mann kendall test rainfall versus time for peak monsoon months average rainfall versus time frequency histograms and la niña events for all respective years in duration from 1918 to 2017 were plotted and the data was again box plotted to convert the recorded observations into a presentable form based on statistical tools the probable maximum precipitation for each region was calculated brief detail about the statistical method used is presented below to detect the trend in the present hydrological time series the non parametric mann kendall mk statistical test is used the test requires serially independent sample data the presence of serial correlation in time series will influence the capacity of the test to appropriately determine the significance of the trend when sample data are serially correlated 1 s z 1 n 1 j z 1 n s g n x j x z 2 s g n x j x z 1 i f x j x z 0 0 i f x j x z 0 1 i f x j x z 0 where n is the length of the sample x z and x j are from z 1 2 n 1 and j z 1 n if n is bigger than 8 statistic s approximates to normal distribution the mean of s is 0 and the variance of s can be acquired as follows 3 v a r s n n 1 2 n 5 18 then the test statistic z is denoted by 4 z s 1 v a r s i f s 0 0 i f s 0 s 1 v a r s i f s 0 if z 0 it indicates an increasing trend and vice versa given a confidence level α the sequential data would be supposed to experience a statistically significant trend if z z 1 α 2 where z 1 α 2 is the corresponding value of p α 2 following the standard normal distribution a positive auto correlation in the time series hampers the power of mk test to detect the trend autocorrelation in the dataset needs to be calculated hamed and rao 1998 have highlighted the importance of calculating the autocorrelation while applying mann kendall test if the autocorrelation is detected in the first lag then modified mk test hamed and rao modified mk test should be applied to detect the underlying trend these changes have incorporated in the manuscript in the present analysis we are having very low value of autocorrelation and hence original mk test is sufficient for the trend analysis the dataset is subjected to the mann kendall test to identify the possible trend the result of the mann kendall test is summarized in table 2 hershfield method 5 p m p x k σ n 1 6 k p m p m 1 s m 1 x average of annual maximum series σn 1 standard deviation pm maximum value of annual maximum series pm 1 mean of annual maximum series excluding the maximum value sm 1 standard deviation of annual maximum series excluding the maximum value the method of estimating the probability of occurrence of maximum precipitation for hydrologic design is to fit a pre calculated distribution cycle of maximum rainfall the second method followed in the study is gumbel extreme value distribution for return period calculation using the above gumbel extreme value distribution to annual maximum rainfall data series for 50 100 and 1000 years these values are then plotted on base maps of study regions n sample size yn reduced variate sn reduced standard deviation 7 y t ln ln t t

results attained from the gumbel method the sample data was then arranged for the weibull probability distribution method involves the statistical ranking of data and calculating the probability of exceedance the obtained probabilities are then used to calculate the return period once return periods are calculated the respective discharge for obtained pmp values is also calculated the most popular method is hershfield method as of now fig 3 explains the methodology used for the present study in the form of a flowchart it lists the stepwise flow of the work 5 results and discussion the values of mean standard deviation and the highest observed value of precipitation were calculated and the descriptive statistics are given in table 1 a similar pattern is seen for median and variance this gives a rough idea that the long term precipitation would be behaving in the same way for all three regions although correlation analysis must be done to confirm the same fig 2 shows the box plot of the given data the box plot of assam and meghalaya is higher as compared to the other regions highlighting the fact that it receives more rain as compared to the other two regions the result shows no trend in the case of maharashtra assam and meghalaya while there is a decreasing trend in uttarakhand this dataset is cleaned of the trend using linear detrending it involves subtracting each value of the time series at time t with the previous value at time t 1 the resultant dataset is linear fig 4 shows the frequency distribution for the dataset the distribution shows skewness as compared to the standard normal distribution this is expected of the long term precipitation dataset finally the utility of pmp values and return period values from all three approaches are evaluated also the comparison of pmp values with the la niña years shows that the pmp predicted is expected to be more than the discharge obtained in the previous la niña years the precipitation values for 50 100 and 1000 return periods were obtained and it was interpreted that the pmp value for uttarakhand and maharashtra will have a return period of more than 50 years while that for assam meghalaya will have a return period of more than 100 years the pmp value of uttarakhand was found to be 696 61 mm which when compared to the discharges obtained for different return periods allows interpretation that the return period of this value lies between 50 and 100 years similarly assam meghalaya shows values of 1035 22 mm which lies between return periods of 100 1000 years the same can be known about the pmp of 427 57 mm for maharashtra which may have a return period of fewer than 50 years the pmp is compared with precipitation observed in either la niña years showing that it is close to or more than it fig 5 table 2 summarises the results obtained la niña years are associated with the largest floods in india afzali gorouh et al 2018 and hencecomparison of obtained pmp values will be the required validation of the results obtained the obtained result hence also validates the definition of pmp the precipitation value which theoretically cannot be exceeded therefore the findings in this study are justified the present analysis uses the hershfield method which is based entirely on the precipitation data the is one limitation of the hershfield method but as clear from the methodology section studies by sarkar et al 2020 show that if the length of the time series is very large 100 years in the present case and hence more than appropriate the estimates of the hershfield method closely relate with the storm transportation and the moisture maximization method hence this limitation is resolved this makes the hershfield method a very popular choice for pmp analysis 6 conclusion the pmp value serves as important design input for the design of structures especially dams the present work has analysed the precipitation data for the high rainfall regions of india the selected states for the study are uttarakhand maharashtra assam and meghalaya the trend analysis showed no trends for assam meghalaya and maharashtra while there was a decreasing trend for uttarakhand neglecting the trend the resulting annual maximum series was subjected to statistical analysis for the calculation of pmp the results obtained from hershfield statistical method and gumbel method are compared with the la niña years rainfall the precipitation values are found to be greater than those obtained during the la niña years for all the study regions ideally any hydraulic structure designed using pmp has zero risk of failure the idea over here is to come up with the safest design value that can be used to design hydraulic structures economically from the study it can be concluded that the pmp value and the maximum observed la niña value is not drastic this present study can be directly used to design the hydraulic structures for the study regions considered without the risk of failure

groundwater resources in this regard the current study evaluates potability of groundwater in coastal villages of the khambhat region gujarat india chemical analysis of 57 groundwater samples was carried out to examine important potable water quality indicators weighted arithmetic groundwater quality index gwqi and entropy weighed groundwater pollution index egpi were evaluated to categorize the groundwater into different potable water quality and pollution zones furthermore spatial maps were generated using various geospatial analysis to represent the geographic distribution of potable groundwater quality and groundwater pollution zones according to calculated gwqi and egpi the calculated average value of gwqi is 265 66 with the highest and lowest gwqi values being 479 57 and 93 45 respectively gwqi values of 26 32 of samples were more than 300 indicating that the quality of groundwater is not acceptable as potable water the calculated values of egpi are from 0 8 to 4 13 with an average value of 2 35 which reflects that more than 66 of groundwater samples are very high to extremely high polluted category graphical abstract image 1 keywords groundwater quality groundwater

resources are present on earth and people have used these resources to advance human civilization chakraborty et al 2021 natural resources are becoming scarcer in the twenty first century and it is crucial time for us to realize that these resources will soon run out as the globe enters an era of a worldwide natural resources crisis chakraborty et al 2012 dasgupta et al 2015 bhattacharyya et al 2022 water is one of the most significant natural resources that the environment supplies to maintain human growth ramachandran et al 2021 from the total water resources of the world only 2 5 are fresh water resources that can be utilized for various human activities giwa et al 2017 surface water meets the demands of the populace for a variety of purposes as it is readily accessible at the surface however surface water is more vulnerable to contamination and its irregular dispersion leads to considering groundwater as an alternate resource p j s kumar and augustine 2022 groundwater is utilized as potable water and for other domestic needs by approximately 66 of the inhabitants of the globe rao et al 2021 in the past two decades the semi arid regions of india and the rest of the globe have seen dramatic growth in the demand for groundwater resources particularly for potable and irrigation water requirements adimalla and qian 2019 as a result groundwater is a substantial resource for rural regions of india accounting for more than 60 of supplied water for crop cultivation and 86 of potable water supply saha et al 2018 the quality of groundwater is majorly affected by rainfall the quality of surface water groundwater recharge and subsurface hydrogeochemical processes vasanthavigar et al 2010 even though it seems clean groundwater may contain a significant quantity of dissolved contaminants that degrade its quality beyene et al 2019 many geological terrains with fast industrialization urbanization population expansion agricultural development excessive fertilizer usage massive evaporation and limited rainfall have experienced groundwater pollution adimalla and qian 2019 the deterioration of groundwater quality in coastal stretches across the globe is a prevalent issue that also causes significant concern saltwater ingress air driven sea spray excessive evaporation and seawater mixing all contribute to a rise in groundwater salinity kamaraj et al 2021 the quality of groundwater has become a major threat especially in rural areas where the inhabitants are heavily reliant on groundwater batabyal and chakraborty 2015 since water quality has a direct influence on the health of the inhabitants who consume it the bureau of indian standards bis and the world health organization who have established drinking water standards for specific chemical parameters of potable water if the permissible thresholds for contaminants in potable water are exceeded it may lead to health hazards rao et al 2021 the previous studies conducted along the coast of gujarat have stated that seawater intrusion is the primary reason for contamination of groundwater in addition to anthropogenic activities in the region soni and pujari 2010 rina et al 2013 maurya et al 2019 bhagat et al 2021 bhagat et al 2021 furthermore the results of the earlier studies conducted to investigate salinity along the coast of gujarat have reported that the gulf of khambhat region is under greater influence of seawater intrusion compared to south gujarat and saurashtra region bhagat et al 2021 this necessitates a comprehensive appraisal and surveillance of groundwater quality to identify its potability in this regard the objective of the current study is to investigate potability of the groundwater in the coastal villages of khambhat and borsad talukas of anand district gujarat india furthermore the groundwater of the region is categorized in different zones for the purpose of drinking based on two distinct indices i groundwater quality index gwqi

water quality and a valuable technique for informing decision makers about the status of water quality for potability verma et al 2020 it integrates numerous groundwater quality indicator parameters into a single score by identifying weighing and aggregating them gao et al 2020 in the current research the groundwater quality index was calculated considering drinking water quality standards published by bis and who which are given in table 1 bis 2012 who 2017 the weighted arithmetic method was employed for calculating the water quality index in which the weight is assigned to each selected water quality parameter based on decision maker s judgement one of the subjective weighting method vasanthavigar et al 2010 odu 2019 saikrishna et al 2020 verma et al 2020 ramachandran et al 2021 four steps are followed to compute gwqi at each sampling locations step 1 each of the analyzed chemical parameters except carbonate which has no recommendation value for drinking water bis who was allocated a weight w from 1 to 5 based on their impact on the potability of groundwater table 1 the highest weight 5 was assigned to parameters i e tds chloride fluoride and nitrate which have a notable impact and the lowest weight 1 was assigned to parameters i e bicarbonate which has less impact moreover weight 4 was assigned to parameters ph sodium and sulfate weight 3 to parameters calcium and magnesium and weight 2 to parameter potassium step 2 the comparative weight cwi of individual parameters is evaluated using eq 1 and the evaluated value of cwi of individual parameter is given in table 1 eq 1 c w i w i i 1 n w i where c w i is the comparative weight ith parameter wi is the assigned weight of ith parameter and n is the number of parameters step 3 the percentage quality

regions the pollution index of groundwater has been used efficiently to assess drinking water quality subba rao and chaudhary 2019 hossain and patra 2020 kamaraj et al 2021 nath et al 2021 in the current study the groundwater pollution index was calculated by assigning weight to individual pollutant factors using entropy method which is one of the objective weighting methods islam et al 2020 zhe et al 2021 p j s kumar and augustine 2022 in the objective weighting methods parameters weights are assigned using mathematical formulas without any concern of the decision maker s opinion odu 2019 the method to calculate the egpi consists of the following steps step 1 create a water quality matrix by using the following matrix x x 11 x 12 x 1 b x 21 x 22 x 2 b x a 1 x a 2 x a b where a i 1 2 3 a is the count of samples b j 1 2 3 b is the count of pollutant factors of individual sample step 2 estimate normalized values pij using a method called generating quotient after range

spatial maps of different groundwater quality parameters such as ph tds calcium magnesium sodium chloride sulfate potassium carbonate bicarbonate fluoride and nitrate at different sampling locations were generated in arcgis 10 3 software various geostatistical and non geostatistical spatial interpolation techniques were used widely by various researchers to estimate concentration of the parameter at the unsampled locations verma et al 2020 ijumulana et al 2021 2022 in present study spatial analyst tool named inverse distance weighted idw which is based on one of the non geostatistical spatial interpolation method was used to generate spatial map showing geographic distribution of concentration of each quality parameter in the study region fig 2 furthermore spatial maps of groundwater

correlation among various parameters involved in the research by correlation coefficient r kothari et al 2021 the value of r ranges from 1 to 1 r 0 6 to 1 indicates strong positive linear correlation and r 0 6 to 1 indicates strong negative linear correlation between two parameters whereas r 0 2 or 0 2 specifies weak correlation between two parameters moreover the correlation between two calculated indices i e gwqi and egpi was also computed to establish the effectiveness of the study using two different indices 3 result and discussion the result of the concentration of various hydrochemical parameters of individual groundwater samples were examined chemically in the laboratory are recorded table 2 spatial variation of concentration of individual parameter in the study

locations and fig 4 shows spatial zones of groundwater quality status for potability of the research region according to gwqi classification which was generated using arcgis 10 3 software the calculated highest and lowest gwqi values were 479 57 and 93 45 respectively with an average of 265 66 gwqi values of 15 sampling locations 26 32 of samples were more than 300 which indicates that the quality of groundwater is not acceptable as potable water approximately 50 of groundwater samples were categorized as very poor quality whereas 21 of the samples were of poor quality specifying that the water is not potable only two groundwater samples 3 5 of samples of villages umlav and sisva of borsad taluka were categorized as good quality moreover not even a single sample was of excellent quality water table 4 3 2 groundwater potability assessment according to egpi the groundwater pollution index was evaluated using the entropy weighted method the uppermost value of calculated egpi was 4 13 the lowermost was 0 8 and the mean value of 2 35 the calculated values of egpi along with groundwater pollution status at each 57 sampling locations are presented in table 5 the highest calculated value of egpi was 4 13 observed in the groundwater sample collected from motipura village of khambhat taluka and the lowest value was 0 8 in the sample collected from sisva village of

analysis a correlation matrix of parameters namely ph total dissolved solids calcium magnesium sodium chloride sulfate potassium carbonate bicarbonate fluoride and nitrate gwqi value and egpi value was constructed and presented in table 7 tds shows strong positive linear correlation with magnesium r 0 66 sodium r 0 88 and chloride r 0 81 chloride is strongly correlated with magnesium r 0 61 and sodium r 0 62 a strong positive correlation of gwqi with tds r 0 96 calcium r 0 61 magnesium r 0 79 sodium r 0 82 and chloride r 0 83 was observed among all the parameters tds shows the highest correlation with gwqi indicating tds as the most significant contributory parameter to evaluating potability of the groundwater similarly egpi is also strongly correlated with tds r 0 93 calcium r 0 61 magnesium r 0 85 sodium r 0 77 and chloride r 0 73 with the highest correlation with tds indicating tds as the most important parameter to determine status of groundwater pollution furthermore values of gwqi and egpi show a strong positive correlation r 0 97 with each other confirming the effectiveness of the study 4 conclusion in the current study the total dissolved solids in all the collected samples were more than 1000 mg l with an average value of 3438 68 mg l specifying the region is under the influence of water salinity moreover two groundwater indices gwqi egpi for each sampling location were calculated employing two different criteria weighting methods i e subjective weighting method for calculating gwqi and objective weighting method for calculating egpi to classify the groundwater of coastal villages of the khambhat region in different categories of potabilty the gwqi assessment indicated that more than 26 32 of groundwater samples were unfit to use as potable water owing to extremely poor water quality additionally the results of egpi reflect that more than 66 of the collected groundwater samples were high to extremely high polluted category furthermore correlation analysis shows gwqi is strongly correlated with egpi r 0 974 ensuring both the methods are equally efficient to evaluate potability of groundwater in general the statistics show that the rural inhabitants residing in the research region are at high threat of possible health consequences from consuming such quality water immediate remedial measurements to regain the quality of groundwater resources need to be planned and implemented to preserve the significant natural resource declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

resources are present on earth and people have used these resources to advance human civilization chakraborty et al 2021 natural resources are becoming scarcer in the twenty first century and it is crucial time for us to realize that these resources will soon run out as the globe enters an era of a worldwide natural resources crisis chakraborty et al 2012 dasgupta et al 2015 bhattacharyya et al 2022 water is one of the most significant natural resources that the environment supplies to maintain human growth ramachandran et al 2021 from the total water resources of the world only 2 5 are fresh water resources that can be utilized for various human activities giwa et al 2017 surface water meets the demands of the populace for a variety of purposes as it is readily accessible at the surface however surface water is more vulnerable to contamination and its irregular dispersion leads to considering groundwater as an alternate resource p j s kumar and augustine 2022 groundwater is utilized as potable water and for other domestic needs by approximately 66 of the inhabitants of the globe rao et al 2021 in the past two decades the semi arid regions of india and the rest of the globe have seen dramatic growth in the demand for groundwater resources particularly for potable and irrigation water requirements adimalla and qian 2019 as a result groundwater is a substantial resource for rural regions of india accounting for more than 60 of supplied water for crop cultivation and 86 of potable water supply saha et al 2018 the quality of groundwater is majorly affected by rainfall the quality of surface water groundwater recharge and subsurface hydrogeochemical processes vasanthavigar et al 2010 even though it seems clean groundwater may contain a significant quantity of dissolved contaminants that degrade its quality beyene et al 2019 many geological terrains with fast industrialization urbanization population expansion agricultural development excessive fertilizer usage massive evaporation and limited rainfall have experienced groundwater pollution adimalla and qian 2019 the deterioration of groundwater quality in coastal stretches across the globe is a prevalent issue that also causes significant concern saltwater ingress air driven sea spray excessive evaporation and seawater mixing all contribute to a rise in groundwater salinity kamaraj et

direct influence on the health of the inhabitants who consume it the bureau of indian standards bis and the world health organization who have established drinking water standards for specific chemical parameters of potable water if the permissible thresholds for contaminants in potable water are exceeded it may lead to health hazards rao et al 2021 the previous studies conducted along the coast of gujarat have stated that seawater intrusion is the primary reason for contamination of groundwater in addition to anthropogenic activities in the region soni and pujari 2010 rina et al 2013 maurya et al 2019 bhagat et al 2021 bhagat et al 2021 furthermore the results of the earlier studies conducted to investigate salinity along the coast of gujarat have reported that the gulf of khambhat region is under greater influence of seawater intrusion compared to south gujarat and saurashtra region bhagat et al 2021 this necessitates a comprehensive appraisal and surveillance of groundwater quality to identify its potability in this regard the objective of the current study is to investigate potability of the groundwater in the coastal villages of khambhat and borsad talukas of anand district gujarat india furthermore the groundwater of the region is categorized in different zones for the purpose of drinking based on two distinct indices i groundwater quality index gwqi and ii entropy weighted groundwater pollution index egpi water quality indexing techniques are suggested and utilized as an appropriate tool for analyzing the condition of groundwater quality across the globe saeedi et al 2010 vasanthavigar et al 2010 batabyal and chakraborty 2015 verma et al 2020 ramachandran et al 2021 the wqi incorporates hydrochemical parameter concentration and weight data to provide a complete index to measure the quality of regional water environments in a brief and understandable manner to determine weights researchers have often employed subjective approaches such as expert rating and analytic hierarchy process ahp zhe et al 2021 the entropy concept in water quality evaluation has been employed regularly over the last decade and has been proven to be more efficient than other indexing approaches as in this method the weight of each parameter is assigned using mathematical formulas overcoming any human intervention adimalla et al 2020 subba rao et al

sodium r 0 62 a strong positive correlation of gwqi with tds r 0 96 calcium r 0 61 magnesium r 0 79 sodium r 0 82 and chloride r 0 83 was observed among all the parameters tds shows the highest correlation with gwqi indicating tds as the most significant contributory parameter to evaluating potability of the groundwater similarly egpi is also strongly correlated with tds r 0 93 calcium r 0 61 magnesium r 0 85 sodium r 0 77 and chloride r 0 73 with the highest correlation with tds indicating tds as the most important parameter to determine status of groundwater pollution furthermore values of gwqi and egpi show a strong positive correlation r 0 97 with each other confirming the effectiveness of the study 4 conclusion in the current study the total dissolved solids in all the collected samples were more than 1000 mg l with an average value of 3438 68 mg l specifying the region is under the influence of water salinity moreover two groundwater indices gwqi egpi for each sampling location were calculated employing two different criteria weighting methods i e subjective weighting method for calculating gwqi and objective weighting method for calculating egpi to classify the groundwater of coastal villages of the khambhat region in different categories of potabilty the gwqi assessment indicated that more than 26 32 of groundwater samples were unfit to use as potable water owing to extremely poor water quality additionally the results of egpi reflect that more than 66 of the collected groundwater samples were high to extremely high polluted category furthermore correlation analysis shows gwqi is strongly correlated with egpi r 0 974 ensuring both the methods are equally efficient to evaluate potability of groundwater in general the statistics show that the rural inhabitants residing in the research region are at high threat of possible health consequences from consuming such quality water immediate remedial measurements to regain the quality of groundwater resources need to be planned and implemented to preserve the significant natural resource declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

11662,groundwater are strategic water resources for irrigation and drinking purposes in the souss massa semi arid region morocco these resources have been threatened during the last decades by different factors such as drought over pumping and marine intrusion the latter is responsible for the degradation of the groundwater quality along the coastal area which is reducing its usability therefore the localisation of the freshwater saline water interface is essential for better sustainable management of groundwater resources in the area the objective of the present study is to assess the temporal changes the extent and the depth of the seawater intrusion in the souss massa coastal area to fulfil this objective two monitoring sites were equipped with water conductivity measurement devices subsurface monitoring device smd to observe the temporal changes of the salinity at a local scale as well as to support the interpretation of a transient electromagnetic tem survey this survey consisted of 83 tem soundings along thirteen profiles located perpendicularly to the ocean and the two rivers delineating the study area the data from the smd stations highlight the temporal changes of electrical conductivity ec with depth clearly illustrating the freshwater saltwater interface location in the central part of the study area 35 55 m ngm at the tifnit location ca 1 km from the coast in addition the results of the tem measurements show that the marine intrusion is already advanced towards the land over a maximum distance of 2500 m finally some new monitoring sites have been proposed to improve the current monitoring network for seawater intrusion and assess whether mitigation solutions lead to a slower progression of the seawater intrusion decision makers can use these results as a basis for the development and implementation of effective policies to ensure a sustainable and integrated water resources management in this region graphical abstract image 1 keywords

growth and climate change fatema et al 2018 mastrocicco and colombani 2021 ouhamdouch et al 2019 werner et al 2013 coastal aquifers play a primary role in the socio economic development of coastal areas especially where water resources are limited these aquifers are the only source of water for a large portion of the world s population raja et al 2021 sherif et al 2011 trabelsi et al 2005 high permeability the presence of faults a low hydraulic gradient and a low recharge rate favour the expansion of marine intrusion into coastal aquifers chafouq et al 2018 ez zaouy et al 2022a fakir et al 2001 hsissou et al 1999 kouzana et al 2010 mavriou et al 2019 moustadraf et al 2008 in addition overexploitation and rising sea levels due to climate change may aggravate the situation chen et al 2016 custodio 2002 ketabchi et al 2016 khouakhi et al 2015 werner and simmons 2009 in different coastal areas worldwide approaches integrating hydrochemistry isotopes and multivariate statistics are used to identify the source and processes responsible for groundwater salinisation abu alnaeem et al 2018 bouderbala et al 2016 de montety et al 2008 rafik et al 2021 2022 however these methods remain unable to provide a complete picture of the salinity distribution especially the extent and depth of the marine intrusion to overcome these limitations geophysics appears as a good alternative for mapping the extent and assessing the depth of seawater intrusion different techniques are available and have been applied to this specific issue such as vertical electrical soundings ves alabjah et al

inland the seawater intrusion extends where the freshwater seawater interface is located this is due to the limited number of wells available for groundwater monitoring along the coast and the sampling technique itself mixed sample not accounting for the possible stratification of the layers due to waters of different salinities and densities the present study aims to evaluate the extent of the seawater intrusion and to locate the freshwater seawater interface to obtain an improved picture of the extent of seawater intrusion in souss massa coastal area an original approach combining high resolution salinity monitoring smd and geophysical surveys tem is applied for the first time in the study area contrary to the regional studies previously mentioned this study only focuses on the coastal area of the souss massa basin fig 1c where seawater intrusion in the dominant source of increased salinity the interpreted results from this study are then contrasted to the existing knowledge of seawater intrusion in the region to highlight the areas of major concern where additional monitoring is required 2 study area the study area is located along the atlantic coast in south western morocco fig 1a namely in the south western part of the souss massa basin fig 1b it is limited by the souss river to the north the massa river to the south and the atlantic ocean to the west fig 1c the

galvanic contact with the ground the tem method has already proved its efficiency for mapping saline water in various studies fitterman and stewart 1986 in taiwan yang et al 1999 in saudi arabia al garni and el kaliouby 2011 and in greece kalisperi et al 2018 further details on the tem method may be found in nabighian and macnae 1991 the in loop configuration consisted of a square transmitter loop of 100 100 m fig 3c the loop was fed with a current of maximum 15 a thus the maximum transmitter moment was 150 000 am2 the transient signals were recorded from 10 μs to 30 ms covering a depth range as shallow as 10 m to at least the saltwater freshwater interface the data was 1d inverted and plotted as sections along the profiles taking into account data from the two imageau stations smd electrical conductivity measured in some wells water levels and geological cross sections established in the study area a total of 83 tem soundings were carried out in october 2019 and february 2020 along 13 profiles perpendicular to the coast and the two river mouths fig 3d by the geophysical service company terratec kalberkamp et al 2020 4 results 4 1 subsurface monitoring device smd the electrical conductivity is ranging from 8892 to 50 435 μs cm with a mean value of 16 809 μs cm from 4th april 2019 to 23rd december 2021 at mzar 1 and from 1876 to 54 883 μs cm with a mean value of 10 893 μs cm from 11th july 2020 to 23rd december 2021 at tif 1 figs s1a and s1b the elevated ec values in the lower part of the piezometers ca 50 000 μs cm are in the range of seawater electrical conductivity at mzar 1 fig 4 a and fig s1a the ec progressively increases as a function of the depth and the vertical ec profiles fig 4a can be divided into three parts from 4 to 25 m ngm the groundwater is characterised by ec values fluctuating around an average value of 12 000 μs cm the groundwater is already more saline than the background salinity in the area 1000 2000 μs cm this is probably due to the frequent infiltration of different saline waters that come from the surface like wastewater water already evaporated malki et al 2017 schreiber et al 2018 tagma et al 2009 river water and the tidal effect along the mouth of the souss river this situation was previously explained by the assumed high permeability dijon 1969 hsissou et al 1997 of the dominant materials e g sand sandstone right next to the measuring station figs 1d and 2 two sensors measured ec values lower than 10 000 μs cm at depths of 15 and 25 m ngm that indicate the existence of fresher water inflows dark blue shade in fig s1a they probably come from the souss river during high water period and circulate through preferential flow paths from 25 to 51 m ngm the groundwater is characterised by a salinity increase from 12 860 to 24 168 μs cm in august 2019 14 260 to 24 179 μs cm in august 2020 and 16 414 to 31 578 μs cm in august 2021 fig 4a the sharp ec increase at a depth of 26 m ngm corresponds to a transition zone between fresher and more saline groundwater from 51 to 58 m ngm the ec is more or less constant fluctuating between 21 000 and 25 000 μs cm much less than the conductivity of seawater an atypical increase at 51 m ngm between august 2020 and august 2021 may highlight the existence of preferential flow paths at this elevation which favours seawater intrusion some measurement errors cannot be excluded and could explain this anomaly in july 2021 the median conductivity is 26 645 μs cm fig 5 shows the variation of median electrical conductivity in the transition zone and the water level at mzar fig 5a the water level is decreasing from 1 65 to 2 93 m ngm during the monitoring period this decrease is linked to a cone of depression due to overexploitation likely at the nearby mzar well field which supplies drinking water to the city of agadir this situation has already been documented in previous studies in the study area by hsissou et al 1997 hssaisoune et al 2017 tagma et al 2009 whilst the water level decreases mostly continuously during the monitoring period the ec in the transition zone increases the local inversion of the flow direction negative water levels exacerbates the advance of the seawater intrusion towards inland in the northern part of the study area as illustrated by the anti correlation between the ec and the water level fig 5a at tif fig 4b and fig s1b the vertical ec profiles can be divided into three parts from 0 75 to 24 75 m ngm the ec is relatively stable from 1945 to 2074 μs cm and from 1901 to 2132 μs cm in august 2020 and august 2021 respectively these values are typical of the freshwater in the region from 24 75 to 36 75 m ngm the ec values increase from 2007 to 46 000 μs cm in august 2020 and from 2066 to 44 000 μs cm in august 2021 this sharp increase at ca 35 55 m ngm corresponds to the freshwater saline water interface illustrating the extent of the seawater intrusion in the central part of the souss massa coastal area from 36 75 to 43 95 m ngm the ec values are varying between 44 000 and 50 248 μs cm which is typical of seawater when comparing the wl with the medium ec in the transition zone fig 5b the wl has a sinusoidal pattern around an average value of 1 1 m ngm lows are observed during the summer period in august 2020 and 2021 and highs during the winter period in january 2020 and 2021 the observed pattern may be explained by irrigation upstream to the piezometer during the growing season from april to august followed by a partial recovery once less or no irrigation is required coupled to a delayed recharge from the previous winter s supplemental fig 3 the unsaturated zone is about ca 80 m and the winter recharge is likely to take at least a few months to reach the water table independently of the water level variations the ec is mostly slowly increasing ca 300 μs cm over the monitoring period the comparison between the two stations fig 5a and b highlights a different behaviour in response to wl variations at mzar the wl is essentially decreasing while the ec is increasing ca 4000 μs cm in 18 months at tif 1 seasonal wl variations are observed around an average value 1 1 m ngm and the ec is increasing at a much slower rate ca 300 μs cm in 12 months likely in response to the general drawdown observed in the whole region and reduced groundwater fluxes towards the atlantic ocean to sum up the monitoring of the ec at different depths enables the location of the freshwater saltwater interface and corroborates the existence of the seawater intrusion in the souss massa coastal aquifer 4 2 transient electromagnetic sounding tem 4 2 1 interpretation of the tem profiles near to smd stations to improve the inversion the smd data water level and electrical conductivity measurements in nearby wells and lithological cross sections were used in this study the model calibration is based on soundings p02001 and p01001 because of their proximity to the smd stations the results of the automatic inversion of the tem soundings using 20 layers figs s2a and s2b at sounding p02001 fit relatively well with the smd data from mzar 1 fig s2a the results are also consistent and in good agreement for sounding p01001 and the smd data at tif 1 fig s2b in sounding p02001 the electrical resistivity decreases from 19 18 to 7 59 ωm between 12 41 and 15 80 m below ground level mbgl fig s2a top left this change corresponds to the transition from the unsaturated zone to the saturated zone and is confirmed by the measured piezometric level at a depth of 14 2 mbgl similarly for sounding p01001 and the smd data at tif 1 a decrease in resistivity values from 101 74 to 58 46 ωm between 81 06 and 94 54 mbgl fig s2b bottom left fits with the location of the water table at 82 5 mbgl below the water table the resistivity progressively decreases to values of 2 4 ωm in both soundings and this is well correlated with the increasing conductivity measured by the two smds fig s2a top left and s2b bottom left in sounding p02001 the resistivity values are already quite low just below the water table layer 7 where the water is brackish according to the smd data ca 12 000 μs cm at shallow depth fig s2a top right in sounding p01001 the sharp decrease of electrical resistivity between 107 91 and 121 30 mbgl fig s2b bottom left corresponds to the transition from freshwater to seawater measured by the smd fig s2b bottom right this comparison highlights the reliability of the inversion model and the contribution of the smd stations to the interpretation of the geophysical data located in the northern part of the study area about 7 8 km east to the seashore fig 6 a tem profile 2 was carried out perpendicular to the souss river and parallel to the coast over a distance of 4670 m see location in fig 3d low resistivity values 4 5 ωm detected in soundings p02001 p02002 and p02003 fig 6a at depths of 3 to 125 m ngm 2 to 90 m ngm and 9 to 75 m ngm in p02001 p02002 and p02003 respectively this result fits with the data at the mzar 1 station installed in pz1 these values are interpreted as saline water bearing layers this interpretation is supported by the data recorded at the mzar 1 station fig 4a with ec values of around 12 500 μs cm at the surface and reaching 31 578 μs cm at an elevation of 51 m ngm soundings p02004 and p02005 indicate slightly higher resistivity 9 10 ωm interpreted as brackish water ec of 9930 μs cm recording in well mzar 1 or possibly a layer with a clay matrix it is shown as a possible extent of the brackish zone black dashed line in fig 6a perpendicular to profile 2 profile 6 fig s4a was also carried out in the vicinity of the souss river perpendicular to the river and parallel to the coast over a distance of 2000 m see location in fig 3d all soundings have a layer of low resistivity values ca 4 ωm except p06005 indicating the presence of salty water this salty water is found near to the surface in sounding p02001 common to profiles 2 and 6 the data of the smd station mzar 1 which is only 100 m north of p06002 show brackish water as mentioned for profile 2 however the resistivity value 28 ωm recorded in p06002 is not within the resistivity range for brackish water 4 5 ωm this could explain by the change in the saline fresh water distribution due to local lithological heterogeneities sands limestone with clay interlayers prevailing on short distances at this location drpe 2018 profile 1 fig 6b was carried out in the tifnit area over a distance of 2000 m see location in fig 3d similar to profile 2 the data of the smd station tif 1 installed in borehole pz3 fig 6b were used to support the interpretation of the geophysical results a high resistivity layer 180 300 ωm is interpreted as sand dunes the top of a less resistive zone 19 50 ωm at elevations varying between 15 m ngm in p01004 and 30 m ngm in p01006 is interpreted as the water table soundings p01001 p01002 and p01003 show very low resistivity values 3 4 ωm again interpreted as the aquifer containing saltwater the seawater intrusion reaches about 1600 m inland fig 6b 4 2 2 profiles along the coast nine profiles p13 p4 p9 p16 p1 p3 p11 p14 and p7 were carried out perpendicular to the coast profile 13 fig s4b is 1500 m long see location in fig 3d below the surface a layer with high resistivity values 100 ωm is interpreted as the unsaturated zone within this layer resistivity values below 1000 ωm in the upper part suggest a lower water content than in the lower part where resistivity values are above 1000 ωm the upper part is interpreted as dry sand dunes whereas the lower part is wet sand dunes due to its proximity to the water table indeed the water table is located at the top of a lower resistivity zone 10 40 ωm this lower resistivity layer 10 16 ωm found in soundings p13001 and p13002 is interpreted as brackish water similar to the previously described profiles low values of resistivity 3 ωm in soundings p13001 and p13002 correspond to the seawater intrusion these layers have an average thickness of ca 50 m in the two first soundings however in sounding p13003 a layer with resistivity value of 8 ωm is interpreted as brackish rather than seawater the extent of the seawater intrusion at depth is not clear in this profile because of the disturbance in sounding p13003 and to a lesser extent p13004 profiles 4 9 and 16 were carried out over distances of 2560 m 1900 m and 2700 m respectively see location in fig 3d these profiles have a similar vertical distribution of the resistivity fig s5a fig s6a and fig s5b respectively in profiles 9 and 16 the resistivity distribution above the water table is similar to profile 13 the seawater intrusion resistivity values from 3 to 8 ωm reaches 2500 m inland according to the interpretation of profiles 4 and 9 fig s5a and fig s6a and ca 2700 m inland according to profile 16 fig s4b the high resistivity values 80 136 ωm 64 116 ωm and 541 ωm in profiles 4 9 and 16 respectively fig s5a fig s6a and fig s5b fig s4a fig s5a fig s4b observed below the marine intrusion 80 to 100 m ngm could indicate a different lithology for example a less permeable unit the profiles 3 11 and 14 were carried out over distances of 4500 m 3900 m and 1700 m respectively see location in fig 3d the results show a relatively similar distribution of resistivity fig s6b fig s7a and fig s7b respectively as previously low resistivity values 2 3 6 and 7 ωm found in some soundings are interpreted as aquifer filled with saltwater for example in profile 3 fig s6b the five soundings closest to the coast present a low resistivity value profiles 11 fig s7a and 14 fig s7b are similar to profile 3 but the sands are subdivided into two units of different resistivity like in profile 13 in profile 11 the water table is located at elevations from 20 to 20 m ngm at the top of a low resistivity zone 20 50 ωm this interpretation is supported by water level measurements in boreholes pt27 and anz60 the seawater intrusion reaches 1700 m 1500 m and 1150 m inland in profiles 3 11 and 14 respectively profile 7 fig 7 a was carried out over a distance of 3700 m see location in fig 3d the near surface layer with high values of resistivity in the range of 162 450 ωm corresponds to the unsaturated zone dry sand dunes the bottom of this layer is the water table just below saltwater 4 5 ωm is detected in soundings p07001 p07002 and p07003 the seawater intrusion may reach up to 1400 m inland in addition at sounding p07004 the resistivity of the water filled sediments 28 ωm correlates well with data from borehole ire 990 69 dynamic water table ca 71 m ngm water conductivity of 3780 μs cm and is interpreted as slightly brackish water 4 2 3 profiles close to the massa river profiles 8 fig s8 and 12 fig 7b are located on the right bank of the massa river to which they are perpendicular profile 8 fig s8 was carried out along a distance of 2700 m at a distance of 2 5 km from the coastline see location in fig 3d in soundings p08006 and p08005 the seawater intrusion is detected below the water table weakly resistive structure 4 5 ωm between the water table and the salty water a lower resistivity layer 15 ωm in p08006 only the closest to river massa indicates the presence of brackish water finally profile 12 fig 7b was carried out over a distance of 3150 m across the massa river and upstream of profile 8 see location in fig 3d a zone of very low resistivity from 0 002 to 3 ωm is detected in soundings p12001 to p12004 local wells have water with high electrical conductivity values 16 850 μs cm in pt13 near p12002 12 890 μs cm in pt15 near p12003 and 6500 μs cm in pt16 near p12004 the tem profile together with these measurements confirm the contamination of groundwater by saline water in the vicinity of the massa river at greater depths soundings p12001 and p12004 show higher resistivity values of about 218 222 ωm these structures are interpreted as coarser gravels and sands containing fresh water or as limestone or sandstone 5 discussion the results of this study provide additional information about seawater intrusion e g its spatial extent fig 8 depth to the freshwater seawater interface fig 9 and possible origin away from the two river mouths it is clear that the seawater intrusion comes directly from the ocean and progresses about 2500 m inland fig 8 previous studies bouchaou et al 2008 görlich et al 2015 hsissou et al 1997 1999 2001 2002 hssaisoune et al 2017 schreiber et al 2018 acknowledged seawater intrusion as the main source of groundwater quality degradation in the coastal part of the souss massa aquifer approaches integrating hydrochemistry major elements and isotopes δ18o δ2h δ15n have been used to identify the main processes responsible for this degradation hsissou et al 1997 suggested that the lack of recharge the aquifer permeability and overexploitation are the main factors driving seawater intrusion in the coastal part of the souss massa aquifer hsissou et al 1999 used the br cl molar ratio to identify the presence of marine water in the aquifer and thus the contamination of groundwater in the coastal zone by seawater based on ec cl and br hsissou et al 2001 concluded that the main coastal areas prone to marine invasion are located in the northern and southern parts of the coastal dunes fig 1c these results are further corroborated by bouchaou et al 2008 hssaisoune et al 2020 2017 malki et al 2017 2016 oumarou danni et al 2019 2018 schreiber et al 2018 in the northern part of the study area ait melloul seawater intrusion is suspected along the souss river near to profile 2 which is characterised by more saline water near the surface compared to regional background salinity and electrical conductivity locally reaching 12 000 μs cm fig 4a this situation may be explained by seawater entering the mouth of the souss river especially during dry periods owing to high tides and the effect of the local piezometric depression caused by intensive pumping at the mzar well field by the national office of drinking water onep the authority in charge of supplying drinking water desmartis and neyens 2021 similar cases were previously observed in several coastal aquifers in morocco alabjah et al 2018 mountadar et al 2018 najib et al 2017 this situation is further enhanced by a lack of recharge hsissou et al 2002 as a result of drought and climate change in the study area desmartis and neyens 2021 hssaisoune et al 2020 additionally the porous nature of the rocks and sediments e g coarser river sediments of the region figs 1d and 2 allows saline water to move quickly inland regarding the central part schreiber et al 2018 concluded that the areas along the coast have relatively high cl concentrations and the dominating water type na cl along the atlantic coast indicates the influence of marine water in addition some points show a cl br molar ratio similar to or equal to seawater attesting the marine origin of the salinity bouchaou et al 2008 schreiber et al 2018 according to the results of this study the seawater intrusion reaches a maximum of 2500 m towards inland the freshwater saltwater interface was clearly detected at 35 55 m ngm at the tif station located 1 km inland figs 8 and 4b this situation is due to a good permeability e g sand dunes of the lithological units and high withdrawals for irrigation east of the study area to compensate for rainfall deficit seif ennasr et al 2017 tagma et al 2009 which cause groundwater drawdown and favour the advance of the seawater intrusion towards inland hsissou et al 1997 irrigated lands are currently extending towards the coast increasing the water demand in the coming years seif ennasr et al 2016 and likely to exacerbate seawater intrusion on a positive note a new desalinisation plant in tifnit was commissioned last winter 2021 2022 and is now supplying drinking water to the city of agadir and water for irrigation purposes it is anticipated that the additional source of water in the region will help reducing the pressure on the aquifer and hopefully slowing the progress of the seawater intrusion in the southern part of the study area marine intrusion probably advances through the more permeable alluvial sediments of the massa river tidal effects may also be responsible for the upstream movement of seawater in the river for at least 5 km during the summer period when the river water levels are lower oumarou danni et al 2019 salinity is thus transferred by the water dynamics especially by the diffusivity of the chloride ions oumarou danni et al 2019 this could explain the high conductivity values measured along the downstream alluvial zone of the massa river oumarou danni et al 2019 some studies malki et al 2017 oumarou danni et al 2018 show that groundwater is characterised by high cl concentrations enriched δ18o values and high electrical conductivity values similar to seawater reaching 50 100 μs cm along the massa river about 8 km from its mouth groundwater samples taken near to the massa river show a cl br ratio similar to seawater schreiber et al 2018 all these evidences indicate the influence of seawater along the massa riverbed and are corroborated by the findings of this study the outputs of this study were combined with the results obtained by traditional methods fig 8 e g electrical conductivity ec geochemistry piezometric levels and stables isotopes δ18o δ2h abhsmd 2009 bouchaou et al 2008 görlich et al 2015 hsissou et al 1999 malki et al 2017 2016 schreiber et al 2018 the seawater intrusion was already well advanced along the two rivers up to the north of al mazar village near the souss river and south of massa village near the massa river schreiber et al 2018 along the atlantic coast the extent of the seawater intrusion is similar to the one of schreiber et al 2018 however this study cannot assess how far the seawater intrusion reaches along both rivers souss and massa this is due to the distribution and the limited number of geophysical profiles carried out along the rivers and the presence of settlements upstream which would interfere with the tem measurements south of the souss river fig 8 the area of probable seawater intrusion is therefore based on previous hydrogeochemical studies abhsmd 2009 oumarou danni et al 2019 2018 schreiber et al 2018 in addition the abhsmd 2009 study based on geochemistry piezometric level and geophysical surveys concluded that marine intrusion is more advanced in this area especially between tifnit and agadir reaching its maximum at the level of the souss river abhsmd 2009 there the aquifer bottom is very deep and the piezometric level is close to the sea level abhsmd 2009 based on this discussion the estimated seawater extent varies from one study to another because of the sampling distribution traditional methods the limited number of smds stations the distance between the tem soundings and profiles as well as their spatial distribution observation wells are recommended to improve the monitoring of the seawater intrusion along the tem profiles e g observation well between p06003 and p06004 with an ideal depth of 200 m table s1 to better locate the intrusion front a reduced inter station spacing around the edge of the seawater intrusion is needed kalberkamp et al 2020 the tem method could also be used to better locate dedicated monitoring wells using an iterative procedure kalberkamp et al 2020 however this method requires a larger budget and tem surveys are probably more valuable for obtaining a long global picture than for determining the exact location of the seawater intrusion at a specific time it may be more cost effective to do a tem survey like in this study every 10 years to supplement conventional methods and smd monitoring in this regard permanent monitoring by traditional methods and smd devices offer tools with historical traceability and relatively lower cost monitoring of groundwater salinity in the study area is not sufficient with two smds 18 km between mzar 1 and tif 1 thus for better monitoring of the seawater intrusion the installation of new instruments is needed to complement the already existing data and improve the knowledge about the aquifer and the progress of the seawater intrusion fig 9 shows the proposed location for new smd stations the locations were assigned a priority level to help local water authorities deciding where to implement future monitoring stations according to their budget these new smd stations aim to fill the gaps in some specific areas of interest e g souss river sous massa national park agricultural fields massa river and to evaluate the efficiency of some management plans and the impact of socio economic activities e g desalination plant drinking water supply such as the mzar well field agriculture artificial recharge etc high priority smds are proposed in areas where there is no data and where geophysical profiles are not available locations that may be areas of future marine intrusion are considered for the smds with medium priority low priority smds are proposed between a high priority and a medium priority stations to monitor the effect of agricultural activities on groundwater in the eastern part of the study area the new smds could provide more information about the depth of the interface and the progress of the seawater intrusion over time in the souss massa coastal area 6 conclusion seawater intrusion is a major issue in coastal aquifers including in the souss massa coastal aquifer which underlies a major agricultural region of morocco the aim of this study was to assess the depth of the freshwater seawater interface and the extent of the seawater intrusion using subsurface monitoring devices smd and transient electromagnetic soundings tem away from the mouths of the rivers souss and massa seawater intrusion is found up to 2 5 km inland near the river mouths the seawater intrusion goes further inland infiltrating along the riverbeds in the northern and southern parts of the study area in the northern part of the study the mzar well field and its associated cone of depression which leads to an inversed hydraulic gradient exacerbate the situation elsewhere this situation is due to limited recharge over pumping for domestic and intensive farming activities upstream of the coastal area and low hydraulic gradient along the coast sand dune is the dominant formation along the coast and is highly permeable further enhancing seawater intrusion based on these results new monitoring locations with different priorities are proposed to complement the existing monitoring network with a focus on seawater intrusion monitoring this study also provides a snapshot of the situation in 2020 2021 that can serve as a baseline for future studies e g comparison with future new surveys to assess the progress of the seawater intrusion these results are also valuable for the calibration of seawater intrusion model of the souss massa aquifer therefore the outcomes of the study benefit stakeholders and decision makers in the souss massa area to preserve groundwater resources and implement sustainable

11662,groundwater are strategic water resources for irrigation and drinking purposes in the souss massa semi arid region morocco these resources have been threatened during the last decades by different factors such as drought over pumping and marine intrusion the latter is responsible for the degradation of the groundwater quality along the coastal area which is reducing its usability therefore the localisation of the freshwater saline water interface is essential for better sustainable management of groundwater resources in the area the objective of the present study is to assess the temporal changes the extent and the depth of the seawater intrusion in the souss massa coastal area to fulfil this objective two monitoring sites were equipped with water conductivity measurement devices subsurface monitoring device smd to observe the temporal changes of the salinity at a local scale as well as to support the interpretation of a transient electromagnetic tem survey this survey consisted of 83 tem soundings along thirteen profiles located perpendicularly to the ocean and the two rivers delineating the study area the data from the smd stations highlight the temporal changes of electrical conductivity ec with depth clearly illustrating the freshwater saltwater interface location in the central part of the study area 35 55 m ngm at the tifnit location ca 1 km from the coast in addition the results of the tem measurements show that the marine intrusion is already advanced towards the land over a maximum distance of 2500 m finally some new monitoring sites have been proposed to improve the current monitoring network for seawater intrusion and assess whether mitigation solutions lead to a slower progression of the seawater intrusion decision makers can use these results as a basis for the development and implementation of effective policies to ensure a sustainable and integrated water resources management in this region graphical abstract image 1 keywords

introduction marine intrusion is a global threat to the quality and sustainability of groundwater in coastal areas this problem can be worsen by several factors such as overexploitation population growth and climate change fatema et al 2018 mastrocicco and colombani 2021 ouhamdouch et al 2019 werner et al 2013 coastal aquifers play a primary role in the socio economic development of coastal areas especially where water resources are limited these aquifers are the only source of water for a large portion of the world s population raja et al 2021 sherif et al 2011 trabelsi et al 2005 high permeability the presence of faults a low hydraulic gradient and a low recharge rate favour the expansion of marine intrusion into coastal aquifers chafouq et al 2018 ez zaouy et al 2022a fakir et al 2001 hsissou et al 1999 kouzana et al 2010 mavriou et al 2019 moustadraf et al 2008 in addition overexploitation and rising sea levels due to climate change may aggravate the situation chen et al 2016 custodio 2002 ketabchi et al 2016 khouakhi et al 2015 werner and simmons 2009 in different coastal areas worldwide approaches integrating hydrochemistry isotopes and multivariate statistics are used to identify the source and processes responsible for groundwater salinisation abu alnaeem et al 2018 bouderbala et al 2016 de montety et al 2008 rafik et al 2021 2022 however these methods remain unable to provide a complete picture of the salinity distribution especially the extent and depth of the marine intrusion to overcome these limitations geophysics appears as a good alternative for mapping the extent and assessing the depth of seawater intrusion different techniques are available and have been applied to this specific issue such as vertical electrical soundings ves alabjah et al

2022b the souss massa coastal area located in central western morocco fig 1 a suffers from increasing water withdrawals due to intense agricultural activities and drought causing significant drawdown and exacerbating marine intrusion due to the importance of the souss massa agriculture in the moroccan economy high groundwater salinity in the souss massa aquifer fig 1b is a major issue for irrigation purposes as such it has been the scope of several studies attar et al 2022 bouchaou et al 2008 hsissou et al 1997 1999 2002 hssaisoune et al 2017 2019 krimissa et al 2004 malki et al 2016 2017 oumarou danni et al 2019 tagma et al 2009 all these studies indicate the existence of seawater in the coastal zone but fail to provide a detailed picture of the seawater intrusion e g how far inland the seawater intrusion extends where the freshwater seawater interface is located this is due to the limited number of wells available for groundwater monitoring along the coast and the sampling technique itself mixed sample not accounting for the possible stratification of the layers due to waters of different salinities and densities the present study aims to evaluate the extent of the seawater intrusion and to locate the freshwater seawater interface to obtain an improved picture of the extent of seawater intrusion in souss massa coastal area an original approach combining high resolution salinity monitoring smd and geophysical surveys tem is applied for the first time in the study area contrary to the regional studies previously mentioned this study only focuses on the coastal area of the souss massa basin fig 1c where seawater intrusion in the dominant source of increased salinity the interpreted results from this study are then contrasted to the existing knowledge of seawater intrusion in the region to highlight the areas of major concern where additional monitoring is required 2 study area the study area is located along the atlantic coast in south western morocco fig 1a namely in the south western part of the souss massa basin fig 1b it is limited by the souss river to the north the massa river to the south and the atlantic ocean to the west fig 1c the study area extends over about 10 km inland the climate of the area is semi arid with hot and dry summers and humid winters schreiber et al 2018 rainfall is often low averaging less than 200 mm per year malki et al 2016 the main socio economic activities in the souss massa region are tourism sea fishing and agriculture bouchaou et al 2005 abhsmd 2012 with agriculture consuming 71 of the extracted groundwater tagma et al 2009 the souss massa national park where human activities are limited covers most of the study area the geology of the study area consists of plio quaternary units with a wide range of facies figs 1d and 2 the geological cross sections fig 2 show that the most abundant formations in the souss massa coastal area are sediments and sedimentary rocks made of sand marl sandstone clay gravel and limestone the most recent quaternary sediments are gravel deposits malki et al 2017 sandy and calcareous deposits fluvial deposits such as gravels or clays hssaisoune et al 2017 abhsmd 2006 and are located along the two rivers as well as in the eastern part of the study area recent dune sand formations almost cover the entire study area while quaternary marine sediments and consolidated dunes are found in the center of the study area especially north of the village tifnit and on the left bank of river massa fig 1d lacustrine limestone is found in the eastern part of the study area and along the massa river south eastern part dijon 1969 from a structural point of view the study area is located in one of the four structural compartments of the souss massa basin the work carried out by hssaisoune et al 2012 shows the existence of two dominant geological discontinuities in the central part of the study area especially south east of tifnit a fault in the central part and another one that is an extension of the klea fault at the eastern extremity of the study area fig 1d the faults are covered by the plio quaternary sediments the hydrological network of the study area is limited to the two intermittent rivers previously mentioned the souss and the massa rivers from a hydrogeological standpoint the shallow unconfined aquifer fig 1b serves as the region s primary source of water the aquifer is located within the plio quaternary miocene and eocene deposits its thickness varies from 30 to 200 m abhsmd 2006 these sediments are characterised by hydraulic conductivity values ranging from 8 10 6 to 3 10 3 m s abhsmd 2006 the aquifer is mainly recharged laterally by the anti atlas mountains rainfall and irrigation return flow

subsurface monitoring device smd in order to monitor the evolution of the saltwater interface in the coastal area of the souss massa region two monitoring stations smd measuring the electrical conductivity ec and the aquifer water level wl have been installed in two piezometers fig 3 d the smd is a patented technology developed by the french company imageau and has been used for various

continuously recording electrical resistivity logs along a specified depth range at regular time intervals table 1 the data are then transmitted to a server via a telemetry system archie 1942 and waxman and smits 1968 formulas are used to convert the raw signal into the electrical conductivity of water eqs 1 and 2 besides the measured resistivity further input data are necessary for that

april 2019 table 1 however the tif 1 station had to be reinstalled in a newly drilled nearby borehole on the 11th of july 2020 due to an inadequate first installation the device was able to record the water level since the beginning but not the water conductivity table 1 3 2 transient electromagnetic soundings tem the physical parameter electrical conductivity or its inverse electrical resistivity are widely used in groundwater studies flathe 1955 roy and elliott 1980 mcneill 1990 and any geophysical resistivity method may be used to detect seawater intrusion in this study a time domain electromagnetic method tem was used to explore the spatial extent and the depth of the seawater intrusion in the souss massa coastal area this method is based on the induction of eddy currents in the subsurface by a sudden switch off of the magnetic field generated by a transmitter loop a receiver coil located in the center of the transmitter loop senses the resulting earth response this in loop configuration shows high sensitivity to conductive formations a large depth of investigation with a relative compact set up good lateral and vertical resolution and the simplicity of not requiring any galvanic contact with the ground the tem method has already proved its efficiency for mapping saline water in various studies fitterman and stewart 1986 in taiwan yang et al 1999 in saudi arabia al garni and el kaliouby 2011 and in greece kalisperi et al 2018 further details on the tem method may be found in nabighian and macnae 1991 the in loop configuration consisted of a square transmitter loop of 100 100 m fig 3c the loop was fed with a current of maximum 15 a thus the maximum transmitter moment was 150 000 am2 the transient signals were recorded from 10 μs to 30 ms covering a depth range as shallow as 10 m to at least the saltwater freshwater interface the data was 1d inverted and plotted as sections along the profiles taking into account data from the two imageau stations smd electrical conductivity measured in some wells water levels and geological cross sections established in the study area a total of 83 tem soundings were carried out in october 2019 and february 2020 along 13 profiles perpendicular to the coast and the two river mouths fig 3d by the geophysical service company terratec kalberkamp et al 2020 4 results 4 1 subsurface monitoring device smd the electrical conductivity is ranging from 8892 to 50 435 μs cm with a mean value of 16 809 μs cm from 4th april 2019 to 23rd december 2021 at mzar 1 and from 1876 to 54 883 μs cm with a mean value of 10 893 μs cm from 11th july 2020 to 23rd december 2021 at tif 1 figs s1a and s1b the elevated ec values in the lower part of the piezometers ca 50 000 μs cm are in the range of seawater electrical conductivity at mzar 1 fig 4 a and fig s1a the ec progressively increases as a function of the depth and the vertical ec profiles fig 4a can be divided into three parts from 4 to 25 m ngm the groundwater is characterised by ec values fluctuating around an average value of 12 000 μs cm the groundwater is already more saline than the background salinity in the area 1000 2000 μs cm this is probably due to the frequent infiltration of different saline waters that come from the surface like wastewater water already evaporated malki et al 2017 schreiber et al 2018 tagma et al 2009 river water and the tidal effect along the mouth of the souss river this situation was previously explained by the assumed high permeability dijon 1969 hsissou et al 1997 of the dominant materials e g sand sandstone right next to the measuring station figs 1d and 2 two sensors measured ec values lower than 10 000 μs cm at depths of 15 and 25 m ngm that indicate the existence of fresher water inflows dark blue shade in fig s1a they probably come from the souss river during high water period and circulate through preferential flow paths from 25 to 51 m ngm the groundwater is characterised by a salinity increase from 12 860 to 24 168 μs cm in august 2019 14 260 to 24 179 μs cm in august 2020 and 16 414 to 31 578 μs cm in august 2021 fig 4a the sharp ec increase at a depth of 26 m ngm corresponds to a transition zone between fresher and more saline groundwater from 51 to 58 m ngm the ec is more or less constant fluctuating between 21 000 and 25 000 μs cm much less than the conductivity of seawater an atypical increase at 51 m ngm between august 2020 and august 2021 may highlight the existence of preferential flow paths at this elevation which favours seawater intrusion some measurement errors cannot be excluded and could explain this anomaly in july 2021 the median conductivity is 26 645 μs cm fig 5 shows the variation of median electrical conductivity in the transition zone and the water level at mzar fig 5a the water level is decreasing from 1 65 to 2 93 m ngm during the monitoring period this decrease is linked to a cone of depression due to overexploitation likely at the nearby mzar well field which supplies drinking water to the city of agadir this situation has already been documented in previous studies in the study area by hsissou et al 1997 hssaisoune et al 2017 tagma et al 2009 whilst the water level decreases mostly continuously during the monitoring period the ec in the transition zone increases the local inversion of the flow direction negative water levels exacerbates the advance of the seawater intrusion towards inland in the northern part of the study area as illustrated by the anti correlation between the ec and the water level fig 5a at tif fig 4b and fig s1b the vertical ec profiles can be divided into three parts from 0 75 to 24 75 m ngm the ec is relatively stable from 1945 to 2074 μs cm and from 1901 to 2132 μs cm in august 2020 and august 2021 respectively these values are typical of the freshwater in the region from 24 75 to 36 75 m ngm the ec values increase from 2007 to 46 000 μs cm in august 2020 and from 2066 to 44 000 μs cm in august 2021 this sharp increase at ca 35 55 m ngm corresponds to the freshwater saline water interface illustrating the extent of the seawater intrusion in the central part of the souss massa coastal area from 36 75 to 43 95 m ngm the ec values are varying between 44 000 and 50 248 μs cm which is typical of seawater when comparing the wl with the medium ec in the transition zone fig 5b the wl has a sinusoidal pattern around an average value of 1 1 m ngm lows are observed during the summer period in august 2020 and 2021 and highs during the winter period in january 2020 and 2021 the observed pattern may be explained by irrigation upstream to the piezometer during the growing season from april to august followed by a partial recovery once less or no irrigation is required coupled to a delayed recharge from the previous winter s supplemental fig 3 the unsaturated zone is about ca 80 m and the winter recharge is likely to take at least a few months to reach the water table independently of the water level variations the ec is mostly slowly increasing ca 300 μs cm over the monitoring period the comparison between the two stations fig 5a and b highlights a different behaviour in response to wl variations at mzar the wl is essentially decreasing while the ec is increasing ca 4000 μs cm in 18 months at tif 1 seasonal wl variations are observed around an average value 1 1 m ngm and the ec is increasing at a much slower rate ca 300 μs cm in 12 months likely in response to the general drawdown observed in the whole region and reduced groundwater fluxes towards the atlantic ocean to sum up the monitoring of the ec at different depths enables the location of the freshwater saltwater interface and corroborates the existence of the seawater intrusion in the souss massa coastal aquifer 4 2 transient electromagnetic sounding tem 4 2 1 interpretation of the tem profiles near to smd stations to improve the inversion the smd data water level and electrical conductivity measurements in nearby wells and lithological cross sections were used in this study the model calibration is based on soundings p02001 and p01001 because of their proximity to the smd stations the results of the automatic inversion of the tem soundings using 20 layers figs s2a and s2b at sounding p02001 fit relatively well with the smd data from mzar 1 fig s2a the results are also consistent and in good agreement for sounding p01001 and the smd data at tif 1 fig s2b in sounding p02001 the electrical resistivity decreases from 19 18 to 7 59 ωm between 12 41 and 15 80 m below ground level mbgl fig s2a top left this change corresponds to the transition from the unsaturated zone to the saturated zone and is confirmed by the measured piezometric level at a depth of 14 2 mbgl similarly for sounding p01001 and the smd data at tif 1 a decrease in resistivity values from 101 74 to 58 46 ωm between 81 06 and 94 54 mbgl fig s2b bottom left fits with the location of the water table at 82 5 mbgl below the water table the resistivity progressively decreases to values of 2 4 ωm in both soundings and this is well correlated with the increasing conductivity measured by the two smds fig s2a top left and s2b bottom left in sounding p02001 the resistivity values are already quite low just below the water table layer 7 where the water is brackish according to the smd data ca 12 000 μs cm at shallow depth fig s2a top right in sounding p01001 the sharp decrease of electrical resistivity between 107 91 and 121 30 mbgl fig s2b bottom left corresponds to the transition from freshwater to seawater measured by the smd fig s2b bottom right this comparison highlights the reliability of the inversion model and the contribution of the smd stations to the interpretation of the geophysical data located in the northern part of the study area about 7 8 km east to the seashore fig 6 a tem profile 2 was carried out perpendicular to the souss river and parallel to the coast over a distance of 4670 m see location in fig 3d low resistivity values 4 5 ωm detected in soundings p02001 p02002 and p02003 fig 6a at depths of 3 to 125 m ngm 2 to 90 m ngm and 9 to 75 m ngm in p02001 p02002 and p02003 respectively this result fits with the data at the mzar 1 station installed in pz1 these values are interpreted as saline water bearing layers this interpretation is supported by the data recorded at the mzar 1 station fig 4a with ec values of around 12 500 μs cm at the surface and reaching 31 578 μs cm at an elevation of 51 m ngm soundings p02004 and p02005 indicate slightly higher resistivity 9 10 ωm interpreted as brackish water ec of 9930 μs cm recording in well mzar 1 or possibly a layer with a clay matrix it is shown as a possible extent of the brackish zone black dashed line in fig 6a perpendicular to profile 2 profile 6 fig s4a was also carried out in the vicinity of the souss river perpendicular to the river and parallel to the coast over a distance of 2000 m see location in fig 3d all soundings have a layer of low resistivity values ca 4 ωm except p06005 indicating the presence of salty water this salty water is found near to the surface in sounding p02001 common to profiles 2 and 6 the data of the smd station mzar 1 which is only 100 m north of p06002 show brackish water as mentioned for profile 2 however the resistivity value 28 ωm recorded in p06002 is not within the resistivity range for brackish water 4 5 ωm this could explain by the change in the saline fresh water distribution due to local lithological heterogeneities sands limestone with clay interlayers prevailing on short distances at this location drpe 2018 profile 1 fig 6b was carried out in the tifnit area over a distance of 2000 m see location in fig 3d similar to profile 2 the data of the smd station tif 1 installed in borehole pz3 fig 6b were used to support the interpretation of the geophysical results a high resistivity layer 180 300 ωm is interpreted as sand dunes the top of a less resistive zone 19 50 ωm at elevations varying between 15 m ngm in p01004 and 30 m ngm in p01006 is interpreted as the water table soundings p01001 p01002 and p01003 show very low resistivity values 3 4 ωm again interpreted as the aquifer containing saltwater the seawater intrusion reaches about 1600 m inland fig 6b 4 2 2 profiles along the coast nine profiles p13 p4 p9 p16 p1 p3 p11 p14 and p7 were carried out perpendicular to the coast profile 13 fig s4b is 1500 m long see location in fig 3d below the surface a layer with high resistivity values 100 ωm is interpreted as the unsaturated zone within this layer resistivity values below 1000 ωm in the upper part suggest a lower water content than in the lower part where resistivity values are above 1000 ωm the upper part is interpreted as dry sand dunes whereas the lower part is wet sand dunes due to its proximity to the water table indeed the water table is located at the top of a lower resistivity zone 10 40 ωm this lower resistivity layer 10 16 ωm found in soundings p13001 and p13002 is interpreted as brackish water similar to the previously described profiles low values of resistivity 3 ωm in soundings p13001 and p13002 correspond to the seawater intrusion these layers have an average thickness of ca 50 m in the two first soundings however in sounding p13003 a layer with resistivity value of 8 ωm is interpreted as brackish rather than seawater the extent of the seawater intrusion at depth is not clear in this profile because of the disturbance in sounding p13003 and to a lesser extent p13004 profiles 4 9 and 16 were carried out over distances of 2560 m 1900 m and 2700 m respectively see location in fig 3d these profiles have a similar vertical distribution of the resistivity fig s5a fig s6a and fig s5b respectively in profiles 9 and 16 the resistivity distribution above the water table is similar to profile 13 the seawater intrusion resistivity values from 3 to 8 ωm reaches 2500 m inland according to the interpretation of profiles 4 and 9 fig s5a and fig s6a and ca 2700 m inland according to profile 16 fig s4b the high resistivity values 80 136 ωm 64 116 ωm and 541 ωm in profiles 4 9 and 16 respectively fig s5a fig s6a and fig s5b fig s4a fig s5a fig s4b observed below the marine intrusion 80 to 100 m ngm could indicate a different lithology for example a less permeable unit the profiles 3 11 and 14 were carried out over distances of 4500 m 3900 m and 1700 m respectively see location in fig 3d the results show a relatively similar distribution of resistivity fig s6b fig s7a and fig s7b respectively as previously low resistivity values 2 3 6 and 7 ωm found in some soundings are interpreted as aquifer filled with saltwater for example in profile 3 fig s6b the five soundings closest to the coast present a low resistivity value profiles 11 fig s7a and 14 fig s7b are similar to profile 3 but the sands are subdivided into two units of different resistivity like in profile 13 in profile 11 the water table is located at elevations from 20 to 20 m ngm at the top of a low resistivity zone 20 50 ωm this interpretation is supported by water level measurements in boreholes pt27 and anz60 the seawater intrusion reaches 1700 m 1500 m and 1150 m inland in profiles 3 11 and 14 respectively profile 7 fig 7 a was carried out over a distance of 3700 m see location in fig 3d the near surface layer with high values of resistivity in the range of 162 450 ωm corresponds to the unsaturated zone dry sand dunes the bottom of this layer is the water table just below saltwater 4 5 ωm is detected in soundings p07001 p07002 and p07003 the seawater intrusion may reach up to 1400 m inland in addition at sounding p07004 the resistivity of the water filled sediments 28 ωm correlates well with data from borehole ire 990 69 dynamic water table ca 71 m ngm water conductivity of 3780 μs cm and is interpreted as slightly brackish water 4 2 3 profiles close to the massa river profiles 8 fig s8 and 12 fig 7b are located on the right bank of the massa river to which they are perpendicular profile 8 fig s8 was carried out along a distance of 2700 m at a distance of 2 5 km from the coastline see location in fig 3d in soundings p08006 and p08005 the seawater intrusion is detected below the water table weakly resistive structure 4 5 ωm between the water table and the salty water a lower resistivity layer 15 ωm in p08006 only the closest to river massa indicates the presence of brackish water finally profile 12 fig 7b was carried out over a distance of 3150 m across the massa river and upstream of profile 8 see location in fig 3d a zone of very low resistivity from 0 002 to 3 ωm is detected in soundings p12001 to p12004 local wells have water with high electrical conductivity values 16 850 μs cm in pt13 near p12002 12 890 μs cm in pt15 near p12003 and 6500 μs cm in pt16 near p12004 the tem profile together with these measurements confirm the contamination of groundwater by saline water in the vicinity of the massa river at greater depths soundings p12001 and p12004 show higher resistivity values of about 218 222 ωm these structures are interpreted as coarser gravels and sands containing fresh water or as limestone or sandstone 5 discussion the results of this study provide additional information about seawater intrusion e g its spatial extent fig 8 depth to the freshwater seawater interface fig 9 and possible origin away from the two river mouths it is clear that the seawater intrusion comes directly from the ocean and progresses about 2500 m inland fig 8 previous studies bouchaou et al 2008 görlich et al 2015 hsissou et al 1997 1999 2001 2002 hssaisoune et al 2017 schreiber et al 2018 acknowledged seawater intrusion as the main source of groundwater quality degradation in the coastal part of the souss massa aquifer approaches integrating hydrochemistry major elements and isotopes δ18o δ2h δ15n have been used to identify the main processes responsible for this degradation hsissou et al 1997 suggested that the lack of recharge the aquifer permeability and overexploitation are the main factors driving seawater intrusion in the coastal part of the souss massa aquifer hsissou et al 1999 used the br cl molar ratio to identify the presence of marine water in the aquifer and thus the contamination of groundwater in the coastal zone by seawater based on ec cl and br hsissou et al 2001 concluded that the main coastal areas prone to marine invasion are located in the northern and southern parts of the coastal dunes fig 1c these results are further corroborated by bouchaou et al 2008 hssaisoune et al 2020 2017 malki et al 2017 2016 oumarou danni et al 2019 2018 schreiber et al 2018 in the northern part of the study area ait melloul seawater intrusion is suspected along the souss river near to profile 2 which is characterised by more saline water near the surface compared to regional background salinity and electrical conductivity locally reaching 12 000 μs cm fig 4a this situation may be explained by seawater entering the mouth of the souss river especially during dry periods owing to high tides and the effect of the local piezometric depression caused by intensive pumping at the mzar well field by the national office of drinking water onep the authority in charge of supplying drinking water desmartis and neyens 2021 similar cases were previously observed in several coastal aquifers in morocco alabjah et al 2018 mountadar et al 2018 najib et al 2017 this situation is further enhanced by a lack of recharge hsissou et al 2002 as a result of drought and climate change in the study area desmartis and neyens 2021 hssaisoune et al 2020 additionally the porous nature of the rocks and sediments e g coarser river sediments of the region figs 1d and 2 allows saline water to move quickly inland regarding the central part schreiber et al 2018 concluded that the areas along the coast have relatively high cl concentrations and the dominating water type na cl along the atlantic coast indicates the influence of marine water in addition some points show a cl br molar ratio similar to or equal to seawater attesting the marine origin of the salinity bouchaou et al 2008 schreiber et al 2018 according to the results of this study the seawater intrusion reaches a maximum of 2500 m towards inland the freshwater saltwater interface was clearly detected at 35 55 m ngm at the tif station located 1 km inland figs 8 and 4b this situation is due to a good permeability e g sand dunes of the lithological units and high withdrawals for irrigation east of the study area to compensate for rainfall deficit seif ennasr et al 2017 tagma et al 2009 which cause groundwater drawdown and favour the advance of the seawater intrusion towards inland hsissou et al 1997 irrigated lands are currently extending towards the coast increasing the water demand in the coming years seif ennasr et al 2016 and likely to exacerbate seawater intrusion on a positive note a new desalinisation plant in tifnit was commissioned last winter 2021 2022 and is now supplying drinking water to the city of agadir and water for irrigation purposes it is anticipated that the additional source of water in the region will help reducing the pressure on the aquifer and hopefully slowing the progress of the seawater intrusion in the southern part of the study area marine intrusion probably advances through the more permeable alluvial sediments of the massa river tidal effects may also be responsible for the upstream movement of seawater in the river for at least 5 km during the summer period when the river water levels are lower oumarou danni et al 2019 salinity is thus transferred by the water dynamics especially by the diffusivity of the chloride ions oumarou danni et al 2019 this could explain the high conductivity values measured along the downstream alluvial zone of the massa river oumarou danni et al 2019 some studies malki et al 2017 oumarou danni et al 2018 show that groundwater is characterised by high cl concentrations enriched δ18o values and high electrical conductivity values similar to seawater reaching 50 100 μs cm along the massa river about 8 km from its mouth groundwater samples taken near to the massa river show a cl br ratio similar to seawater schreiber et al 2018 all these evidences indicate the influence of seawater along the massa riverbed and are corroborated by the findings of this study the outputs of this study were combined with the results obtained by traditional methods fig 8 e g electrical conductivity ec geochemistry piezometric levels and stables isotopes δ18o δ2h abhsmd 2009 bouchaou et al 2008 görlich et al 2015 hsissou et al 1999 malki et al 2017 2016 schreiber et al 2018 the seawater intrusion was already well advanced along the two rivers up to the north of al mazar village near the souss river and south of massa village near the massa river schreiber et al 2018 along the atlantic coast the extent of the seawater intrusion is similar to the one of schreiber et al 2018 however this study cannot assess how far the seawater intrusion reaches along both rivers souss and massa this is due to the distribution and the limited number of geophysical profiles carried out along the rivers and the presence of settlements upstream which would interfere with the tem measurements south of the souss river fig 8 the area of probable seawater intrusion is therefore based on previous hydrogeochemical studies abhsmd 2009 oumarou danni et al 2019 2018 schreiber et al 2018 in addition the abhsmd 2009 study based on geochemistry piezometric level and geophysical surveys concluded that marine intrusion is more advanced in this area especially between tifnit and agadir reaching its maximum at the level of the souss river abhsmd 2009 there the aquifer bottom is very deep and the piezometric level is close to the sea level abhsmd 2009 based on this discussion the estimated seawater extent varies from one study to another because of the sampling distribution traditional methods the limited number of smds stations the distance between the tem soundings and profiles as well as their spatial distribution observation wells are recommended to improve the monitoring of the seawater intrusion along the tem profiles e g observation well between p06003 and p06004 with an ideal depth of 200 m table s1 to better locate the intrusion front a reduced inter station spacing around the edge of the seawater intrusion is needed kalberkamp et al 2020 the tem method could also be used to better locate dedicated monitoring wells using an iterative procedure kalberkamp et al 2020 however this method requires a larger budget and tem surveys are probably more valuable for obtaining a long global picture than for determining the exact location of the seawater intrusion at a specific time it may be more cost effective to do a tem survey like in this study every 10 years to supplement conventional methods and smd monitoring in this regard permanent monitoring by traditional methods and smd devices offer tools with historical traceability and relatively lower cost monitoring of groundwater salinity in the study area is not sufficient with two smds 18 km between mzar 1 and tif 1 thus for better monitoring of the seawater intrusion the installation of new instruments is needed to complement the already existing data and improve the knowledge about the aquifer and the progress of the seawater intrusion fig 9 shows the proposed location for new smd stations the locations were assigned a priority level to help local water authorities deciding where to implement future monitoring stations according to their budget these new smd stations aim to fill the gaps in some specific areas of interest e g souss river sous massa national park agricultural fields massa river and to evaluate the efficiency of some management plans and the impact of socio economic activities e g desalination plant drinking water supply such as the mzar well field agriculture artificial recharge etc high priority smds are proposed in areas where there is no data and where geophysical profiles are not available locations that may be areas of future marine intrusion are considered for the smds with medium priority low priority smds are proposed between a high priority and a medium priority stations to monitor the effect of agricultural activities on groundwater in the eastern part of the study area the new smds could provide more information about the depth of the interface and the progress of the seawater intrusion over time in the souss massa coastal area 6 conclusion seawater intrusion is a major issue in coastal aquifers including in the souss massa coastal aquifer which underlies a major agricultural region of morocco the aim of this study was to assess the depth of the freshwater seawater interface and the extent of the seawater intrusion using subsurface monitoring devices smd and transient electromagnetic soundings tem away from the mouths of the rivers souss and massa seawater intrusion is found up to 2 5 km inland near the river mouths the seawater intrusion goes further inland infiltrating along the riverbeds in the northern and southern parts of the study area in the northern part of the study the mzar well field and its associated cone of depression which leads to an inversed hydraulic gradient exacerbate the situation elsewhere this situation is due to limited recharge over pumping for domestic and intensive farming activities upstream of the coastal area and low hydraulic gradient along the coast sand dune is the dominant formation along the coast and is highly permeable further enhancing seawater intrusion based on these results new monitoring locations with different priorities are proposed to complement the existing monitoring network with a focus on seawater intrusion monitoring this study also provides a snapshot of the situation in 2020 2021 that can serve as a baseline for future studies e g comparison with future new surveys to assess the progress of the seawater intrusion these results are also valuable for the calibration of seawater intrusion model of the souss massa aquifer therefore the outcomes of the study benefit stakeholders and decision makers in the souss massa area to preserve groundwater resources and implement sustainable

11663,water resources including potable water availability are complicated issues in many kazakhstan regions central kazakhstan region is one such region which requires the proper support in the water supply most of the kazakhstan regions had been using mostly surface water however with the limitation of the surface water the groundwater resources have been used more intensively during the last decades at the same time the groundwater chemical composition plays a decisive role for categorization as the potable water within this research work the chemical composition of groundwater formation features in the arid conditions of kazakhstan are presented the regional hydrogeochemical field works were carried out to establish the patterns of fresh and brackish groundwater formation in the arid conditions of kazakhstan the two main factors influencing the chemical compositions were investigated including a the water rock interaction for mountain folded areas and b water soil gas interaction and evaporative concentration water evaporation and salts accumulation for flat areas the physical and chemical modeling by the gibbs free energy minimization method which is based on the thermodynamics laws were provided to analyze processes of these two main factors influencing the chemical compositions the results of these analyses for the a mountain folded areas we found that with the growth of gypsum 1 2 in the rock the content of sulfate compounds in water increases tenfold in the fractured rocks of mountain folded areas with free access to atmospheric air open system waters are enriched with oxygen and carbon dioxide at the same time the cationic composition of waters is determined by the lithological composition of the rocks the sodium cations predominate in granite massifs calcium is predominant in enriched calcium minerals bicarbonate anions predominate in the anionic component with weak mineralization for the b flat areas as mineralization increases due to the interaction of water soil gas and evaporative concentration the chemical composition changes the changes occur from sulfate to chloride in anions and from calcium to sodium in cations these two main factors pattern a b influencing the chemical compositions were also observed in the bigger regional hydrogeochemical studies mountain folded with connected flat areas waters are predominantly fresh bicarbonate calcium sodium in the feeding zones of the mountain folded areas originally with water movement down to the flat areas the mineralization increases the water s mineralization increases and becomes more sulfate to chloride the hydrogeochemical zonings are traced this study is applicable for forecasting searching the fresh and slightly brackish waters which could be suitable for domestic water supply graphical abstract image 1 keywords central kazakhstan fresh and sub saline groundwater hydrogeological structures horizontal hydrogeochemical zoning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction groundwater as an integral part of water resources is an important strategic resource for water security and the sustainable development of any state igrac 2018 igrac 2019 groundwater is the most extracted natural resource in the world with the total amount of water withdrawal up to a thousand cubic kilometers per year margat et al 2013 susan et al 2003 about 60 of the world s recovered groundwater is used for agriculture the rest is almost equally divided between the household needs of the population and the industrial sector vrba and van der gun 2004 zhaparkhanov et al 1985 with population growth the percentage of recoverable groundwater resources increases and the quality of groundwater changes accordingly many researchers subba et al 2022 a

people s health the fresh and sub saline groundwater investigations are very important in kazakhstan zektser 2001 mironenko 1983 water resources are distributed unevenly in kazakhstan groundwater is becoming the main source for household and drinking water supply to cities towns and agricultural facilities with decreasing surface water sydykov and shlygina 1998 ahmedsafin et al 1979 akhmedsafin et al 1981 the domestic and drinking water supply of 70 of all cities in kazakhstan is based on the use of groundwater smolyar et al 2002 as in many regions worldwide groundwater is the main source of freshwater used for drinking domestic agricultural industrial needs hellmann and pitsch 2013 poryadin et al 2016 shelepova 1989 preservation of groundwater quality is a growing concern around the world veselov et al 1992 vrba and van der gun 2004 edmunds and smedley 1996 kazakhstan has a shortage of fresh groundwater in many regions the sub saline waters with a salinity of up to 1 5 g l and sometimes even higher have been used for domestic needs under an agreement with the state sanitary and epidemiological authorities soils of the kazakh ssr and bezsonov 1967 soils of the krainov and shvets 1980 waters with a mineral content of 1 5 3 0 g l require desalination processing for further domestic use in kazakhstan regions without fresh and sub saline groundwater in exceptional cases the groundwater with a salinity level of 3 010 0 g l is used for domestic needs absametov et al 2017a b smolyar et al 2012 water deficiency increasing population and various sectors of the economy water demand in the required quantity and quality are becoming one of the most important problems in kazakhstan akhmedsafin et al 1981 sagin et al 2017 uneven distribution of water resources over the territory and time insufficient consideration of the water factor in the location of industry and agriculture use rapid growth in water consumption and irrational use of scarce water resources have led to an acute water shortage in most of kazakhstan regions veselov et al 1993 akhmetsafin 1955 assessment of the economic activities impact on groundwater resources the groundwater chemical composition mapping of insufficient moisture zones which covers central kazakhstan region are important investigations for scientific and practical importance absametov et al 2017a b smolyar et al 2012 despite the low mineralization and the chemical composition simplicity groundwater consists of a complex multicomponent hydrogeochemical system sydykov et al 2014 jing et al 2019 several dozen chemical elements are investigated with various concentrations in the fresh low mineralized groundwater of kazakhstan smolyar et al 2012 sydykov and absametov 2014 there is a close relationship between the formation of the chemical composition of groundwater and the distribution of soils in the region to study the effect of soils on the chemical composition of groundwater and the features of element migration in waters we applied physicochemical modeling in the water soil gas system using the selector software package bychinsky et al 2004 karpov 1981 this program is based on the gibbs free energy minimization principle to analyze the soil influence on the chemical composition and water particles migration the purpose of this research is to assess the regional hydrogeochemical formation patterns of fresh and sub saline groundwater in the arid conditions of central kazakhstan which are very important for domestic drinking water supply the chemical composition of fresh and slightly saline groundwater horizontal hydrogeochemical zoning of groundwater in relation to the hydrogeological conditions of central kazakhstan were investigated by combining the field works investigations previously published and archival data on the research areas absametov et al 2017a b sydykov and absametov 2014 dokuchaev 1889 fersman 1955 as a result of the dissolution of rocks by natural waters and the selective concentration of some chemical elements and the dispersion of others due to binding them in the form of secondary mineral phases leads to the formation of various geochemical types of groundwater mazukhina et al 2009 sklyarova et al 2011 the central kazakhstan region precipitation archives near the cities of karkaralinsk and karaganda were analyzed the composition of soils hydro geology data of the region were used from the research group s previous studies and other researchers works nikanorov et al 1983 the physical and chemical modeling in the water soil gas system using the selector software package were applied bychinsky et al 2004 karpov 1981 based on the principle of minimizing the gibbs free energy to study the effect of soils on the chemical composition of groundwater and water particles migration the use of physical and chemical modeling of the water rock gas system which is based on the gibbs free energy minimization principle forms the basis for substantiating the conceptual model of a non equilibrium self developing system 2 study area central kazakhstan s arid region is our research area fig 1 the area characterized with limited surface runoff groundwater resources are the only source of water for many people in this region the groundwater of different territories landscapes regions has a unique chemical composition these indicators are necessary for the water supply investigations zverev 1982 one of the important indicators for groundwater chemical composition changes investigation is hydro chemical zoning mapping the groundwater hydro chemical zoning is primarily associated with the landscape geochemical conditions of the region and consists of 1 dry steppes with dark chestnut and light chestnut soils 2 desert steppes and deserts with brown desert steppe and gray brown soils fig 1 nikanorov et al 1983 absametov et al 2017a b dry steppes are localized in the north region of the research area fig 1 within the distribution of dark chestnut soils a low mountain relief with absolute marks of 1000 1500 m prevails composed of effusive sedimentary rocks and intrusive formations of the paleozoic era abdulin 1981 a relatively large amount of atmospheric precipitation prolonged snow melting and significant dissection of the relief provide favorable conditions for groundwater supply to form hydro carbonate sodium calcium waters with a low salinity of 0 07 0 4 g l in wider ranges the mineralization of groundwater values varies from 0 7 to 19 6 g l with bicarbonate calcium sodium and sulfate sodium compositions bespalov 1971 saprykin 1984 desert steppes with brown desert steppe soils cover basement plains compiled by small hummocks and are located in the south of the region fig 1 the water bearing rocks are the effusive sedimentary rocks of the upper middle paleozoic fig 2 the formation of groundwater occurs mainly due to the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation shvartsev 1978 nikanorov et al 1983 the recharge areas are small hillside ridges and individual low mountain outliers rising against the background of the basement plains from where the underground runoff towards the relief depressions occurs the noted hydrogeological features of the area predetermine the chemical composition of groundwater at the same time the salinity of water varies widely from 0 3 in the understood parts to 22 g l in the plain part with an average value for the region of 2 g l fresh waters are sulfate hydro carbonate calcium sodium and sulfate sodium waters generally have a salinity of more than 1 g l there is a close relationship between the formation of the chemical composition of groundwater and the peculiarity of the soil distribution in the region to study the effect of soils on the chemical composition of groundwater and the features of the migration of elements in waters we carried out the physical and chemical modeling in the water soil gas system using the selector software package based on the principle of minimizing the gibbs free energy karpov 1981 bychinsky et al 2004 when modeling to characterize the chemical composition of rainfall we analyzed precipitation in the north near karkaralinsk city and in the south of karaganda city fig 2 absametov et al 2017a b 2 1 orography the relief climate hydrography geological and structural features of the region are the main natural factors that determine the conditions for groundwater formation the role of these factors is very significant both in the formation of groundwater chemical composition and in the assessment of their resources they also mainly determine the conditions of feeding transit and discharge of aquifers and complexes shvartsev 1998 2013 the territory of central kazakhstan is characterized by a variety of landscape and geological conditions as a result of which its hydrogeological situation is characterized by great complexity and variability absametov et al 2017a b shagarova et al 2018 most of the territory is occupied by a shallow and hilly elevated plain typical for central kazakhstan with relatively well defined general slopes from the central part of the balkhash teniz watershed where absolute marks reach 1400 1500 m the maximum mark is confined to the top of mount kyzylrai 1565 m the relative elevation is 150 400 m smolyar et al 2012 absametov et al 2017a b in different parts of central kazakhstan depending on the relief the nature of the native substrate microclimate and water regime different types of soils and in accordance with this plant communities were formed in most of the territory dark chestnut brown and gray brown soils are widespread often with saline solonetz and takyr like formations in the floodplains of rivers gullies lacustrine depressions and in the depressions between the hills chernozem meadow chestnut and meadow alluvial soils are found the climate of the territory under consideration is mainly sharply continental and arid but very heterogeneous due to large differences in the relief structure the average annual air temperature varies from 2 to 2 5 с to 5 7 с cold weather occurs in late october and lasts until april the average annual absolute air humidity varies from 5 to 7 mbar the average annual wind speed is from 3 5 to 5 0 m s the average layer of annual precipitation does not exceed 260 mm absametov et al 2017a b sydykov and absametov 2014 2 2 hydrogeological setting central kazakhstan is characterized by a shallow hillside relief which favors the formation of underground runoff and promotes intensive water exchange the main structural and tectonic feature of the region is the presence of an uplifted caledonian hercynian mountain fold area and adjacent large cimmerian alpine downfolds of the rocky basement from the west and southwest belonging to young platform structures as well as from the north of rocky basement downfolds filled with a thick mass mesozoic and cenozoic sedimentary rocks sydykov et al 2014 absametov et al 2017a b the hydrogeological difference between these parts of the territory lies in the fact that within the mountain folded part which occupies most of the karaganda region predominantly unconfined fissure waters of shallow circulation and groundwater are developed confined to the zone of exogenous and endogenous fracturing of uneven aged effusive intrusive and metamorphosed sedimentary rocks downfolds which are the marginal parts of artesian basins the main role belongs to pore bed confined groundwater confined to the rocks of a loose sedimentary cover smolyar et al 2012 absametov et al 2017a b sydykov and absametov 2014 the boundaries between pore strata groundwater and fracture zones are divided along underground watersheds and differ from each other in the characteristics of the distribution of groundwater salinity and chemical composition the turgai downfold is located in the western part of central kazakhstan according to the structure of the mesozoic cenozoic cover in the turgai basin there are two regions northern and southern with different hydrogeological conditions the southern part of the basin is part of central kazakhstan and is represented by aquifers and complexes of quaternary upper pliocene middle quaternary oligocene eocene upper cretaceous lower middle cretaceous and jurassic sediments fig 2 in the kazakh uplands aquifers and horizons are developed in quaternary alluvial oligocene miocene jurassic sediments as well as water bearing zones of fracturing terrigenous middle carboniferous permian famennian lower carboniferous fractured and karst carbonate volcanogenic devonian sedimentary volcanogenic devonian ordovician intrusive and metamorphosed precambrian and paleozoic rocks in the low mountains and high hummocks of the balkhash irtysh watershed groundwater is developed in intrusive and volcanogenic effusive sedimentary pre paleozoic and paleozoic rocks ground waters are fresh bicarbonate sodium and calcium composition in the valleys of the nura sherubai nura zharly taldy tokrau zhamshi mointy and atasu rivers pore waters of alluvial quaternary deposits are widespread the waters therein are groundwater less often pressurized with a depth of occurrence from 0 2 to 10 0 m and pressurized waters from 32 0 to 50 0 m the waters are fresh and slightly salty in the mikhailovsko sokurskaya downfold fresh and slightly saline pressure underground waters of the jurassic deposits are developed flow rates vary from 3 0 to 30 0 l s absametov et al 2017a b smolyar et al

document regulating the quality of groundwater for household and drinking purposes and determining their suitability for use in kazakhstan is the sanitary rules sanitary and epidemiological requirements for water sources water intake points for household and drinking purposes domestic and drinking water supply and places of cultural and domestic water use and safety of water bodies which was approved by the minister of national economy of the republic of kazakhstan no 209 as of march 16 2015 order of the margat and van der gun 2013 the list of standardized indicators of the sanitary rules in addition to the usual macro components of the chemical composition of groundwater cl so4 2 contains a large number of micro components f fe mn as be sr mo se zn cu pb cd cr hg which are divided into two groups by their concentrations and biochemical significance shvartsev 2008 polubarinova kochina 1977 absametov et al 2017a b the first group is the low mineralized groundwater which has small natural concentrations of elements much lower than the maximum allowable concentration mac these elements include cu 1 0 mg l mo 0 25 mg l pb 0 03 mg l zn 5 0 mg l kaz sanitary 2015 the second group of groundwater which has high natural concentrations of elements which are close to mac these elements include fe 0 3 mg l f 0 7 1 5 mg l be 0 0002 mg l se 0 001 mg l as 0 05 mg l sr 7 0

organoleptic f mn and toxicological li be cd as se as sr f properties and use for domestic water supply kaz sanitary 2015 within the first group of the low mineralized groundwater copper cu in various contents is established in the groundwater of all aquifers with a change in its content from 0 2 to 1 0 mg l they are mainly associated with volcanogenic and volcano plutonic hydrothermal metasomatic ore formations these are copper porphyry gold copper molybdenum copper molybdenum mo ranges from 0 1 to 0 3 mg l in the northern balkhash region while the maximum concentrations have been established for paleozoic intrusive formations lead pb occurs up to 0 03 mg l in the underground waters of the northern balkhash region lead is widespread and is characteristic of many ore formations the dissolution of lead minerals in groundwater manifests itself with different intensity shvartsev 2008 zinc zn content in the underground waters of the northern balkhash region is up to 5 0 mg l the relatively high value of the coefficient of variation of zinc in groundwater within the ore formation confirms its assignment to the group of mobile elements that are sensitive to changes in concentration in water bearing rocks this is largely due to the stability and relatively good solubility of its chemical compounds polubarinova kochina 1977 within the second group of groundwater which has high natural concentrations of elements iron fe are found in all aquifers its content in groundwater is up to 0 3 mg l in groundwater iron compounds are likely candidates for the role of migration carriers of other elements groundwater containing high iron content is predominantly calcium sulfate type ii with a mineralization of 2 3 g l fluorine f in various contents is established in the groundwater of all aquifers with a change in its content from 0 7 to 1 5 mg l they are mainly associated with volcanogenic formations beryllium be content in the underground waters of the northern balkhash region is very low up to 0 0002 mg l in the groundwater of the region manganese is found almost everywhere its occurrence varies from 50 to 80 selenium se is found in groundwater of all aquifers up to 0 0001 mg l its minimum content in various aquifers is characteristic of the upper carboniferous water bearing rocks arsenic as is found in groundwater of all aquifers up to 0 05 mg l strontium sr is established in the groundwater of all aquifers up to 7 0 mg l in the groundwater of the region manganese mn is found almost everywhere its occurrence varies from 86 to 100 the content of manganese in groundwater is average sydykov et al 2014 absametov et al 2017a b 2 5 steps modeling the physical and chemical modeling in the water soil gas system using the selector software package based on the principle of minimizing the gibbs free energy were applied bychinsky et al 2004 to study the effect of soils on the chemical composition of groundwater and water particles migration we analyzed precipitation in the north of the region near the city of karkaralinsk and in the south of the city of karaganda figs 1 and 2 through this modeling to characterize the chemical composition of rainfall absametov et al 2017a b smolyar et al 2012 under isobaric isothermal conditions a multicomponent system is in equilibrium when its free energy function will have a minimum value the free energy of the system as a function of the composition in vector form has the form g x q r t x ln x x x ln γ q q j j l vector dash means transposition operation whose element q j is the isobaric isothermal potential of i mole of component j at a given temperature pressure and appropriate choice of the standard state for the activity coefficient γ j of the same component r is the universal gas constant t is temperature k γ γ j j l x x j j l α α ф x x a α ф normalization condition that specifies the structure of the system with respect to its phase and component composition karpov 1981 bychinsky et al 2004 in the calculations the function qt j is used which replaces the values of q j and does not affect the final result calculated by optimal programming methods the proof of this fundamental question is considered in detail in karpov 1981 the mass balance equation system can be written as a x β here a aij i 1n j 1 m matrix of coefficients showing the number of moles of stoichiometric unit i in component j β β i i 1n the vector of the initial chemical composition of the system whose element β i is the number of moles of stoichiometric unit i in the system it is assumed that the initial data are given in such a way that n ф n in the system a x β is always consistent the rank a is equal to the number of equations it is equal to the number n additional equations can be included in the system of mass balance equations for example if according to the conditions of the problem it is required to maintain the constancy of the volume of the system at a given temperature and pressure for this additional equation in matrix a the coefficients at x will be the values of the partial volumes of the components of the system α β v will represent the total molecular volume of the system for the electrical neutrality equation if it is included in the system of mass balance equations β e 0 then the system as a whole is electrically neutral the coefficients in the matrix a at x j will be the charges of the components karpov 1981 sklyarova et al 2011 thus to calculate the equilibrium composition of an isobaric isothermal system it is required to find such molar amounts of dependent components that would satisfy the mass balance equations and at the same time ensure the minimum value of the isobaric isothermal potential of the system at the same time we note the most important property of the function g x the property on which in fact the entire derivation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the equilibrium of the system is built with their explicit analytical representation in the form of a system of equalities and inequalities karpov 1981 sklyarova et al 2011 the relationship between the main components of the chemical composition of groundwater is determined by the composition of water bearing rocks and the intensity of water exchange their mineralization often increases as a result of leaching of alkaline earth elements from rocks mainly due to the destruction of plagioclases this leads to the predominance of calcium bicarbonates in the macro component composition of groundwater with the transformation of type ii waters an excess concentration of alkaline elements in well drained areas of acidic rocks leads to the formation of bicarbonate sodium or bicarbonate sodium calcium waters of type i akhmedsafin et al 1981 the chemical composition of groundwater sensitively reacts to changes in the totality of the natural geological and hydrogeological conditions of the territory this is the basis for setting up hydrogeochemical searches moreover if the microelement composition of the ore bearing complex of rocks and especially ore deposits is revealed in groundwater then the microcomponent composition of the water bearing complexes themselves and components brought by underground runoff from other areas or introduced from the outside by surface runoff and precipitation will be much more clearly established in it sydykov et al 1991 indeed if within the chu ili ore belt groundwater from fresh to salty of different chemical composition is developed then this is certainly the result of a complex impact of various physiographic geological and hydrogeological factors permanent and seasonal the atmospheric salinity is essential in formation of the chemical composition of the fractured waters of the alimentation areas absametov et al 2017a b smolyar et al 2012 moreover the chemical composition of rain and snow waters differs markedly sydykov et al 2014 nikanorov et al 1983 if the melt water has a predominantly hydro carbonate sulfate composition with a salinity of 0 02 0 05 g l then rainwater is of hydro carbonate chloride composition with a total salinity of 0 05 0 9 g l the increased content of sulfates in the snow waters is probably due to the instability of the snow cover with its purification with the gypsum enriched dust the increase in the content of chlorine ions in rainfall occurs as a result of the circulation of air masses bringing moisture to the balkhash teniz watershed through northern kazakhstan where active deflation of sodium chloride from the surface of numerous dry lakes is noted it is possible that the formation of low mineralized chloride groundwater in the main watershed part is associated with atmospheric precipitation which seeps through the soil layer enriched with chlorides and in this environment the latter dissolve much faster than gypsum this is confirmed by the results of an experiment on determining the composition of the filtrate obtained by passing atmospheric water through a column of the soil layer at the same time at the beginning of the experiment the filtrate was intensively enriched with chlorine ions in subsequent portions sulfate ions played a significant role in the chemical composition of the filtered water this probably explains the fact that in the soil samples of the wet season there was less chlorine and more sulfate than in the samples of the dry season which are more enriched in chlorides soils of kazssr 1967 sokolov et al 1962 dark chestnut soils are most often confined to watershed plains and slight steep slopes with diluvial usually stony loam more than 80 cm thick according to x ray structural analysis fig 3 clay fractions are represented by goethite chlorite kaolinite and montmorillonite coarse fractions are similar in mineralogical composition to the parent rock albite anorthite orthoclase quartz biotite and hornblende in addition as a result of the circulation of substances and the transfer of salts associated with the water regime of soils the carbonate and gypsum horizons are formed in the soil horizon depending on the thickness of these horizons we considered three options when modeling 1 there is no saline horizon 2 the thickness of the carbonate horizon is 0 2 and gypsum is 0 6 and 3 the thickness of the carbonate horizon is 0 3 and gypsum is 0 8 2 6 steps results and discussion one of the important indicators of changes in the groundwater chemical composition is hydro chemical zoning caused by the impact of many natural and geological factors the chemical composition of groundwater represents the interaction of the earth components climate is the main factor determining the zoning of the natural context already by the end of the 19th century dokuchaev 1889 had shown the climatic zoning with vegetation distribution of established by a humboldt 1915 with soils and landscapes characteristics representing the earth s surface nature as the whole interconnected system fersman 1955 expanded the earth s surface zoning location law classifications with the geochemical phenomena each zone is characterized by a certain composition of groundwater as an element of the geochemical phenomena each groundwater chemical composition zone is characterized by the local environment landscape deviations local structures tectonic geomorphological hydrogeological soil conditions petrochemical metallogenic rock parameters the groundwater use for various purposes is largely determined by the water salinity and chemical composition jing et al 2019 edmunds and shand 2008 groundwater classification is important for this task including domestic use absametov et al 2017a b smolyar et al 2012 the groundwater mineralization degrees are closely related to regional hydrogeochemical patterns shvartsev and shen 2016 sydykov and davletgaliev 1989 drever 1997 when using groundwater for domestic use several groups are differentiated as follows i type water ultra fresh with mineralization up to 0 1 g l the first stage of atmospheric precipitation with a predominance of sio2 over calcium bicarbonates ii type water moderately fresh with a mineralization of 0 1 0 5 g l a next stage of water transformation water movements underground increase salt composition with sodium calcium bicarbonates sulfates and chlorides of alkali and alkaline earth elements iii type water normally fresh waters with salinity of 0 5 1 0 g l with increased sulfate and chloride ions in water composition iv type water slightly brackish water with mineralized salinity higher than 1 g l high sulfate and chloride ions in water composition the a zone with the ii iii types water moderately and normally fresh with a mineralization of 0 1 1 0 g l is widespread in the central kazakhstan research area fig 4 this zone a is forming a system of low mountains and highlands of the balkhash teniski watershed as well as the individual mountain ranges of saryoba kalmakemel bektauata the highest elevation 900 1500 m is located in the east and northeast where a system of low mountains and highlands from the balkhash teniz watershed kzylrai mountains 1565 m karkaraly 1403 m kent 1411 m the groundwater is mainly associated with effusive sedimentary rocks and intrusive formations of the pre paleozoic and paleozoic eras which are almost everywhere exposed or overlain by dark chestnut soils these mountainous areas are characterized by intense fracturing with relatively good washing of water bearing rocks to a depth of 30 50 m in terms of chemical composition the waters are mainly bicarbonate calcium sodium with a mineralization of 0 1 0 7 g l the source of underground runoff formation is atmospheric precipitation the b zone with the iv type water fig 4 slightly brackish water with mineralized salinity higher than 1 g l by composition sulfate hydrocarbonate sulfate sulfate chloride and chloride mainly sodium with subzones b1 1 3 g l b2 3 5 g l b3 5 10 g l sydykov zh s shcherbina 1980 slightly brackish groundwater is formed as a result of soluble salts in the water bearing rocks leaching sediments interconnections during the water exchange processes within ancient and modern river valleys in the peripheral parts of the central kazakhstan mountain folded regions slightly brackish groundwater is distinguished by the diversity of its chemical composition among other groundwater due to the influence of natural hydrogeological and physicochemical factors the slightly brackish groundwater is mostly sulfate hydrocarbonate sodium calcium and sulfate sodium calcium sulfate chloride sodium calcium and sulfate chloride sodium magnesium brackish groundwater are less common the initial chemical composition of water in the modeled system is similar to the composition of rainfall sampled in the vicinity of the karkaralinsk city mg l so4 2 2 1 cl 1 26 hco3 5 5 mg2 0 48 na 0 97 ca 2 4 17 and k 0 7 at ph 7 13 a t 25 с and p 98066 5 pa smolyar et al 2012 absametov et al 2017a b another equally important factor controlling the chemical equilibrium in the system is the partial pressure of the dissolved gasses drever 1997 shvartsev 1978 at the same time the soil layer is essential as a source of delivery of organic matter and carbon dioxide to groundwater the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in groundwater is significantly higher about 30 fold than in the atmosphere a distinctive feature of soils when interacting with groundwater is the presence in addition to organic compounds that contribute to a high partial pressure of carbon dioxide in soil solutions and the groups of minerals they contain 1 dissolving congruently saline horizons and 2 dissolving incongruently mainly aluminosilicates and silicates the peculiarity dissolution of aluminosilicates with all its complexity is mainly associated with hydrolysis garrels and christ 1965 shcherbina 1980 shvartsev 1998 the hydrolysis process involves the mutual chemical decomposition of solid substance and water when water dissociates into h and oh oh ions are neutralized by carbon dioxide and form hco3 ions and the h ions enter the crystal lattice of aluminosilicates with the formation of clay minerals table 1 the chemical compositions of the waters are predominantly calcium sodium hydrocarbonate with a mineralization of 0 1 0 7 g l analyzing the forms of occurrence of carbonate in water it can be stated that in acidic waters with low mineralization carbonic acid prevails lmg 2 95 g mol kg the content of which does not change with increasing mineralization as shown in fig 2 a at the same time the behavior of hydro carbonate is determined by the amount of oh and co2 and is equivalent to the content of cations transferred into the solution as the salinity of the solution increases there is a proportional increase in the concentration of hydro carbonate in water from lgm 4 63 to 0 75 g mol kg and accordingly the alkaline acid indicator changes from acidic ph 4 65 to alkaline ph 8 61 sulfur migration in natural waters is carried out mainly in the form of a sulfate ion with an ionic radius of 2 95 a which determines the high mobility of anions the content of sulfates in water when interacting with soils is controlled by the thickness of the gypsum layer so in the gypsum horizon where its concentration is 0 6 almost 1 46 g mol kg and at 0 8 gypsum in soils its content is already equal to 1 37 g mol kg as shown in tables 2 and 3 thus the increase in the content of sulfate ion in waters is limited by the amount of gypsum in the solid phase since the solution has not yet reached saturation with sulfate compounds as shown in fig 3 b e proportional growth is also characteristic of the concentration of chlorine in water as the degree of the reaction increases its amount is measured from lgm 10 2 to 4 32 g mol kg the complexation of this anion is weak and in natural waters the ion cl is usually present the large radius of a chlorine ion 1 81 a in combination with its low valence determines the good migration ability of chloride compounds the most widespread chlorides are calcium magnesium sodium potassium barium and other compounds that dissolve easily in water the negative charge of chlorine almost completely excludes its absorption by colloids in the hypergenesis zone because they clay and humus are also negatively charged therefore for chlorine in the hypergenesis zone there are almost no physicochemical barriers which turns it into a very energetic water migrant the soil layer also plays an important role in the formation of the cationic composition of infiltrating waters if at the initial stage of interaction in the solution the cation composition is approximately the same then as the mineralization increases the sodium content increases noticeably which is associated with the predominance of sodium containing minerals in the system as shown in fig 3 c the main forms of sodium in the waters are the following na with a maximum content in the system lgm 0 67 g mol kg nahco3 lgm 1 7 g mol kg na2co3 lgm 2 1 g mol kg na2so4 lgm 3 24 g mol kg and nahsio3 lgm 4 7 g mol kg with an increase in the salinity of the aqueous solution the content of sodium compounds naturally increases as well which characterizes it as a well migrating element in addition sodium ion as a rule does not enter the crystal lattice of clay minerals and is completely removed by solutions during leaching of aluminosilicates the migration features of calcium in the system are determined by the equilibrium state with calcium carbonate which at ph 7 5 and a calcium content of lgm 2 28 g mol kg begins to fall out of solution as shown in fig 3 c e however it is predominant in the chemical composition in the lithosphere calcium occupies the fifth place among the leading elements of the earth s crust in addition the large size of the ionic radius of this cation does not allow it to enter oxygen tetrahedra and octahedra together with magnesium and potassium and participate in the construction of a lattice of clay minerals this is one of the reasons for the absence of calcium containing clay minerals and its relatively high mobility in the hypergenesis zone in comparison with magnesium and potassium during the interphase transition calcium in solution is present in the form of free ions hydroxyls and sulfates an increase in the amount of gypsum and calcite salts in the system leads to a natural increase in calcium ions in the aqueous phase with a minimum concentration lgm 2 28 g mol kg which is characteristic of the degree of 2 reaction as shown in fig 3 d e the behavior of magnesium is more complicated which under equal migration conditions with calcium passes into water more intensively this is largely due to the smaller radius of its ions 0 74 a compared to calcium the solubility of an ionic compound is higher the greater the difference in ionic radius between the ions that make up this compound so the sulfate ion has a radius of 2 95 a and with a small ionic radius of the magnesium cation 0 74 a forms an easily soluble salt of mgso4 however magnesium in the solution of the system is by onefold or even twofold lower than calcium and the main form of the element is free ions with the maximum concentration lgm 3 41 g mol kg at lgm 2 this is due to a small amount of magnesium in the rock only colored minerals biotite and hornblende contain magnesium in addition magnesium enters the crystal lattice of the mineral and is removed from solution during the formation of clay minerals chlorite in particular the behavior of aluminum and iron in water is controlled by the product of the hydroxide solubility of these elements and does not depend on the increase in the degree of the reaction at the same time their content in solution in the presence of silicon in the aqueous phase depends on the alkaline acid index and is controlled by the equilibrium state with clay minerals it is easy to see as shown in fig 3 c that in weak acid media the migration of the aluminum ion is higher than that in neutral and alkaline ones but even here it remains very low lgm 7 46 g mol kg thus the soil layer is not only a supplier of organic matter and highly soluble compounds from saline permeable horizons but also enriches the water solution with elements of the parent rock as a result of its destruction as is commonly known formation of waters chemical composition and changes in physicochemical conditions lead to the destruction of large fragments and the formation of clay minerals i e to soil transformation in places where the soil layer is absent the ratio between the basic components of the groundwater chemical composition especially the cationic is determined by the composition of the water bearing parent rocks under these conditions their mineralization often increases as a result of the leaching of alkaline earth elements from water bearing rocks mainly due to the destruction of plagioclases which leads to the predominance of calcium hydro carbonates in the groundwater macro component composition and the formation of hydro carbonate calcium waters in granite massifs and the thickness of ore bearing formations the leading place is occupied by alkaline components and sulfates as a result of the peculiarities of their petrochemical composition in groundwater excessive concentration of alkaline elements in water in well drained areas mainly in areas of developed acidic rocks promotes the formation of sodium hydro carbonate or sodium calcium hydrocarbonate waters of type i in the zone of the distribution of fresh groundwater according to the conditions for the formation of its chemical composition three hydro chemical groups are distinguished as follows a hydro carbonate calcium sodium in some places sodium waters of types i and ii developed mainly in the mountainous parts of the region where the main forming factors of their chemical composition were atmospheric precipitation and composition of water bearing rocks b hydro carbonate sulfate calcium sodium waters of type ii these are in the low mountainous parts of the region both in the north and in the east where the formation of their chemical composition is influenced by soluble salts of the cover formations of the aeration zone c sulfate sodium calcium waters of type ii these have a limited area of distribution they are associated with paleozoic rocks enriched in sulfate minerals the zone of sub saline waters b is present almost over the entire area of the region in the thickness of various types of rocks on the surface of which light chestnut and brown soils with different types and thickness of the saline horizon are often developed the subzone with groundwater salinity of 1 3 g l is widespread in the region it is present both in the shallow hills and in the foothills along the periphery of the mountain ranges waters are present both in the plain part of the region and in the foothills along the periphery of the mountain ranges in a strip 80 100 km wide this subzone is formed as a result of leaching of soluble salts of water bearing rocks and overlying sediments at relatively weak water exchange processes in the peripheral parts of the zone facing the alimentation areas mountains of kyzylrai karkaraly kent bektau ata groundwater is mainly sulfate hydro carbonate sodium calcium the supply and discharge of groundwater in the region are due to the peculiarity of the territorial distribution of hydrodynamic areas determined by the relief the geological and facies composition of the water bearing rocks and climatic zonality akhmedsafin et al 1981 as the alimentation areas pass away and the soil salinity increases they become sulfate sodium calcium and sulfate chloride types ii and iii type ii is associated with ore bearing sedimentary volcanic and intrusive rocks with a thin quaternary cover type iii is developed in local areas of heterogeneous paleozoic rock complexes t their surfaces are eluvial deluvial formations of considerable thickness replenishment of groundwater is carried out by the inflow of water from overlying complexes and infiltration of atmospheric precipitation their mode largely depends on climate forming conditions the annual amplitude of fluctuations in their level is 0 6 1 m ahmedsafin et al 1979 to establish the effect of the soil layer on the groundwater chemical composition in this subzone we used a series of physicochemical models in the water soil gas system at the same time it was found that in contrast to the freshwater zone a in the formation of the chemical composition of zone b the congruent dissolution of carbonate sulfate and chloride minerals of the soil layer is of great importance in this regard we considered two versions of the model of the interaction of water with light chestnut soils on granodiorites depending on the thickness of the saline soil horizon 1 the content of calcite 0 2 and gypsum 0 1 in the system 2 the content of calcite 0 3 and gypsum 1 2 the second component of the adopted model is atmospheric precipitation when modeling the chemical composition is taken to be similar to rainfall in the region of karaganda mg l so4 2 7 37 cl 1 22 hco3 11 16 mg2 0 38 na 0 91 ca2 2 83 and k 1 56 at a ph of 6 24 t 25 с total p 98066 5 pa and partial p co2103 pa in the first option at low concentrations of calcite and gypsum in light chestnut soils the chemical composition of the solution is formed as a result of incongruent dissolution of a large fraction of soils as shown in fig 5 at the same time depending on the degree of the reaction the content of carbonate compounds varies g mol kg for hydro carbonate from 4 62 to 0 86 carbonic acid from 3 35 to 2 95 sodium hydrocarbonate from 10 7 to 1 91 calcium hydrocarbonate from 10 to 3 43 magnesium hydrocarbonate from 9 96 to 4 51 carbonate from 10 3 to 2 15 and sodium carbonate from 15 2 to 2 21 shown in table 4 in addition the aqueous phase contains g mol kg sulfate ions from 8 22 to 2 25 orthosilicic acid from 9 to 4 82 chloride ions from 10 2 to 5 33 calcium sulfate from 12 4 to 4 94 magnesium sulfate from 12 5 to 6 21 sodium sulfate from 14 1 to 3 29 and other compounds as shown in fig 5 b c as the mineralization of the aqueous solution increases the alkaline acid index also increases from 4 68 to 8 71 the heterogeneity of soil forming factors associated with moisture conditions fluctuations in absolute marks and a variety of steepness and exposure of slopes leads to different soil salinity which naturally affects the chemical composition of groundwater shown in table 5 with an increase in the amount of gypsum in system 1 2 the content of sulfate compounds in the solution increases tenfold so the concentration of sulfate ion ranges from 7 15 to 1 18 g mol kg sodium sulfate from 13 to 2 14 g mol kg calcium sulfate from 11 3 to 3 65 and magnesium sulfate from 11 4 to 5 06 the process of dissolution of carbonate salts seems to be more complicated the solubility of which depends on the partial pressure of co2 the ph value and the saturation of the solution with carbonates in the system when the degree of reaction is 0 1 or 2 calcium carbonate is in the solid phase and only at a ph of less than 7 4 do the carbonate salts start to pass into solution as shown in fig 5 d the study of the behavior of the leading elements of the groundwater chemical composition testifies to the unequal degree of their concentration as the total content of salts in the solution increases the same works on modeling the chemical composition are found in the works apollarro et al 2021 fuoco et al 2021 shvartsev 2005 thus the calcium content in water is controlled primarily by the solubility of its carbonates all waters of the studied region with mineralization above 1 g l are saturated with calcite absametov et al 2017a b shvartsev et al 2007 consequently the mineralization of groundwater in the subzone from 1 to 3 g l increases due to compounds of sulfate ions the relative increase in the amount of sulfate ions in groundwater is explained both by the dissolution of the sulfate salts of the overlying sediments and by the oxidation of sulfide minerals of bedrocks which are widespread in almost all aquifers of the region s rocks and often form deposits and ore occurrences based on the above descriptions of fresh and low mineralized hydrogeochemical zones it is possible to distinguish the general nature of the regular change in the groundwater mineralization and chemical composition which occurs as a result of the long term formation of the landscape in particular this regularity is clearly established during the formation of saline waters when the dissolution and leaching of water bearing rocks prevails over the influx accumulation of salts occurs in the influx horizon groundwater salinity increases with the movement of groundwater from alimentation areas to discharge areas 3 conclusions the formation of the chemical composition of groundwater occurs under complex dynamic relationships with natural geological and hydrogeological conditions the main natural factors that determine the nature of the migration of chemical elements in groundwater are the physiographic geological structural and hydrogeological features of the region the maximum possible consideration and assessment of the intensity duration and direction of each of them with the establishment of their interaction will most reliably illuminate and understand the complex hydrogeochemical processes occurring in groundwater when considering the water migration of chemical elements in the earth s crust scientists propose to distinguish between internal and external factors of element migration such factors that control the migration of chemical elements in groundwater include temperature pressure alkaline acid and redox characteristics of the aquatic environment other scientists are inclined to believe that the value of indicators is primarily determined by climatic and landscape conditions the relief of the territory another important feature is hydrogeochemical zonation based on the groundwater chemical composition due to the influence of many localized natural and geological factors the chemical element migration in natural waters makes it possible to approach the quantitative assessment of some geological processes such as chemical weathering denudation changes in the mineral content of rocks soil salinization formation and destruction of mineral deposits within this research work the main regional hydrogeochemical formation patterns of fresh and sub saline groundwater for household and drinking purposes in the territory of central kazakhstan were investigated the features of chemical composition of groundwater formation for the leaching zone and the continental salinization zone were analyzed it was shown that transformations of the chemical composition of groundwater during the formation of their geochemical zoning directly affect the concentration of standardized chemical elements in them the chemical composition of water movement was investigated the two main factors influencing the chemical compositions were investigated including a the water rock interaction for mountain folded areas and b water soil gas interaction and evaporative concentration water evaporation and salts accumulation for flat areas the physical and chemical modeling by the gibbs free energy minimization method which is based on the thermodynamics laws were provided to analyze processes of these two main factors influencing the chemical compositions the heterogeneity of soil forming factors associated with moisture conditions fluctuations in absolute marks a variety of steepness and exposure of slopes leads to different soil salinity which affects the chemical composition of groundwater the study results show that with the growth of the gypsum 1 2 the sulfate compounds content increases tenfold in the carbonated water acidic waters with low mineralization prevails lmg 2 95 g mol kg and the content does not change with increasing mineralization the bicarbonate is determined by the amount of oh and co2 and it is equivalent to the content of cations that have passed into the solution as the salinity of the solution increases there is a proportional increase in the concentration of bicarbonate in water from lmg 4 63 to 0 75 g mol kg and accordingly the alkaline acid index changes from acidic ph 4 65 to alkaline ph 8 61 the sulfur migration in natural waters is carried out mainly in the form of a sulfate ion with an ionic radius of 2 95 a which determines the high mobility of anions the content of sulfates in water is controlled by the thickness of the gypsum layer so in the gypsum horizon where its concentration at 0 6 is almost 1 46 g mol kg and at 0 8 gypsum in soils its content is already 1 37 g mol kg the increase in the content of sulfate ions in waters is limited by the amount of gypsum in the solid phase since the solution has not yet reached saturation with sulfate compounds the two main factors

bicarbonate calcium sodium in the feeding zones of the mountain folded areas originally with water movement down to the flat areas the mineralization increases the water s mineralization increases and becomes more sulfate to chloride the hydrogeochemical zonings are traced by classifying into two zones a and b the a zone with the ii iii types water moderately and normally fresh with a mineralization of 0 1 1 0 g l which is widespread in the central kazakhstan research area this zone a is forming a system of low mountains and highlands of the balkhash teniski watershed as well as the individual mountain ranges of saryoba kalmakemel bektauata the groundwater is mainly associated with effusive sedimentary rocks and intrusive formations of the pre paleozoic and paleozoic periods which are almost everywhere exposed or overlain by dark chestnut soils these mountainous areas are characterized by intense fracturing with relatively good washing of water bearing rocks to a depth of

11663,water resources including potable water availability are complicated issues in many kazakhstan regions central kazakhstan region is one such region which requires the proper support in the water supply most of the kazakhstan regions had been using mostly surface water however with the limitation of the surface water the groundwater resources have been used more intensively during the last decades at the same time the groundwater chemical composition plays a decisive role for categorization as the potable water within this research work the chemical composition of groundwater formation features in the arid conditions of kazakhstan are presented the regional hydrogeochemical field works were carried out to establish the patterns of fresh and brackish groundwater formation in the arid conditions of kazakhstan the two main factors influencing the chemical compositions were investigated including a the water rock interaction for mountain folded areas and b water soil gas interaction and evaporative concentration water evaporation and salts accumulation for flat areas the physical and chemical modeling by the gibbs free energy minimization method which is based on the thermodynamics laws were provided to analyze processes of these two main factors influencing the chemical compositions the results of these analyses for the a mountain folded areas we found that with the growth of gypsum 1 2 in the rock the content of sulfate compounds in water increases tenfold in the fractured rocks of mountain folded areas with free access to atmospheric air open system waters are enriched with oxygen and carbon dioxide at the same time the cationic composition of waters is determined by the lithological composition of the rocks the sodium cations predominate in granite massifs calcium is predominant in enriched calcium minerals bicarbonate anions predominate in the anionic component with weak mineralization for the b flat areas as mineralization increases due to the interaction of water soil gas and evaporative concentration the chemical composition changes the changes occur from sulfate to chloride in anions and from calcium to sodium in cations these two main factors pattern a b influencing the chemical compositions were also observed in the bigger regional hydrogeochemical studies mountain folded with connected flat areas waters are predominantly fresh

territory and time insufficient consideration of the water factor in the location of industry and agriculture use rapid growth in water consumption and irrational use of scarce water resources have

composition mapping of insufficient moisture zones which covers central kazakhstan region are important investigations for scientific and practical importance absametov et al 2017a b smolyar et al 2012 despite the low mineralization and the chemical composition simplicity groundwater consists of a complex multicomponent hydrogeochemical system sydykov et al 2014 jing et al 2019 several dozen chemical elements are investigated with various concentrations in the fresh low mineralized groundwater of kazakhstan smolyar et al 2012 sydykov and absametov 2014 there is a close relationship between the formation of the chemical composition of groundwater and the distribution of soils in the region to study the effect of soils on the chemical composition of groundwater and the features of element migration in waters we applied physicochemical modeling in the water soil gas system using the selector software package bychinsky et al 2004 karpov 1981 this program is based on the gibbs free energy minimization principle to analyze the soil influence on the chemical composition and water particles migration the purpose of this research is to assess the regional hydrogeochemical formation patterns of fresh and sub saline groundwater in the arid conditions of central kazakhstan which are very important for domestic drinking water supply the chemical composition of fresh and slightly saline groundwater horizontal hydrogeochemical zoning of groundwater in relation to the hydrogeological conditions of central kazakhstan were investigated by combining the field works investigations previously published and archival data on the research areas absametov et al 2017a b sydykov and absametov 2014 dokuchaev 1889 fersman 1955 as a result of the dissolution of rocks by natural waters and the selective concentration of some chemical elements and the dispersion of others due to binding them in the form of secondary mineral phases leads to the formation of various geochemical types of groundwater mazukhina et al 2009 sklyarova et al 2011 the central kazakhstan region precipitation archives near the cities of karkaralinsk and karaganda were analyzed the composition of soils hydro geology data of the region were used from the research group s previous studies and other researchers works nikanorov et al 1983 the physical and chemical modeling in the water soil gas system using the selector software package were applied bychinsky et al 2004 karpov 1981 based on the principle of minimizing the gibbs free energy to study the effect of soils on the chemical composition of groundwater and water particles migration the use of physical and chemical modeling of the water rock gas system which is based on the gibbs free energy minimization principle forms the basis for substantiating the conceptual model of a non equilibrium self developing system 2 study area central kazakhstan s arid region is our research area fig 1 the area characterized with limited surface runoff groundwater resources are the only source of water for many people in this region the groundwater of different territories landscapes regions has a unique chemical composition these indicators are necessary for the water supply investigations zverev 1982 one of the important indicators for groundwater chemical composition changes investigation is hydro chemical zoning mapping the groundwater hydro chemical zoning is primarily associated with the landscape geochemical conditions of the region and consists of 1 dry steppes with dark chestnut and light chestnut soils 2 desert steppes and deserts with brown desert steppe and gray brown soils fig 1 nikanorov et al 1983 absametov et al 2017a b dry steppes are localized in the north region of the research area fig 1 within the distribution of dark chestnut soils a low mountain relief with absolute marks of 1000 1500 m prevails composed of effusive sedimentary rocks and intrusive formations of the paleozoic era abdulin 1981 a relatively large amount of atmospheric precipitation prolonged snow melting and significant dissection of the relief provide favorable conditions for groundwater supply to form hydro carbonate sodium calcium waters with a low salinity of 0 07 0 4 g l in wider ranges the mineralization of groundwater values varies from 0 7 to 19 6 g l with bicarbonate calcium sodium and sulfate sodium compositions bespalov 1971 saprykin 1984 desert steppes with brown desert steppe soils cover basement plains compiled by small hummocks and are located in the south of the region fig 1 the water bearing rocks are the effusive sedimentary rocks of the upper middle paleozoic fig 2 the formation of groundwater occurs mainly due to the infiltration of atmospheric precipitation shvartsev 1978 nikanorov et al 1983 the recharge areas are small hillside ridges and individual low mountain outliers rising against the background of the basement plains from where the underground runoff towards the relief depressions occurs the noted hydrogeological features of the area predetermine the chemical composition of groundwater at the same time the salinity of water varies widely from 0 3 in the understood parts to 22 g l in the plain part with an average value for the region of 2 g l fresh waters are sulfate hydro carbonate calcium sodium and sulfate sodium waters generally have a salinity of more than 1 g l there is a close relationship between the formation of the chemical composition of groundwater and the peculiarity of the soil distribution in the region to study the effect of soils on the chemical composition of groundwater and the features of the migration of elements in waters we carried out the physical and chemical modeling in the water soil gas system using the selector software package based on the principle of minimizing the gibbs free energy karpov 1981 bychinsky et al 2004 when modeling to characterize the chemical composition of rainfall we analyzed precipitation in the north near karkaralinsk city and in the south of karaganda city fig 2 absametov et al 2017a b 2 1 orography the relief climate hydrography geological and structural features of the region are the main natural factors that determine the conditions for groundwater formation the role of these factors is very significant both in the formation of groundwater chemical composition and in the assessment of their resources they also mainly determine the conditions of feeding transit and discharge of aquifers and complexes shvartsev 1998 2013 the territory of central kazakhstan is characterized by a variety of landscape and geological conditions as a result of which its hydrogeological situation is characterized by great complexity and variability absametov et al 2017a b shagarova et al 2018 most of the territory is occupied by a shallow and hilly elevated plain typical for central kazakhstan with relatively well defined general slopes from the central part of the balkhash teniz watershed where absolute marks reach 1400 1500 m the maximum mark is confined to the top of mount kyzylrai 1565 m the relative elevation is 150 400 m smolyar et al 2012 absametov et al 2017a b in different parts of central kazakhstan depending on the relief the nature of the native substrate microclimate and water regime different types of soils and in accordance with this plant communities were formed in most of the territory dark chestnut brown and gray brown soils are widespread often with saline solonetz and takyr like formations in the floodplains of rivers gullies lacustrine depressions and in the depressions between the hills chernozem meadow chestnut and meadow alluvial soils are found the climate of the territory under consideration is mainly sharply continental and arid but very heterogeneous due to large differences in the relief structure the average annual air temperature varies from 2 to 2 5 с to 5 7 с cold weather occurs in late october and lasts until april the average annual absolute air humidity varies from 5 to 7 mbar the average annual wind speed is from 3 5 to 5 0 m s the average layer of annual precipitation does not exceed 260 mm absametov et al 2017a b sydykov and absametov 2014 2 2 hydrogeological setting central kazakhstan is characterized by a shallow hillside relief which favors the formation of underground runoff and promotes intensive water exchange the main structural and tectonic feature of the region is the presence of an uplifted caledonian hercynian mountain fold area and adjacent large cimmerian alpine downfolds of the rocky basement from the west and southwest belonging to young platform structures as well as from the north of rocky basement downfolds filled with a thick mass mesozoic and cenozoic sedimentary rocks sydykov et al 2014 absametov et al 2017a b the hydrogeological difference between these parts of the territory lies in the fact that within the mountain folded part which occupies most of the karaganda region predominantly unconfined fissure waters of shallow circulation and groundwater are developed confined to the zone of exogenous and endogenous fracturing of uneven aged effusive intrusive and metamorphosed sedimentary rocks downfolds which are the marginal parts of artesian basins the main role belongs to pore bed confined groundwater confined to the rocks of a loose sedimentary cover smolyar et al 2012 absametov et al 2017a b sydykov and absametov 2014 the boundaries between pore strata groundwater and fracture zones are divided along underground watersheds and differ from each other in the characteristics of the distribution of groundwater salinity and chemical composition the turgai downfold is located in the western part of central kazakhstan according to the structure of the mesozoic cenozoic cover in the turgai basin there are two regions northern and southern with different hydrogeological conditions the southern part of the basin is part of central kazakhstan and is represented by aquifers and complexes of quaternary upper pliocene middle quaternary oligocene eocene upper cretaceous lower middle cretaceous and jurassic sediments fig 2 in the kazakh uplands aquifers and horizons are developed in quaternary alluvial oligocene miocene jurassic sediments as well as water bearing zones of fracturing terrigenous middle carboniferous permian

document regulating the quality of groundwater for household and drinking purposes and determining their suitability for use in kazakhstan is the sanitary rules sanitary and epidemiological requirements for water sources water intake points for household and drinking purposes domestic and drinking water supply and places of cultural and domestic water use and safety of water bodies which was approved by the minister of national economy of the republic of kazakhstan no 209 as of march 16 2015 order of the margat and van der gun 2013 the list of standardized indicators of the sanitary rules in addition to the usual macro components of the chemical composition of groundwater cl so4 2 contains a large number of micro components f fe mn as be sr mo se zn cu pb cd cr hg which are divided into two groups by their concentrations and biochemical significance shvartsev 2008 polubarinova kochina 1977 absametov et al 2017a b the first group is the low mineralized groundwater which has small natural concentrations of elements much lower than the maximum allowable concentration mac these elements include cu 1 0 mg l mo 0 25 mg l pb 0 03 mg l zn 5 0 mg l kaz sanitary 2015 the

contents is established in the groundwater of all aquifers with a change in its content from 0 2 to 1 0 mg l they are mainly associated with volcanogenic and volcano plutonic hydrothermal metasomatic ore formations these are copper porphyry gold copper molybdenum copper molybdenum mo ranges from 0 1 to 0 3 mg l in the northern balkhash region while the maximum concentrations have been established for paleozoic intrusive formations lead pb occurs up to 0 03 mg l in the underground waters of the northern balkhash region lead is widespread and is characteristic of many ore formations the dissolution of lead minerals in groundwater manifests itself with different intensity shvartsev 2008 zinc zn content in the underground waters of the northern balkhash region is up to 5 0 mg l the relatively high value of the coefficient of variation of zinc in groundwater within the ore formation confirms its assignment to the group of mobile elements that are sensitive to changes in concentration in water bearing rocks this is largely due to the stability and relatively good solubility of its chemical compounds polubarinova kochina 1977 within the second group of groundwater which has high natural concentrations of elements iron fe are found in all aquifers its content in groundwater is up to 0 3 mg l in groundwater iron compounds are likely candidates for the role of migration carriers of other elements groundwater containing high iron content is predominantly calcium sulfate type ii with a mineralization of 2 3 g l fluorine f in various contents is established in the groundwater of all aquifers with a change in its content from 0 7 to 1 5 mg l they are mainly associated with volcanogenic formations beryllium be content in the underground waters of the northern balkhash region is very low up to 0 0002 mg l in the groundwater of the region manganese is found almost everywhere its occurrence varies from 50 to 80 selenium se is found in groundwater of all aquifers up to 0 0001 mg l its minimum content in various aquifers is characteristic of the upper carboniferous water bearing rocks arsenic as is found in groundwater of all aquifers up to 0 05 mg l strontium sr is established in the groundwater of all aquifers up to 7 0 mg l in the groundwater of the region manganese mn is found almost everywhere its occurrence varies from 86 to 100 the content of manganese in groundwater is average sydykov et al 2014 absametov et al 2017a b 2 5 steps modeling the physical and chemical modeling in the water soil gas system using the selector software package based on the principle of minimizing the gibbs free energy were applied bychinsky et al 2004 to study the effect of soils on the chemical composition of groundwater and water particles migration we analyzed precipitation in the north of the region near the city of karkaralinsk and in the south of the city of karaganda figs 1 and 2 through this modeling to characterize the chemical composition of rainfall absametov et al 2017a b smolyar et al 2012 under isobaric isothermal conditions a multicomponent system is in equilibrium when its free energy function will have a minimum value the free energy of the system as a function of the composition in vector form has the form g x q r t x ln x x x ln γ q q j j l vector dash means transposition operation whose element q j is the isobaric isothermal potential of i mole of component j at a given temperature pressure and appropriate choice of the standard state for the activity coefficient γ j of the same component r is the universal gas constant t is temperature k γ γ j j l x x j j l α α ф x x a α ф normalization condition that specifies the structure of the system with respect to its phase and component composition karpov 1981 bychinsky et al 2004 in the calculations the function qt j is used which replaces the values of q j and does not affect the final result calculated by optimal programming methods the proof of this fundamental question is considered in detail in karpov 1981 the mass balance equation system can be written as a x β here a aij i 1n j 1 m matrix of coefficients showing the number of moles of stoichiometric unit i in component j β β i i 1n the vector of the initial chemical composition of the system whose element β i is the number of moles of stoichiometric unit i in the system it is assumed that the initial data are given in such a way that n ф n in the system a x β is always consistent the rank a is equal to the number of equations it is equal to the number n additional equations can be included in the system of mass balance equations for example if according to the conditions of the problem it is required to maintain the constancy of the volume of the system at a given temperature and pressure for this additional equation in matrix a the coefficients at x will be the values of the partial volumes of the components of the system α β v will represent the total molecular volume of the system for the electrical neutrality equation if it is included in the system of mass balance equations β e 0 then the system as a whole is electrically neutral the coefficients in the matrix a at x j will be the charges of the components karpov 1981 sklyarova et al 2011 thus to calculate the equilibrium composition of an isobaric isothermal system it is required to find such molar amounts of dependent components that would satisfy the mass balance equations and at the same time ensure the minimum value of the isobaric isothermal potential of the system at the same time we note the most important property of the function g x the property on which in fact the entire derivation of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the equilibrium of the system is built with their explicit analytical representation in the form of a system of equalities and inequalities karpov 1981 sklyarova et al 2011 the relationship between the main components of the chemical composition of groundwater is determined by the composition of water bearing rocks and the intensity of water exchange their mineralization often increases as a result of leaching of alkaline earth elements from rocks mainly due to the destruction of plagioclases this leads to the predominance of calcium bicarbonates in the macro component composition of groundwater with the transformation of type ii waters an excess concentration of alkaline elements in well drained areas of acidic rocks leads to the formation of bicarbonate sodium or bicarbonate sodium calcium waters of type i akhmedsafin et al 1981 the chemical composition of groundwater sensitively reacts to changes in the totality of the natural geological and hydrogeological conditions of the territory this is the basis for setting up hydrogeochemical searches moreover if the microelement composition of the ore bearing complex of rocks and especially ore deposits is revealed in groundwater then the microcomponent composition of the water bearing complexes themselves and components brought by underground runoff from other areas or introduced from the outside by surface runoff and precipitation will be much more clearly established in it sydykov et al 1991 indeed if within the chu ili ore belt groundwater from fresh to salty of different chemical composition is developed then this is certainly the result of a complex impact of various physiographic geological and hydrogeological factors permanent and seasonal the atmospheric salinity is essential in formation of the chemical composition of the fractured waters of the alimentation areas absametov et al 2017a b smolyar et al 2012 moreover the chemical composition of rain and snow waters differs markedly sydykov et al 2014 nikanorov et al 1983 if the melt water has a predominantly hydro carbonate sulfate composition with a salinity of 0 02 0 05 g l then rainwater is of hydro carbonate chloride composition with a total salinity of 0 05 0 9 g l the increased content of sulfates in the snow waters is probably due to the instability of the snow cover with its purification with the gypsum enriched dust the increase in the content of chlorine ions in rainfall occurs as a result of the circulation of air masses bringing moisture to the balkhash teniz watershed through northern kazakhstan where active deflation of sodium chloride from the surface of numerous dry lakes is noted it is possible that the formation of low mineralized chloride groundwater in the main watershed part is associated with atmospheric precipitation which seeps through the soil layer enriched with chlorides and in this environment the latter dissolve much faster than gypsum this is confirmed by the results of an experiment on determining the composition of the filtrate obtained by passing atmospheric water through a column of the soil layer at the same time at the beginning of the experiment the filtrate was intensively enriched with chlorine ions in subsequent portions sulfate ions played a significant role in the chemical composition of the filtered water this probably explains the fact that in the soil samples of the wet season there was less chlorine and more sulfate than in the samples of the dry season which are more enriched in chlorides soils of kazssr 1967 sokolov et al 1962 dark chestnut soils are most often confined to watershed plains and slight steep slopes with diluvial usually stony loam more than 80 cm thick according to x ray structural analysis fig 3 clay fractions are represented by goethite chlorite kaolinite and montmorillonite coarse fractions are similar in mineralogical composition to the parent rock albite anorthite orthoclase quartz biotite and hornblende in addition as a result of the circulation of substances and the transfer of salts associated with the water regime of soils the carbonate and gypsum horizons are formed in the soil horizon depending on the thickness of these horizons we considered three options when modeling 1 there is no saline horizon 2 the thickness of the carbonate horizon is 0 2 and gypsum is 0 6 and 3 the thickness of the carbonate horizon is 0 3 and gypsum is 0 8 2 6 steps results and discussion one of the important indicators of changes in the groundwater chemical composition is hydro chemical zoning caused by the impact of many natural and geological factors the chemical composition of groundwater represents the interaction of the earth components climate is the main factor determining the zoning of the natural context already by the end of the 19th century dokuchaev 1889 had shown the climatic zoning with vegetation distribution of established by a humboldt 1915 with soils and landscapes characteristics representing the earth s surface nature as the whole interconnected system fersman 1955 expanded the earth s surface zoning location law classifications with the geochemical phenomena each zone is characterized by a certain composition of groundwater as an element of the geochemical phenomena each groundwater chemical composition zone is characterized by the local environment landscape deviations local structures tectonic geomorphological hydrogeological soil conditions petrochemical metallogenic rock parameters the groundwater use for various purposes is largely determined by the water salinity and chemical composition jing et al 2019 edmunds and shand 2008 groundwater classification is important for this task including domestic use absametov et al 2017a b smolyar et al 2012 the groundwater mineralization degrees are closely related to regional hydrogeochemical patterns shvartsev and shen 2016 sydykov and davletgaliev 1989 drever 1997 when using groundwater for domestic use several groups are differentiated as follows i type water ultra fresh with mineralization up to 0 1 g l the first stage of atmospheric precipitation with a predominance of sio2 over calcium bicarbonates ii type water moderately fresh with a mineralization of 0 1 0 5 g l a next stage of water transformation water movements underground increase salt composition with sodium calcium bicarbonates sulfates and chlorides of alkali and alkaline earth elements iii type water normally fresh waters with salinity of 0 5 1 0 g l with increased sulfate and chloride ions in water composition iv type water slightly brackish water with mineralized salinity higher than 1 g l high sulfate and chloride ions in water composition the a zone with the ii iii types water moderately and normally fresh with a mineralization of 0 1 1 0 g l is widespread in the central kazakhstan research area fig 4 this zone a is forming a system of low mountains and highlands of the balkhash teniski watershed as well as the individual mountain ranges of saryoba kalmakemel bektauata the highest elevation 900 1500 m is located in the east and northeast where a system of low mountains and highlands from the balkhash teniz watershed kzylrai mountains 1565 m karkaraly 1403 m kent 1411 m the groundwater is mainly associated with effusive sedimentary rocks and intrusive formations of the pre paleozoic and paleozoic eras which are almost everywhere exposed or overlain by dark chestnut soils these mountainous areas are characterized by intense fracturing with relatively good washing of water bearing rocks to a depth of 30 50 m in terms of chemical composition the waters are mainly bicarbonate calcium sodium with a mineralization of 0 1 0 7 g l the source of underground runoff formation is atmospheric precipitation the b zone with the iv type water fig 4 slightly brackish water with mineralized salinity higher than 1 g l by composition sulfate hydrocarbonate sulfate sulfate chloride and chloride mainly sodium with subzones b1 1 3 g l b2 3 5 g l b3 5 10 g l sydykov zh s shcherbina 1980 slightly brackish groundwater is formed as a result of soluble salts in the water bearing rocks leaching sediments interconnections during the water exchange processes within ancient and modern river valleys in the peripheral parts of the central kazakhstan mountain folded regions slightly brackish groundwater is distinguished by the diversity of its chemical composition among other groundwater due to the influence of natural hydrogeological and physicochemical factors the slightly brackish groundwater is mostly sulfate hydrocarbonate sodium calcium and sulfate sodium calcium sulfate chloride sodium calcium and sulfate chloride sodium magnesium brackish groundwater are less common the initial chemical composition of water in the modeled system is similar to the composition of rainfall sampled in the vicinity of the karkaralinsk city mg l so4 2 2 1 cl 1 26 hco3 5 5 mg2 0 48 na 0 97 ca 2 4 17 and k 0 7 at ph 7 13 a t 25 с and p 98066 5 pa smolyar et al 2012 absametov et al 2017a b another equally important factor controlling the chemical equilibrium in the system is the partial pressure of the dissolved gasses drever 1997 shvartsev 1978 at the same time the soil layer is essential as a source of delivery of organic matter and carbon dioxide to groundwater the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in groundwater is significantly higher about 30 fold than in the atmosphere a distinctive feature of soils when interacting with groundwater is the presence in addition to organic compounds that contribute to a high partial pressure of carbon dioxide in soil solutions and the groups of minerals they contain 1 dissolving congruently saline horizons and 2 dissolving incongruently mainly aluminosilicates and silicates the peculiarity dissolution of aluminosilicates with all its complexity is mainly associated with hydrolysis garrels and christ 1965 shcherbina 1980 shvartsev 1998 the hydrolysis process involves the mutual chemical decomposition of solid substance and water when water dissociates into h and oh oh ions are neutralized by carbon dioxide and form hco3 ions and the h ions enter the crystal lattice of aluminosilicates with the formation of clay minerals table 1 the chemical compositions of the waters are predominantly calcium sodium hydrocarbonate with a mineralization of 0 1 0 7 g l analyzing the forms of occurrence of carbonate in water it can be stated that in acidic waters with low mineralization carbonic acid prevails lmg 2 95 g mol kg the content of which does not change with increasing mineralization as shown in fig 2 a at the same time the behavior of hydro carbonate is determined by the amount of oh and co2 and is equivalent to the content of cations transferred into the solution as the salinity of the solution increases there is a proportional increase in the concentration of hydro carbonate in water from lgm 4 63 to 0 75 g mol kg and accordingly the alkaline acid indicator changes from acidic ph 4 65 to alkaline ph 8 61 sulfur migration in natural waters is carried out mainly in the form of a sulfate ion with an ionic radius of 2 95 a which determines the high mobility of anions the content of sulfates in water when interacting with soils is controlled by the thickness of the gypsum layer so in the gypsum horizon where its concentration is 0 6 almost 1 46 g mol kg and at 0 8 gypsum in soils its content is already equal to 1 37 g mol kg as shown in tables 2 and 3 thus the increase in the content of sulfate ion in waters is limited by the amount of gypsum in the solid phase since the solution has not yet reached saturation with sulfate compounds as shown in fig 3 b e proportional growth is also characteristic of the concentration of chlorine in water as the degree of the reaction increases its amount is measured from lgm 10 2 to 4 32 g mol kg the complexation of this anion is weak and in natural waters the ion cl is usually present the large radius of a chlorine ion 1 81 a in combination with its low valence determines the good migration ability of chloride compounds the most widespread chlorides are calcium magnesium sodium potassium barium and other compounds that dissolve easily in water the negative charge of chlorine almost completely excludes its absorption by colloids in the hypergenesis zone because they clay and humus are also negatively charged therefore for chlorine in the hypergenesis zone there are almost no physicochemical barriers which turns it into a very energetic water migrant the soil layer also plays an important role in the formation of the cationic composition of infiltrating waters if at the initial stage of interaction in the solution the cation composition is approximately the same then as the mineralization increases the sodium content increases noticeably which is associated with the predominance of sodium containing minerals in the system as shown in fig 3 c the main forms of sodium in the waters are the following na with a maximum content in the system lgm 0 67 g mol kg nahco3 lgm 1 7 g mol kg na2co3 lgm 2 1 g mol kg na2so4 lgm 3 24 g mol kg and nahsio3 lgm 4 7 g mol kg with an increase in the salinity of the aqueous solution the content of sodium compounds naturally increases as well which characterizes it as a well migrating element in addition sodium ion as a rule does not enter the crystal lattice of clay minerals and is completely removed by solutions during leaching of aluminosilicates the migration features of calcium in the system are determined by the equilibrium state with calcium carbonate which at ph 7 5 and a calcium content of lgm 2 28 g mol kg begins to fall out of solution as shown in fig 3 c e however it is predominant in the chemical composition in the lithosphere calcium occupies the fifth place among the leading elements of the earth s crust in addition the large size of the ionic radius of this cation does not allow it to enter oxygen tetrahedra and octahedra together with magnesium and potassium and participate in the construction of a lattice of clay minerals this is one of the reasons for the absence of calcium containing clay minerals and its relatively high mobility in the hypergenesis zone in comparison with magnesium and potassium during the interphase transition calcium in solution is present in the form of free ions hydroxyls and sulfates an increase in the amount of gypsum and calcite salts in the system leads to a natural increase in calcium ions in the aqueous phase with a minimum concentration lgm 2 28 g mol kg which is characteristic of the degree of 2 reaction as shown in fig 3 d e the behavior of magnesium is more complicated which under equal migration conditions with calcium passes into water more intensively this is largely due to the smaller radius of its ions 0 74 a compared to calcium the solubility of an ionic compound is higher the greater the difference in ionic radius between the ions that make up this compound so the sulfate ion has a radius of 2 95 a and with a small ionic radius of the magnesium cation 0 74 a forms an easily soluble salt of mgso4 however magnesium in the solution of the system is by onefold or even twofold lower than calcium and the main form of the element is free ions with the maximum concentration lgm 3 41 g mol kg at lgm 2 this is due to a small amount of magnesium in the rock only colored minerals biotite and hornblende contain magnesium in addition magnesium enters the crystal lattice of the mineral and is removed from solution during the formation of clay minerals chlorite in particular the behavior of aluminum and iron in water is controlled by the product of the hydroxide solubility of these elements and does not depend on the increase in the degree of the reaction at the same time their content in solution in the presence of silicon in the aqueous phase depends on the alkaline acid index and is controlled by the equilibrium state with clay minerals it is easy to see as shown in fig 3 c that in weak acid media the migration of the aluminum ion is higher than that in neutral and alkaline ones but even here it remains very low lgm 7 46 g mol kg thus the soil layer is not only a supplier of organic matter and highly soluble compounds from saline permeable horizons but also enriches the water solution with elements of the parent rock as a result of its destruction as is commonly known formation of waters chemical composition and changes in physicochemical conditions lead to the destruction of large fragments and the formation of clay minerals i e to soil transformation in places where the soil layer is absent the ratio between the basic components of the groundwater chemical composition especially the cationic is determined by the composition of the water bearing parent rocks under these conditions their mineralization often increases as a result of the leaching of alkaline earth elements from water bearing rocks mainly due to the destruction of plagioclases which leads to the predominance of calcium hydro carbonates in the groundwater macro component composition and the formation of hydro carbonate calcium waters in granite massifs and the thickness of ore bearing formations the leading place is occupied by alkaline components and sulfates as a result of the peculiarities of their petrochemical composition in groundwater excessive concentration of alkaline elements in water in well drained areas mainly in areas of developed acidic rocks promotes the formation of sodium hydro carbonate or sodium calcium hydrocarbonate waters of type i in the zone of the distribution of fresh groundwater according to the conditions for the formation of its chemical composition three hydro chemical groups are distinguished as follows a hydro carbonate calcium sodium in some places sodium waters of types i and ii developed mainly in the mountainous parts of the region where the main forming factors of their chemical composition were atmospheric precipitation and composition of water bearing rocks b hydro carbonate sulfate calcium sodium waters of type ii these are in the low mountainous parts of the region both in the north and in the east where the formation of their chemical composition is influenced by soluble salts of the cover formations of the aeration zone c sulfate sodium calcium waters of type ii these have a limited area of distribution they are associated with paleozoic rocks enriched in sulfate minerals the zone of sub saline waters b is present almost over the entire area of the region in the thickness of various types of rocks on the surface of which light chestnut and brown soils with different types and thickness of the saline horizon are often developed the subzone with groundwater salinity of 1 3 g l is widespread in the region it is present both in the shallow hills and in the foothills along the periphery of the mountain ranges waters are present both in the plain part of the region and in the foothills along the periphery of the mountain ranges in a strip 80 100 km wide this subzone is formed as a result of leaching of soluble salts of water bearing rocks and overlying sediments at relatively weak water exchange processes in the peripheral parts of the zone facing the alimentation areas mountains of kyzylrai karkaraly kent bektau ata groundwater is mainly sulfate hydro carbonate sodium calcium the supply and discharge of groundwater in the region are due to the peculiarity of the territorial distribution of hydrodynamic areas determined by the relief the geological and facies composition of the water bearing rocks and climatic zonality akhmedsafin et al 1981 as the alimentation areas pass away and the soil salinity increases they become sulfate sodium calcium and sulfate chloride types ii and iii type ii is associated with ore bearing sedimentary volcanic and intrusive rocks with a thin quaternary cover type iii is developed in local areas of heterogeneous paleozoic rock complexes t their surfaces are eluvial deluvial formations of considerable thickness replenishment of groundwater is carried out by the inflow of water from overlying complexes and infiltration of atmospheric precipitation their mode largely depends on climate forming conditions the annual amplitude of fluctuations in their level is 0 6 1 m ahmedsafin et al 1979 to establish the effect of the soil layer on the groundwater chemical composition in this subzone we used a series of physicochemical models in the water soil gas system at the same time it was found that in contrast to the freshwater zone a in the formation of the chemical composition of zone b the congruent dissolution of carbonate sulfate and chloride minerals of the soil layer is of great importance in this regard we considered two versions of the model of the interaction of water with light chestnut soils on granodiorites depending on the thickness of the saline soil horizon 1 the content of calcite 0 2 and gypsum 0 1 in the system 2 the content of calcite 0 3 and gypsum 1 2 the second component of the adopted model is atmospheric precipitation when modeling the chemical composition is taken to be similar to rainfall in the region of karaganda

gypsum in light chestnut soils the chemical composition of the solution is formed as a result of incongruent dissolution of a large fraction of soils as shown in fig 5 at the same time depending on the degree of the reaction the content of carbonate compounds varies g mol kg for hydro carbonate from 4 62 to 0 86 carbonic acid from 3 35 to 2 95 sodium hydrocarbonate from 10 7 to 1 91 calcium

factors associated with moisture conditions fluctuations in absolute marks and a variety of steepness and exposure of slopes leads to different soil salinity which naturally affects the chemical composition of groundwater shown in table 5 with an increase in the amount of gypsum in system 1 2 the content of sulfate compounds in the solution increases tenfold so the concentration of sulfate ion ranges from 7 15 to 1 18 g mol kg sodium sulfate from 13 to 2 14 g mol kg calcium sulfate from 11 3 to 3 65 and magnesium sulfate from 11 4 to 5 06 the process of dissolution of carbonate salts seems to be more complicated the solubility of which depends on the partial pressure of co2 the ph value and the saturation of the solution with carbonates in the system when the degree of reaction is 0 1 or 2 calcium carbonate is in the solid phase and only at a ph of less than 7 4 do the carbonate salts start to pass into solution as shown in fig 5 d the study of the behavior of the leading elements of the groundwater chemical composition testifies to the unequal degree of their concentration as the total content of salts in the solution increases the same works on modeling the chemical composition are found in the works apollarro et al 2021 fuoco et al 2021 shvartsev 2005 thus the calcium content in water is controlled primarily by the solubility of its carbonates all waters of the studied region with mineralization above 1 g l are saturated with calcite absametov et al 2017a b shvartsev et al 2007 consequently the mineralization of groundwater in the subzone from 1 to 3 g l increases due to compounds of sulfate ions the relative increase in the amount of sulfate ions in groundwater is explained both by the dissolution of the sulfate salts of the overlying sediments and by the oxidation of sulfide minerals of bedrocks which are widespread in almost all aquifers of the region s rocks and often form deposits and ore occurrences based on the above descriptions of fresh and low mineralized hydrogeochemical zones it is possible to distinguish the general nature of the regular change in the groundwater mineralization and chemical composition which occurs as a result of the long term formation of the landscape in particular this regularity is clearly established during the formation of saline waters when the dissolution and leaching of water bearing rocks prevails over the influx accumulation of salts occurs in the influx horizon groundwater salinity increases with the movement of groundwater from alimentation areas to discharge areas 3 conclusions the formation of the chemical composition of groundwater occurs under complex dynamic relationships with natural geological and hydrogeological conditions the main natural factors that determine the nature of the migration of chemical elements in groundwater are the physiographic geological structural and hydrogeological features of the region the maximum possible consideration and assessment of the intensity duration and direction of each of them with the establishment of their interaction will most reliably illuminate and understand the complex hydrogeochemical processes occurring in groundwater when considering the water migration of chemical elements in the earth s crust scientists propose to distinguish between internal and external factors of element migration such factors that control the migration of chemical elements in groundwater include temperature pressure alkaline acid and redox characteristics of the aquatic environment other scientists are inclined to believe that the value of indicators is primarily determined by climatic and landscape conditions the relief of the territory another important feature is hydrogeochemical zonation based on the groundwater chemical composition due to the influence of many localized natural and geological factors the chemical element migration in natural waters makes it possible to approach the quantitative assessment of some geological processes such as chemical weathering denudation changes in the mineral content of rocks soil salinization formation and destruction of mineral deposits within this research work the main regional hydrogeochemical formation patterns of fresh and sub saline groundwater for household and drinking purposes in the territory of central kazakhstan were investigated the features of chemical composition of groundwater formation for the leaching zone and the continental salinization zone were analyzed it was shown that transformations of the chemical composition of groundwater during the formation of their geochemical zoning directly affect the concentration of standardized chemical elements in them the chemical composition of water movement was investigated the two main factors influencing the chemical compositions were investigated including a the water rock interaction for mountain folded areas and b water soil gas interaction and evaporative concentration water evaporation and salts accumulation for flat areas the physical and chemical modeling by the gibbs free energy minimization method which is based on the thermodynamics laws were provided to analyze processes of these two main factors influencing the chemical compositions the heterogeneity of soil forming factors associated with moisture conditions fluctuations in absolute marks a variety of steepness and exposure of slopes leads to different soil salinity which affects the chemical composition of groundwater the study results show that with the growth of the gypsum 1 2 the sulfate compounds content increases tenfold in the carbonated water acidic waters with low mineralization prevails lmg 2 95 g mol kg and the content does not change with increasing mineralization the bicarbonate is determined by the amount of oh and co2 and it is equivalent to the content of cations that have passed into the solution as the salinity of the solution increases there is a proportional increase in the concentration of bicarbonate in water from lmg 4 63 to 0 75 g mol kg and accordingly the alkaline acid index changes from acidic ph 4 65 to alkaline ph 8 61 the sulfur migration in natural waters is carried out mainly in the form of a sulfate ion with an ionic radius of 2 95 a which determines the high mobility of anions the content of sulfates in water is controlled by the thickness of the gypsum layer so in the gypsum horizon where its concentration at 0 6 is almost 1 46 g mol kg and at 0 8 gypsum in soils its content is already 1 37 g mol kg the increase in the content of sulfate ions in waters is limited by the amount of gypsum in the solid phase since the solution has not yet reached saturation with sulfate compounds the two main factors pattern a b influencing the chemical compositions were also observed in the bigger regional hydrogeochemical studies mountain folded with connected flat areas waters are predominantly fresh bicarbonate calcium sodium in the feeding zones of the mountain folded areas originally with water movement down to the flat areas the mineralization increases the water s mineralization increases and becomes more sulfate to chloride the hydrogeochemical zonings are traced by classifying into two zones a and b the a zone with the ii iii types water moderately and normally fresh with a mineralization of 0 1 1 0 g l which is widespread in the central kazakhstan research area this zone a is forming a system of low mountains and highlands of the balkhash teniski watershed as well as the individual mountain ranges of saryoba kalmakemel bektauata the groundwater is mainly associated with effusive sedimentary rocks and intrusive formations of the pre paleozoic and paleozoic periods which are almost everywhere exposed or overlain by dark chestnut soils these mountainous areas are characterized by intense fracturing with relatively good washing of water bearing rocks to a depth of 30 50 m in terms of chemical composition the waters are mainly bicarbonate calcium sodium with a mineralization of 0 1 0 7 g l the source of underground runoff formation is atmospheric precipitation the b zone with the iv type water slightly brackish water with mineralized salinity higher than 1 g l by composition sulfate hydrocarbonate sulfate sulfate chloride and chloride mainly sodium with subzones b1 1 3 g l b2 3 5 g l b3 5 10 g l the slightly brackish groundwater is mostly sulfate hydrocarbonate sodium calcium and sulfate sodium calcium sulfate chloride sodium calcium and sulfate chloride sodium magnesium brackish groundwater are less common this study is applicable for forecasting searching the fresh and slightly brackish waters which could be suitable for domestic water

11664,groundwater is a key source of freshwater for communities in many nations including sri lanka however with the current trends of population growth and climate change stress on groundwater is increasing at an alarming rate groundwater quality in sri lanka has already been depleted over time as a result of both anthropogenic and natural factors and there is a significant likelihood that such issues will get worse in the near future the overall groundwater quality in ratnapura district has not been the subject of any prior studies despite the fact that many residents depend on groundwater as their primary source of water under these circumstances this groundwater quality study was conducted to assess the groundwater quality in ratnapura district with respect to the drinking water quality standards in this study available data on 10 water quality parameters from 50 groundwater sources was utilized to analyze the groundwater quality using several statistical and graphical methods in particular the water quality index wqi geostatistical modeling hierarchical cluster analysis hca principal component analysis pca and spatial autocorrelation analysis were used to assess the overall water quality and potential causes for variations over the area overall results revealed significant deterioration of groundwater quality in the eastern and south eastern areas of the district multivariate analysis results revealed substantial differences between groundwater in the wet zone and the dry zone of the district implying increased mineralization of groundwater in the dry zone furthermore the results demonstrate that both climate and soil properties have a substantial impact on groundwater quality variation across the district future hydrogeological research in the area as well as water engineers policy makers government officials donor agencies etc will benefit from the findings of this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality index spatial autocorrelation analysis hierarchical cluster analysis principal component analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since it is the primary supply of water for those who live in arid and semi arid regions of the planet groundwater is just as important to human society as surface water jeihouni et al 2014 the main sources of drinking water for 36 4 and 3 2 of sri lanka s population respectively are domestic wells and tube wells ministry of city planning and water supply 2018 however due to both natural and anthropogenic activities deterioration of groundwater quality has been a common issue across the country groundwater sources in many areas are accumulated with contaminants from residential sewage urban runoff and agricultural seepage mahagamage and manage 2015 gunatilake 2016 when considering natural processes high fluoride and hardness in the dry zone groundwater jayawardana et al 2010 rubasinghe et al 2015 and high iron content in hard rocky alluvial soil areas are common groundwater issues in the country bandara 2003 further in some coastal areas salinity intrusion into groundwater has been escalating to a water crisis particularly in the jaffna peninsula gopalakrishnan et al 2020 on top of all of this the recently discovered chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology ckdu which is frequently linked to groundwater quality has been a common acute health issue in most dry zone areas dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 udeshani et al 2020 in this background monitoring and identifying groundwater sensitive areas in the country is critical for ensuring public health which in turn aids the country s economic and social development given the foregoing ratnapura district was particularly selected for this research since there is no previous study focused on the overall quality of groundwater in the district and it is a highly vulnerable area towards climate change and its negative impacts navaratne et al 2019 despite having substantial rainfall throughout the year ratnapura district is overwhelmed with drinking water issues both in terms of quality and quantity this is partly due to the lack of pipe borne water supply coverage in the district and the inadequate treatment of raw water in the community controlled water supply schemes in the area the poor quality of the water delivered by some community water supply schemes has been a persistent problem in other districts as well ratnayake et al 2006 asian development bank 2015 therefore the lack of groundwater quality studies in ratnapura district can be considered as a significant research gap in the drinking water supply sector in the area accordingly this study was planned to evaluate the groundwater quality in the district in terms of drinking water quality standards as well as to identify the possible underlying causes for the deterioration of groundwater quality in the area 2 study area sri lanka is a tropical country with three climate zones which are mainly characterized by the indian ocean monsoons kaleelm i m 2018 as shown in fig 1 b the dry zone is the largest climate zone in the country which receives a mean annual rainfall of around 1000 mm primarily from the northeast monsoon from october to january the south western part of the country belongs to the wet zone which receives mean annual rainfall of around 2500 mm mostly from the southwest monsoon from may to august jayasena et al 2008 rubasinghe et al 2015 the intermediate zone which combines traits from both the dry and wet zones is squeezed between these two distinct climate zones as shown in fig 1b ratnapura district uniquely placed across all three climate zones which has caused diverse environmental and climate conditions within the district as a result mean annual rainfall highly varied across the district from over 4000 mm in the western side to around 1000 mm in the southeastern side according to unpublished data of central environmental authority 2016 ratnapura district contains an area of 3239 km2 kaleelm i m 2018 for administrative purposes it has been divided into 17 divisional secretariats ds as depicted in fig 1c red yellow podzolic soils are the predominant soil category in ratnapura district according to the soil profile of the district fig 2 created using the sri lankan soil map european commission 2022 in fact it is the dominant soil group in the wet zone of sri lanka leelamanie et al 2013 however in the eastern and south eastern areas of the district reddish brown earth soils are the most common group of soils it is also the most widespread soil group in the dry zone of sri lanka leelamanie et al 2013 no hydrogeological research has specifically addressed the common aquifer types in ratnapura district however based on the country s aquifer map united nations educationalscientific and 2006 it can be fairly determined that shallow regolith aquifers with underlying deep fractured aquifers are the most common aquifer type in ratnapura district 3 methodology 3 1 water quality data collection in this study the results of 10 water quality parameters from 50 groundwater sources were analyzed this set of data was collected in ratnapura district as part of the world bank funded water supply and sanitation improvement project which aimed to develop rural water supply schemes all of the samples were collected either from dug wells or natural springs the ph color turbidity electrical conductivity ec alkalinity hardness chloride sulphate iron and total dissolve solids tds were the available parameters from these parameters the ph and ec were measured at site using a pre calibrated yinmik portable meter which contains a glass electrode bulb specifically sensitive to the hydrogen ion concentration and separate conductivity sensors for ec measurements samples were then transported to the national water supply and drainage board nws db laboratory at ratnapura standard methods recommended by apha 2017 for testing water quality parameters were followed while storing and transporting the samples 3 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis of water quality parameters spatial autocorrelation is an important aspect in any environment related spatial data analysis in particular a key element in determining the precision of spatial interpolation is the degree of spatial autocorrelation radocaj et al 2021 since its introduction in 1950 the moran s i index moran 1950 has been the most widely employed indicator to quantify the spatial autocorrelation of a data set in spatial distribution studies ijumulana et al 2020 radocaj et al 2021 the moran s i value ranges between 1 and 1 the spatial autocorrelation increases as the positive values increase which denotes a higher degree of spatial clustering of data on the other hand if the negative values are lower the autocorrelation is lower and the data are more dispersed a moran s i value of zero means results are completely randomly distributed in space moran 1950 wang et al 2022 moran s i value was calculated according to the following equation 1 1 i 1 i 1 n j 1 n w i j i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n x i x 2 where n represents the number of samples xi denotes the selected parameter value at the location i xj represents the values of the same parameter at all other locations x represents the average of all values of the same parameter and wij denotes the spatial weight which represents the spatial relationship among two nearby samples ijumulana et al 2020 moran s i index was calculated for water quality parameters as well as for wqi values using arcgis 10 2 1 software in addition to spatial autocorrelation high low clustering and hot spot analysis were performed using the getis ord general g tool available in arcgis 10 2 1 software this tool enables the identification of clustering patterns of high or low values related to the attributes of spatial data in a given area hot spot analysis visually identifies the areas where there are statistically significant clusters of high or low values in the given data set shen et al 2017 the formula for the calculation of g statistic is given in equation 2 2 g i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x j i 1 n j 1 n x i x j where xi and xj are the parameter values at locations i and j respectively wi j represents the spatial weight between locations i and j n is the number of samples in the given dataset villar navascues et al 2020 3 3 development of water quality index wqi the idea of the wqi is to represent the overall water quality by encompassing many water quality parameters in to single numeric value such that it reduces the complexity involved with interpretation of overall water quality in recent decades the wqi has been extensively used for assessment of water quality across the world ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 kachroud et al 2019 das et al 2022 and also in some parts of sri lanka rathnasiri and manage 2015 cooray et al 2019 udeshani et al 2020 furthermore the integration of wqi with gis technology has enabled the preparation of spatial distribution maps which can graphically represent the overall variation of groundwater quality over a large area alexander et al 2017 mahrokh et al 2019 tefera et al 2021 the idea of the wqi was initially proposed by horton 1965 after that many experts in the field have introduced different forms of water quality indexes which have their own merits and demerits kachroud et al 2019 in this research weighted arithmetic method was used to develop wqi since it is the most widely used method for both surface and groundwater studies ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 patel and vadodaria 2015 ibrahim 2019 in this method assigning weightages to parameters and the calculation of relative weights for each parameter equation 3 can be considered as the first steps in the calculation process 3 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi relative weight wi assigned weightage n number of parameters however the final index value can vary greatly depending on the weights assigned necessitating the knowledge of experts in the field kachroud et al 2019 therefore it was decided to look into the literature and accordingly the most regularly used weightages for each parameter were selected based on similar groundwater studies table 1 shows the selected weightages for each parameter in the next step a quality rating scale qi was derived for each parameter equation 4 in this study sls 614 2013 the sri lankan standards for drinking water quality slsi 2013 was used to obtain the standard limits for water quality parameters si which are also given in table 1 however there is no recommended maximum limit on ec in both sls 614 and who standards world health organization 2017 therefore the maximum limit of 750 μs cm for ec was used to evaluate the wqi as adopted by mahagamage et al 2016 patel and vadodaria 2015 4 q i c i i i s i i i x 100 where ci concentration measured value of ith parameter si standard limit of ith parameter in drinking water ii ideal value of ith parameter ii for ph 7 and for all other parameters 0 finally in order to compute the water quality index equations 5 and 6 were used 5 s i i w i x q i 6 w q i i 1 n s i i where sii is the sub index of the ith parameter and the wqi value is the arithmetic sum of sub indices of all the measured parameters of the given sample the wqi results from these calculations were categorized using the brown et al 1972 classification scale which was used in many other previous studies saleem et al 2016 balamurugan et al 2020 udeshani et al 2020 accordingly samples were put into one of five categories based on wqi scores excellent 0 25 good 26 50 poor 51 75 very poor 76 100 and unsuitable 100 3 4 preparation of spatial distribution maps spatial distribution maps were used to represent the spatial variation of wqi for groundwater in ratnapura district the spatial distribution map of wqi was created using arcgis 10 2 1 software arcgis offers a variety of spatial interpolation techniques although no technique is completely accurate for all types of studies bronowicka mielniczuk et al 2019 however many studies have found that kriging methods in particular the ok method produce more precise prediction surfaces than other approaches coulibaly and becker 2007 shamsudduha 2007 ohmer et al 2017 yet idw method is the most frequently used deterministic method and often in the context of comparison with kriging methods li and heap 2011 bronowicka mielniczuk et al 2019 geostatistical methods such as kriging are reliable for interpolation when a high spatial autocorrelation exists among the data and idw method is more suitable when the data with a low level of spatial autocorrelation has to be analyzed jie et al 2013 therefore the spatial autocorrelation result of wqi values was considered for selecting the best suited method among idw and kriging methods however the resulted moran s i value of wqi was only 0 288 which indicated a positive yet reduced degree of spatial correlation among the data therefore as an additional check the cross validation approach davis 1987 was used to assess the accuracy of prediction surfaces generates by both methods mean error me root mean square error rmse mean standardized error mse and root mean square standardized error rmsse are among the error measures which are most widely used for assessment of spatial interpolation methods li and heap 2011 wu 2016 radocaj et al 2021 me is derived from equation 7 and is used to assess the level of bias in interpolations li and heap 2011 for greater interpolation accuracy the mean error value must be as close to zero as possible a measure of error size is provided by rmse and it can be denoted as in equation 8 7 m e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 8 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 where n is the number of sample points and pi denotes the predicted value at point i similarly oi denotes the observed value at point i the me and rmse values of the ok and idw methods were compared for the given data set using the geostatistical analyst tool available in arcgis 10 2 1 software the me value was found to be 0 1537 for the ok interpolation method which is significantly better than the idw method s me value of 3 6075 the rmse value of kriging method 35 1839 was also slightly better than the relevant value of idw method 39 4601 in addition mse and rmsse values were also calculated for the ok method these functions are not available for the idw method in arcgis 10 2 1 the mse and rmsse values for a given dataset need to be as close as possible to 0 and 1 respectively for higher accuracy and the formulas for these two measures are given in equations 9 and 10 li and heap 2011 esri 2022 9 m s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s i 10 r m s s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s i 2 where psi and osi stand for standardized predicted value and standardized observed value at point i respectively for the provided dataset the mse and rmsse values for the ok interpolation method were found to be 0 0014 and 0 9263 respectively demonstrating a satisfactory level of accuracy therefore considering both spatial autocorrelation and these results the ok method was used to produce the spatial distribution map for wqi 3 5 multivariate statistical analysis modern multivariate statistical techniques have emerged as effective tools for analyzing and managing groundwater quality machwal and jha 2015 selvakumar et al 2017 bodrud doza 2019 hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca are the two multivariate statistical techniques used to analyze groundwater data in this research cluster analysis is a useful method of sorting a large set of data into groups based on similarities and dissimilarities of data between the selected data points in this analysis agglomerative or a bottom up approached was utilized using spss statistics 25 0 software as the method of clustering ward s method with squared euclidean distance was utilized as in many other previous studies machwal and jha 2015 selvakumar et al 2017 walter et al 2017 a dendrogram was derived to graphically represent and distinguish the clusters formed arcgis 10 2 1 software was used to identify the spatial distribution of main clusters and to visually analyze the relationship between the spatial distribution of clusters with underlying soil conditions and climate conditions principal component analysis pca is a multivariate statistical analysis method as well which linearly transforms original variables into new variables called principal components similar to hca spss statistics 25 0 software was used to perform pca the extracted principal components pcs were further used to identify the major differences in groundwater quality over the study area 4 results and discussion 4 1 general and geostatistical analysis results of water quality parameters a summary of the results of 10 water quality parameters from 50 groundwater sources and a comparison with sri lankan water quality standards sls 614 slsi 2013 are given in table 2 according to the findings it is evident that out of the 10 parameters 4 values in particular have significantly surpassed the standard limitations outlined in sls 614 those are turbidity by 24 alkalinity by 14 hardness by 18 and iron by 14 in this study global moran s i value was used to analyze the spatial autocorrelations of parameter values in the area results of moran s i analysis are given in table 3 five parameters including ec alkalinity hardness sulphate and tds showed strong spatial autocorrelation in the area each of these parameters had a moran s i value more than or close to 0 5 all five of these parameters have a z score value critical value larger than 2 58 and a p value significance level less than 0 05 indicating that the high and or low values of each parameter are geographically clustered in the given data set ijumulana et al 2021 atabati et al 2022 esri 2022 these five parameters were further examined using getis ord g statistics to analyze the spatial patterns in the area high low clustering results are given in table 4 and the resulted hot spots maps are given in fig 3 separately for each parameter turbidity is the most deteriorating parameter among the tested parameters with 24 of samples having turbidity levels higher than the sls tolerance limit of 2 ntu turbidity is an optical characteristic of water that measures the relative clarity of water the common assumption for turbidity in groundwater is the contamination of groundwater with surface runoff in particular in high rainfall areas the continual process of dissolution and leaching of organic material on the surface due to frequent rain could lead to high turbidity in groundwater ojo et al 2012 moran s i value of 0 0323 indicates high and low values of turbidity are scattered across the district without significant spatial autocorrelation this suggests that higher turbidity levels are caused by localized factors such as unprotected wells as per table 2 hardness and alkalinity are among the parameters which have comparatively lower compliance with standard limits hardness is the presence of polyvalent cations in water especially ca2 and mg2 world health organization 2010 while alkalinity can be defined as the acid neutralizing capacity of water apha 2017 both hardness and alkalinity have shown high spatial autocorrelation and clustering fig 3 b and c show a clustering of higher values hot spots in the district s south eastern part embilipitiya and weligepola ds divisions which is in the country s dry zone in fact all five parameters in fig 3 have shown hot spots in the same area which indicates higher mineralization of groundwater in the dry zone of the district both alkalinity and hardness in groundwater are functions of the geology of the area and the percolation of rain water which has dissolved co2 from the atmosphere raju 2014 when considering geological inputs limestone is the major source for both hardness and alkalinity though its composition varies ranging from calcite caco3 to dolomite caco3 mgco3 however calcite is the most abundant substance in limestone which makes ca2 ions the most accountable cation type for groundwater hardness boyd et at 2016 the presence of crystalline limestone rocks has been well identified even from the early studies of the area panabokke 1962 the limestone cave located at wawulpane near the border of embilipitiya and kolonna ds divisions is another sound indication of the presence of limestone in the area thamodi and kumara 2020 total iron concentrations exceeded the standard limit of 0 3 mg l in 14 of the samples groundwater in the area has a minimal level of spatial autocorrelation with respect to iron as indicated by the moran s i value of 0 0564 and the p value of 0 4089 since iron is the most abundant metallic element in the earth s outer crust hem 1985 iron in these groundwater samples could have originated from various mineral sources ngah and nwankwoala 2013 iron is also added to the groundwater from the leaching of organic waste and plant debris from the surface apha 2017 the limonitic iron ores are abundant in ratnapura district and the deposits are highly scattered with nearly 50 such deposits identified in the district jayawardena 1984 this explains the scattered nature of the groundwater sources with high iron content 4 2 water quality index wqi resulted wqi values for considered groundwater sources varied from the lowest of 8 00 in kalawana ds division up to the maximum of 184 64 in weligepola ds division the mean and standard deviation of the resulting wqi values were 44 98 and 35 11 respectively as per the wqi classification scale proposed by brown et al 1972 most samples fell into excellent and good categories with each having 16 32 and 18 36 samples from the rest of the samples 10 20 2 4 and 4 8 samples fell into the poor very poor and unsuitable categories respectively the moran s i value of wqi was found to be 0 2881 with z and p values of 3 3982 and 0 0007 which indicate moderate spatial autocorrelation in the district fig 4 shows the spatial distribution map for wqi in the district produced using the ordinary kriging ok interpolation method as per fig 4 wqi values increased from north west to south east directions across the district which indicates deterioration of groundwater quality from wet zone to dry zone eheliyagoda kuruwita kiriella ayagama and ratnapura ds divisions which are located in the wet zone showed lower levels of wqi values less deterioration of groundwater quality while emiblipitiya weligepola and godakawela ds divisions exhibited higher levels of wqi values which represents relatively high deterioration of groundwater quality 4 3 water quality statistics in different climate zones table 2 also summarized the general statistics of the different water quality parameter values as well as the wqi in each climate zone both the resultant mean wqi values and the spatial distribution map of wqi confirm the deterioration of groundwater quality from wet zone to dry zone results in table 2 indicate six water quality parameters have considerably contributed for deteriorated groundwater quality in dry zone of the district those are ec tds alkalinity hardness sulphate and chloride and all these parameters are either direct or indirect representatives of dissolved ions in water world health organization 2017 the increase of dissolved solids or ions in groundwater in dry climate conditions can be due to several reasons low rainfall and high evaporation rates exacerbated by high ambient temperature cause salt accumulation in groundwater in the country s dry zone rubasinghe et al 2015 in particular sodium potassium and chloride ions are abundant in the groundwater of the dry zone credited to excessive evaporation dissanayake and weerasooriya 1985 in contrast high precipitation and continuous leaching of rain water ions and other dissolved particles dilute them considerably and flush them out with the underground flow of water jayawardana et al 2010 the underground lithology of the area also plays a major role in the mineral content of groundwater dissanayake and weerasooriya 1985 ligate et al 2021 for instance groundwater in contact with mafic rocks contains high dissolved solids while quartzose metaclastic rocks causes the groundwater to have low dissolved solids jayasena et al 2008 the effects of soil conditions in the area on groundwater are further discussed in section 4 5 4 4 hierarchical cluster analysis hca in groundwater studies cluster analysis has been effectively used to group groundwater sources in a selected area and also to identify areas with degraded groundwater quality deepesh and madan 2014 wali et al 2022 in this study 10 water quality parameters of 50 groundwater sources were utilized for hca using spss software and the resulted dendrogram fig 5 revealed two distinctive clusters cluster 1 and 2 are comprised of 32 and 18 sampling locations respectively the mean values of water quality parameters and wqi in both clusters were compared in table 5 one of the major observations from table 5 is the deterioration of overall water quality in cluster 2 wqi 60 78 when compared with cluster 1 wqi 30 75 out of the 10 parameters measured 6 parameters clearly stand out as the contributors to higher wqi in cluster 2 increments ranging from 245 to 743 those parameters are ec alkalinity hardness chloride sulphate and tds which indicate higher mineralization of groundwater in cluster 2 the spatial distributions of these two clusters were visually analyzed by marking the sampling points of the two clusters on the ratnapura district map as shown in fig 5 the constituents of groundwater are highly affected by the prevailing climate conditions and the underlying geology of the area dissanayake and weerasooriya 1985 therefore the soil map of ratnapura district and climate zone boundaries were also inserted in the map which would provide some valuable insight on the possible reasons for variations in clusters when considering the underlying soil conditions most of the district soil profile consists of red yellow podzolic soils and most of the cluster 1 sampling points are located in this soil type 30 out of 32 in contrast the majority of the cluster 2 sampling points are located on reddish brown earth type soils in the eastern and south eastern parts of the district the red yellow podzolic soils are the dominant soil group in the wet zone of the country leelamanie et al 2013 in this type of soil ph values are often less than 5 5 and the cation exchange capacity of this soil type tends to be relatively low moormann and panabokke 1961 in contrast reddish brown earth type soils are the most widespread soil group in the dry zone leelamanie et al 2013 and have ph values of between 6 0 and 7 0 usually together with higher cation exchange capacity moormann and panabokke 1961 it is obvious that the underlying soil features play a significant effect in influencing the chemical composition of groundwater because of the spatial distribution of the two clusters in these two different types of soils all the sampling points of cluster 1 are distributed in wet and intermediate zones only while cluster 2 mostly distributed in dry and intermediate zones fig 6 this indicates the influence of climate conditions for the variation of groundwater quality in the two clusters distribution of cluster 1 dominantly in the wet zone can also explain the possible reasons behind the higher mean value of color in cluster 1 table 4 color in natural water typically caused by the presence of organic substances mainly originated from decaying of surface vegetation higher percolation of surface water due to continual rainfall in the wet zone can carry relatively high loads of decaying organic matter to groundwater which causes the increment of color in groundwater ojo et al 2012 4 5 principal component analysis pca principal components pcs with eigenvalues greater than 1 0 were considered for further analysis since those are the pcs that best explain the variance of analyzed data machiwal and jha 2015 harman 1960 accordingly 3 pcs were extracted and table 6 shows the software generated component matrix which presents the influence of each parameter for the given pc the first second and third pcs represent the majority of the variance in the data set with 49 2 25 3 and 10 3 of the total variance respectively table a1 these three pcs collectively represent 84 8 of the total variance and the rest of the pcs account for small amounts of percentages and hence can be considered as negligible ganegoda et al 2018 figure a1 shows the resultant scree plot or the graph of pc numbers vs respective eigenvalues the first pc which explains the majority of the total variance has been mainly contributed by the following parameters ec 0 987 tds 0 977 total hardness 0 958 total alkalinity 0 890 sulphate 0 792 and chloride 0 747 these results of pc1 match with the hca results in table 6 both indicating a strong correlation between the mineralization process and the formation of two distinct water quality patterns natural chemical processes such as cation exchange dissolution of calcite dolomitization and sulphate reduction can lead to such a high concentration of minerals in groundwater celestino et al 2018 the second principal component pc2 is mostly dominated by turbidity 0 927 color 0 890 and total iron 0 806 turbidity and color in groundwater are mostly related to the leaching of surface water in particular in areas with high rainfall the continual process of dissolution and leaching of organic material and other particles on the surface due to frequent rain could lead to high turbidity and color in groundwater ojo et al 2012 further continual leaching of rainwater dilutes the ionic concentrations of groundwater and negates the effects of the mineralization process dissanayaka and weerasoorya 1985 which might have led to lowering the parameters such as ec tds sulphate chloride hardness and alkalinity in pc2 4 6 limitations this study was based on the data collected by the water supply and sanitation improvement project as a base line survey in the area though extreme weather conditions were avoided during sample collection seasonal variations were not covered by the sample collection process sample density was also restricted due to the limited resource availability furthermore anion and cation concentrations were not measured separately considering the availability of resources and the requirements of the project in particular major cations and anions concentration could have revealed intriguing aspects of the groundwater in the area such as groundwater types in the area and their origins therefore advanced experiments incorporating the measurement of ionic concentrations are recommended for better understanding of the groundwater constituents in this diverse area 5 conclusions this study is the first comprehensive investigation on overall groundwater quality in ratnapura district and for the first time the dramatic variances in groundwater quality across the area were highlighted in this study the resultant spatial distribution map of wqi revealed significant deterioration of groundwater quality in the eastern and south eastern parts of the district this area of concern includes weligepola embilipitiya and madampe ds divisions as well as eastern parts of the kolonna and balangoda ds divisions in particular the hardness alkalinity and turbidity levels of the groundwater in these regions are either over or very close to the recommended maximum limits for drinking water these parameter concentrations may not pose a direct threat to human health on their own however objectionable taste and other related issues of hardness scaling soap consumption etc can make the groundwater of the area unsuitable for direct human consumption therefore unless there is no other viable water source it is best to avoid using groundwater in the area or to apply substantial hardness removal technologies before consumption the results of two multivariate statistical analysis used hca and pca provided valuable insight on groundwater quality variation in the area hierarchical cluster analysis hca results indicated two major clusters cluster 01 dominating the wet zone and cluster 02 concentrated in the dry and intermediate zones of the district principal component analysis pca revealed ec tds hardness alkalinity and chloride as the parameters that contributed to the development of two clusters of sampling points with different characteristics overall results suggest that the climate conditions and underlying soil conditions play a major role in deciding the physical and chemical constituents of groundwater in ratnapura district mineralization of groundwater is high in dry zone areas compared to the wet zone natural chemical processes such as ion exchange reverse ion exchange dissolution of calcite dolomization sulphate reduction etc could have contributed to the higher ionic concentration in the dry zone groundwater this process of mineralization in the dry zone has also been facilitated by higher evaporation due to high ambient temperatures and the lack of rainfall for the dilution effect to take place further this study demonstrates the potential of the integration of statistical methods such as wqi hca pca etc with spatial analysis techniques for the investigation of groundwater quality over a large area as well as identifying the possible causes of groundwater deterioration the findings of this research can be successfully utilized by water supply engineers policymakers and other experts in the planning and design of drinking water supply schemes in the area further this study provides a basis for future hydrogeological studies in ratnapura district which in turn will be helpful for sustainable management of groundwater

11664,groundwater is a key source of freshwater for communities in many nations including sri lanka however with the current trends of population growth and climate change stress on groundwater is increasing at an alarming rate groundwater quality in sri lanka has already been depleted over time as a result of both anthropogenic and natural factors and there is a significant likelihood that such issues will get worse in the near future the overall groundwater quality in ratnapura district has not been the subject of any prior studies despite the fact that many residents depend on groundwater as their primary source of water under these circumstances this groundwater quality study was conducted to assess the groundwater quality in ratnapura district with respect to the drinking water quality standards in this study available data on 10 water quality parameters from 50 groundwater sources was utilized to analyze the groundwater quality using several statistical and graphical methods in particular the water quality index wqi geostatistical modeling hierarchical cluster analysis hca principal component analysis pca and spatial autocorrelation analysis were used to assess the overall water quality and potential causes for variations over the area overall results revealed significant deterioration of groundwater quality in the eastern and south eastern areas of the district multivariate analysis results revealed substantial differences between groundwater in the wet zone and the dry zone of the district implying increased mineralization of groundwater in the dry zone furthermore the results demonstrate that both climate and soil properties have a substantial impact on groundwater quality variation across the district future hydrogeological research in the area as well as water engineers policy makers government officials donor agencies etc will benefit from the findings of this study graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality index spatial autocorrelation analysis hierarchical cluster analysis principal component analysis data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction since it is the primary supply of water for those who live in arid and semi arid regions of the planet groundwater is just as important to human society as surface water jeihouni et al 2014 the main sources of drinking water for 36 4 and 3 2 of sri lanka s population respectively are domestic wells and tube wells ministry of city planning and water supply 2018 however due to both natural and anthropogenic activities deterioration of groundwater quality has been a common issue across the country groundwater sources in many areas are accumulated with contaminants from residential sewage urban runoff and agricultural seepage mahagamage and manage 2015 gunatilake 2016 when considering natural processes high fluoride and hardness in the dry zone groundwater jayawardana et al 2010 rubasinghe et al 2015 and high iron content in hard rocky alluvial soil areas are common groundwater issues in the country bandara 2003 further in some coastal areas salinity intrusion into groundwater has been escalating to a water crisis particularly in the jaffna peninsula gopalakrishnan et al 2020 on top of all of this the recently discovered chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology ckdu which is frequently linked to groundwater quality has been a common acute health issue in most dry zone areas dissanayake and chandrajith 2017 udeshani et al 2020 in this background monitoring and identifying groundwater sensitive areas in the country is critical for ensuring public health which in turn aids the country s economic and social development given the foregoing ratnapura district was particularly selected for this research since there is no previous study focused on the overall quality of groundwater in the district and it is a highly vulnerable area towards climate change and its negative impacts navaratne et al 2019 despite having substantial rainfall throughout the year ratnapura district is overwhelmed with drinking water issues both in terms of quality and quantity this is partly due to the lack of pipe borne water supply coverage in the district and the inadequate treatment of raw water in the community controlled water supply schemes in the area the poor quality of the water delivered by some community water supply schemes has been a persistent problem in other districts as well ratnayake et al 2006 asian development bank 2015 therefore the lack of groundwater quality studies in ratnapura district can be considered as a significant research gap in the drinking water supply sector in the area accordingly this study was planned to evaluate the groundwater quality in the district in terms of drinking water quality standards as well as to identify the possible underlying causes for the deterioration of groundwater quality in the area 2 study area sri lanka is a tropical country with three climate zones which are mainly characterized by the indian ocean monsoons kaleelm i m 2018 as shown in fig 1 b the dry zone is the largest climate zone in the country which receives a mean annual rainfall of around 1000 mm primarily from the northeast monsoon from october to january the south western part of the country belongs to the wet zone which receives mean annual rainfall of around 2500 mm mostly from the southwest monsoon from may to august jayasena et al 2008 rubasinghe et al 2015 the intermediate zone which combines traits from both the dry and wet zones is squeezed between these two distinct climate zones as shown in fig 1b ratnapura district uniquely placed across all three climate zones which has caused diverse environmental and climate conditions within the district as a result mean annual rainfall highly varied across the district from over 4000 mm in the western side to around 1000 mm in the southeastern side according to unpublished data of central environmental authority 2016 ratnapura district contains an area of 3239 km2 kaleelm i m 2018 for administrative purposes it has been divided into 17 divisional secretariats ds as depicted in fig 1c red yellow podzolic soils are the predominant soil category in ratnapura district according to the soil profile of the district fig 2 created using the sri lankan soil map european commission 2022 in fact it is the dominant soil group in the wet zone of sri lanka leelamanie et al 2013 however in the eastern and south eastern areas of the district reddish brown earth soils are the most common group of soils it is also the most widespread soil group in the dry zone of sri lanka leelamanie et al 2013 no hydrogeological research has specifically addressed the common aquifer types in ratnapura district however based on the country s aquifer map united nations educationalscientific and 2006 it can be fairly determined that shallow regolith aquifers with underlying deep fractured aquifers are the most common aquifer type in ratnapura district 3 methodology 3 1 water quality data collection in this study the results of 10 water quality parameters from 50 groundwater sources were analyzed this set of data was collected in ratnapura district as part of the world bank funded water supply and sanitation improvement project which aimed to develop rural water supply schemes all of the samples were collected either from dug wells or natural springs the ph color turbidity electrical conductivity ec alkalinity hardness chloride sulphate iron and total dissolve solids tds were the available parameters from these parameters the ph and ec were measured at site using a pre calibrated yinmik portable meter which contains a glass electrode bulb specifically sensitive to the hydrogen ion concentration and separate conductivity sensors for ec measurements samples were then transported to the national water supply and drainage board nws db laboratory at ratnapura standard methods recommended by apha 2017 for testing water quality parameters were followed while storing and transporting the samples 3 2 spatial autocorrelation analysis of water quality parameters spatial autocorrelation is an important aspect in any environment related spatial data analysis in particular a key element in determining the precision of spatial interpolation is the degree of spatial autocorrelation radocaj et al 2021 since its introduction in 1950 the moran s i index moran 1950 has been the most widely employed indicator to quantify the spatial autocorrelation of a data set in spatial distribution studies ijumulana et al 2020 radocaj et al 2021 the moran s i value ranges between 1 and 1 the spatial autocorrelation increases as the positive values increase which denotes a higher degree of spatial clustering of data on the other hand if the negative values are lower the autocorrelation is lower and the data are more dispersed a moran s i value of zero means results are completely randomly distributed in space moran 1950 wang et al 2022 moran s i value was calculated according to the following equation 1 1 i 1 i 1 n j 1 n w i j i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x x j x i 1 n x i x 2 where n represents the number of samples xi denotes the selected parameter value at the location i xj represents the values of the same parameter at all other locations x represents the average of all values of the same parameter and wij denotes the spatial weight which represents the spatial relationship among two nearby samples ijumulana et al 2020 moran s i index was calculated for water quality parameters as well as for wqi values using arcgis 10 2 1 software in addition to spatial autocorrelation high low clustering and hot spot analysis were performed using the getis ord general g tool available in arcgis 10 2 1 software this tool enables the identification of clustering patterns of high or low values related to the attributes of spatial data in a given area hot spot analysis visually identifies the areas where there are statistically significant clusters of high or low values in the given data set shen et al 2017 the formula for the calculation of g statistic is given in equation 2 2 g i 1 n j 1 n w i j x i x j i 1 n j 1 n x i x j where xi and xj are the parameter values at locations i and j respectively wi j represents the spatial weight between locations i and j n is the number of samples in the given dataset villar navascues et al 2020 3 3 development of water quality index wqi the idea of the wqi is to represent the overall water quality by encompassing many water quality parameters in to single numeric value such that it reduces the complexity involved with interpretation of overall water quality in recent decades the wqi has been extensively used for assessment of water quality across the world ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 kachroud et al 2019 das et al 2022 and also in some parts of sri lanka rathnasiri and manage 2015 cooray et al 2019 udeshani et al 2020 furthermore the integration of wqi with gis technology has enabled the preparation of spatial distribution maps which can graphically represent the overall variation of groundwater quality over a large area alexander et al 2017 mahrokh et al 2019 tefera et al 2021 the idea of the wqi was initially proposed by horton 1965 after that many experts in the field have introduced different forms of water quality indexes which have their own merits and demerits kachroud et al 2019 in this research weighted arithmetic method was used to develop wqi since it is the most widely used method for both surface and groundwater studies ramakrishnaiah et al 2009 patel and vadodaria 2015 ibrahim 2019 in this method assigning weightages to parameters and the calculation of relative weights for each parameter equation 3 can be considered as the first steps in the calculation process 3 w i w i i 1 n w i where wi relative weight wi assigned weightage n number of parameters however the final index value can vary greatly depending on the weights assigned necessitating the knowledge of experts in the field kachroud et al 2019 therefore it was decided to look into the literature and accordingly the most regularly used weightages for each parameter were selected based on similar groundwater studies table 1 shows the selected weightages for each parameter in the next step a quality rating scale qi was derived for each parameter equation 4 in this study sls 614 2013 the sri lankan standards for drinking water quality slsi 2013 was used to obtain the standard limits for water quality parameters si which are also given in table 1 however there is no recommended maximum limit on ec in both sls 614 and who standards world health organization 2017 therefore the maximum limit of 750 μs cm for ec was used to evaluate the wqi as adopted by mahagamage et al 2016 patel and vadodaria 2015 4 q i c i i i s i i i x 100 where ci concentration measured value of ith parameter si standard limit of ith parameter in drinking water ii ideal value of ith parameter ii for ph 7 and for all other parameters 0 finally in order to compute the water quality index equations 5 and 6 were used 5 s i i w i x q i 6 w q i i 1 n s i i where sii is the sub index of the ith parameter and the wqi value is the arithmetic sum of sub indices of all the measured parameters of the given sample the wqi results from these calculations were categorized using the brown et al 1972 classification scale which was used in many other previous studies saleem et al 2016 balamurugan et al 2020 udeshani et al 2020 accordingly samples were put into one of five categories based on wqi scores excellent 0 25 good 26 50 poor 51 75 very poor 76 100 and unsuitable 100 3 4 preparation of spatial distribution maps spatial distribution maps were used to represent the spatial variation of wqi for groundwater in ratnapura district the spatial distribution map of wqi was created using arcgis 10 2 1 software arcgis offers a variety of spatial interpolation techniques although no technique is completely accurate for all types of studies bronowicka mielniczuk et al 2019 however many studies have found that kriging methods in particular the ok method produce more precise prediction surfaces than other approaches coulibaly and becker 2007 shamsudduha 2007 ohmer et al 2017 yet idw method is the most frequently used deterministic method and often in the context of comparison with kriging methods li and heap 2011 bronowicka mielniczuk et al 2019 geostatistical methods such as kriging are reliable for interpolation when a high spatial autocorrelation exists among the data and idw method is more suitable when the data with a low level of spatial autocorrelation has to be analyzed jie et al 2013 therefore the spatial autocorrelation result of wqi values was considered for selecting the best suited method among idw and kriging methods however the resulted moran s i value of wqi was only 0 288 which indicated a positive yet reduced degree of spatial correlation among the data therefore as an additional check the cross validation approach davis 1987 was used to assess the accuracy of prediction surfaces generates by both methods mean error me root mean square error rmse mean standardized error mse and root mean square standardized error rmsse are among the error measures which are most widely used for assessment of spatial interpolation methods li and heap 2011 wu 2016 radocaj et al 2021 me is derived from equation 7 and is used to assess the level of bias in interpolations li and heap 2011 for greater interpolation accuracy the mean error value must be as close to zero as possible a measure of error size is provided by rmse and it can be denoted as in equation 8 7 m e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 8 r m s e 1 n i 1 n p i o i 2 where n is the number of sample points and pi denotes the predicted value at point i similarly oi denotes the observed value at point i the me and rmse values of the ok and idw methods were compared for the given data set using the geostatistical analyst tool available in arcgis 10 2 1 software the me value was found to be 0 1537 for the ok interpolation method which is significantly better than the idw method s me value of 3 6075 the rmse value of kriging method 35 1839 was also slightly better than the relevant value of idw method 39 4601 in addition mse and rmsse values were also calculated for the ok method these functions are not available for the idw method in arcgis 10 2 1 the mse and rmsse values for a given dataset need to be as close as possible to 0 and 1 respectively for higher accuracy and the formulas for these two measures are given in equations 9 and 10 li and heap 2011 esri 2022 9 m s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s i 10 r m s s e 1 n i 1 n p s i o s i 2 where psi and osi stand for standardized predicted value and standardized observed value at point i respectively for the provided dataset the mse and rmsse values for the ok interpolation method were found to be 0 0014 and 0 9263 respectively demonstrating a satisfactory level of accuracy therefore considering both spatial autocorrelation and these results the ok method was used to produce the spatial distribution map for wqi 3 5 multivariate statistical analysis modern multivariate statistical techniques have emerged as effective tools for analyzing and managing groundwater quality machwal and jha 2015 selvakumar et al 2017 bodrud doza 2019 hierarchical cluster analysis hca and principal component analysis pca are the two multivariate statistical techniques used to analyze groundwater data in this research cluster analysis is a useful method of sorting a large set of data into groups based on similarities and dissimilarities of data between the selected data points in this analysis agglomerative or a bottom up approached was utilized using spss statistics 25 0 software as the method of clustering ward s method with squared euclidean distance was utilized as in many other previous studies machwal and jha 2015 selvakumar et al 2017 walter et al 2017 a dendrogram was derived to graphically represent and distinguish the clusters formed arcgis 10 2 1 software was used to identify the spatial distribution of main clusters and to visually analyze the relationship between the spatial distribution of clusters with underlying soil conditions and climate conditions principal component analysis pca is a multivariate statistical analysis method as well which linearly transforms original variables into new variables called principal components similar to hca spss statistics 25 0 software was used to perform pca the extracted principal components pcs were further used to identify the major differences in groundwater quality over the study area 4 results and discussion 4 1 general and geostatistical analysis results of water quality parameters a summary of the results of 10 water quality parameters from 50 groundwater sources and a comparison with sri lankan water quality standards sls 614 slsi 2013 are given in table 2 according to the findings it is evident that out of the 10 parameters 4 values in particular have significantly surpassed the standard limitations outlined in sls 614 those are turbidity by 24 alkalinity by 14 hardness by 18 and iron by 14 in this study global moran s i value was used to analyze the spatial autocorrelations of parameter values in the area results of moran s i analysis are given in table 3 five parameters including ec alkalinity hardness sulphate and tds showed strong spatial autocorrelation in the area each of these parameters had a moran s i value more than or close to 0 5 all five of these parameters have a z score value critical value larger than 2 58 and a p value significance level less than 0 05 indicating that the high and or low values of each parameter are geographically clustered in the given data set ijumulana et al 2021 atabati et al 2022 esri 2022 these five parameters were further examined using getis ord g statistics to analyze the spatial patterns in the area high low clustering results are given in table 4 and the resulted hot spots maps are given in fig 3 separately for each parameter turbidity is the most deteriorating parameter among the tested parameters with 24 of samples having turbidity levels higher than the sls tolerance limit of 2 ntu turbidity is an optical characteristic of water that measures the relative clarity of water the common assumption for turbidity in groundwater is the contamination of groundwater with surface runoff in particular in high rainfall areas the continual process of dissolution and leaching of organic material on the surface due to frequent rain could lead to high turbidity in groundwater ojo et al 2012 moran s i value of 0 0323 indicates high and low values of turbidity are scattered across the district without significant spatial autocorrelation this suggests that higher turbidity levels are caused by localized factors such as unprotected wells as per table 2 hardness and alkalinity are among the parameters which have comparatively lower compliance with standard limits hardness is the presence of polyvalent cations in water especially ca2 and mg2 world health organization 2010 while alkalinity can be defined as the acid neutralizing capacity of water apha 2017 both hardness and alkalinity have shown high spatial autocorrelation and clustering fig 3 b and c show a clustering of higher values hot spots in the district s south eastern part embilipitiya and weligepola ds divisions which is in the country s dry zone in fact all five parameters in fig 3 have shown hot spots in the same area which indicates higher mineralization of groundwater in the dry zone of the district both alkalinity and hardness in groundwater are functions of the geology of the area and the percolation of rain water which has dissolved co2 from the atmosphere raju 2014 when considering geological inputs limestone is the major source for both hardness and alkalinity though its composition varies ranging from calcite caco3 to dolomite caco3 mgco3 however calcite is the most abundant substance in limestone which makes ca2 ions the most accountable cation type for groundwater hardness boyd et at 2016 the presence of crystalline limestone rocks has been well identified even from the early studies of the area panabokke 1962 the limestone cave located at wawulpane near the border of embilipitiya and kolonna ds divisions is another sound indication of the presence of limestone in the area thamodi and kumara 2020 total iron concentrations exceeded the standard limit of 0 3 mg l in 14 of the samples groundwater in the area has a minimal level of spatial autocorrelation with respect to iron as indicated by the moran s i value of 0 0564 and the p value of 0 4089 since iron is the most abundant metallic element in the earth s outer crust hem 1985 iron in these groundwater samples could have originated from various mineral sources ngah and nwankwoala 2013 iron is also added to the groundwater from the leaching of organic waste and plant debris from the surface apha 2017 the limonitic iron ores are abundant in ratnapura district and the deposits are highly scattered with nearly 50 such deposits identified in the district jayawardena 1984 this explains the scattered nature of the groundwater sources with high iron content 4 2 water quality index wqi resulted wqi values for considered groundwater sources varied from the lowest of 8 00 in kalawana ds division up to the maximum of 184 64 in weligepola ds division the mean and standard deviation of the resulting wqi values were 44 98 and 35 11 respectively as per the wqi classification scale proposed by brown et al 1972 most samples fell into excellent and good categories with each having 16 32 and 18 36 samples from the rest of the samples 10 20 2 4 and 4 8 samples fell into the poor very poor and unsuitable categories respectively the moran s i value of wqi was found to be 0 2881 with z and p values of 3 3982 and 0 0007 which indicate moderate spatial autocorrelation in the district fig 4 shows the spatial distribution map for wqi in the district produced using the ordinary kriging ok interpolation method as per fig 4 wqi values increased from north west to south east directions across the district which indicates deterioration of groundwater quality from wet zone to dry zone eheliyagoda kuruwita kiriella ayagama and ratnapura ds divisions which are located in the wet zone showed lower levels of wqi values less deterioration of groundwater quality while emiblipitiya weligepola and godakawela ds divisions exhibited higher levels of wqi values which represents relatively high deterioration of groundwater quality 4 3 water quality statistics in different climate zones table 2 also summarized the general statistics of the different water quality parameter values as well as the wqi in each climate zone both the resultant mean wqi values and the spatial distribution map of wqi confirm the deterioration of groundwater quality from wet zone to dry zone results in table 2 indicate six water quality parameters have considerably contributed for deteriorated groundwater quality in dry zone of the district those are ec tds alkalinity hardness sulphate and chloride and all these parameters are either direct or indirect representatives of dissolved ions in water world health organization 2017 the increase of dissolved solids or ions in groundwater in dry climate conditions can be due to several reasons low rainfall and high evaporation rates exacerbated by high ambient temperature cause salt accumulation in groundwater in the country s dry zone rubasinghe et al 2015 in particular sodium potassium and chloride ions are abundant in the groundwater of the dry zone credited to excessive evaporation dissanayake and weerasooriya 1985 in contrast high precipitation and continuous leaching of rain water ions and other dissolved particles dilute them considerably and flush them out with the underground flow of water jayawardana et al 2010 the underground lithology of the area also plays a major role in the mineral content of groundwater dissanayake and weerasooriya 1985 ligate et al 2021 for instance groundwater in contact with mafic rocks contains high dissolved solids while quartzose metaclastic rocks causes the groundwater to have low dissolved solids jayasena et al 2008 the effects of soil conditions in the area on groundwater are further discussed in section 4 5 4 4 hierarchical cluster analysis hca in groundwater studies cluster analysis has been effectively used to group groundwater sources in a selected area and also to identify areas with degraded groundwater quality deepesh and madan 2014 wali et al 2022 in this study 10 water quality parameters of 50 groundwater sources were utilized for hca using spss software and the resulted dendrogram fig 5 revealed two distinctive clusters cluster 1 and 2 are comprised of 32 and 18 sampling locations respectively the mean values of water quality parameters and wqi in both clusters were compared in table 5 one of the major observations from table 5 is the deterioration of overall water quality in cluster 2 wqi 60 78 when compared with cluster 1 wqi 30 75 out of the 10 parameters measured 6 parameters clearly stand out as the contributors to higher wqi in cluster 2 increments ranging from 245 to 743 those parameters are ec alkalinity hardness chloride sulphate and tds which indicate higher mineralization of groundwater in cluster 2 the spatial distributions of these two clusters were visually analyzed by marking the sampling points of the two clusters on the ratnapura district map as shown in fig 5 the constituents of groundwater are highly affected by the prevailing climate conditions and the underlying geology of the area dissanayake and weerasooriya 1985 therefore the soil map of ratnapura district and climate zone boundaries were also inserted in the map which would provide some valuable insight on the possible reasons for variations in clusters when considering the underlying soil conditions most of the district soil profile consists of red yellow podzolic soils and most of the cluster 1 sampling points are located in this soil type 30 out of 32 in contrast the majority of the cluster 2 sampling points are located on reddish brown earth type soils in the eastern and south eastern parts of the district the red yellow podzolic soils are the dominant soil group in the wet zone of the country leelamanie et al 2013 in this type of soil ph values are often less than 5 5 and the cation exchange capacity of this soil type tends to be relatively low moormann and panabokke 1961 in contrast reddish brown earth type soils are the most widespread soil group in the dry zone leelamanie et al 2013 and have ph values of between 6 0 and 7 0 usually together with higher cation exchange capacity moormann and panabokke 1961 it is obvious that the underlying soil features play a significant effect in influencing the chemical composition of groundwater because of the spatial distribution of the two clusters in these two different types of soils all the sampling points of cluster 1 are distributed in wet and intermediate zones only while cluster 2 mostly distributed in dry and intermediate zones fig 6 this indicates the influence of climate conditions for the variation of groundwater quality in the two clusters distribution of cluster 1 dominantly in the wet zone can also explain the possible reasons behind the higher mean value of color in cluster 1 table 4 color in natural water typically caused by the presence of organic substances mainly originated from decaying of surface vegetation higher percolation of surface water due to continual rainfall in the wet zone can carry relatively high loads of decaying organic matter to groundwater which causes the increment of color in groundwater ojo et al 2012 4 5 principal component analysis pca principal components pcs with eigenvalues greater than 1 0 were considered for further analysis since those are the pcs that best explain the variance of analyzed data machiwal and jha 2015 harman 1960 accordingly 3 pcs were extracted and table 6 shows the software generated component matrix which presents the influence of each parameter for the given pc the first second and third pcs represent the majority of the variance in the data set with 49 2 25 3 and 10 3 of the total variance respectively table a1 these three pcs collectively represent 84 8 of the total variance and the rest of the pcs account for small amounts of percentages and hence can be considered as negligible ganegoda et al 2018 figure a1 shows the resultant scree plot or the graph of pc numbers vs respective eigenvalues the first pc which explains the majority of the total variance has been mainly contributed by the following parameters ec 0 987 tds 0 977 total hardness 0 958 total alkalinity 0 890 sulphate 0 792 and chloride 0 747 these results of pc1 match with the hca results in table 6 both indicating a strong correlation between the mineralization process and the formation of two distinct water quality patterns natural chemical processes such as cation exchange dissolution of calcite dolomitization and sulphate reduction can lead to such a high concentration of minerals in groundwater celestino et al 2018 the second principal component pc2 is mostly dominated by turbidity 0 927 color 0 890 and total iron 0 806 turbidity and color in groundwater are mostly related to the leaching of surface water in particular in areas with high rainfall the continual process of dissolution and leaching of organic material and other particles on the surface due to frequent rain could lead to high turbidity and color in groundwater ojo et al 2012 further continual leaching of rainwater dilutes the ionic concentrations of groundwater and negates the effects of the mineralization process dissanayaka and weerasoorya 1985 which might have led to lowering the parameters such as ec tds sulphate chloride hardness and alkalinity in pc2 4 6 limitations this study was based on the data collected by the water supply and sanitation improvement project as a base line survey in the area though extreme weather conditions were avoided during sample collection seasonal variations were not covered by the sample collection process sample density was also restricted due to the limited resource availability furthermore anion and cation concentrations were not measured separately considering the availability of resources and the requirements of the project in particular major cations and anions concentration could have revealed intriguing aspects of the groundwater in the area such as groundwater types in the area and their origins therefore advanced experiments incorporating the measurement of ionic concentrations are recommended for better understanding of the groundwater constituents in this diverse area 5 conclusions this study is the first comprehensive investigation on overall groundwater quality in ratnapura district and for the first time the dramatic variances in groundwater quality across the area were highlighted in this study the resultant spatial distribution map of wqi revealed significant deterioration of groundwater quality in the eastern and south eastern parts of the district this area of concern includes weligepola embilipitiya and madampe ds divisions as well as eastern parts of the kolonna and balangoda ds divisions in particular the hardness alkalinity and turbidity levels of the groundwater in these regions are either over or very close to the recommended maximum limits for drinking water these parameter concentrations may not pose a direct threat to human health on their own however objectionable taste and other related issues of hardness scaling soap consumption etc can make the groundwater of the area unsuitable for direct human consumption therefore unless there is no other viable water source it is best to avoid using groundwater in the area or to apply substantial hardness removal technologies before consumption the results of two multivariate statistical analysis used hca and pca provided valuable insight on groundwater quality variation in the area hierarchical cluster analysis hca results indicated two major clusters cluster 01 dominating the wet zone and cluster 02 concentrated in the dry and intermediate zones of the district principal component analysis pca revealed ec tds hardness alkalinity and chloride as the parameters that contributed to the development of two clusters of sampling points with different characteristics overall results suggest that the climate conditions and underlying soil conditions play a major role in deciding the physical and chemical constituents of groundwater in ratnapura district mineralization of groundwater is high in dry zone areas compared to the wet zone natural chemical processes such as ion exchange reverse ion exchange dissolution of calcite dolomization sulphate reduction etc could have contributed to the higher ionic concentration in the dry zone groundwater this process of mineralization in the dry zone has also been facilitated by higher evaporation due to high ambient temperatures and the lack of rainfall for the dilution effect to take place further this study demonstrates the potential of the integration of statistical methods such as wqi hca pca etc with spatial analysis techniques for the investigation of groundwater quality over a large area as well as identifying the possible causes of groundwater deterioration the findings of this research can be successfully utilized by water supply engineers policymakers and other experts in the planning and design of drinking water supply schemes in the area further this study provides a basis for future hydrogeological studies in ratnapura district which in turn will be helpful for sustainable management of groundwater
