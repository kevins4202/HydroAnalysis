22235,vibration of a pipe conveying two phase flow is a major concern in ocean engineering and it is necessary to formulate a proper damping model to avoid excessive flow induced vibration in pipes while only a few studies have investigated the effects of damping model on dynamics of pipe conveying flow in this work we focus on the dynamic behavior of pipe induced by the gas liquid two phase flow using a combined damping model the generalized integral transform technique gitt is employed to model the dynamic behavior of the pipe conveying two phase flow and the governing equation of vibration is transformed into a coupled system of second order ordinary differential equations in the time domain by gitt method parametric studies are performed to investigate the effects of damping ratios on the dynamic behavior of the pipe and the results from this model have been verified against the existing experimental results besides the dimensionless critical frequency of the pipe at which instability sets in has been predicted both in the real and imaginary part finally a dimensionless structural parameter γ 0 that can govern the normalized stability envelope of the pipe is

cylinders exhibited fluidelastic instabilities in liquid flow when undergoing buckling or oscillations and several parameters such as flow velocity void fraction flexural rigidity and boundary conditions can affect the fluidelastic instabilities ortega et al 2013 investigated the dynamic behavior of a slender riser induced by the interaction between an internal slug flow and an external flow an and su 2015 employed the generalized integral transform technique gitt in the analysis of the dynamic behavior of a pipe conveying two phase flow thus obtaining a normalized stability envelope for the dynamic system chatjigeorgiou 2017 claimed that the effect of slug flow was important on the dynamics of risers by combining the dynamical model of the pipeline and the slug flow model and stated that the flow model amplified the dynamic components significantly wang and duan 2015 investigated a nonlinear model for a steel lazy wave riser slwr configuration with an ocean current and internal flow and simulated the effect of pipe soil interaction ocean current and internal flow on the nonlinear mechanical behavior however they did not address the dynamics of slwr and ignore the effects of damping for the mechanical behavior liang et al 2018b used semi analytical solution to study the dynamic behavior of a fluid conveying pipe with different pipe end boundary conditions and investigated the effect of the pipe end freedom degrees on vibration displacement although there are many studies that ignore the effects of damping on the vibration of a pipe conveying two phase flow the flow and structural damping cannot be neglected in actual industrial problems some experimental studies have investigated the vibration of pipes conveying two phase flow with the help of a suitable damping model the first experimental study on two phase flow damping was conducted by carlucci 1980 and carlucci and brown 1983 and many studies are oriented towards the influence of fluid parameters on the two phase flow damping ratio uchiyama 2003 pettigrew and taylor 2004 gravelle et al 2007 such as void fraction flow velocity and regime transition charreton et al 2015 provided experimental data on two phase flow damping confirming that the two phase damping can be defined as a velocity dependent viscous damping mechanism and investigated the relationship between the gas phase motion and structural vibration hara and kohgo 1977 first developed a two phase flow model for investigating the damping of a vibrating rod in a two phase bubble flow and found a good agreement between analytical and experimental results combining the vibration of the tube and the damping model monette and pettigrew 2004 investigated the fluidelastic instability of the flexible tubes conveying single phase and two phase flows and compared the results of the theoretical analysis with and without damping to the experimental results on critical frequency and velocity which showed that the theoretical results involving damping agree better with the results of the experiment based on existing research the surface tension and flow regime play an important role on the two phase flow damping the two phase damping is found to increase with surface tension at certain flows condition but the behavior is inconsistent for all the flow regimes charreton et al 2015 pettigrew et al 1998 weaver et al 2000 therefore the effects of damping on the vibration of pipes conveying two phase flow need to be investigated further for every specific flow regime for future researches miwa et al 2015 manabe et al 2001 classified the main flow patterns in vertical pipes used for transporting oil natural gas as bubbly flow dispersed bubbly flow churn flow annular flow stratified smooth flow and stratified wavy flow in our work we are mainly concerned with the two phase flow in an oil gas piping system and investigate the effects of the linear two phase flow damping model on the dynamic behavior of a pipe conveying gas liquid two phase flow at finely dispersed bubbles to churn flow regime firstly we obtain a linear two phase flow damping model according to the drift flux model subsequently we investigate the dynamic behavior of a pipe conveying two phase flow using this linear damping model the dynamic behavior of the damped vibration is investigated analytically and numerically using gitt gitt solution is a kind of semi analytical solutions which have been used for solving the problems of functionally graded material annular sector plate liang et al 2015 2014 dynamic behavior of a fluid conveying vertical or horizontal pipe liang et al 2018b a and it has been proved to be a very useful and effective solution to solve the dynamics problem gitt has been developed by cotta 1993 for investigating heat and fluid flow problems and further developed by an and su to analyze the dynamic behavior of euler bernoulli beams an and su 2011 timoshenko beams an and su 2016 axially moving orthotropic plates an and su 2014 vertical flow conveying pipes an and su 2015 and vibration of free spanning pipelines li et al 2018 based on the available experimental data a linear two phase damping ratio model is developed based on the drift flux model a relationship between the relative amplitude and the damping ratios is obtained the phase portraits of the vibration displacement velocity with damping are presented the critical two phase flow velocities and dimensionless frequencies in both real and imaginary parts are also provided in this work a relationship between the complex dimensionless critical frequency and the damping ratios of the pipe conveying the two phase flow is found for simplifying the complex numerical calculations from this the instability of a pipe conveying gas liquid two phase flow has been obtained the rest of the paper is organized as follows in section 2 the governing equation of the transverse vibration of a vertical pipe conveying gas liquid two phase flow with a linear damping model is presented and the drift flux liquid gas two phase flow model is also shown in this section in section 3 the solution is obtained by integral transformations for solving this damped vibration problem the results calculated by the gitt method are explained and discussed in section 4 and a flow parametric study is presented to investigate the effects of damping ratios on the dynamic behavior of a pipe conveying two phase flow in addition the critical flow rates and dimensionless critical frequency of the pipe are obtained furthermore a dimensionless structural parameter that can govern the normalized stability envelope for the pipe system is provided finally the conclusions of the paper are provided in section 5 2 mathematical formulation a vertical pipe with clamped clamped boundary conditions conveying gas liquid two phase flow is considered as shown in fig 1 under the assumptions of the euler bernoulli beam theory and assuming that the external imposed tension and pressurization effects are either absent or neglected the equation of transverse motion of the pipe can be derived according to the procedures used by païdoussis 1998 and monette and pettigrew 2004 1a e i 4 y x 4 k m k m g x l 2 y x 2 y x k m k u k 2 2 y x 2 2 k m k u k 2 y x t k m k m 2 y t 2 e i σ ω t 4 y x 4 c y t 0 with

structural damping coefficient fluid damping is induced by the fluid friction on the pipe wall and the drag forces dissipation on the bubbles according to the experimental results presented by gravelle et al 2007 and charreton et al 2015 the damping ratio of the two phase flow can be modeled as velocity dependent damping in eq 1a the fluid damping is represented by the linear viscous damping model charreton et al 2015 gravelle et al 2007 3 l 2 y c y t where l 2 is a fluid damping operator and c is the viscous damping coefficient 2 1 dimensionless mathematical formulation for

suitable two phase flow damping model we need to use a reliable model to describe the two phase internal flow the use of drift flux model is more appropriate when there is strong coupling and local relative motion between that two phases and theoretically the use of drift flux model is more appropriate for dispersed bubbly bubbly and slug flow patterns bhagwat and ghajar 2014 therefore we use a drift flux model to predict the void fraction of the gas liquid two phase flow zuber and findlay 1965 wallis 1969 hibiki and ishii 2003 guo et al 2018 the volumetric gas fraction ε g void fraction α and the slip factor k are defined as follows 7 ε g q g q g q l 8 α a g a g a l a g a 9 k u g u l where q g and q l are the volumetric flow rates of the gas and liquid phases and a g and a l are the areas occupied by the gas and liquid in the inner cross section of the pipe respectively the flow velocities of gas and liquid phases and two phase mixture velocity are defined as follows 10 u g q g a g and u l q l a l 11 v q g q l a u gs u ls where u gs and u ls are gas and liquid superficial velocities 12 α ε g c 0 u gm v the drift velocity u gm void fraction α with the volumetric gas fraction ε g and slip ratio k are defined in the drift flux model as follows 13 u gm u g v 14 k 1 α 1 c 0 u gm v α where c 0 is distribution parameter which is indicative of the distribution of the gas phase across the pipe cross section and let c 0 equal to 1 2 bhagwat and ghajar 2012 2014 in vertical pipe orientation in addition we use the drift velocity function provided by bhagwat and ghajar 2014 that represents a flow regime independent drift flux model based on the void fraction correlation 15 u gm 0 35 g d h ρ l ρ g ρ l 1 α 0 5 where d h is the hydraulic pipe diameter finally we obtain a void fraction that is independent of the flow regime which is divided into three ranges based on the void fraction values as follows 0 α 0 25 0 25 α 0 75 0 75 α 1 corresponding to bubbly slug or intermittent and annular flow regimes respectively as the combined damping model mentioned in eqs 2 and 3 the combined damping ratio including structural and two phase flow damping ratios can be expressed as 16 ζ c ζ s ζ 2 φ we use the experimental data of the two phase flow damping ratios charreton et al 2015 to build a new linear damping model in the experimental article charreton et al 2015 considered the internal flow as a homogeneous flow model assumes no local slip between the two phases and calculated the void fraction α equal to volumetric gas fraction ε g however the void fraction can be recalculated by eq 12 as the drift flux model with the local slip in consideration and the experimental damping ratios data can be modified as a new damping model with the more reasonable void fraction shown in fig 2 according to literatures the two phase damping ratios are largely governed by the flow regime with the highest damping values occurring in the bubble flow regime near the transition zone the influence of velocities on damping ratios for the same flow regime is neglected therefore we can simplify these modified damping data using the drift flux model to a linear two phase flow damping ratio model for finely dispersed bubble and churn flow conditions in eq 17 as shown in fig 2 17 ζ 2 φ κ 0 κ 1 α 0 α α α 0 κ 0 κ 2 α α 0 α α 0 where κ 0 3 5 κ 1 13 0 κ 2 4 3 and α 0 0 25 which are based on the recalculated experimental damping results available in gravelle et al 2007 using eqs 12 and 15 3 generalized integral transform solution the solution methodology involves proposing an integral transform pair for the potential the integral transform and the associated inversion formula are given below 18a y i τ 0 1 x i x y x τ d x transform 18b w y τ i 1 x i x y i τ inverse subsequently for eliminating the x coordinate we need to find the normalized eigenfunction x i x to transform the transverse displacement according to the principle of gitt the auxiliary eigenvalue problem needs to be chosen for the dimensionless governing equation eq 5a subject to the homogeneous boundary conditions represented by eqs 5b e the fourth order sturm liouville eigenvalue problem is thus chosen as follows 19a d 4 x i x d x 4 μ i 4 x i x 0 x 1 with the following boundary conditions 19b c x i 0 0 d x i 0 d x 0 19d e x i 1 0 d x i 1 d x 0 where x i x and μ i are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues respectively eqs 19 are solved analytically to yield 20a b x i x cos μ i x 1 2 cos μ i 2 cosh μ i x 1 2 cosh μ i 2 for i odd sin μ i x 1 2 sin μ i 2 sinh μ i x 1 2 sinh μ i 2 for i even where the eigenvalues are obtained from the transcendental equations 21 tanh μ i 2 tan μ i 2 for i odd tan μ i 2 for i even the eigenfunctions satisfy the following orthogonality relation 22 0 1 x i x x j x d x δ i j where δ i j is the kronecker delta 23 δ i j 1 i j 0 i j the integral transformation process is now employed through the operation of eq 5 with 0 1 x

transverse deflection is truncated to finite orders n w eqs 24 and eqs 26 in the truncated series is subsequently calculated using the ndsolve routine in mathematica with n w 16 this is based on the investigation by an and su 2015 about the influence of truncation orders n w on the vibration displacements and contribution to the calculation convergence of the pipe system for obtaining the frequency of vibration we employed the fluidelastic instability theory and the classical mode summation response formulation which can be expressed as 27 y i τ a i e i ω τ then the system of equations eq 24 is expressed as a summation of modes 28 j 1 μ j 4 ω 2 ζ ω i η μ j 4 ω i δ i j 2 k γ k β k 1 2 a i j ω i k γ k 2 b i j γ c i j γ a i j a j 0 when the damping is considered the imaginary part of the frequency term cannot be zero and so in this case ω is the complex natural frequency the solution of equations is obtained by setting the determinant of the coefficients a j equal to zero this means that both the real and imaginary parts of the determinant are equal to zero after solving the equations we can obtain the critical two phase flow velocities and critical dimensionless frequency of the pipe at instability according to the classical mode summation response formulation we use in eq 27 we can determine that the imaginary part of ω is the ratio which describe the dissipation of vibration energy and together with the model provided by lei et al 2013 we can develop a relationship between the dimensionless critical frequency and the damping ratio shown in eq 29 29 ω i ω i ω r e i ω i ω r e 0 2 ω i 2 i ς t 2 k m k m ω r e 0 2 ς t 2 k m k m 2 where ω i is the dimensionless critical frequency in imaginary part ω r e 0 and ω r e are the dimensionless critical frequencies in real part without damping and with damping respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 verification of the gitt results with damping ratio as shown in section 2 we use the kelvin voigt damping method to model structural damping before considering the flow induced damping the verification of gitt numerical results with the damping model should be investigated as shown by fig 3 besides the structural damping ratio needs to be confirmed by experiments considering the verification of gitt results in this paper the material of pipe is pvc and the experimental data by gravelle et al 2007 is taken as a reference for the properties of the pipe model as shown in table 1 the dimensionless variables can be obtained through eq 4 and v 0 0 3 is employed for the initial condition in addition the solution of this system is achieved with n w 20 an and su 2015 to ascertain the convergence in fig 3 it can be seen that the results calculated with the kelvin voigt damping model as σ 0 05 agree well with the available experimental results gravelle et al 2007 therefore we consider the gitt method to be a reliable way to solve the dynamic behavior of the pipe with damping 4 2 parametric study on dynamic behavior of pipe with two phase flow damping to investigate the influence of flow parameters on the dynamic behavior of a pipe the parameters that we considered are the two phase flow damping ratio ζ 2 φ two phase flow mixture velocity v and volumetric gas fraction ε g in this section we mainly discuss the transverse displacement of a pipe conveying a two phase flow subjected to a damping model fig 4 shows that the damping ratio has little influence on the natural frequency in the real part however the damping ratio does have a great influence on the transverse displacement of the pipe when the damping ratio becomes larger the decay rate of vibration increases furthermore it can be concluded from fig 4 that the amplitudes of vibration decrease when the damping ratio becomes larger therefore it is necessary to investigate the damped vibration with independent variables ζ 2 φ v ε g as mentioned by bhagwat and ghajar 2012 2014 the void fraction range of bubbly flow is approximately 0 α 0 25 and that of the slug and intermittent flow is approximately 0 25 α 0 75 the void fraction calculated by the drift flux model agrees well with the modified experimental results and the flow regime range as shown in fig 2 therefore we draw a flow map to present the two phase flow conditions for our calculation as shown in fig 5 and find a series of flow velocities for calculation in the finely dispersed bubble and churn flow regimes as mentioned in eq 17 the curves in fig 6 are calculated using the linear two phase flow damping model and under different flow mixture velocities v 4 0 m s 5 0 m s 6 0 m s 8 0 m s 10 0 m s and 12 0 m s respectively the results of gitt are represented by a relative amplitude a r which is the peak vibration amplitude at the central point of the pipe in the first damping circle divided by the peak amplitude at the center of the pipe without damping a r also indicates the energy dissipation of the damped vibration of the pipe conveying two phase flow as shown in fig 5 transition zone of the bubble and churn is around the volumetric fraction ε g 0 5 and the differences of curves are also shown in fig 6 when ε g 0 5 the two phase flow in pipe is finely dispersed bubble flow and we can infer from the plots that the two phase flow mixing velocities have little influence on the relative amplitude a r of vibration however when the two phase flow turns to churn flow ε g 0 5 the relative amplitudes a r increase with the increase in the mixing velocity in addition according to figs 2 and 6 the ratio a r is found to be largely governed by the damping ratio of the two phase flow when the two phase flow damping ratios reach the highest values near the transition zone the a r reach the lowest values which means the damping effect on the dynamic behavior becomes much larger in the finely dispersed bubble flow regime near the flow transition zone we can obtain that the area of the greatest energy dissipation is near the two phase flow transition zone and the two phase flow mixture velocity has a greater effect on the damped vibration in churn flow regime than that in finely dispersed bubbles flow for further analysis we employ the time history plots ftts and phase plane portraits of dimensionless displacement and velocity to describe the damped vibration of a pipe conveying two phase flow as we can see in figs 7 and 8 the observation point is located in the middle of pipe the points on trajectories are dimensionless time τ 0 0 01 0 02 2 0 and the green arrow indicates the direction in which time proceeds in fig 7 a and c the damped vibration displacement exhibits an obverse decrease when volumetric fraction ε g equals to 0 5 near the transition zone in fig 8 a and c the varying flow mixture velocities make little effects on the damped vibration motion these figures show that the dimensionless vibration velocity shows the same decreasing law as concluded for displacements in fig 6 however the frequencies of damped vibration vary slightly with different flow mixture velocities and volumetric fractions shown in fig 7 b and 8 b therefore the flow transition contributes much to the vibration displacements and velocities when the pipe conveys gas liquid two phase flow 4 3 critical velocity and frequency of the pipe conveying two phase flow at instability the critical two phase flow velocity of the pipe are shown in fig 9 by solving eq 28 we can find that the critical mixture velocity increases with the increasing volumetric fraction in other words if the pipe conveys more gas phase flow the larger mixture velocity is needed to make the pipe become unstable besides fig 9 shows the critical superficial velocity of gas phase flow gives more contribution to the critical mixture velocity of two phase flow than that of liquid phase then the real and imaginary parts of dimensionless critical frequency are shown in fig 10 in fig 10 a we compare the real dimensionless critical frequency results in both damped and undamped vibration and besides we verify the damping results by gitt with the results calculated by eq 29 through fig 10 a it shows that the gitt damping results agree well with the model we provide in eq 29 and the real dimensionless critical frequency may not be sensitive to damping as indicated when the volumetric gas fraction becomes larger the real dimensionless critical frequency becomes smaller both in damped and undamped vibration the imaginary dimensionless critical frequencies calculated by gitt and eq 29 are showing in fig 10 b and they agree well with each other as the mode response formulation we employ in this work shown in eq 27 we can obtain that the imaginary part of dimensionless critical frequency is the decaying function of response formulation only damping can cause the imaginary frequency and cause the vibration decaying 4 4 structural parameter of normalized two phase flow rate stability envelopes the stability envelope is defined as a relation between normalized gas and liquid superficial velocities u g s u g s m a x and u l s u l s m a x where u g s m a x is the critical velocity of the single phase gas flow ε g 1 and u l s m a x is the critical velocity of single phase liquid flow ε g 0 as shown in fig 11 the points on the curves are the pipe critical stability point u l s c r i t i c a l u l s m a x u g s c r i t i c a l u g s m a x with varying volumetric fractions and structural parameters and the curves are the stable boundaries for pipes conveying two phase flow for predicting the instability of pipes the area below the stable boundary is called stability envelope for each structural parameter pipe and the instability envelope is beyond the boundary as an and su 2015 proposed a volumetric flow rate stability envelope and verified it with the results obtained by monette and pettigrew 2004 the stability envelope has been validated in this study we investigate the stability envelopes with different structural parameters which can predict the instability of different vertical pipes here we provide a dimensionless variable γ 0 which comes from the dimensionless variable γ the dimensionless variable γ comprised of γ 0 and γ k γ 0 refers to the structural properties and γ k relates to the fluid part as shown in eq 30 the structural parameter γ 0 is a dimensionless variable with all the structural properties including to describe different pipes 30 γ g l 3 k m k m e i g l 3 m e i g l 3 k m k e i γ 0 γ k in fig 11 there is a limiting stability envelope where γ 0 tends to be a small value and the area below the limiting stable boundary is called a limiting stability envelope for γ 0 1 the stability envelope is roughly identical to the limiting one when increasing γ 0 the stable region below the stability envelope becomes smaller in addition fig 11 shows that the stability envelope calculated by an and su 2015 also follows this tendency therefore we can conclude that if the gas and liquid superficial velocities are located beyond the certain limiting stability envelope the pipe will experience fluidelastic instability an instability prediction of a pipe conveying gas liquid two phase flow is obtained by providing this normalized two phase flow rate stability envelope 5 conclusions in this paper the dynamic behavior of a pipe conveying two phase flow with a damping model is calculated using the generalized integral transform technique gitt the following conclusions can be brought out i the pipe conveying two phase flow can be assumed as a viscous damped beam system the kelvin voigt damping model and viscous damping model can be used as the structural damping and two phase flow damping models respectively ii when considering the damping in the pipe system the vibration amplitude and oscillation time have a definite relation with the damping ratio when the damping ratio becomes larger the vibration amplitude and oscillation time decrease using this proposed two phase flow damping ratio the differences between the two flow regimes can be found in the bubbly flow regime the two phase flow mixture velocity does not significantly influence the damped relative amplitude a r but in the churn flow regime the relative amplitude increases when the mixture velocity becomes larger besides it is found that the damped vibration energy dissipation reaches the peak value near the two phase flow transition zone iii it is found that the normalized stability envelope of the pipe conveying the two phase flow is governed by a dimensionless structural parameter γ 0 g l 3 m e i and there exists a limiting stability envelope with increasing γ 0 the stable region below the stability envelope becomes smaller the stability envelopes obtained in this study can be a useful and effective way to predict the instability of a pipe conveying gas liquid two phase flow in petroleum engineering acknowledgments the work was

conveying single phase and two phase flows and compared the results of the theoretical analysis with and without damping to the experimental results on critical frequency and velocity which showed that the theoretical results involving damping agree better with the results of the experiment based on existing research the surface tension and flow regime play an important role on the two phase flow damping the two phase damping is found to increase with surface tension at certain flows condition but the behavior is inconsistent for all the flow regimes charreton et al 2015 pettigrew et al 1998 weaver et al 2000 therefore the effects of damping on the vibration of pipes conveying two phase flow need to be investigated further for every specific flow regime for future researches miwa et al 2015 manabe et al 2001 classified the main flow patterns in vertical pipes used for transporting oil natural gas as bubbly flow dispersed bubbly flow churn flow annular flow stratified smooth flow and stratified wavy flow in our work we are mainly concerned with the two phase flow in an oil gas piping system and investigate the effects of the linear two phase flow damping model on the dynamic behavior of a pipe conveying gas liquid two phase flow at finely dispersed bubbles to churn flow regime firstly we obtain a linear two phase flow damping model according to the drift flux model subsequently we investigate the dynamic behavior of a pipe conveying two phase flow using this linear damping model the dynamic behavior of the damped vibration is investigated analytically and numerically using gitt gitt solution is a kind of semi analytical solutions which have been used for solving the problems of functionally graded material annular sector plate liang et al 2015 2014

section 5 2 mathematical formulation a vertical pipe with clamped clamped boundary conditions conveying gas liquid two phase flow is considered as shown in fig 1 under the assumptions of the euler bernoulli beam theory and assuming that the external imposed tension and pressurization effects are either absent or neglected the equation of transverse motion of the pipe can be derived according to

suitable two phase flow damping model we need to use a reliable model to describe the two phase internal flow the use of drift flux model is more appropriate when there is strong coupling and local relative motion between that two phases and theoretically the use of drift flux model is more appropriate for dispersed bubbly bubbly and slug flow patterns bhagwat and ghajar 2014 therefore we use a drift flux model to predict the void fraction of the gas liquid two phase flow zuber and findlay 1965 wallis 1969 hibiki and ishii 2003 guo et al 2018 the volumetric gas fraction ε g void fraction α and the slip factor k are defined as follows 7 ε g q g q g q l 8 α a g a g a l a g a 9 k u g u l where q g and q l are the volumetric flow rates of the gas and liquid phases and a g and a l are the areas occupied by the gas and liquid in the inner cross section of the pipe respectively the flow velocities of gas and liquid phases and two phase mixture velocity are defined as follows 10 u g q g a g and u l q l a l 11 v q g q l a u gs u ls where u gs and u ls are gas and liquid superficial velocities 12 α ε g c 0 u gm v the drift velocity u gm void fraction α with the volumetric gas fraction ε g and slip ratio k are defined in the drift flux model as follows 13 u gm u g v 14 k 1 α 1 c 0 u gm v α where c 0 is distribution parameter which is indicative of the distribution of the gas phase across the pipe cross section and let c 0 equal to 1 2 bhagwat and ghajar 2012 2014 in vertical pipe orientation in addition we use the drift velocity function provided by bhagwat and ghajar 2014 that represents a flow regime independent drift flux model based on the void fraction correlation 15 u gm 0 35 g d h ρ l ρ g ρ l 1 α 0 5 where d h is the hydraulic pipe diameter finally we obtain a void fraction that is independent of the flow regime which is divided into three ranges based on the void fraction values as follows 0 α 0 25 0 25 α 0 75 0 75 α 1 corresponding to bubbly slug or intermittent and annular flow regimes respectively as the combined damping model mentioned in eqs 2 and 3 the combined damping ratio including structural and two phase flow damping ratios can be expressed as 16 ζ c ζ s ζ 2 φ we use the experimental data of the two phase flow damping ratios charreton et al 2015 to build a new linear damping model in the experimental article charreton et al 2015 considered the internal flow as a homogeneous flow model assumes no local slip between the two phases and calculated the void fraction α equal to volumetric gas fraction ε g however the void fraction can be recalculated by eq 12 as the drift flux model with the local slip in consideration and the experimental damping ratios data can be modified as a new damping model with the more reasonable void fraction shown in fig 2 according to literatures the two phase damping ratios are largely governed by the flow regime with the highest damping values occurring in the bubble flow regime near the transition zone the influence of velocities on damping ratios for the same flow regime is neglected therefore we can simplify these modified damping data using the drift flux model to a linear two phase flow damping ratio model for finely dispersed bubble and churn flow conditions in eq 17 as shown in fig 2 17 ζ 2 φ κ 0 κ 1 α 0 α α α 0 κ 0 κ 2 α α 0 α α 0 where κ 0 3 5 κ 1 13 0 κ 2 4 3 and α 0 0 25 which are based on the recalculated experimental damping results available in gravelle et al 2007 using eqs 12 and 15 3 generalized integral transform solution the solution methodology involves proposing an integral transform pair for the potential the integral transform and the associated inversion formula are given below 18a y i τ 0 1 x i x y x τ d x transform 18b w y τ i 1 x i x y i τ inverse subsequently for eliminating the x coordinate we need to find the normalized eigenfunction x i x to transform the transverse displacement according to the principle of gitt the auxiliary eigenvalue problem needs to be chosen for the dimensionless governing equation eq 5a subject to the homogeneous boundary conditions represented by eqs 5b e the fourth order sturm liouville eigenvalue problem is thus chosen as follows 19a d 4 x i x d x 4 μ i 4 x i x 0 x 1 with the following boundary conditions 19b c x i 0 0 d x i 0 d x 0 19d e x i 1 0 d x i 1 d x 0 where x i x and μ i are the eigenfunctions and eigenvalues respectively eqs 19 are solved analytically to yield 20a b x i x cos μ i x 1 2 cos μ i 2 cosh μ i x 1 2 cosh μ i 2 for i odd sin μ i x 1 2 sin μ i 2 sinh

orthogonality relation 22 0 1 x i x x j x d x δ i j where δ i j is the kronecker delta 23 δ i j 1 i j 0 i j the integral transformation process is now employed through the operation of eq 5 with 0 1 x

transverse deflection is truncated to finite orders n w eqs 24 and eqs 26 in the truncated series is subsequently calculated using the ndsolve routine in mathematica with n w 16 this is based on the investigation by an and su 2015 about the influence of truncation orders n w on the vibration displacements and contribution to the calculation convergence of the pipe system for obtaining the frequency of vibration we employed the fluidelastic instability theory and the classical mode summation response formulation which can be expressed as 27 y i τ a i e i ω τ then the system of equations eq 24 is expressed as a summation of modes 28 j 1 μ j 4 ω 2 ζ ω i η μ j 4 ω i δ i j 2 k γ k β k 1 2 a i j ω i k γ k 2 b i j γ c i j γ a i j a j 0 when the damping is considered the imaginary part of the frequency term cannot be zero and so in this case ω is the complex natural frequency the solution of equations is obtained by setting the determinant of the coefficients a j equal to zero this means that both the real and imaginary parts of the determinant are equal to zero after solving the equations we can obtain the critical two phase flow velocities and critical dimensionless frequency of the pipe at instability according to the classical mode summation response formulation we use in eq 27 we can determine that the imaginary part of ω is the ratio which describe the dissipation of vibration energy and together with the model provided by lei et al 2013 we can develop a relationship between the dimensionless critical frequency and the damping ratio shown in eq 29 29 ω i ω i ω r e i ω i ω r e 0 2 ω i 2 i ς t 2 k m k m ω r e 0 2 ς t 2 k m k m 2 where ω i is the dimensionless critical frequency in imaginary part ω r e 0 and ω r e are the dimensionless critical frequencies in real part without damping and with damping respectively 4 results and discussions 4 1 verification of the gitt results with damping ratio as shown in section 2 we use the kelvin voigt damping method to model structural damping before considering the flow induced damping the verification of gitt numerical results with the damping model should be investigated as shown by fig 3 besides the structural damping ratio needs to be confirmed by experiments considering the verification of gitt results in this paper the material of pipe is pvc and the experimental data by gravelle et al 2007 is taken as a reference for the properties of the pipe model as shown in table 1 the dimensionless variables can be obtained through eq 4 and v 0 0 3 is employed for the initial condition in addition the solution of this system is achieved with n w 20 an and su 2015 to ascertain the convergence in fig 3 it can be seen that the results calculated with the kelvin voigt damping model as σ 0 05 agree well with the available experimental results gravelle et al 2007 therefore we consider the gitt method to be a reliable way to solve the dynamic behavior of the pipe with damping 4 2 parametric study on dynamic behavior of pipe with two phase flow damping to investigate the influence of flow parameters on the dynamic behavior of a pipe the parameters that we considered are the two phase flow damping ratio ζ 2 φ two phase flow mixture velocity v and volumetric gas fraction ε g in this section we mainly discuss the transverse displacement of a pipe conveying a two phase flow subjected to a damping model fig 4 shows that the damping ratio has little influence on the natural frequency in the real part however the damping ratio does have a great influence on the transverse displacement of the pipe when the damping ratio becomes larger the decay rate of vibration increases furthermore it can be concluded from fig 4 that the amplitudes of vibration decrease when the damping ratio becomes larger therefore it is necessary to investigate the damped vibration with independent variables ζ 2 φ v ε g as mentioned by bhagwat and ghajar 2012 2014 the void fraction range of bubbly flow is approximately 0 α 0 25 and that of the slug and intermittent flow is approximately 0 25 α 0 75 the void fraction calculated by the drift flux model agrees well with the modified experimental results and the flow regime range as shown in fig 2 therefore we draw a flow map to present the two phase flow conditions for our calculation as shown in fig 5 and find a series of flow velocities for calculation in the finely dispersed bubble and churn flow regimes as mentioned in eq 17 the curves in fig 6 are calculated using the linear two phase flow damping model and under different flow mixture velocities v 4 0 m s 5 0 m s 6 0 m s 8 0 m s 10 0 m s and 12 0 m s respectively the results of gitt are represented by a relative amplitude a r which is the peak vibration amplitude at the central point of the pipe in the first damping circle divided by the peak amplitude at the center of the pipe without damping a r also indicates the energy dissipation of the damped vibration of the pipe conveying two phase flow as shown in fig 5 transition zone of the bubble and churn is around the volumetric fraction ε g 0 5 and the differences of curves are also shown in fig 6 when ε g 0 5 the two phase flow in pipe is finely dispersed bubble flow and we can infer from the plots that the two phase flow mixing velocities have little influence on the relative amplitude a r of vibration however when the two phase flow turns to churn flow ε g 0 5 the relative amplitudes a r increase with the increase in the mixing velocity in addition according to figs 2 and 6 the ratio a r is found to be largely governed by the damping ratio of the two phase flow when the two phase flow damping ratios reach the highest values near the transition zone the a r reach the lowest values which means the damping effect on the dynamic behavior becomes much larger in the finely dispersed bubble flow regime near the flow transition zone we can obtain that the area of the greatest energy dissipation is near the two phase flow transition zone and the two phase flow mixture velocity has a greater effect on the damped vibration in churn flow regime than that in finely dispersed bubbles flow for further analysis we employ the time history plots ftts and phase plane portraits of dimensionless displacement and velocity to describe the damped vibration of a pipe conveying two phase flow as we can see in figs 7 and 8 the observation point is located in the middle of pipe the points on trajectories are dimensionless time τ 0 0 01 0 02 2 0 and the green arrow indicates the direction in which time proceeds in fig 7 a and c the damped vibration displacement exhibits an obverse decrease when volumetric fraction ε g equals to 0 5 near the transition zone in fig 8 a and c the varying flow mixture velocities make little effects on the damped vibration motion these figures show that the dimensionless vibration velocity shows the same decreasing law as concluded for displacements in fig 6 however the frequencies of damped vibration vary slightly with different flow mixture velocities and volumetric fractions shown in fig 7 b and 8 b therefore the flow transition contributes much to the vibration displacements and velocities when the pipe conveys gas liquid two phase flow 4 3 critical velocity and frequency of the pipe conveying two phase flow at instability the critical two phase flow velocity of the pipe are shown in fig 9 by solving eq 28 we can find that the critical mixture velocity increases with the increasing volumetric fraction in other words if the pipe conveys more gas phase flow the larger mixture velocity is needed to make the pipe become unstable besides fig 9 shows the critical superficial velocity of gas phase flow gives more contribution to the critical mixture velocity of two phase flow than that of liquid phase then the real and imaginary parts of dimensionless critical frequency are shown in fig 10 in fig 10 a we compare the real dimensionless critical frequency results in both damped and undamped vibration and besides we verify the damping results by gitt with the results calculated by eq 29 through fig 10 a it shows that the gitt damping results agree well with the model we provide in eq 29 and the real dimensionless critical frequency may not be sensitive to damping as indicated when the volumetric gas fraction becomes larger the real dimensionless critical frequency becomes smaller both in damped and undamped vibration the imaginary dimensionless critical frequencies calculated by gitt and eq 29 are showing in fig 10 b and they agree well with each other as the mode response formulation we employ in this work shown in eq 27 we can obtain that the imaginary part of dimensionless critical frequency is the decaying function of response formulation only damping can cause the imaginary frequency and cause the vibration decaying 4 4 structural parameter of normalized two phase flow rate stability envelopes the stability envelope is defined as a relation between normalized gas and liquid superficial velocities u g s u g s m a x and u l s u l s m a x where u g s m a x is the critical velocity of the single phase gas flow ε g 1 and u l s m a x is the critical velocity of single phase liquid flow ε g 0 as shown in fig 11 the points on the curves are the pipe critical stability point u l s c r i t i c a l u l s m a x u g s c r i t i c a l u g s m a x with varying volumetric fractions and structural parameters and the curves are the stable boundaries for pipes conveying two phase flow for predicting the instability of pipes the area below the stable boundary is called stability envelope for each structural parameter pipe and the instability envelope is beyond the boundary as an and su 2015 proposed a volumetric flow rate stability envelope and verified it with the results obtained by monette and pettigrew 2004 the stability envelope has been validated in this study we investigate the stability envelopes with different structural parameters which can predict the instability of different vertical pipes here we provide a dimensionless variable γ 0 which comes from the dimensionless variable γ the dimensionless variable γ comprised of γ 0 and γ k γ 0 refers to the structural properties and γ k relates to the fluid part as shown in eq 30 the structural parameter γ 0 is a dimensionless variable with all the structural properties including to describe different pipes 30 γ g l 3 k m k m e i g l 3 m e i g l 3 k m k e i γ 0 γ k in fig 11 there is a limiting stability envelope where γ 0 tends to be a small value and the area below the limiting stable boundary is called a limiting stability envelope for γ 0 1 the stability envelope is roughly identical to the limiting one when increasing γ 0 the stable region below the stability envelope becomes smaller in addition fig 11 shows that the stability envelope calculated by an and su 2015 also follows this tendency therefore we can conclude that if the gas and liquid superficial velocities are located beyond the certain limiting stability envelope the pipe will experience fluidelastic instability an instability prediction of a pipe conveying gas liquid two phase flow is obtained by providing this normalized two phase flow rate stability envelope 5 conclusions in this paper the dynamic behavior of a pipe conveying two phase flow with a damping model is calculated using the generalized integral transform technique gitt the following conclusions can be brought out i the pipe conveying two phase flow can be assumed as a viscous damped beam system the kelvin voigt damping model and viscous damping model can be used as the structural damping and two phase flow damping models respectively ii when considering the damping in the pipe system the vibration amplitude and oscillation time have a definite relation with the damping ratio when the damping ratio becomes larger the vibration amplitude and oscillation time decrease using this proposed two phase flow damping ratio the differences between the two flow regimes can be found in the bubbly flow regime the two phase flow mixture velocity does not significantly influence the damped relative amplitude a r but in the churn flow regime the relative amplitude increases when the mixture velocity becomes larger besides it is found that the damped vibration energy dissipation reaches the peak value near the two phase flow transition zone iii it is found that the normalized stability envelope of the pipe conveying the two phase flow is governed by a dimensionless structural parameter γ 0 g l 3 m e i and there exists a limiting stability envelope with increasing γ 0 the stable region below the stability envelope becomes smaller the stability envelopes obtained in this study can be a useful and effective way to predict the instability of a pipe conveying gas liquid two phase flow in petroleum engineering acknowledgments the work was

22236,in recent years submarine debris flow impact on suspended pipeline has been extensively investigated typical modes of impact force are identified at low reynolds number it increases till reaches a stable plateau otherwise it sharply rises to a peak before decreasing to a stable value however the formation mechanism of peak impact force remains an open question to address this issue a two dimensional 2d biphasic slurry and water numerical model is developed using ansys fluent 18 0 this model is used to simulate the constant speed submarine debris flow impact on a suspended pipeline herein similar modes of peak and stable impact coefficients which are nondimensionalized impact forces on a suspended pipeline are observed the formation mechanism of peak impact force is revealed it is found that the stable impact force relies on the constant speed of a submarine debris flow while peak impact force depends on its velocity and local acceleration at initial impact moreover the relationships between reynolds number and coefficients of inertia and drag are proposed to estimate the peak and stable impact forces the relations are compared to experimental and numerical datasets available in literatures and laboratory experiments are recommended in future to obtain more measured datasets for further verification keywords suspended pipeline submarine debris flow constant impact velocity peak impact force inertia coefficient local acceleration 1 introduction submarine pipelines are critical seafloor installations often deployed for efficient transportation of strategic energy and mineral resources from the offshore production fields to onshore processing and ancillary storage facilities kaiser 2017 the corridors for pipeline routes are extensively surveyed and prudently selected before carrying out on site constructions to circumvent hazardous areas with potential seafloor instabilities even so they are still inevitably exposed to the devastating threats of failed soil masses due to long runout distances white et al 2016 the soil masses emitted from the underwater slope failures are transported typically in the form of gravity driven sediment flows such as debris flows and turbidity currents submarine debris flows are very dense non newtonian fluids in laminar regime with density up to 1800 kg m3 and velocity up to 30 m s drago 2002 on the other hand turbidity currents are dilute turbulent newtonian flows with density higher than ambient water and up to 1200 kg m3 maximum velocity reached by turbidity currents is on the order of 10 15 m s drago 2002 as such submarine debris flows contain much larger momentum with the potential for catastrophic disasters to seafloor structures which is a major concern for engineering design of offshore structures such as submarine pipelines malgesini et al 2018 submarine debris flow impact forces on pipelines are rudimentary yet critical information for optimization of structural design and mitigation of hazardous effects evaluation methods of submarine debris flow impact force on a pipeline are divided by two distinct approaches soil and fluid mechanics the soil mechanics approach was developed after failure of three platforms and associated pipelines in the northern gulf of mexico during the hurricane camille in 1969 zakeri 2009a with an empirical parameter the impact force is assumed to be proportional to undrained shear strength of sliding mass the empirical parameter was initially set to constant values e g demars 1978 bea and aurora 1982 and later improved with consideration of soil strain rate effects e g shcapery and dunlap 1978 zakeri et al 2012 the soil mechanics approach is more applicable to early stage of failed mass when undrained shear strength of soil is close to the intact in situ state however submarine debris flows have very high fluidity and thus the fluid mechanics approach seems to be more appropriate zakeri et al 2008 randolph et al 2011 in fluid mechanics approach drag equation is widely used to estimate submarine debris flow impact force on pipelines in the drag equation the impact force is proportional to the square of velocity though researchers e g pazwash and robertson 1975 began early to investigate the impact forces exerted by non newtonian fluid flowing around objects evaluation of impact force on a pipeline due to submarine debris flow impact started to be performed merely a decade ago zakeri et al 2008 zakeri et al 2008 launched a series of flume tests to investigate submarine debris flow impact force normally acting on a pipeline through lab experiments and supplemental computational fluid dynamics cfd analyses zakeri et al 2009b they proposed empirical relations between drag coefficient and reynolds number for suspended and as laid pipelines afterwards several researchers followed up their pioneering work to study the normal and longitudinal impact forces on suspended zakeri 2009c liu et al 2015 and as laid wang et al 2016 pipelines at various angles of debris flow attack they extended the drag coefficient as a function of reynolds number and angle of attack besides some researchers studied normal impact force on a pipeline under different suspension height li et al 2015 guo et al 2019 and correlated drag coefficient with reynolds number and suspension height other researchers studied the effects of various factors such as the streamlined cross section of a pipeline perez gruszkiewicz 2012 fan et al 2018 low temperature environment near seabed nian et al 2018 and cavity of negative pressure formed behind a pipeline dutta and hawlader 2019 on the impact force acting on a suspended pipeline it should be noted that all previous efforts are made to estimate the impact force on a pipeline imposed by a constant speed submarine debris flow also since suspended pipelines are more vulnerable to debris flow impact than the laid on seafloor scenarios they are of major focus in the previous and present studies in previous research typical modes of stable and peak impact forces on a suspended pipeline are identified however the understanding of their formation mechanism is still far from adequate as such the peak impact force is used in previous work to calculate drag coefficient as it is on a more hazardous level than the stable one the aim of this paper is to understand the formation mechanism of typical modes of impact forces and establish a more reliable methodology to estimate the peak impact force as such a two dimensional 2d biphasic slurry and water numerical model is developed using ansys fluent 18 0 the 2d model is then used to simulate the constant speed submarine debris flow impact on suspended pipelines based on the numerical experiments efforts are made to provide an explanation for the underlying formation mechanism of peak impact force on a suspended pipeline due to the constant speed submarine debris flow efforts are also made to set up a methodology to estimate the peak impact force on a suspended pipeline 2 model descriptions 2 1 general ansys fluent 18 0 is a general purpose cfd software that includes three different euler

diameter 0 01 m is placed at the centerline of domain the centroid of pipe has a distance 0 05 m away from left boundary as such the pipe is located more than four times the pipe diameter away from all the boundaries and the confining effects of computational domain on velocity fields and associated impact forces on the pipe are negligible zakeri et al 2009c the domain is discretized into unstructured meshes using fluent meshing module the minimum mesh size is 4e 5 m and the maximum is 4e 3 m since slurry pipe interaction is of main interest in the study meshes around pipe are further

analyses 3 1 interactions between submarine debris flow and suspended pipeline a total of 48 runs are performed to simulate the submarine debris flow impact on a suspended pipeline the maximum shear rate is 400 s 1 and reynolds number is up to 847 8 for a real submarine debris flow its density could be up to 1800 kg m3 and velocity is estimated to reach 30 m s drago 2002 the diameter of a pipe typically ranges from 0 1 to 1 0 m zakeri et al 2008 thus the maximum shear rate could be 300 s 1 assuming a debris flow possesses the shear stress of 2 0 kpa zakeri et al 2008 the maximum reynolds number is calculated to be 810 both the maximum shear rate and reynolds number of a real submarine debris flow impact on a suspended pipeline are covered by the 48 numerical runs thus are considered suitable for application to field scenarios mesh sensitivity analysis is carried out to evaluate the influence of mesh size on numerical results the mesh size is reduced to a minimum of 3e 5 m and maximum of 3e 3 m the refined domain has a total of 5986 nodes and 11104 triangular elements a trial simulation with 15 clay content and 4 0 m s inlet velocity is carried out the calculated impact coefficient on the suspended pipeline is very close to that before mesh refinement fig 2 as such the numerical results are insensitive to mesh systems generated in this work and the coarser mesh is used for the simulations to demonstrate the interactions between submarine debris flow and suspended pipeline modeling results of volume fractions and velocity fields from two representative runs are shown fig 3 these two runs have the same clay content of 15 and inlet velocities of 0 2 and 1 0 m s it is shown that a channel filling with water is formed behind suspended pipe however the entrapped water fades away as the channel becomes narrow at inlet velocity of 0 2 m s the reynolds number of flow field is calculated to be 1 9 the velocity field is symmetrical however when it is set at 1 0 m s the reynolds number increases to be 35 1 the flow field is still symmetrical but with eddies recirculating at the rear of the pipe these phenomena are consistent with previous laboratory zakeri et al 2008 and numerical e g fan et al 2018 nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 observations in addition the fully developed velocity fields also demonstrate that the confining effects of selected computational domain on impact forces exerted on the pipe are negligible 3 2 modes of impact coefficients and underlying mechanism the time series impact coefficients imposed by slurries of different clay concentrations are shown fig 4 the impact coefficients are non dimensional impact forces the corresponding reynolds number is also calculated for each case two typical modes of impact coefficients i e peak and stable acting on a suspended pipeline are observed when the reynolds number is high the impact coefficient sharply rises to a peak upon initial impact and afterwards gradually declines until it reaches a stable value the peak impact coefficient is larger than the stable one for the low reynolds number the impact coefficient gradually increases to a stable value which means that the peak and stable impact coefficients equal each other a critical reynolds number is observed distinguishing the modes of impact coefficient in present work this critical reynolds number seems to settle around 50 the formation mechanism of such modes of impact force is explained as follows according to morison equation morison et al 1950 the total impact force applied on a suspended pipeline consists of two components i e velocity related drag force and acceleration induced inertia force 4 f 1 2 c d ρ d u 2 π 4 c m ρ d 2 a where f is the total impact force c d is the drag coefficient c m is the inertia coefficient and a is the acceleration the material acceleration of slurry is decomposed into two parts i e the convective and local accelerations the convective acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity due to change of position while the local acceleration is the rate of change of velocity with respect to time at a given point which can be seen in the following equation 5 d u d t u t u u where u is the vectorized velocity of slurry and t is the time the interaction processes between slurry and pipeline can be divided into two stages i e the initial and embedded impacts the criteria used to distinguish these two stages is that whether the pipeline is fully engulfed by slurry since slurry is set at constant speed the convective acceleration is always nil then at embedded impact the acceleration induced inertia force is zero the total impact force merely depends on velocity induced drag force which sets to a stable value when imposed by a constant speed slurry however at initial impact the magnitude of slurry velocity at the position of pipeline increases from zero to constant speed within a short duration this leads to a transient local acceleration accompanying by an immediate inertia force acting on the pipe superposed by velocity induced drag force and local acceleration induced inertia force the total impact force presents a sharp and temporary peak at initial impact note that the inertia force will be prominent only when the reynolds number is high enough this is because when it is small the duration of initial impact will be significantly increased thus the local acceleration will be greatly reduced which inhibits the development of inertia force applied on the pipeline when the reynolds number is small enough the contribution of inertia force to total impact force is negligible and it will only be controlled by constant speed of slurry 3 3 comparison with laboratory experiment from zakeri et al 2008 the peak and stable impact coefficients associated with reynolds number for each run are listed table 2 as shown in fig 5 comparisons of impact coefficients are made between the present numerical datasets and flume experimental data collected by zakeri et al 2008 it is shown that the numerical datasets generally fit the experiment results however when zoomed in some differences are observed when reynolds number is low the inertia forces are negligible thus the peak and stable impact coefficients nearly overlap with each other the peak and stable impact coefficients are slightly larger than those from zakeri et al 2008 this may be possible occurrence of partial slippage on the pipe surface in the laboratory experiments whereas in the numerical model the boundary condition of no slip wall is set with the increase of reynolds number the peak impact coefficients gradually overpass the stable values this is due to the inertia forces on the pipeline induced by local accelerations in addition it is observed that the laboratory measured impact coefficients are larger than the peak impact coefficients output from the numerical model this is possibly due to that the downslope propagating slurries in zakeri et al 2008 flume experiments may possess some nonnegligible convective acceleration when impacting on a pipeline as such the local acceleration at initial impact on a pipeline combined with the convective acceleration of slurry contributes to enlarged magnitudes of inertia force 3 4 estimation of peak impact force due to inadequate understanding of formation mechanism of peak impact force previous researchers fan et al 2018 nian et al 2018 guo et al 2019 usually formulate the peak and stable impact forces on a suspended pipeline separately and correlate them only with the impact velocity of submarine debris flow in this work a single formula with combination of drag and inertia forces into a framework is proposed to predict the peak impact force the stable impact coefficient is affected only by the speed of submarine debris flow and thus equals to the drag coefficient the peak impact force per unit length on a pipeline is 6 f f d f i where the peak impact force f 1 2 c p ρ d u 2 drag force f d 1 2 c s ρ d u 2 and inertia force f i π 4 c m ρ d 2 a then 7 1 2 ρ d u 2 c p c s π 4 c m ρ d 2 a where c s and c p are the stable and peak impact coefficients the time averaged acceleration will be used to characterize the local acceleration at initial impact 8 a u 0 δ t where a is the time averaged local acceleration δ t is the time increment to reach peak impact coefficient then eq 7 is further manipulated into 9 c m 2 π c p c s γ δ t the peak and stable impact coefficients shear rate and duration to reach peak are known and listed in table 2 then the inertia coefficient is readily obtained the relation between inertia coefficient and reynolds number is shown in fig 6 the fitted relation for inertia coefficient is 10 c m 0 2975 ln re 0 8533 re 17 6 r 2 0 88 0 re 17 6 r 2 1 00 the critical reynolds number for fitted relation is set at 17 6 which is smaller than that of the original numerical datasets 50 this resetting of critical reynolds number is on conservative side for prediction of peak impact force note that when reynolds number is lower than this critical value the pipeline still experiences some inertia force as reflected from the fluctuation of impact coefficient before reaching stable however the peak impact force of engineering interest at lower reynolds number is the stable impact force thus it is reasonable to set the inertia coefficient at nil for low reynolds number the drag coefficient is taken as the stable impact coefficient 11 c d 0 58 18 re 0 9 r 2 0 96 finally the peak impact force per unit length on a pipeline is 12 f f d f i 1 2 c d ρ d u 2 π 4 c m ρ d 2 a 3 5 comparison with numerical datasets from fan et al 2018 and nian et al 2018 to demonstrate the proposed relationship between inertia coefficient and reynolds number comparisons are made with published numerical datasets fan et al 2018 nian et al 2018 for the calculation of inertia coefficient based on numerical datasets from fan et al 2018 and nian et al 2018 time increments are assumed as 0 025 and 0 040 s in addition datasets with reynolds number lower than the critical reynolds number 17 6 are abandoned the available numerical datasets are listed in tables 3 and 4 then comparison between the third party numerical datasets and present relation proposed in this work is shown in fig 7 it is found that although some deviation exists between available numerical datasets and present relation curve their overall trends are similar one reason leading to the deviation may be due to the selection of time increment as a uniform constant for all cases the comparison with available numerical datasets provides us some confidence in the present relation in future lab experiments should be performed to further validate the relation 4 example of peak impact force estimation a prototype scenario of submarine debris flow impact on a submarine pipeline is proposed in this example a suspended pipeline with a 0 25 m diameter is installed a submarine debris flow impinges on the suspended pipeline at 10 different constant velocities i e 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 m s the time increment to reach peak impact force is assumed to be 0 025 s for cases with reynolds number larger than 17 6 the debris flow has a density of 1500 kg m3 the debris flow is assumed as a herschel bulkley fluid the yield stress is 450 pa flow consistency index is 20 pa s0 35 and flow behavior index is 0 35 for the purpose of method comparison the peak impact force exerted by a submarine debris flow on a suspended pipeline per unit length is estimated with the following two approaches approach ⅰ zakeri et al 2008 2009c 13 f 1 2 c d ρ d u 2 c d 1 4 17 5 re 1 25 approach ⅱ 14 f 1 2 c d ρ d u 2 π 4 c m ρ d 2 a c d 0 58 18 re 0 9 c m 0 2975 ln re 0 8533 re 17 6 0 re 17 6 table 5 is a summary of peak impact force predicted using different methods the results are also visualized fig 8 it is shown that for low velocity impact scenarios i e low reynolds number predictions of peak impact force with the two approaches are close to each other this is due to that at low reynolds number drag force is predominant and the effect of inertia force is negligible however as reynolds number of submarine debris flow increases the predicted peak impact force by approach ⅰ is significantly underestimated this is because of absence of inertia force at larger reynolds number in approach ⅰ in addition predictions of only drag force by approach ⅱ at larger reynolds number are less than those predicted by approach ⅰ this is because approach ⅰ is developed based on peak impact force while approach ⅱ with drag force only is derived from stable impact force 5 discussions 5 1 will peak impact force due to separated region formed behind the pipeline fan et al 2018 observed that at initial impact a separated region filling with ambient water is formed behind the pipeline afterwards the separated region disappears at embedded impact they claimed that the separated region is a main reason for the formation of peak impact force and its disappearance accounting for the stable impact force they argued that due to the density difference between slurry and water pressure difference is largest when separated region shows up to examine their viewpoints additional numerical runs are performed by replacing the ambient water with air the slurry is set at 15 clay table 1 the same inlet velocities are assigned at the inlet of domain i e 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 m s comparisons of transient impact coefficients are made between the scenarios of slurry water and slurry air runs fig 9 it is found that only slight differences of impact coefficient exist between slurry air and slurry water runs the density ratio between slurry and water is appropriately 1 7 while that ratio between slurry and air is about 1700 if separated region is a major contribution to its formation the peak impact force would be much more remarkable in the slurry air runs 5 2 will peak impact force due to transition from static to kinetic friction friction is a force that resists motion when two objects are in contact there are two forms of friction i e static and kinetic when sliding two objects past each other the development of friction from static to kinetic is schematized fig 10 the transition is briefly divided into two stages first the friction rapidly increases to a peak static region and then it presents a bluff descent to be stable kinetic region the static friction is always larger than kinetic one this phenomenon of friction development plausibly resembles the mode of peak and stable impact forces acting by a constant speed submarine debris flow on the suspended pipeline so will peak impact force observed in this study be a consequence of frictional transition from static to kinetic between slurry and pipe assuming it is true then whatever the reynolds number is peak impact force at initial impact would always show up as the friction between slurry and pipe is perpetual however present research reveals that the peak impact force will only show up when reynolds number is large enough 6 conclusions in this study a 2d two phase numerical model is developed using the ansys fluent 18 0 to simulate the constant speed submarine debris flow impact on a suspended pipeline two typical modes of impact force i e peak and stable acting on the suspended pipeline are observed the formation mechanism of peak and stable impact forces is revealed as follows for a constant speed submarine debris flow its convective acceleration is nil however at initial impact the suspended pipeline still experiences a short lived local acceleration which leads to an immediate peak before declining to be stable the stable impact force is attributed to the speed induced drag force while the peak impact force is superposed by speed induced drag force and local acceleration induced inertia force this temporary peak is less prominent and even negligible at lower reynolds number as the magnitude of local acceleration at initial impact is minor for the convenience of engineering application associated formula for estimation of peak and stable impact forces are put forward the peak impact force is the summation of drag and inertia forces and stable impact force is only the drag force thus the relation between reynolds number and drag coefficient is developed to predict the drag force and it is compared with the experimental datasets from zakeri et al 2008 the relation between reynolds number and inertia coefficient is proposed to estimate the inertia force and it is verified against numerical datasets available in fan et al 2018 and nian et al 2018 in this work comparisons to existing experimental and numerical datasets provide us some confidence in the proposed relations however additional physical experiments are suggested to be performed to obtain more measured data for further verification and improvement of the proposed relations author contributions xuesheng qian conceptualization methodology software validation formal

22236,in recent years submarine debris flow impact on suspended pipeline has been extensively investigated typical modes of impact force are identified at low reynolds number it increases till reaches a stable plateau otherwise it sharply rises to a peak before decreasing to a stable value however the formation mechanism of peak impact force remains an open question to address this issue a two dimensional 2d biphasic slurry and water numerical model is developed using ansys fluent 18 0 this model is used to simulate the constant speed submarine debris flow impact on a suspended pipeline herein similar modes of peak and stable impact coefficients which are nondimensionalized impact forces on a suspended pipeline are observed the formation mechanism of peak impact force is revealed it is found that the stable impact force relies on the constant speed of a submarine debris flow while peak impact force depends on its velocity and local acceleration at initial impact moreover the relationships between reynolds number and coefficients of inertia and drag are proposed to estimate the peak and stable impact forces the relations are compared to experimental and numerical datasets available in literatures and laboratory experiments are recommended in future to obtain more measured datasets for further verification keywords suspended pipeline submarine debris flow constant impact velocity peak impact force inertia coefficient local acceleration 1 introduction submarine pipelines are critical seafloor installations often deployed for efficient transportation of strategic energy and mineral resources from the offshore production fields to onshore processing and ancillary storage facilities kaiser 2017 the corridors for pipeline routes are extensively surveyed and prudently selected before carrying out on site constructions to circumvent hazardous areas with potential seafloor instabilities even so they are still inevitably exposed to the devastating threats of failed soil masses due to long runout distances white et al 2016 the soil masses emitted from the underwater slope failures are transported typically in the form of gravity driven sediment flows such as debris flows and turbidity currents submarine debris flows are very dense non newtonian fluids in laminar regime with density up to 1800 kg m3 and velocity up to 30 m s drago 2002 on the other hand turbidity currents are dilute turbulent newtonian flows with density higher than ambient water and up to 1200 kg m3 maximum velocity reached by turbidity currents is on the order of 10 15 m s drago 2002 as such submarine debris flows contain much larger momentum with the potential for catastrophic disasters to seafloor structures which is a major concern for engineering design of offshore structures such as submarine pipelines malgesini et al 2018 submarine debris flow impact forces on pipelines are rudimentary yet critical information for optimization of structural design and mitigation of hazardous effects evaluation methods of submarine debris flow impact force on a pipeline are divided by two distinct approaches soil and fluid mechanics the soil mechanics approach was developed after failure of three platforms and associated pipelines in the northern gulf of mexico during the hurricane camille in 1969 zakeri 2009a with an empirical parameter the impact force is assumed to be proportional to undrained shear strength of sliding mass the empirical parameter was initially set to constant values e g demars 1978 bea and aurora 1982 and later improved with consideration of soil strain rate effects e g shcapery and dunlap 1978 zakeri et al 2012 the soil mechanics approach is more applicable to early stage of failed mass when undrained shear strength of soil is close to the intact in situ state however submarine debris flows have very high fluidity and thus the fluid mechanics approach seems to be more appropriate zakeri et al 2008 randolph et al 2011 in fluid mechanics approach drag equation is widely used to estimate submarine debris flow impact force on pipelines in the drag equation the impact force is proportional to the square of velocity though researchers e g pazwash and robertson 1975 began early to investigate the impact forces exerted by non newtonian fluid flowing around objects evaluation of impact force on a pipeline due to submarine debris flow impact started to be performed merely a decade ago zakeri et al 2008 zakeri et al 2008 launched a series of flume tests to investigate submarine debris flow impact force normally acting on a pipeline through lab experiments and supplemental computational fluid dynamics cfd analyses zakeri et al 2009b they proposed empirical relations between drag coefficient and reynolds number for suspended and as laid pipelines afterwards several researchers followed up their pioneering work to study the normal and longitudinal impact forces on suspended zakeri 2009c liu et al 2015 and as laid wang et al 2016 pipelines at various angles of debris flow attack they extended the drag coefficient as a function of reynolds number and angle of attack besides some researchers studied normal impact force on a pipeline under different suspension height li et al 2015 guo et al 2019 and correlated drag coefficient with reynolds number and suspension height other researchers studied the effects of various factors such as the streamlined cross section of a pipeline perez gruszkiewicz 2012 fan et al 2018 low temperature environment near seabed nian et al 2018 and cavity of negative pressure formed behind a pipeline dutta and hawlader 2019 on the impact force acting on a suspended pipeline it should be noted that all previous efforts are made to estimate the impact force on a pipeline imposed by a constant speed submarine debris flow also since suspended pipelines are more vulnerable to debris flow impact than the laid on seafloor scenarios they are of major focus in the previous and present studies in previous research typical modes of stable and peak impact forces on a suspended pipeline are identified however the understanding of their formation mechanism is still far from adequate as such the peak impact force is used in previous work to calculate drag coefficient as it is on a more hazardous level than the stable one the aim of this paper is to understand the formation mechanism of typical modes of impact forces and establish a more reliable methodology to estimate the peak impact force as such a two dimensional 2d biphasic slurry and water numerical model is developed using ansys fluent 18 0 the 2d model is then used to simulate the constant speed submarine debris flow impact on suspended pipelines based on the numerical experiments efforts are made to provide an explanation for the underlying formation mechanism of peak impact force on a suspended pipeline due to the constant speed submarine debris flow efforts are also made to set up a methodology to estimate the peak impact force on a suspended pipeline 2 model descriptions 2 1 general ansys fluent 18 0 is a general purpose cfd software that includes three different euler euler multiphase models the volume of fluid vof model mixture model and eulerian model fluent 2017 submarine debris flow constitutes an incompressible biphasic slurry and water flow regime as such the eulerian multiphase model is used to simulate the constant speed submarine debris flow impact on a suspended pipeline in the biphasic slurry and water numerical model conservation equations for mass and momentum are discretized using the finite volume method fvm they are solved separately over the unstructured meshes for each phase the interphase coupling is achieved through the shared pressure

diameter 0 01 m is placed at the centerline of domain the centroid of pipe has a distance 0 05 m away from left boundary as such the pipe is located more than four times the pipe diameter away from all the boundaries and the confining effects of computational domain on velocity fields and associated impact forces on the pipe are negligible zakeri et al 2009c the domain is discretized into unstructured meshes using fluent meshing module the minimum mesh size is 4e 5 m and the maximum is 4e 3 m since slurry pipe interaction is of main interest in the study meshes around pipe are further

maximum of 3e 3 m the refined domain has a total of 5986 nodes and 11104 triangular elements a trial simulation with 15 clay content and 4 0 m s inlet velocity is carried out the calculated impact coefficient on the suspended pipeline is very close to that before mesh refinement fig 2 as such the numerical results are insensitive to mesh systems generated in this work and the coarser mesh is used for the simulations to demonstrate the interactions between submarine debris flow and suspended pipeline modeling results of volume fractions and velocity fields from two representative runs are shown fig 3 these two runs have the same clay content of 15 and inlet velocities of 0 2 and 1 0 m s it is shown that a channel filling with water is formed behind suspended pipe however the entrapped

0 2975 ln re 0 8533 re 17 6 r 2 0 88 0 re 17 6 r 2 1 00 the critical reynolds number for fitted relation is set at 17 6 which is smaller than that of the original numerical datasets 50 this resetting of critical reynolds number is on conservative side for prediction of peak impact force note that when reynolds number is lower than this critical value the pipeline still experiences some inertia force as reflected from the fluctuation of impact coefficient before reaching stable however the peak impact force of engineering interest at lower reynolds number is the stable impact force thus it is reasonable to set the inertia coefficient at nil for low reynolds number the drag coefficient is taken as the stable impact coefficient 11 c d 0 58 18 re 0 9 r 2 0 96 finally the peak impact force per unit length on a pipeline is 12 f f d f i 1 2 c d ρ d u 2 π 4 c m ρ d 2 a 3 5 comparison with numerical datasets from fan et al 2018 and nian et al 2018 to demonstrate the proposed relationship between inertia coefficient and reynolds number comparisons are made with published numerical datasets fan et al 2018 nian et al 2018 for the calculation of inertia coefficient based on numerical datasets from fan et al 2018 and nian et al 2018 time increments are assumed as 0 025 and 0 040 s in addition datasets with reynolds number lower than the critical reynolds number 17 6 are abandoned the available numerical datasets are listed in tables 3 and 4 then comparison between the third party numerical datasets and present relation proposed in this work is shown in fig 7 it is found that although some deviation exists between available numerical datasets and present relation curve their overall trends are similar one reason leading to the deviation may be due to the selection of time increment as a uniform constant for all cases the comparison with available numerical datasets provides us some confidence in the present relation in future lab experiments should be performed to further validate the relation 4 example of peak impact force estimation a prototype scenario of submarine debris flow impact on a submarine pipeline is proposed in this example a suspended pipeline with a 0 25 m diameter is installed a submarine debris flow impinges on the suspended pipeline at 10 different constant velocities i e 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 and 6 0 m s the time increment to reach peak impact force is assumed to be 0 025 s for cases with reynolds number larger than 17 6 the debris flow has a density of 1500 kg m3 the debris flow is assumed as a herschel bulkley fluid the yield stress is 450 pa flow consistency index is 20 pa s0 35 and flow behavior index is 0 35 for the purpose of method comparison the peak impact force exerted by a submarine debris flow on a suspended pipeline per unit length is estimated with the following two approaches approach ⅰ zakeri et al 2008 2009c 13 f 1 2 c d ρ d u 2 c d 1 4 17 5 re 1 25 approach ⅱ 14 f 1 2 c d ρ d u 2 π 4 c m ρ d 2 a c d 0 58 18 re 0 9 c m 0 2975 ln re 0 8533 re 17 6 0 re 17 6 table 5 is a summary of peak impact force predicted using different methods the results are also visualized fig 8 it is shown that for low velocity impact scenarios i e low reynolds number predictions of peak impact force with the two approaches are close to each other this is due to that at low reynolds number drag force is predominant and the effect of inertia force is negligible however as reynolds number of submarine debris flow increases the predicted peak impact force by approach ⅰ is significantly underestimated this is because of absence of inertia force at larger reynolds number in approach ⅰ in addition predictions of only drag force by approach ⅱ at larger reynolds number are less than those predicted by approach ⅰ this is because approach ⅰ is developed based on peak impact force while approach ⅱ with drag force only is derived from stable impact force 5 discussions 5 1 will peak impact force due to separated region formed behind the pipeline fan et al 2018 observed that at initial impact a separated region filling with ambient water is formed behind the pipeline afterwards the separated region disappears at embedded impact they claimed that the separated region is a main reason for the formation of peak impact force and its disappearance accounting for the stable impact force they argued that due to the density difference between slurry and water pressure difference is largest when separated region shows up to examine their viewpoints additional numerical runs are performed by replacing the ambient water with air the slurry is set at 15 clay table 1 the same inlet velocities are assigned at the inlet of domain i e 0 2 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 2 0 3 0 and 4 0 m s comparisons of transient impact coefficients are made between the scenarios of slurry water and slurry air runs fig 9 it is found that only slight differences of impact coefficient exist between slurry air and slurry water runs the density ratio between slurry and water is appropriately 1 7 while that ratio between slurry and air is about 1700 if separated region is a major contribution to its formation the peak impact force would be much more remarkable in the slurry air runs 5 2 will peak impact force due to transition from static to kinetic friction friction is a force that resists motion when two objects are in contact there are two forms of friction i e static and kinetic when sliding two objects past each other the development of friction from static to kinetic is schematized fig 10 the transition is briefly divided into two stages first the friction rapidly increases to a peak static region and then it presents a bluff descent to be stable kinetic region the static friction is always larger than kinetic one this phenomenon of friction development plausibly resembles the mode of peak and stable impact forces acting by a constant speed submarine debris flow on the suspended pipeline so will peak impact force observed in this study be a consequence of frictional transition from static to kinetic between slurry and pipe assuming it is true then whatever the reynolds number is peak impact force at initial impact would always show up as the friction between slurry and pipe is perpetual however present research reveals that the peak impact force will only show up when reynolds number is large enough 6 conclusions in this study a 2d two phase numerical model is developed using the ansys fluent 18 0 to simulate the constant speed submarine debris flow impact on a suspended pipeline two typical modes of impact force i e peak and stable acting on the suspended pipeline are observed the formation mechanism of peak and stable impact forces is revealed as follows for a constant speed submarine debris flow its convective acceleration is nil however at initial impact the suspended pipeline still experiences a short lived local acceleration which leads to an immediate peak before declining to be stable the stable impact force is attributed to the speed induced drag force while the peak impact force is superposed by speed induced drag force and local acceleration induced inertia force this temporary peak is less prominent and even negligible at lower reynolds number as the magnitude of local acceleration at initial impact is minor for the convenience of engineering application associated formula for estimation of peak and stable impact forces are put forward the peak impact force is the summation of drag and inertia forces and stable impact force is only the drag force thus the relation between reynolds number and drag coefficient is developed to predict the drag force and it is compared with the experimental datasets from zakeri et al 2008 the relation between reynolds number and inertia coefficient is proposed to estimate the inertia force and it is verified against numerical datasets available in fan et al 2018 and nian et al 2018 in this work comparisons to existing experimental and numerical datasets provide us some confidence in the proposed relations however additional physical experiments are suggested to be performed to obtain more measured data for further verification and improvement of the proposed relations author contributions xuesheng qian conceptualization methodology software validation formal

abuan and howell 2019 compared with other renewable energies tidal energy has the characteristics of long term predictability abundant resources high energy density and high maintenance cost how to develop a kind of efficient and cheap tidal energy device that can even be installed in places with different water flow characteristics has become a major problem since the structure of the horizontal axis tidal stream turbine is similar to that of the horizontal axis wind turbine most of its blades are designed in the way of wind turbine blades at present the design of tidal stream turbine mainly adopts the blade element momentum bem theory bahaj et al 2007 tedds et al tedds et al 2011 and so on which are also designed by this method to study its hydrodynamic characteristics in order to improve the working efficiency of tidal stream turbines optimization is often required after the preliminary design and the optimization method is mostly genetic algorithm which is basically aimed at the distribution of blade chord length twist angle thickness and so on sale et al 2009 goundar and ahmed 2014 huang and kanemoto 2015 kumar et al 2019 applied the response surface approximate model radial basis function and kriging model as the surrogate models for relative thickness of the blade and maximum relative thickness location of the blade and combined with cfd to optimize the

16 blade geometry variables to optimize turbine thrust annual energy production and blade quality xin shen et al chen et al 2016 had an additional blade start performance as his optimization target the aerodynamic performance of the blade is calculated by the lift surface method combined with the free wake model and the starting performance is calculated by the bem method the microgenetic algorithms used in this article compared to large populations of the traditional genetic algorithm require fewer total function evaluations which can reduce the population and saves the computing resources mostafa fatehi et al 2019 studied the influence of cavitation on aerodynamic performance of airfoils the stall performance and aerodynamic performance of airfoil with cavity were significantly improved compared with airfoils without cavity in this paper the response surface surrogate model and the weighted average surrogate model were used to optimize the chord length distribution of turbine blades in order to improve the turbine power coefficient and expand the applicable range of the turbine finally flume experiments were carried out to verify the reliability of numerical simulation results 2 design 2 1 methodology because of the rapidity and accuracy of the blade element momentum theory bem was used in the initial blade design hjort et al 2009 fischer et al 2012 the essence of the blade element momentum theory is to combine the momentum theorem and the blade element theory to solve the axial and tangential induction factors so as to calculate the turbine thrust and torque and other parameters under given conditions according to the acutator disc theory and momentum theorem the thrust and torque of the blade element at the radius r are respectively 2 1 d t 4 π ρ v 2 a 1 a r d r 2 2 d m ρ v d a 2 ω r a r 4 π ρ v ω 1 a a r 3 d r the blade is divided into z usually 10 z 20 micro segments along the direction of wingspan and these micro segments are called leaf element each element has different linear velocity ω r chord length c and pitch angle β so the force on elements are not the same according to the definition in fig 1 the lift force and drag force on the blade element are 2 3 d f l 1 2 ρ w 2 c l c d r 2 4 d f d 1 2 ρ w 2 c d c d r where c l c d respectively represent the lift and drag coefficients of the airfoil the axial force and tangential force of the blade element can be obtained by decomposing the lift force and the drag force along the axial direction and tangential direction respectively 2 5 d f a d f l cos φ d f d sin φ

thrust and torque of the blade element at the radius r are respectively 2 9 d t 1 2 n ρ w 2 c c n d r 2 10 d m 1 2 n ρ w 2 c c t r d r according to the geometric relationship shown in fig 1 the relative velocity of water flow and the inflow angle can be expressed as 2 11 w v 1 a 2 ω r 1 a 2 2 12 φ tan 1 v 1 a ω r 1 a then the angle of attack of the blade element can be written as 2 13 α φ β the expression of axial induction factor a can be obtained 2 14 a 1 a σ c n 4 π sin 2 φ where μ represents the relative radius μ r r and σ means solidity σ n c 2 r the expression of tangential induction factor a 2 15 a 1 a σ c t 4 π μ sin φ cos φ by combining the momentum theory and the blade element theory the relationship between the axial and tangential induction factors and the lift drag coefficient of airfoil can be obtained the axial and tangential induction factors of each blade element can be obtained by iterating the two factors with the given airfoil lift and drag and then the chord length distribution and pitch angle distribution of each blade element can be obtained the tip speed ratio tsr is the ratio of the blade tip speed to the free stream velocity 2 16 t s r ω r v the c p is the power coefficient that is the efficiency of the turbine to convert water flow energy into the mechanical energy of the generator 2 17 c p t ω 1 2 ρ v 3 a 2 2 geometry there are many types of airfoils and specific airfoils should be selected for the requirement of characteristics at the blade root the torque provided is small and the applied force is large therefore the strength at the blade root should be increased and the airfoil with a greater thickness should be selected to meet the design requirements of blade structure generally the tip part of the blade is of thin profile with smaller maximum lift coefficient and minimum drag coefficient higher lift drag ratio and lower noise level for the turbine blade the power generation is concentrated at about 75 of the blade span which requires that the airfoil has a high lift drag ratio here is not sensitive to roughness and has good stall characteristics and maintains a large lift in the stall area with reference to existing studies naca 63 xxx series are most widely used in horizontal axis tidal turbines considering the requirements of blade processing and blade strength airfoils with 15 thickness were selected for performance evaluation by comparing the lift coefficient drag coefficient and lift drag ratio of naca63 x15 airfoils of different thicknesses with a reynolds number of 106 in figs 2 4 naca63 815 which has the best lift and drag coefficient was finally selected as the initial airfoil according to the blade element momentum theory blade design software of the horizontal axis tidal turbine was developed in matlab the geometric parameters of the turbine blade with a diameter of 5 4 m and an optimal tip speed ratio of 6 were obtained through the design software as shown in table 1 its blade geometric distribution curve and 3d model was shown in fig 5 and fig 6 2 3 computational mesh in this paper cfx software is used for numerical calculation the whole flow field is divided into stationary region and rotation region and the cross sectional area of the calculation region is square 14 4 m 14 4 m the distance from the inlet to the blade is 27 m 5d and the distance from the outlet to the blade is 54 m 10d in order to improve the calculation accuracy all grids are divided into structured grids by blocks the topological structures of the static domain and the rotational domain are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively in this model steady state and steady analysis are performed the turbulence model is sst k ω model the inlet adopts velocity inlet boundary conditions the outlet adopts pressure outlet boundary conditions the flume side walls and the supporting structure of the hydraulic turbine adopt no slip wall boundary conditions in order to reduce the computation the interface between the stationary domain and the rotational domain uses stage and the inlet velocity is 3 5 m s in order to determine the number of meshes five sets of different numbers of meshes are used for simulation calculation the results are shown in table 2 grid independence as the number of grids increases the calculation error gradually decreases it can be seen that when the number of grids reaches 6 58 million the values of c p and c t are basically the same as when the number of grids reaches 8 89 million in consideration of computer resources the fourth grid is adopted for subsequent optimization 3 optimization the main methods used in the optimization design of horizontal axis tidal turbine blades are optimal cybernetics mathematical programming and genetic algorithm turbine optimization is mainly aimed at maximizing the final power coefficient of the turbine in this paper the power coefficient of the blade under various working conditions is comprehensively considered to expand the range of the optimal power coefficient while improving the power coefficient 3 1 f 1 c p 4 c p 6 c p 8 3 3 2 f 2 σ 2 c p 4 c p 6 c p 8 c p 4 c p 6 c p 8 represent the power coefficient for tsr 4 6 8 respectively f1 for the mean of the three power coefficient under different conditions f2 for the variance of the three power coefficient only when f1 is maximized and f2 is minimized can the turbine performance be improved and its scope be expanded since the blade airfoil has been selected it can be carried out by changing the angle distribution and chord length distribution of each section of the blade and since the two variables have different effects different optimization methods are adopted here to optimize the final blade 3 1 pitch angle optimization as can be seen from the lift drag ratio curve of the airfoil before when the blade angle of attack is 6 the lift drag ratio is the highest and the performance is the best therefore the pitch angle of the blade is adjusted first to make the distribution of the blade along the spanwise angle of attack close to 6 as shown in the fig 9 and fig 10 as mentioned above the power generated by the blade is mainly concentrated at about 75 of the blade span and noise reduction is required for the blade tip both of which have higher lift drag ratio when pitch angle is optimized in fig 11 it is mainly based on the initial blade from the 3 4 blade length to the tip to reduce the angle of attack and improve the lift drag ratio for example in the relative radius of 0 9 angle of attack of the airfoil blade section from 6 46 to 6 07 in fig 11 and in the relative radius of 1 0 angle of attack of the airfoil blade section from 6 77 to 5 96 closer to the optimal angle of attack in fig 12 after optimizing the pitch angle according to the turbine performance curves fig 13 and fig 14 the turbine performance is basically improved under various working conditions the optimal tip speed ratio of the blade is also deviated from the rated tsr 6 to tsr 8 so the final optimization goal should not only consider the initial optimal tip speed ratio of 6 but also consider the optimal tip speed ratio deviation caused in the blade design process as well as the effective range of the turbine 3 2 chord optimization after adjusting the pitch angle of the blade the blade performance is improved but the optimal tip speed ratio is biased to the high tip velocity ratio tsr 8 cavitation is easy to occur in the case of high blade tip speed ratio at this time the motor speed is too fast which is not conducive to the stable operation of the unit therefore the chord length distribution of the blade needs to be further changed in total the blade is composed of 17 blade element sections which means there are 17 chord length variables in order to reduce variables bezier curve is adopted to parameterize the chord length distribution curve of the blade and the chord length distribution of the blade is controlled by controlling the control points of the bezier curve in this paper the third order bezier curve is selected that is the change of the chord length curve is controlled by four chord length control points bezier curve has good geometrical characteristics and the expression of n order bezier curve is shown as follows 3 3 p t i 0 n b i n q i i 0 n c n i 1 t n i t i q i p t is described from any point on the curve t 0 1 is the parameter b i n is the bernstein basis function c n i is the combination of i q i for bezier control point in order to improve the performance of the blade the two control points c 2 and c 3 only consider the case of up regulation and do not consider down regulation shown in fig 15 the tip part is relatively thin for the sake of structural safety only fine tuning the scope of each control point is shown in table 3 because the neural network model has a strong ability to approximate complex nonlinear functions and a strong fault tolerance rate it is not easy to affect the overall performance of the network therefore rbf is adopted as the agent model and then use the nsga ⅱ method optimization the error analysis of the model in table 4 shows that the rbf model is reliable f1 and f2 of each pareto solution can be seen in fig 16 the curve part connected by the red point set is the pareto frontier solution when optimize we choose the best advantage in the pareto frontier solution as can be seen from the leading edge solution with the increase of the average power coefficient of tsr 4 6 8 its variance increases gradually however the increase range of the power coefficient variance is small compared with the increase range of the average value and the resulting variance is also within the allowable range therefore the best choice is the point with the largest variance and mean value of the leading edge solution in fig 17 as can be seen from figs 18 20 the tsr of the twice optimized blade increases by about 2 when tsr 6 it can also be seen from the axial torque my suffered by each blade element that the torque near 3 4 of the blade span direction increases obviously after optimization and the power coefficient of the turbine also increases although the blade power coefficient has no advantage in the range of high tip speed ratio after two optimizations it has a significant improvement in the range of low tip speed ratio the cavitation performance of the blade can be improved when the blade operates in the low tip speed ratio range 4 measurement experimental setup the experiment was carried out at shanghai shipping research institute the working section of the cavitation water cylinder at shanghai shipping research institute is 2 6 m long the cross section is square with rounded corners and the size is 0 6 m 0 6 m as shown in fig 21 the maximum water speed is 12 m s equipped with j25 dynamometer and h44 oblique flow dynamometer the maximum thrust measured by the two instruments is 3000 n the maximum torque is 150 nm and the maximum rotation speed of the propeller shaft can reach 4000 rpm the water cylinder is equipped with pressure regulating box and deaeration device which has good controllability the pressure adjustment range of the working section of the water cylinder is 0 200 kpa according to the specifications of the cavitation cylinder the model was processed into a 240 mm diameter three blade turbine which was scaled to a scale of 1 22 5 with the prototype as shown in fig 22 by adjusting the turbine speed and flow speed to change the turbine tip speed ratio the complete hydrodynamic performance curve of turbine operation is obtained as can be seen from fig 23 the sea trial was conducted at the lhd tidal power generation platform on xiushan island in zhejiang province according to the fig 24 it can be seen that the results of model test data cfd prediction data and actual sea survey data in the optimal tip speed ratio region are relatively close the actual sea survey data basically fluctuates in cfd prediction and the overall trend is in good agreement in the model experiment the velocity is too large and the turbine speed is too low in the region with lower tip speed ratio while in the region with higher tip speed ratio the velocity is too low and the loss is too large making the power coefficient low only when tsr 4 6 the velocity and the speed of the turbine are appropriate and the power coefficient of the turbine is higher because of the scale effect of the cavitation cylinder as a whole the results of model simulation and optimization are true and reliable 5 conclusion in this paper the principle and method of blade design of power flow turbine are described in detail and the chord length and pitch angle distribution of blade are optimized by genetic algorithm so as to optimize the hydrodynamic performance of tidal turbine in the optimization process the following conclusions can be drawn the blade pitch angle distribution will change the blade angle of attack when it comes to flow so the blade pitch angle distribution should be optimized according to the lift drag ratio of airfoils used in each section the main power generating position of the blade is concentrated at about 75 of the blade span so the increase of chord length in the middle of the blade is conducive to capturing more energy of water flow and improving power coefficient of the tidal turbine through the establishment of neural network model of a certain reliability and adopt the nsga ⅱmulti objective genetic optimization makes the final optimization of turbine is not only in the most high power factor increased by 2 and also make the turbine within the scope of the tip speed ratio of 4 6 power coefficient are optimal as a result the power efficient of the tidal turbine in more sea condition can be overall improved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

v the c p is the power coefficient that is the efficiency of the turbine to convert water flow energy into the mechanical energy of the generator 2 17 c p t ω 1 2 ρ v 3 a 2 2 geometry there are many types of airfoils and specific airfoils should be selected for the requirement of characteristics at the blade root the torque provided is small and the applied force is large therefore the strength at the blade root should be increased and the airfoil with a greater thickness should be selected to meet the design requirements of blade structure generally the tip part of the blade is of thin profile with smaller maximum lift coefficient and minimum drag coefficient higher lift drag ratio and lower noise level for the turbine blade the power generation is concentrated at about 75 of the blade span which requires that the airfoil has a high lift drag ratio here is not sensitive to roughness and has good stall characteristics and maintains a large lift in the stall area with reference to existing studies naca 63 xxx series are most widely used in horizontal axis tidal turbines considering the requirements of blade processing and blade strength airfoils with 15 thickness were selected for performance evaluation by comparing the lift coefficient drag coefficient and lift drag ratio of naca63 x15 airfoils of different thicknesses with a reynolds number of 106 in figs 2 4 naca63 815 which has the best lift and drag coefficient was finally selected as the initial airfoil according to the blade element momentum theory blade design software of the horizontal axis tidal turbine was developed in matlab the geometric parameters of the turbine blade with a diameter of 5 4 m and an optimal tip speed ratio of 6 were obtained through the design software as shown in table 1 its blade geometric distribution curve and 3d model was shown in fig 5 and fig 6 2 3 computational mesh in this paper cfx software is used for numerical calculation the whole flow field is divided into stationary region and rotation region and the cross sectional area of the calculation region is square 14 4 m 14 4 m the distance from the inlet to the blade is 27 m 5d and the distance from the outlet to the blade is 54 m 10d in order to improve the calculation accuracy all grids are divided into structured grids by blocks the topological structures of the static domain and the rotational domain are shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively in this model steady state and steady analysis are performed the turbulence model is sst k ω model the inlet adopts velocity inlet boundary conditions the outlet adopts pressure outlet boundary conditions the flume side walls and the supporting structure of the hydraulic turbine adopt no slip wall boundary conditions in order to reduce the computation the interface between the stationary domain and the rotational domain uses stage and the inlet velocity is 3 5 m s in order to determine the number of meshes five sets of different numbers of meshes are used for simulation calculation the results are shown in table 2 grid independence as the number of grids increases the calculation error gradually decreases it can be seen that when the number of grids reaches 6 58 million the values of c p and c t are basically the same as when the number of grids reaches 8 89 million in consideration of computer resources the fourth grid is adopted for subsequent optimization 3 optimization the main methods used in the optimization design of horizontal axis tidal turbine blades are optimal cybernetics mathematical programming and genetic algorithm turbine optimization is mainly aimed at maximizing the final power coefficient of the turbine in this paper the power coefficient of the blade under various working conditions is comprehensively considered to expand the range of the optimal power coefficient while improving the power coefficient 3 1 f 1 c p 4 c p 6 c p 8 3 3 2 f 2 σ 2 c p 4 c p 6 c p 8 c p 4 c p 6 c p 8 represent the power coefficient for tsr 4 6 8 respectively f1 for the mean of the three power coefficient under different conditions f2 for the variance of the three power coefficient only when f1 is maximized and f2 is minimized can the turbine performance be improved and its scope be expanded since the blade airfoil has been selected it can be carried out by changing the angle distribution and chord length distribution of each section of the blade and since the two variables have different effects different optimization methods are adopted here to optimize the final blade 3 1 pitch angle optimization as can be seen from the lift drag ratio curve of the airfoil before when the blade angle of attack is 6 the lift drag ratio is the highest and the performance is the best therefore the pitch angle of the blade is adjusted first to make the distribution of the blade along the spanwise angle of attack close to 6 as shown in the fig 9 and fig 10 as mentioned above the power generated by the blade is mainly concentrated at about 75 of the blade span and noise reduction is required for the blade tip both of which have higher lift drag ratio when pitch angle is optimized in fig 11 it is mainly based on the initial blade from the 3 4 blade length to the tip to reduce the angle of attack and improve the lift drag ratio for example in the relative radius of 0 9 angle of attack of the airfoil blade section from 6 46 to 6 07 in fig 11 and in the relative radius of 1 0 angle of attack of the airfoil blade section from 6 77 to 5 96 closer to the optimal angle of attack in fig 12 after optimizing the pitch angle according to the turbine performance curves fig 13 and fig 14 the turbine performance is basically improved under various working conditions the optimal tip speed ratio of the blade is also deviated from the rated tsr 6 to tsr 8 so the final optimization goal should not only consider the initial optimal tip speed ratio of 6 but also consider the optimal tip speed ratio deviation caused in the blade design process as well as the effective range of the turbine 3 2 chord optimization after adjusting the pitch angle of the blade the blade performance is improved but the optimal tip speed ratio is biased to the high tip velocity ratio tsr 8 cavitation is easy to occur in the case of high blade tip speed ratio at this time the motor speed is too fast which is not conducive to the stable operation of the unit therefore the chord length distribution of the blade needs to be further changed in total the blade is composed of 17 blade element sections which means there are 17 chord length variables in order to reduce variables bezier curve is adopted to parameterize the chord length distribution curve of the blade and the chord length distribution of the blade is controlled by controlling the control points of the bezier curve in this paper the third order bezier curve is selected that is the change of the chord length curve is controlled by four chord length control points bezier curve has good geometrical characteristics and the expression of n order bezier curve is shown as follows 3 3 p t i 0 n b i n q i i 0 n c n i 1 t n i t i q i p t is described from any point on the curve t 0 1 is the parameter b i n is the bernstein basis function c n i is the combination of i q i for bezier control point in order to improve the performance of the blade the two control points c 2 and c 3 only consider the case of up regulation and do not consider down regulation shown in fig 15 the tip part is relatively thin for the sake of structural safety only fine tuning the scope of each control point is shown in table 3 because the neural network model has a strong ability to approximate complex nonlinear functions and a strong fault tolerance rate it is not easy to affect the overall performance of the network therefore rbf is adopted as the agent model and then use the nsga ⅱ method optimization the error analysis of the model in table 4 shows that the rbf model is reliable f1 and f2 of each pareto solution can be seen in fig 16 the curve part connected by the red point set is the pareto frontier solution when optimize we choose the best advantage in the pareto frontier solution as can be seen from the leading edge solution with the increase of the average power coefficient of tsr 4 6 8 its variance increases gradually however the increase range of the power coefficient variance is small compared with the increase range of the average value and the resulting variance is also within the allowable range therefore the best choice is the point with the largest variance and mean value of the leading edge solution in fig 17 as can be seen from figs 18 20 the tsr of the twice optimized blade increases by about 2 when tsr 6 it can also be seen from the axial torque my suffered by each blade element that the torque near 3 4 of the blade span direction increases obviously after optimization and the power coefficient of the turbine also increases although the blade power coefficient has no advantage in the range of high tip speed ratio after two optimizations it has a significant improvement in the range of low tip speed ratio the cavitation performance of the blade can be improved when the blade operates in the low tip speed ratio range 4 measurement experimental setup the experiment was carried out at shanghai shipping research institute the working section of the cavitation water cylinder at shanghai shipping research institute is 2 6 m long the cross section is square with rounded corners and the size is 0 6 m 0 6 m as shown in fig 21 the maximum water speed is 12 m s equipped with j25 dynamometer and h44 oblique flow dynamometer the maximum thrust measured by the two instruments is 3000 n the maximum torque is 150 nm and the maximum rotation speed of the propeller shaft can reach 4000 rpm the water cylinder is equipped with pressure regulating box and deaeration device which has good controllability the pressure adjustment range of the working section of the water cylinder is 0 200 kpa according to the specifications of the cavitation cylinder the model was processed into a 240 mm diameter three blade turbine which was scaled to a scale of 1 22 5 with the prototype as shown in fig 22 by adjusting the turbine speed and flow speed to change the turbine tip speed ratio the complete hydrodynamic performance curve of turbine operation is obtained as can be seen from fig 23 the sea trial was conducted at the lhd tidal power generation platform on xiushan island in zhejiang province according to the fig 24 it can be seen that the results of model test data cfd prediction data and actual sea survey data in the optimal tip speed ratio region are relatively close the actual sea survey data basically fluctuates in cfd prediction and the overall trend is in good agreement in the model experiment the velocity is too large and the turbine speed is too low in the region with lower tip speed ratio while in the region with higher tip speed ratio the velocity is too low and the loss is too large making the power coefficient low only when tsr 4 6 the velocity and the speed of the turbine are appropriate and the power coefficient of the turbine is higher because of the scale effect of the cavitation cylinder as a whole the results of model simulation and optimization are true and reliable 5 conclusion in this paper the principle and method of blade design of power flow turbine are described in detail and the chord length and pitch angle distribution of blade are optimized by genetic algorithm so as to optimize the hydrodynamic performance of tidal turbine in the optimization process the following conclusions can be drawn the blade pitch angle distribution will change the blade angle of attack when it comes to flow so the blade pitch angle distribution should be optimized according to the lift drag ratio of airfoils used in each section the main power generating position of the blade is concentrated at about 75 of the blade span so the increase of chord length in the middle of the blade is conducive to capturing more energy of water flow and improving power coefficient of the tidal turbine through the establishment of neural network model of a certain reliability and adopt the nsga ⅱmulti objective genetic optimization makes the final optimization of turbine is not only in the most high power factor increased by 2 and also make the turbine within the scope of the tip speed ratio of 4 6 power coefficient are optimal as a result the power efficient of the tidal turbine in more sea condition can be overall improved declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

22238,the connector loads of a 3 module vlfs very large floating structure deployed in the shallow water areas have been investigated by experimental and numerical methods for the numerical method a simplified analysis procedure has been built based on 3d hydroelasticity theory and rmfc rigid module flexible connector model and the effect of the uneven seabed can be included in this procedure the model tests of the 3 module vlfs considering the complicated seabed topography and wave environment have been finished some key technologies for the model tests have been solved such as the simulations of the complicated seabed topography and the connector model a lot of the first hand model test results have been discussed and compared with the numerical results some useful conclusions were obtained which can provide reference basis for the preliminary and conceptual design of vlfs and its connectors keywords vlfs connecter loads hydroelasticity uneven seabed model tests 1 introduction the rapid expansion of world population the exhausting of inland resources and the requirement of sustainable development of world economy have strengthened the efforts of mankind to increase the capability of resource exploitation and space utilization in the ocean very large floating structures vlfs are among those marine structures that have attracted long lasting attention in ocean utilization for several decades ohmatsu 2005 wang and wang 2015 ding et al 2019 different from other offshore floating structures a vlfs is kilometers in length and due to its large sizes and relatively low bending regidities their hydroelastic responses to waves are of the most concern many studies have been carried out and many methods have been proposed for the prediction of the hydroelastic responses of vlfs the most robust method is the three dimensional theory of the hydroelasticity wu 1984 price and wu 1985 as well as different hybrid hydroelastic analysis methods takuji 1998 kashiwagi 1998 chen et al 2006 michailides et al 2013 senjanović et al 2015 wu et al 2018 on the other hand because semisubmersible design analysis and construction technologies have been well developed and proven in the oil industry the principle technological questions for this class of vlfs relate to the connection to determine its hydroelastic response two models are required a structural model to include the elasticity of the structure and a hydrodynamic model to determine the fluid forces but a detailed finite element structural model is actually the more difficult of the two to construct and compared with the deformation of the whole structure of the vlfs the deformation occurring in the modules can be neglected therefore the rigid module flexible connector rmfc model wang et al 1991 riggs et al 2000 is much more suitable for conceptual and preliminary design of milti module vlfs in the rmfc model the vlfs is composed by rigid modules connected by flexible connectors the connectors are given stiffness properties to represent the physical connector stiffnesses and the motions of vlfs are completely characterized by 6 displacement degrees of freedom of each module much work has been done about the characteristics of the vlfs s connector loads based on rmfc models wu and mills 1996 riggs et al 1999 wu et al 2016 2017 but most of the numerical results are not verified by experiments in this paper the investigation of connector loads of a 3 module vlfs is carried out by experimental and numerical methods firstly the analysis methodologies including hydroelasticity of floating structure in shallow water and theory of rmfc model are described briefly then the design of connectors will be introduced in section 3 as well as the description of a 1 100 scale model test with three vlfs s modules in section 4 of this paper at the same time a comparison is carried out between the experimental measurements and numerical results to validate the theory of rmfc model and the variation trend and extreme loads of connectors with different sea states are also obtained the theory and results presented in the paper could provide a technical foundation for the load determination and structure design of vlfs s connectors 2 theoretical description 2 1 3d hydroelasticity theory the dynamic behavior of a floating structure is observed in an equilibrium coordinate system oxyz with x axis pointing from stern to bow x y plane on the undisturbed water surface z axis pointing upwards and passing through the equilibrium position of the gravity center of the structure by introducing the principal coordinates q r t r 1 2 m the displacement u x y z of the structure is expressed as the aggregation of the principal modes u r x r y r z r r 1 2 m

numerical method for solving the green function was investigated by yang et al 2014 which proposed a new gauss laguerre integral expression 2 2 rmfc model each module has 6 degrees of freedom in the

k u 5 k u 6 k t where u 1 k u 6 k are 6 degrees of freedom of the kth module a linear and zero length spring are used to model the connectors and the spring restricts relative translations but allows

matrix can be obtained by the assembly of stiffness matrixes between adjacent modules to build the rmfc model of three module vlfs the bush elements were used between two adjacent modules to simulate the stiffness of connectors in this paper 10 different values as shown in table 1 will be chosen in the calculation to study the influence of connector stiffness in this analysis the three components of rotational stiffness k θx k θy and k θz of the connectors were assumed zero 3 design of connectors for a multi module vlfs as shown in fig 1 connectors between two adjacent modules have great influence on the global responses of the vlfs in waves and usually suffer the largest internal loads that may result in damage in severe wave conditions to evaluate the fluid structure interactions of a multi module vlfs in waves and to assess the safety of the connectors the influence of connector stiffness of a 3 module vlfs was firstly studied each module of the vlfs consists of five transverse pontoons ten columns and eight longitudinal braces 10sets of combinations of connector stiffness components in three directions k x k y and k z are given in the table 1 represented by k4 k13 were examined for the 3 module vlfs in irregular waves described by a jonswap spectrum with h s 8 0 m and t p 9 0s in different wave directions in case all the connectors are of the stiffness k9 k x 2 109 n m k y 1 109n m and k z 2 109n m the maximum connector forces of the vlfs appear at the connector c1 and their variations with regard to the wave angle are shown in fig 2 a evidently all connector forces achieve peak values at the wave angles around 84 while become much smaller at the wave angle of 90 riggs et al 2000 observed the same phenomenon in the research of vlfs comparing these peak values the influence of different combinations of connector stiffness components k4 k13 on the maximum connector forces of the vlfs in waves of h s 8 0 m and t p 9 0s is exhibited in fig 2 b it indicates that in the wave condition of h s 8 0 m and t p 9 0s the vlfs of the connector stiffness k9 produces much higher connector force fx in x direction than other connector stiffness combinations fig 3 a shows the wave spectrum the transfer functions of fx for the vlfs of different connector stiffness k6 and k9 shown in fig 3 b and 3 c exhibit peaks at frequencies 0 3 and 0 8 rad s respectively the former is far away from the wave energy range the latter is actually the resonant frequency of the horizontal bending mode of the vlfs in water fig 3 d which is just close to the peak frequency of the wave spectrum this explains the large difference of the maximum connector forces caused by different designs of the connector stiffness of k9 and k6 similarly in case of connector stiffness k8 the resonant frequency of the torque mode falls into the wave energy range and produces very high vertical connector force fz in this wave condition in the whole vlfs system the connectors are only small parts design of the connectors should avoid the resonant frequencies of the vlfs in water close to the wave frequency range in order to investigate the potentially dangerous connector loads the connector stiffness k9 k x k z 2 109 n m and k y 1 109 n m will be used in the model tests 3 1 comparative analysis of experimental and prediction results the model tests of the 3 module semi submersible type vlfs with a scale ratio of λ 100 1 was tested in the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering of dalian university of technology fig 4 the principal particulars of the vlfs are listed in table 2 the complicated seabed topography and wave environment in the area around the model was simulated in the wave according to the measured seabed topography near an island ding et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the model was tested in regular and irregular wave conditions with different wave frequencies and three wave angles 0 43 and 88 the dynamic responses of the modules and the connector forces were measured each connector model includes 2 l shape mounting plates 5 springs with spherical hinges at the both ends as shown in fig 6 the stiffness of spring was designed and manufactured according to the law of similitude of the connector stiffness 16 k prototype k model λ 2 therefore the coefficients of model connector stiffness were k x m k z m 2 10 5 n m and k y m 1 10 5 n m corresponding to the prototype connector stiffness k9 in fig 2 k x k z 2 109 n m and k y 1 109 n m 3 2 results in regular waves the transfer function response amplitude operator rao of connector loads were obtained in the regular waves all results in this paper have been translated into the prototype to clearly show the real responses of the connector the measured connector force fx at the connectors c1 c4 are shown in the fig 7 a in fig 7 b the measured raos of fx fy and fz at the connector c1 in wave direction of 43 are compared it can be found that the raos of fx of the four connectors have the same tendency and the longitudinal connector force fx is larger than other components fy and fz the similar tendency also appears in wave directions 0 and 88 fig 8 shows the raos of connector forces at c1 in three wave directions evidently the connector force in y direction is much smaller than the other two directions in the wave frequency range lower than 0 5 rad s λ l 0 82 all connector forces at c1 are much larger in wave direction of 43 than in other wave directions when the wave frequency is greater than 0 45 rad s wave length λ l 3 1lb the connector force fz is larger in wave direction of 88 than in other wave directions in waves of frequencies ω 0 6 0 7 rad s λ l 2 1 5lb all connector forces are always larger in beam sea than in other incoming wave directions based on the rmfc theory the transfer functions of connector loads can be obtained by the mode superposition method taking into account the symmetry only the results of c1 connector loads are compared in this paper when this model is used in the analysis of hydroelastic responses of a vlfs deployed near seashore the software thafts cssrc 2011 may be employed with the seabed modeled as a fixed boundary the hydrodynamic model of uneven seabed and vlfs model is shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the compared results of numerical predictions and model tests as can be seen from the figure the general variations and values between the numerical predictions and model tests are in good agreement the numerical prediction results under wave direction of 90 are also given in the fig 10 and the results of connector loads are significantly small it can be inferred that the maximum value of connector loads will occur at 45 to 90 wave directions and this conclusion is also given in the literature which will be discussed in more detail later in order to investigate how the uneven bathymetry affects the hydrodynamics loads the wave propagation near the island are also given in the fig 11 the wave factors of h 3 0 m t 11 6s are used as the far field incident wave the wave heights wave periods and wave directions at the center points m1 m3 of three module vlfs under this typical regular wave condition are given in the table 3 it can be found that the waves at different positions of three module vlfs appear obvious inhomogeneous because of the uneven bathymetry the inhomogeneous encounter wave may make the distribution of hydrodynamic loads acting on the three modules the responses of the modules and the connector loads between two adjacent modules rather complicated 3 3 results in irregular waves response time curves of different test parameters under various sea conditions are obtained through irregular wave tests the time of each irregular wave test condition will be not less than 1 h corresponding to the actual sea condition so as to ensure enough samples for statistical analysis the irregular sea states are described by the jonswaps wave spectra 17 s ω α g 2 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω ω p 4 γ exp 0 5 ω ω p σ ω p 2 where α 5 16 h s 2 ω p 4 g 2 1 0 287 ln γ is the generalized philip constant σ is the spectral width parameter and γ 2 0 is the spectral peak parameter the wave elevation and connector loads in different wave directions are plotted in fig 12 similar to the results in regular waves the values of fx and fz are close and much bigger than fy the test results of connector loads are fitted by weibull distribution function and the results of wave induced loads wl and combined loads cl wave frequency and high frequency components are basically in accordance with the weibull distribution law fig 13 the formula of probability density function of weibull distribution is 18 f x b a b x b 1 e x a b where a and b are two parameters of weibull distribution respectively the extreme load γ n can be expressed according to ochi method ochi 1973 19 γ n 2 ln n α m 0 where α is assurance rate n is the number of samples and m 0 is 0 th order spectral moment table 4 shows the extreme value inferences based on the weibull and ochi method the results inferred by ochi method are slightly bigger than the values by weibull method the total extreme load in x direction of c1 connector is more than 50 thousand tons under this wave condition the significant c1 connector loads for all sea states and wave angles are compared in fig 14 the model test results of the wave condition of h s 8 05 m t p 9 1s are also given in these figures and the variation trend of the results with sea states and wave angles is very similar similar to the result in regular waves the maximum significant x direction force is larger than the other forces the results also reach a maximum at approximate 84 85 wave angle and these results are consistent with other studies riggs et al 2000 4 conclusions the connector loads of a three modules vlfs in variable seabed bathymetry are investigated by numerical methods and model tests some important conclusions are as follows 1 the x connector force is larger than the other forces thus close attention should be paid to the longitudinal loads in connector design 2 compared with experimental results the prediction results show that the numerical method presented in this paper is effective and applicable especially useful for preliminary and conceptual design of vlfs and its connectors 3 the maximum connector loads occur at the wave direction of 84 85 it is suggested that the vlfs should be equipped with a dynamic positioning system to keep the wave angle far away from 85 the best range of wave angle is from 0 to 50 according to experimental and numerical results 4 even though the trend is the same certain disparity exists between the experimental and numerical results perhaps the biggest reason is that the effect of environmental conditions near the island is not accurately considered in the numerical prediction because only the effect of uneven seabed was taken into account in the simplified method but the really wave condition such as inhomogeneous wave height and wave direction need to be further considered in the subsequent numerical prediction model

22238,the connector loads of a 3 module vlfs very large floating structure deployed in the shallow water areas have been investigated by experimental and numerical methods for the numerical method a simplified analysis procedure has been built based on 3d hydroelasticity theory and rmfc rigid module flexible connector model and the effect of the uneven seabed can be included in this procedure the model tests of the 3 module vlfs considering the complicated seabed topography and wave environment have been finished some key technologies for the model tests have been solved such as the simulations of the complicated seabed topography and the connector model a lot of the first hand model test results have been discussed and compared with the numerical results some useful conclusions were obtained which can provide reference basis for the preliminary and conceptual design of vlfs and its connectors keywords vlfs connecter loads hydroelasticity uneven seabed model tests 1 introduction the rapid expansion of world population the exhausting of inland resources and the requirement of sustainable development of world economy have strengthened the efforts of mankind to increase the capability of resource exploitation and space utilization in the ocean very large floating structures vlfs are among those marine structures that have attracted long lasting attention in ocean utilization for several decades ohmatsu 2005 wang and wang 2015 ding et al 2019 different from other offshore floating structures a vlfs is kilometers in length and due to its large sizes and relatively low bending regidities their hydroelastic responses to waves are of the most concern many studies have been carried out and many methods have been proposed for the prediction of the hydroelastic responses of vlfs the most robust method is the three dimensional theory of the hydroelasticity wu 1984 price and wu 1985 as well as different hybrid hydroelastic analysis methods takuji 1998 kashiwagi 1998 chen et al 2006 michailides et al 2013 senjanović et al 2015 wu et al 2018 on the other hand because semisubmersible design analysis and construction technologies have been well developed and proven in the oil industry the principle technological questions for this class of vlfs relate to the connection to determine its hydroelastic response two models are required a structural model to include the elasticity of the structure and a hydrodynamic model to determine the fluid forces but a detailed finite element structural model is actually the more difficult of the two to construct and compared with the deformation of the whole structure of the vlfs the deformation occurring in the modules can be neglected therefore the rigid module flexible connector rmfc model wang et al 1991 riggs et al 2000 is much more suitable for conceptual and preliminary design of milti module vlfs in the rmfc model the vlfs is composed by rigid modules connected by flexible connectors the connectors are given stiffness properties to represent the physical connector stiffnesses and the motions of vlfs are completely characterized by 6 displacement degrees of freedom of each module much work has been done about the characteristics of the vlfs s connector loads based on rmfc models wu and mills 1996 riggs et al 1999 wu et al 2016 2017 but most of the numerical results are not verified by experiments in this paper the investigation of connector loads of a 3 module vlfs is carried out by experimental and numerical methods firstly the analysis methodologies including hydroelasticity of floating structure in shallow water and theory of rmfc model are described briefly then the design of connectors will be introduced in section 3 as well as the description of a 1 100 scale model test with three vlfs s modules in section 4 of this paper at the same time a comparison is carried out between the experimental measurements and numerical results to validate the theory of rmfc model and the variation trend and extreme loads of connectors with different sea states are also obtained the theory and results presented in the paper could provide a technical foundation for the load determination and structure design of vlfs s connectors 2 theoretical description 2 1 3d hydroelasticity theory the dynamic behavior of a floating structure is observed in an equilibrium coordinate system oxyz with x axis pointing from stern to bow x y plane on the undisturbed water surface z axis pointing upwards and passing through the equilibrium position of the gravity center of the structure by introducing the principal coordinates q r t r 1 2 m the displacement u x y z of the structure is expressed as the aggregation of the principal modes u r x r y r z r r 1 2 m

generalized modal inertial modal damping and modal stiffness of the dry structure q and ξ 1 are the principal coordinate vector and the first order linear generalized wave exciting force vector respectively a b and c are the matrices of generalized hydrodynamic inertia damping and restoring coefficients respectively by assuming water to be ideal fluid with no viscosity and its motion is irrotational the fluid motion can be represented by a velocity potential φ x y z t the steady state harmonic potential is expressed as 3 φ x y z t re φ x y z e i ω t where ω is circular frequency t is the time and i the imaginary unit the total potential is the summary of incident potential φ i diffraction potential φ d and radiation potential φ r the boundary conditions for solving the rth

the depth varying seabed r is the radiation radius of out propagating waves the boundary condition of the diffraction potential φ d x y z is the same as radiation case except the boundary condition on the wetted surface which is 5 φ d n s 0 φ i n the green function method is usually adopted in the solution of diffraction and radiation problems for satisfying the boundary condition of free surface

numerical method for solving the green function was investigated by yang et al 2014 which proposed a new gauss laguerre integral expression 2 2 rmfc model each module has 6 degrees of freedom in the

k u 5 k u 6 k t where u 1 k u 6 k are 6 degrees of freedom of the kth module a linear and zero length spring are used to model the connectors and the spring restricts relative translations but allows

matrix can be obtained by the assembly of stiffness matrixes between adjacent modules to build the rmfc model of three module vlfs the bush elements were used between two adjacent modules to simulate the stiffness of connectors in this paper 10 different values as shown in table 1 will be chosen in the calculation to study the influence of connector stiffness in this analysis the three components of rotational stiffness k θx k θy and k θz of the connectors were assumed zero 3 design of connectors for a multi module vlfs as shown in fig 1 connectors between two adjacent modules have great influence on the global responses of the vlfs in waves and usually suffer the largest internal loads that may result in damage in severe wave conditions to evaluate the fluid structure interactions of a multi module vlfs in waves and to assess the safety of the connectors the influence of connector stiffness of a 3 module vlfs was firstly studied each module of the vlfs consists of five transverse pontoons ten columns and eight longitudinal braces 10sets of combinations of connector stiffness components in three directions k x k y and k z are given in the table 1 represented by k4 k13 were examined for the 3 module vlfs in irregular waves described by a jonswap spectrum with h s 8 0 m and t p 9 0s in different wave directions in case all the connectors are of the stiffness k9 k x 2 109 n m k y 1 109n m and k z 2 109n m the maximum connector forces of the vlfs appear at the connector c1 and their variations with regard to the wave angle are shown in fig 2 a evidently all connector forces achieve peak values at the wave angles around 84 while become much smaller at the wave angle of 90 riggs et al 2000 observed the same phenomenon in the research of vlfs comparing these peak values the influence of different combinations of connector stiffness components k4 k13 on the maximum connector forces of the vlfs in waves of h s 8 0 m and t p 9 0s is exhibited in fig 2 b it indicates that in the wave condition of h s 8 0 m and t p 9 0s the vlfs of the connector stiffness k9 produces much higher connector force fx in x direction than other connector stiffness combinations fig 3 a shows the wave spectrum the transfer functions of fx for the vlfs of different connector stiffness k6 and k9 shown in fig 3 b and 3 c exhibit peaks at frequencies 0 3 and 0 8 rad s respectively the former is far away from the wave energy range the latter is actually the resonant frequency of the horizontal bending mode of the vlfs in water fig 3 d which is just close to the peak frequency of the wave spectrum this explains the large difference of the maximum connector forces caused by different designs of the connector stiffness of k9 and k6 similarly in case of connector stiffness k8 the resonant frequency of the torque mode falls into the wave energy range and produces very high vertical connector force fz in this wave condition in the whole vlfs system the connectors are only small parts design of the connectors should avoid the resonant frequencies of the vlfs in water close to the wave frequency range in order to investigate the potentially dangerous connector loads the connector stiffness k9 k x k z 2 109 n m and k y 1 109 n m will be used in the model tests 3 1 comparative analysis of experimental and prediction results the model tests of the 3 module semi submersible type vlfs with a scale ratio of λ 100 1 was tested in the state key laboratory of coastal and offshore engineering of dalian university of technology fig 4 the principal particulars of the vlfs are listed in table 2 the complicated seabed topography and wave environment in the area around the model was simulated in the wave according to the measured seabed topography near an island ding et al 2017 as shown in fig 5 the model was tested in regular and irregular wave conditions with different wave frequencies and three wave angles 0 43 and 88 the dynamic responses of the modules and the connector forces were measured each connector model includes 2 l shape mounting plates 5 springs with spherical hinges at the both ends as shown in fig 6 the stiffness of spring was designed and manufactured according to the law of similitude of the connector stiffness 16 k prototype k model λ 2 therefore the coefficients of model connector stiffness were k x m k z m 2 10 5 n m and k y m 1 10 5 n m corresponding to the prototype connector stiffness k9 in fig 2 k x k z 2 109 n m and k y 1 109 n m 3 2 results in regular waves the transfer function response amplitude operator rao of connector loads were obtained in the regular waves all results in this paper have been translated into the prototype to clearly show the real responses of the connector the measured connector force fx at the connectors c1 c4 are shown in the fig 7 a in fig 7 b the measured raos of fx fy and fz at the connector c1 in wave direction of 43 are compared it can be found that the raos of fx of the four connectors have the same tendency and the longitudinal connector force fx is larger than other components fy and fz the similar tendency also appears in wave directions 0 and 88 fig 8 shows the raos of connector forces at c1 in three wave directions evidently the connector force in y direction is much smaller than the other two directions in the wave frequency range lower than 0 5 rad s λ l 0 82 all connector forces at c1 are much larger in wave direction of 43 than in other wave directions when the wave frequency is greater than 0 45 rad s wave length λ l 3 1lb the connector force fz is larger in wave direction of 88 than in other wave directions in waves of frequencies ω 0 6 0 7 rad s λ l 2 1 5lb all connector forces are always larger in beam sea than in other incoming wave directions based on the rmfc theory the transfer functions of connector loads can be obtained by the mode superposition method taking into account the symmetry only the results of c1 connector loads are compared in this paper when this model is used in the analysis of hydroelastic responses of a vlfs deployed near seashore the software thafts cssrc 2011 may be employed with the seabed modeled as a fixed boundary the hydrodynamic model of uneven seabed and vlfs model is shown in fig 9 fig 10 shows the compared results of numerical predictions and model tests as can be seen from the figure the general variations and values between the numerical predictions and model tests are in good agreement the numerical prediction results under wave direction of 90 are also given in the fig 10 and the results of connector loads are significantly small it can be inferred that the maximum value of connector loads will occur at 45 to 90 wave directions and this conclusion is also given in the literature which will be discussed in more detail later in order to investigate how the uneven bathymetry affects the hydrodynamics loads the wave propagation near the island are also given in the fig 11 the wave factors of h 3 0 m t 11 6s are used as the far field incident wave the wave heights wave periods and wave directions at the center points m1 m3 of three module vlfs under this typical regular wave condition are given in the table 3 it can be found that the waves at different positions of three module vlfs appear obvious inhomogeneous because of the uneven bathymetry the inhomogeneous encounter wave may make the distribution of hydrodynamic loads acting on the three modules the responses of the modules and the connector loads between two adjacent modules rather complicated 3 3 results in irregular waves response time curves of different test parameters under various sea conditions are obtained through irregular wave tests the time of each irregular wave test condition will be not less than 1 h corresponding to the actual sea condition so as to ensure enough samples for statistical analysis the irregular sea states are described by the jonswaps wave spectra 17 s ω α g 2 ω 5 exp 5 4 ω ω p 4 γ exp 0 5 ω ω p σ ω p 2 where α 5 16 h s 2 ω p 4 g 2 1 0 287 ln γ is the generalized philip constant σ is the spectral width parameter and γ 2 0 is the spectral peak parameter the wave elevation and connector loads in different wave directions are plotted in fig 12 similar to the results in regular waves the values of fx and fz are close and much bigger than fy the test results of connector loads are fitted by weibull distribution function and the results of wave induced loads wl and combined loads cl wave frequency and high frequency components are basically in accordance with the weibull distribution law fig 13 the formula of probability density function of weibull distribution is 18 f x b a b x b 1 e x a b where a and b are two parameters of weibull distribution respectively the extreme load γ n can be expressed according to ochi method ochi 1973 19 γ n 2 ln n α m 0 where α is assurance rate n is the number of samples and m 0 is 0 th order spectral moment table 4 shows the extreme value inferences based on the weibull and ochi method the results inferred by ochi method are slightly bigger than the values by weibull method the total extreme load in x direction of c1 connector is more than 50 thousand tons under this wave condition the significant c1 connector loads for all sea states and wave angles are compared in fig 14 the model test results of the wave condition of h s 8 05 m t p 9 1s are also given in these figures and the variation trend of the results with sea states and wave angles is very similar similar to the result in regular waves the maximum significant x direction force is larger than the other forces the results also reach a maximum at approximate 84 85 wave angle and these results are consistent with other studies riggs et al 2000 4 conclusions the connector loads of a three modules vlfs in variable seabed bathymetry are investigated by numerical methods and model tests some important conclusions are as follows 1 the x connector force is larger than the other forces thus close attention should be paid to the longitudinal loads in connector design 2 compared with experimental results the prediction results show that the numerical method presented in this paper is effective and applicable especially useful for preliminary and conceptual design of vlfs and its connectors 3 the maximum connector loads occur at the wave direction of 84 85 it is suggested that the vlfs should be equipped with a dynamic positioning system to keep the wave angle far away from 85 the best range of wave angle is from 0 to 50 according to experimental and numerical results 4 even though the trend is the same certain disparity exists between the experimental and numerical results

22239,sailing attitude would experience many changes when ship entering shallow water due to the hydrodynamic interaction between ship hull and seabed or riverbed which can be expressed in a significant increase in resistance sinkage and trim and can engender the safety of ships a numerical model of ship maneuvering motion that takes account of the shallow water effect is proposed based on the maneuvering mathematical modeling group mmg model flow field data solved based on a numerical model of non uniform flow serves as the basis for calculating hydrodynamic forces of the ship model simulations of straightforward turning and zig zag motions are performed on a cargo ship using various empirical methods and the fourth order runge kutta method ship trajectories for varying depth draft ratio rudder angle and flow velocity are compared indicating that shallow water effect would increase ship sailing resistance and decrease maneuverability result shows that ship maneuverability would be reduced as the depth draft ratio decrease when ship sailing in shallow water application of the model in a typical mountainous river reveals that the model can reasonably simulate the shallow

uniform flow due to irregular boundaries traditionally the river flow was treated as uniform flow to simplify the calculations of hydrodynamic forces on ship maneuverability however influence of simple non uniform flow is usually determined via a generalized method namely making assumptions about the flow field of the reach this method can simplify calculations and improve computational efficiency of the simulation which is suitable for still water areas or areas in which the flow is highly uniform adverse navigation flow conditions are common phenomena for inland and mountainous waterways including flow velocity flow direction and water flow surface slope etc uniform flow or generalized non uniform flow methods are typically implemented however it is difficult to reflect the characteristics and influence of non uniform flow on ship maneuverability in the actual river due to over simplified flow patterns with the rapid development of shipping industry it is a competitive alternative transport mode for passengers and cargo especially at much lower costs than via the other transport modes a clear international tendency of increase in ship number can be observed due to the growing demand for ships to transport various products debaillon 2010 meng and wan 2016 so the risk of navigating of ships in shallow water tends to increase in mountainous waterways the most important factor affects the navigation is the restriction of water depth the change in water depth leads to a strong interaction between the ship and the waterway bed note that d is the ship draft and h is the water depth of waterway the effects of water depth on the ship maneuverability shallow water effects on sailing ships are known to increase significantly starting at a range of depth to draft ratio between 1 5 h d 3 razgallah et al 2018 insufficient water depth is a common occurrence and easy to engender the shallow water effect in inland waterways and especially in mountainous rivers thus difficulties and hazards associated with ship handling in mountainous waterways are increasing because of the shallow water depth maimun et al 2013 when entering shallow water a number of changes arise owing to the hydrodynamic interaction between the bottom of the ship hull and the riverbed in general the flow velocity between the bottom of the ship hull and the riverbed increases which are expressed in a pronounced increase in sinkage trim and resistance tezdogan et al 2015b terziev et al 2018 as the ship travels forward it may lead to the squat sometimes resulting in undesirable grounding du et al 2018 ship behaviors in shallow water are closely related to safe navigation attracting much attention a series of studies of the ship behaviors in shallow water have been carried out worldwide zou and larsson 2013 he et al 2016 currently numerical methods are more prone to simulate ship behaviors in shallow water delefortrie and vantorre 2007 simulated the maneuvering behavior of container carriers in shallow water and presented the empirical expressions for the water depth dependence of mathematical models suited for the simulation of ship maneuvers based on the linear slender body assumption gourlay 2008 developed linear slender body numerical methods to predict the sinkage and trim of ship sailing in shallow water tezdogan et al 2015a fully adopted the nonlinear unsteady rans simulation to predict the squat and resistance of a model scale duisburg test case container ship petru 2017 conducted the cfd simulations for the purpose of observing the effects of limited water depth on sailing ship hull in two domains one with a depth of 20 35 m and the other with a depth 6 85 m and results implied that the effects related mainly to change in pressure velocity forces and torques acting on the ship hull besides there are also studies on the effect of shallow water on parameters related to hull design for instance rotteveel et al 2017 investigated the effect that water depth has on the optimal choice of design parameters such as the athwart ship s propeller location the tunnel top curvature the flat of bottom shape in the stern region and the stern bilge radius the effect of shallow water on sailing ahead of ships have been studied well however there is still room for study on maneuverability of ships in shallow waters such as mountainous rivers and canals shallow water effect induces a series of adverse effects on the ship including reduced speed as a consequence of increased resistance reduced rudder effect and degraded turning performance pacuraru and domnisoru 2017 according to some researchers ships experience a drop in speed of up to 30 upon entering shallow waters tezdogan et al 2015b this value can rise up to 60 when operating in rivers or canals barrass 2012 such a dramatic speed reduction is directly attributable to the increase in resistance and the change in maneuvering characteristics creation of reliable mathematical models for ship maneuvering with due account for the shallow water effect is also very desirable as if such models are implemented in bridge simulators navigators and sailor can be better trained and prepared to complicated maneuvering phenomena sutulo et al 2010 from the viewpoint of ship navigation safety it is meaningful to simulate the maneuvering behavior of a ship in shallow water wei et al 2017 which contributes to making reasonable decisions such as the regulation of ship speed and navigation direction in the shallow water as well as estimating the safe ship speed in advance in the study the numerical model of non uniform flow is developed and flow field calculated by the model is applied to solve the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship in addition a widely used numerical model known as the maneuvering mathematical group mmg is proposed the mmg model is also known as a modular model is one of the solutions for ship maneuvering motion simulations developed in japan lin jia et al 2013 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 reichel 2017 then a new ship maneuvering numerical model that takes account of the shallow water effect is developed as based on the deep water model by correcting the hydrodynamic derivatives numerical simulations of straightforward turning and zig zag motions are conducted on a cargo ship and ship trajectories in shallow water for varying the depth draft ratio rudder angle and flow velocity are compared flow fields for two rapids of the lancang river are simulated aiming to providing the necessary flow field data for the maneuvering simulation of the ship in the actual river the main objective of the research is to investigate the effect of shallow water on the ship maneuverability and the simulated results for the ship in the actual rivers will offer guidance on ship maneuvering in shallow waterways to guarantee safe navigation 2 numerical model of non uniform flow 2 1 basic equations and numerical computation basic equations of the numerical model of non uniform flow contain continuity equation and momentum equations in the cartesian coordinates system basic equations are expressed as

fluctuating river bank the body fitted curvilinear coordinate system has been widely used for calculating the flow around arbitrary complex bodies thus which was employed for this study typically the conversion equations in the body fitted curvilinear coordinate system are given by the following equation 4 α 2 x ξ 2 γ 2 x η 2 j 2 p x ξ q x η 0 α 2 y ξ 2 γ 2 y η 2 j 2 p y ξ q y η 0 in eq 4 p and q

coordinate system are solved through the simplec algorithm doormaal and raithby 1984 firstly the relevant coefficients of coordinate transformation are calculated as well as the computation of initial water depth of the whole study reach based on the upper and lower boundary conditions velocity in the direction of the two curvilinear coordinates is solved based on momentum equations water depth of the study reach is calculated and modified along with the velocity finally the above steps are repeated until solving convergence except the computation of coefficients of coordinate transformation in the process of differential discretization and the solution of basic equations the staggered grid method is adopted for the purpose of overcoming the difficulty of discretizing the pressure gradient term and continuity equation besides sub relaxation technique is used aiming to promote the convergence of the non linear iteration the tridiagonal matrix algorithm tdma is applied to the solution of difference equations the basis for convergence is that the error of continuous equation is less than the given value 2 2 validation of the numerical model of non uniform flow measured data of the water level z and flow velocity v f in a small reach of the lancang river are selected to validate the reliability of the numerical model of non uniform flow the average measured flow discharge at the reach on may 15 2016 was approximately 1635 m3 s 1 which was selected as the computational flow discharge to validate z and v f the reach for the validation of z is below the jinghong dam till the end of the no 243 boundary stele about 76 km and grids used to discretize were curvilinear grids the study reach includes about 40000 grids and average length and width of the grid are about 19 m and 15 m respectively river width at the validated reach changes greatly and the width of the local position is less than 100 m in the dry season while more than 100 m in the flood season the jinghong dam is located about 5 km north of jinghong city yunnan province china and it is the sixth of eight cascade power stations in the lower reaches of the lancang river the no 243 boundary stele is located at the entrance of the lancang river into myanmar cross sections for the validation of v f are located at the dafanshui and xiuhua rapids and computational grids of two rapids are presented in fig 1 dafanshui and xiuhua rapids are located at 70 3 km and 68 3 km downstream of the jinghong dam respectively results are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively l b is the distance from the no 243 boundary stele and l w is the distance of cross section in the direction of river width computed values are in good agreement with the measured data indicating that the numerical model of non uniform simulates the flow motion well 3 numerical model of ship maneuvering in deep and open water 3 1 coordinate systems fig 4 shows the coordinate systems implemented in this study the spatial fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 where the x 0 y 0 plane coincides with the still water surface and the z 0 axis points vertically downward and the moving ship fixed coordinate system o x y z where o is taken at the midship of the ship and the x y and z axes point toward the bow of the ship starboard and vertically downward respectively the heading angle ψ is defined as the angle between x 0 and x axes δ is the rudder angle and r is the yaw rate additionally u m and v m denote the ship speed components in the directions of x and y respectively the drift angle at midship position β is defined as β tan 1 v m u m and the total velocity u is defined as u u m 2 v m 2 3 2 still and deep water motion equations modeling the actual motion of a ship with six degrees of freedom is very complicated generally the maneuvering motions of a ship in still and deep water are represented in terms of the surge sway and yaw need to be considered while the roll pitch or trim and heave motion can be ignored from a practical point of view the motion equations are expressed as 9 m m x u m m m y v m r x h x r x p m m y v m m m x u m r y h y r y p i z g j z r n h n r n p subscripts h p and r mean the hull propeller and rudder respectively the lateral force component and moment are neglected here because their values are relatively small consequently these two parameters are thus incorporated into the propeller influenced hull force calculation in the mmg based model y p and n p are expressed as follows 10 y p 0 n p 0 3 2 1 hydrodynamic forces acting on ship hull surge force x h lateral force y h yaw moment n h around midship acting on ship hull are expressed as follows 11 x h 1 2 ρ l d u 2 x h y h 1 2 ρ l d u 2 y h n h 1 2 ρ l 2 d u 2 n h where v m represents the non dimensionalized lateral velocity defined as v m u and r is the non dimensionalized yaw rate defined as r l u based on the resistance theory of the cross flow calculation formulas of x h y h and n h was put forward by inoue et al 1981 and can be expressed as follows 12 x h x u m x v m v m v m 2 x v m r v m r x r r r 2 y h y v m v m y r r y v m v m v m v m y v m r r v m y r r r r n h n v m v m n r r n v m v m v m v m n v

provides detail calculation methods of the hydrodynamic derivatives 3 2 2 propeller induced hydrodynamic force in the mmg model surge force due to propeller x p can be expressed as follows 13 x p 1 t p t for simplicity the thrust deduction coefficient t p is assumed to be constant for a given propeller load propeller thrust t is written as 14 t ρ n p 2 d p 4 k t j p the thrust coefficient k t can be derived by 2nd order polynomial fitting as follows 15 k t j p k 2 j p 2 k 1 j p k 0 the advanced ration j p is defined as follows 16 j p u m 1 w p n p d p where n p and d p are the revolution speed and diameter of the propeller respectively w p is the wake fraction changing with maneuvering motions in general several formulae for w p have been summarized by yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 in this study the following formula is used 17 w p w p 0 exp 8 β p 2 where w p 0 is the wake fraction when the ship is advancing straightforward and β p is the geometrical inflow angle to the propeller which can be expressed as follows 18 β p β x p r here x p denotes the non dimensional longitudinal coordinate of propeller position in the expression of x p the steering effect on the propeller thrust is excluded instead this effect is taken into account via the rudder force component as is described in the next section 3 2 3 hydrodynamic forces induced by steering effective rudder forces x r y r and n r are expressed as 19 x r 1 t r f n sin δ y r 1 a h f n cos δ n r x r a h x h f n cos δ where f n is normal force on the rudder note that tangential force on the rudder is neglected in eq 19 t r a h and x h are the coefficients that primarily represent the hydrodynamic interactions between the ship hull and rudder the t r is the steering resistance deduction coefficient as it defines the deduction coefficient of rudder resistance versus f n sin δ which is the longitudinal component of f n it should be noted that x r includes a component of the propeller thrust change owing to steering as mentioned in subsection 3 2 2 therefore t r is a coefficient of both the rudder resistance deduction and the propeller thrust increase induced by steering the underlying reason that steering induced propeller thrust increase occurs as a result of an increase of the nominal wake at the propeller position is not clear at present however it is suggested that the tangential force component on the rudder neglected in eq 20 may involve in t r the a h and x h are the rudder force increase factor and the position of an additional lateral force component respectively the a h represents the factor of steering induced lateral force acting on the ship hull versus f n cos δ which is the lateral component of f n the x h means the longitudinal acting point of the additional lateral force component the measured value of x h was about 0 45 l and the additional lateral force was found to act on the stern portion of the hull the phenomena may be understood by considering the hydrodynamic interaction of a wing with a flap the ship hull and rudder are regarded as the main wing and the flap respectively as is shown in fig 5 the lift force lateral force in this case is induced on the rudder by steering while an additional force component δ y in fig 5 is induced on the ship hull δ y is a product of the hydrodynamic interaction between the hull main wing and rudder flap then a h is defined by δ y f n cos δ and x h can be regarded as the acting point of δ y eq 19 is not theoretically derived 1 t r is given by the regression analysis xin le et al 1999 as follows 20 1 t r 0 7382 0 0539 c b 0 1755 c b 2 the normal force f n of the rudder is expressed as follows 21 f n 1 2 ρ a r u r 2 f α sin α r where f α is the rudder lift gradient coefficient which can be estimated by using fujii s formula and is commonly applied as follows 22 f α 6 13 λ r λ r 2 25 here λ r represents the aspect ratio of the rudder the resultant inflow velocity to rudder u r is expressed as follows 23 u r u 2 1 w r 2 1 k g s in eq 23 w r is obtained via the following formula w r w r 0 w p w p 0 where the magnitude of w r 0 is approximated as 0 25 and k is obtained via the following formula xin le et al 1999 k 1 065 δ 0 0 935 δ 0 the effective inflow angle to the rudder α r can be calculated via the following formula 24 α r δ γ r β r in eq 24 β r β 2 x r r where x r 0 5 3 3 motion equations for deep water flow motion when a ship is sailing in flowing water v f is the absolute flow velocity of the ship s position and can be calculated mainly including two steps firstly coordinates of the ship are searched in flow field by the basic function in finite element method and then v f is obtained by interpolating the flow velocity at four nodes of the grid ψ f is the flow direction in the spatial fixed coordinate system u c x and u c y denote the absolute flow velocity components in the directions of x and y respectively u c x and u c y are expressed as 25 u c x v f cos ψ f ψ u c y v f sin ψ f

derivatives will not be difficult to solve but analytical solutions will hardly be obtained runge kutta method has been very much common tool to get numerical solutions thus in this study the fourth order runge kutta method is adopted to solve the ship maneuvering motion equations variables of the ship maneuvering motion equations are u x u y and r given that the initial condition is expressed as u x u x 0 u y u y 0 r r 0 eq 28 is modified as follows 29 u x x m m y u y r m x m y v f r sin ψ f ψ m m x u y y m m x u x r m x m y v f r cos ψ f ψ m m y r n i z g j z assuming eq 29 can be rewritten

numerical model of ship maneuvering validation of the numerical model is performed on a cargo ship baoshou21 sailing in the lancang river and main parameters of the baoshou21 are presented in table 1 propulsive performance and turning ability of the baoshou21 are evaluated by implementing its specifications and parameters in the numerical model of ship maneuvering motion the test environment is an imaginary and unlimitedly wide water area not the actual channel and has uniform water depth water depth of verification tests is 2 5 times designed draft namely h 2 5d and test time of propulsive performance and turning ability are 50 s and 100 s respectively the results are shown in fig 6 the verification of propulsive performance aims to check whether the designed speed of the ship is reasonable or not and the ship trajectory in the still water is a straight line or not from the sailing distance within 50s and the ship trajectory in fig 6 a it can be seen that the speed and trajectory predictions are reasonable from previous researches xiu heng and wu 1998 xin le et al 1999 turning diameter d of the inland cargo ship with better turning ability is 1 5 3 5 times the ship length l namely d 1 5l 3 5l fig 6 b shows that the simulation result is consistent with the previous research considering this it is reasonable to implement the ship maneuvering numerical model proposed in this article to calculate the propulsive performance and turning ability of the representative ship baoshou 21 another ship huapinghao sailing in the lancang river was selected as the representative ship for the zig zag motion verification test because the baoshou 21 did not conduct the zig zag motion verification testing some important parameters of the huapinghao are presented in table 2 the test water area of zig zag motion is selected in the ganlan dam water area of the lancang river the ganlan dam water area with slow flow velocity and the width ranges from 170 m to 250 m water surface is gentle and longitudinal slope is about 0 4 water depth is approximately 10 m about six times the designed draft depth of the ship generally speaking the flow velocity width and longitudinal slope of the water area meet the requirements of zig zag motion test fig 7 shows the time history curves for the rudder and heading angles during 10 10 zig zag motion verification testing for load and rotational speed ratios of 90 each k and t are the turning ability index and steering quality index respectively as is shown in table 3 the computed values of k and t are in good agreement with the measured values in practice in such the river therefore it is reasonable to utilize the ship maneuvering numerical model proposed in this article to perform numerical simulations of zig zag motion 4 numerical model of ship maneuvering motion in shallow water incorporating the shallow water effect into the numerical model of ship maneuvering motion is primarily achieved by correcting the hydrodynamic derivatives of the model in deep water consequently the motion equation is unaltered from eq 9 but values of the relevant coefficients are different 4 1 added mass and added moment of inertia currently there are three methods for calculating added mass and added moment of inertia including slender body theory method singularity distribution method and the finite element method slender body theory method belongs to two dimensional calculations although the proposed method is simple there are noticeable error between the experimental and simulation results singularity distribution method and the finite element method are both three dimensional fluid dynamics methods however the computational process is exceedingly complex in summary for the purpose of improving the accuracy of calculation and simplifying calculation added mass and added inertia moment are calculated via a regression formula mei qing 1988 the regression formula is derived from large numbers of experimental data which are expressed as 33 m x h m x h d 1 1 3 3 77 1 14 b d 0 233 l d 3 43 c b h d 1 1 3 m y h m y h d 1 0 82 0 413 0 0320 b d 0 0129 b d 2 h d 1 0 82 j z z h j z z h d 1

modifying the total resistance coefficient and the added resistance of straightforward motion wei min et al 1982 the total resistance coefficient in shallow water is corrected as 34 c t h c t a b h d where c t h and c t are the total resistance coefficients of the straightforward motion in shallow and deep water respectively and a and b are empirical coefficients obtained by the numerous ship model tests the added resistance formula xin le et al 1999 is expressed as 35 x v m r h x v m r 1 0 9879 d h 21 9123 d h 2 73 8161 d h 3 71 1409 d h 4 4 3 lateral hydrodynamic force and moment acting on the ship hull if ship hull is supposed as a wing l is equivalent to the wing s chord and 2d is treated as the wing s span as is shown in fig 8 thus the aspect ratio λ is the ratio of its span to its mean chord then taking 2d as the wing s span aims to eliminate the influence of a free surface the aspect ratio is expressed as λ 2 d l and the effective aspect ratio is defined as follows λ e λ d 2 h λ π d 2 h cot π d 2 h q the lateral hydrodynamic force and dynamic moment acting on the ship in shallow water can be decomposed into the linear and nonlinear components hirano 1985 the formula for calculating the linear hydrodynamic derivatives is expressed as 36 y v m h π 2 λ e 1 4 c b b l q 2 3 y r h π 4 λ e q 0 7 n v m h λ e q 1 7 n r h 0 54 λ e λ e 2 q 0 7 here q is a constant and it is determined via numerous captive model tests the formula of the nonlinear hydrodynamic derivatives inoue et al 1981 is expressed as 37 y v m v m h y v m v m 1 14 d h 3 5 y r r h y r r 1 3 d h 2 5 y v m

induced thrust and moment as the ship travels through shallow water is carried out by correcting the deep water thrust deduction factor t p and the wake fraction ω p to those in shallow water xin le et al 1999 corrected the thrust deduction coefficient t p as the following formula 38 1 t p h 1 t p 1 1 0 2 d h 0 7295 d h 2 and the wake fraction ω p is corrected as 39 1 ω p h 1 ω p cos 1 4 c b d h 4 5 rudder force and moment the steering resistance deduction factor t r in shallow water can adopt the value in deep water whereas the moment in shallow water is obtained by correcting the flow straightening coefficient γ r of the ship hull and propeller in deep water xin le and yan sheng 1999 40 γ r h γ r 1 0 0161 d h 4 4222 d h 2 4 9825 d h 3 4 6 navigation resistance navigation resistance is assumed to be made up of two independent components of resistance during the upward sailing which can be expressed as r r v r j r r v and r j are navigation resistance flow resistance and slope resistance respectively flow resistance is divided into frictional resistance r f and residual resistance r r the former is mainly related to the reynolds number while the latter is related to the froude number namely r v r f r e r r f r some scholars have carried out a detailed study on the calculation of navigation resistance and the famous эиванков method was proposed guan lun 2004 relevant parameters in the эиванков formula were obtained by combining results of the actual ship tests and the ship model tests such as the friction coefficient the reduction coefficient of ship cross section and so on the baoshou 21 belongs to the power driven ship and its flow resistance is calculated by the following formula 41 r v f 1 a s v s 1 83 ξ 1 c b a m v s 1 7 4 f r in eq 41 s a s l w c 1 d c b b v s 1 15 1 3 v c p v a ξ 1 17 7 c b 2 5 l w 6 b 3 2 a m β c b d f r v s g l w here f 1 is friction coefficient of the power driven ship and the baosou 21 is the steel ship so f 1 0 17 a s is the wetted surface area of ship l w is the waterline length of ship c 1 is the coefficient for the power driven c 1 1 8 b is the ship width v s is the ship sailing speed which is modified due to taking account for the influence of shallow water and narrow channel v c p is the longitudinal surface mean flow velocity v a is the minimum sailing speed required for a ship to sail upward successfully under the action of resistance and v a 0 3 0 5 m s 1 ξ 1 is the coefficient of residual resistance a m is the area of midship section of ship wetted section β c is the reduction coefficient of ship cross section for the power driven β c 0 93 f r is the froude number slope resistance is expressed as 42 r j α w j w is the tons of water that a ship displaces when it is fully loaded and j is the mean water surface gradient α is the correction coefficient for the local increase of water surface gradient α 1 1 1 2 4 7 shallow water ship maneuvering motion simulation as previously mentioned the cargo ship baoshou21 is implemented as the representative ship in a series of simulations i e straightforward motion turning motion and zig zag motion a series of simulations for varying depth draft ratios rudder angles and flow velocity aim to reveal the ship maneuverability in shallow water it should be noted that these simulations are carried out in an imaginary and unrestricted water area not the actual river and designed speed of the representative ship is treated as the initial sailing speed in the calculation of these tests besides it is not necessary to add the flow velocity for straightforward and zig zag motion simulations and whether to add the flow velocity in turning motion simulation depends on the specific situation 4 8 straightforward motion fig 9 illustrates the straightforward motion ship trajectories for the same sailing time t 50 s the same rudder angel δ 0 and various depth draft ratios h d 1 5 2 0 3 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 and l s is the sailing distance fig 10 clearly reflects the relation between l s and h d when the ship is traveling in shallow water h d 3 0 as the h decreases the resistance rapidly increases as compared to deep water travel this results in a significantly shorter l s l s tends to increase as the increase of h d however l s increases slowly when ship enters deep water h d 3 0 in this case even if h d increases continually there is no obvious increase in l s and tends to be stable this finding demonstrates the significance of the shallow water effect because as resistance gradually decreases in deep water the effect of water depth on l s is greatly weakened 4 9 turning motion in order to verify the applicability of the proposed numerical model in turning motion of the actual ship we conducted a turning test for the actual ship huapinghao in the turning test and the numerical simulation in shallow water water depth is 2 5 times the designed draft of the huapinghao the turning test is conducted in the ganlan dam water area of the lancang river the conditions of numerical simulation are that initial heading angle and rudder angle are 0 and the fixed rudder angle for ship turning motion is 25 fig 11 shows the comparison of turning diameters of the actual ship and the model in shallow and deep water obviously simulated trajectories are in good accordance with tested trajectories of the actual ship indicating that the proposed numerical model based on the shallow water effect can apply to the simulation of the turning motion of the actual ship fig 12 shows a comparison of calculated turning trajectories for various depth draft ratios h d 1 5 2 0 3 0 the results are obtained under the conditions that the flow velocity at the initial position of the ship the initial heading angle and the rudder angle are equal to zero in addition the fixed rudder angles for ship turning motion are 15 right and 15 left the turning diameter can be seen to increase as the water depth decreases this is because the damping moment is increased when the ship is turning and yields a smaller yaw rate and drift angle in deep water this smaller drift angle causes the turning speed to decrease the above two factors result in a relatively increased turning diameter in shallow water which is unfavorable for ship maneuverability in shallow waterways fig 13 shows the simulated turning trajectory results for various rudder angles δ 10 15 20 25 and a fixed depth draft ratio h d 2 0 the results are obtained under the conditions that the flow velocity at the initial position of the ship the initial heading angle and the rudder angle are equal to zero the larger rudder angle causes the turning diameter to decrease when the depth draft ratio remains constant the simulation results roughly agree with those obtained for deep water travel fig 14 compares the calculated turning trajectories for various flow velocities v w 0 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 m s 1 and a fixed depth draft ratio h d 2 0 the results were obtained under the following conditions initial heading angle and rudder angle are 0 and a fixed rudder angle of ship turning motion is 15 the ship is turning and deflecting towards the direction of the flow when flow velocity exists the results show that ship turning becomes increasingly abnormal as the flow velocity increases with a complete circle becoming an arc with a smaller radius at higher flow velocities the proposed numerical model of ship maneuvering motion which is based on non uniform flow and regression formulae on shallow water effect is applied to a study on waterway regulation of the dafanshui rapids and the xiuhua rapids in the lancang river the dafanshui rapids was narrow and the channel width was about 60 m in the dry season the channel width of the xiuhua rapids was narrowed to 40 m due to the constructions of dikes based on the navigation standard of inland waterway of china gang et al 2014 the restricted waterway refers to the waterway producing obvious restriction for the navigation due to narrow water surface and small coefficient of cross section c c evaluation index of the restricted waterway is c c in general if c c 10 the waterway is not the restricted waterway in addition cross section coefficient of restricted waterway should be 6 c c 10 c c can be calculated by the following formula 43 c c a c a m a c is the flow area of cross section of the waterway a m is area of midship section of ship wetted section and a m β c b d β c 0 93 b is the ship width and d is the designed draft for the baoshou 21 a m 0 93 8 3 1 95 15 05 m2 when the water levels of two rapids are the most unfavorable for ship navigation for dafanshui rapids a c is about 396 m2 c c 396 15 05 26 31 10 for xiuhua rapids a c is about 168 m2 c c 168 15 05 11 16 10 therefore the two study rapids do not belong to the restricted waterway the case study simulation is completed in three general steps at the first step flow fields of the two rapids are calculated via the 2d flow numerical model proposed in the paper and then both of deep and shallow water simulations of ship maneuvering motion are performed by incorporating flow field data into the calculations based on the proposed numerical model at the final step a comparison of ship trajectories in the deep and shallow water is performed to analyze the influence of reduced water depth on ship navigation resistance in the case of the baoshou 21 since the minimum flow discharge of the jinghong power station should be controlled at 800 1000 m3 s 1 to ensure the lowest navigable water level that would guarantee safe navigation of the fourth grade waterway the lowest water depth of the fourth grade waterway is generally from 1 6 m to 1 9 m 800 m3 s 1 serves as the most adverse flow condition which is selected as the computational flow discharge for the purpose of ensuring safe navigation in this study the initial speed required in the simulation is 5 45 m s 1 and the heading angles are 73 and 111 respectively for deep and shallow water note that the same rudder angle is implemented for the same rapids in deep and shallow water the trajectories of ship motion in deep and shallow water are shown in fig 15 the flow velocity between the bottom of the ship and the riverbed is not only related the total bottom area of the ship but also closely related to the water depth when the ship is sailing in shallow water the flow is divided and pushed along the two sides of the ship leading to the increase of velocities along these two sides furthermore the increased viscous resistance results in reduced travel distance in shallow water this is also related to the flow field because when the flow velocity is large the viscous resistance is also large thereby hindering forward movement 4 10 zig zag motion fig 16 shows the results of simulating 20 20 zig zag motion trajectories with various depth draft ratios h d 1 5 3 0 it can be seen that a smaller depth draft ratio corresponds to a larger swing and period of zig zag motion this indicates that under the influence of the shallow water effect ship resistance increases and ship maneuverability decreases time history curves for the rudder and heading angles during shallow and deep water travel are shown in fig 17 results show that the duration of zig zag motion occurring in shallow water is longer than that occurring in deep water this means that maneuverability is reduced in shallow water because of the lower water depth 5 conclusions in this study with the aim of investigating the ship maneuverability in shallow water a numerical model of ship maneuvering motion that takes account of the shallow water effect is proposed based on the mmg model the flow field data solved based on a numerical model of non uniform flow are taken as the basis for calculating hydrodynamic forces of the ship model simulations of straightforward turning and zig zag motions in an unrestricted water area are performed on a cargo ship by using various empirical methods the fourth order runge kutta method and fortran programming language ship trajectories in shallow water for varying depth draft ratio rudder angle and flow velocity are compared indicating that shallow water caused ships to increase its sailing resistance and to decrease its maneuverability as the depth draft ratio decreases an increase in the duration of zig zag motion means that shallow water effect is pronounced and ship maneuverability is reduced besides the numerical result of turning motion is compared with the available experimental data and reasonable agreement is achieved the application of the ship model in an engineering case demonstrates it is reasonable to adopt the model considering the shallow water effect to simulate and guide maneuvering motions of the ship in mountainous river ship maneuverability in shallow water will undoubtedly attract further attention of scientists and engineers due to the rapid trend of enlargement in ship size in the world market however safety operations in inland waters particularly in mountainous rivers have yet completely insured study on ships in shallow waters should be continued to deepen the understanding of the phenomena including the effects of non uniform riverbed morphology confined shallow water inclined river bed wind waves and tidal waves and shallow water waves close to the

22239,sailing attitude would experience many changes when ship entering shallow water due to the hydrodynamic interaction between ship hull and seabed or riverbed which can be expressed in a significant increase in resistance sinkage and trim and can engender the safety of ships a numerical model of ship maneuvering motion that takes account of the shallow water effect is proposed based on the maneuvering mathematical modeling group mmg model flow field data solved based on a numerical model of non uniform flow serves as the basis for calculating hydrodynamic forces of the ship model

uniform flow due to irregular boundaries traditionally the river flow was treated as uniform flow to simplify the calculations of hydrodynamic forces on ship maneuverability however influence of simple non uniform flow is usually determined via a generalized method namely making assumptions about the flow field of the reach this method can simplify calculations and improve computational efficiency of the simulation which is suitable for still water areas or areas in which the flow is highly uniform adverse navigation flow conditions are common phenomena for inland and mountainous waterways including flow velocity flow direction and water flow surface slope etc uniform flow or generalized non uniform flow methods are typically implemented however it is difficult to reflect the characteristics and influence of non uniform flow on ship maneuverability in the actual river due to over simplified flow patterns with the rapid development of shipping industry it is a competitive alternative transport mode for passengers and cargo especially at much lower costs than via the other transport modes a clear international tendency of increase in ship number can be observed due to the growing demand for ships to transport various products debaillon 2010 meng and wan 2016 so the risk of navigating of ships in shallow water tends to increase in mountainous waterways the most important factor affects the navigation is the restriction of water depth the change in water depth leads to a strong interaction between the ship and the waterway bed note that d is the ship draft and h is the water depth of waterway the effects of water depth on the ship maneuverability shallow water effects on sailing ships are known to increase significantly starting at a range of depth to draft ratio between 1 5 h d 3 razgallah et al 2018 insufficient water depth is a common occurrence and easy to engender the shallow water effect in inland waterways and especially in mountainous rivers thus difficulties and hazards associated with ship handling in mountainous waterways are increasing because of the shallow water depth maimun et al 2013 when entering shallow water a number of changes arise owing to the hydrodynamic interaction between the bottom of the ship hull and the riverbed in general the flow velocity between the bottom of the ship hull and the riverbed increases which are expressed in a pronounced increase in sinkage trim and resistance tezdogan et al 2015b terziev et al 2018 as the ship travels forward it may lead to the squat sometimes resulting in undesirable grounding du et al 2018 ship behaviors in shallow water are closely related to safe navigation attracting much attention a series of studies of the ship behaviors in shallow water have been carried out worldwide zou and larsson 2013 he et al 2016 currently numerical methods are more prone to simulate ship behaviors in shallow water delefortrie and vantorre 2007 simulated the maneuvering behavior of container carriers in shallow water and presented the empirical expressions for the water depth dependence of mathematical models suited for the simulation of ship maneuvers based on the linear slender body assumption gourlay 2008 developed linear slender body numerical methods to predict the sinkage and trim of ship sailing in shallow water tezdogan et al 2015a fully adopted the nonlinear unsteady rans simulation to predict the squat and resistance of a model scale duisburg test case container ship petru 2017 conducted the cfd simulations for the purpose of observing the effects of limited water depth on sailing ship hull in two domains one with a depth of 20 35 m and the other with a depth 6 85 m and results implied that the effects related mainly to change in pressure velocity forces and torques acting on the ship hull besides there are also studies on the effect of shallow water on parameters related to hull design for instance rotteveel et al 2017 investigated the effect that water depth has on the optimal choice of design parameters such as the athwart ship s propeller location the tunnel top curvature the flat of bottom shape in the stern region and the stern bilge radius the effect of shallow water on sailing ahead of ships have been studied well however there is still room for study on maneuverability of ships in shallow waters such as mountainous rivers and canals shallow water effect induces a series of adverse effects on the ship including reduced speed as a consequence of increased resistance reduced rudder effect and degraded turning performance pacuraru and domnisoru 2017 according to some researchers ships experience a drop in speed of up to 30 upon entering shallow waters tezdogan et al 2015b this value can rise up to 60 when operating in rivers or canals barrass 2012 such a dramatic speed reduction is directly attributable to the increase in resistance and the change in maneuvering characteristics creation of reliable mathematical models for ship maneuvering with due account for the shallow water effect is also very desirable as if such models are implemented in bridge simulators navigators and sailor can be better trained and prepared to complicated maneuvering phenomena sutulo et al 2010 from the viewpoint of ship navigation safety it is meaningful to simulate the maneuvering behavior of a ship in shallow water wei et al 2017 which contributes to making reasonable decisions such as the regulation of ship speed and navigation direction in the shallow water as well as estimating the safe ship speed in advance in the study the numerical model of non uniform flow is developed and flow field calculated by the model is applied to solve the hydrodynamic forces acting on the ship in addition a widely used numerical model known as the maneuvering mathematical group mmg is proposed the mmg model is also known as a modular model is one of the solutions for ship maneuvering motion simulations developed in japan lin jia et al 2013 yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 reichel 2017 then a new ship maneuvering numerical model that takes account of the shallow water effect is developed as based on the deep water model by correcting the hydrodynamic derivatives numerical simulations of straightforward turning and zig zag motions are conducted on a cargo ship and ship trajectories in shallow water for varying the depth draft ratio rudder angle and flow velocity are compared flow fields for two rapids of the lancang river are simulated aiming to providing the necessary flow field data for the maneuvering simulation of the ship in the actual river the main objective of the research is to investigate the effect of shallow water on the ship maneuverability and the simulated results for the ship in the actual rivers will offer guidance on ship maneuvering in shallow waterways to guarantee safe navigation 2 numerical model of non uniform flow 2 1 basic equations and numerical computation basic equations of the numerical model of non uniform flow contain continuity equation and momentum equations in the cartesian coordinates system basic equations are expressed as

v x v v y g z y g n 2 v u 2 v 2 h 4 3 υ 2 v x 2 2 v y 2 f e u 0 due to the irregular banks of natural rivers thus the method of mesh fitting river bank is adopted for overcoming the issue of largely fluctuating river bank the body fitted curvilinear coordinate system has been widely used for calculating the flow around arbitrary complex bodies thus which was employed for this study typically the conversion equations in the body fitted curvilinear coordinate system are given by the following equation 4 α 2 x ξ 2 γ 2 x η 2 j 2 p x ξ q x η 0 α 2 y ξ 2 γ 2 y η 2 j 2 p y ξ q y η 0 in eq 4 p and q

coordinate system are solved through the simplec algorithm doormaal and raithby 1984 firstly the relevant coefficients of coordinate transformation are calculated as well as the computation of initial water depth of the whole study reach based on the upper and lower boundary conditions velocity in the direction of the two curvilinear coordinates is solved based on momentum equations water depth of the study reach is calculated and modified along with the velocity finally the above steps are repeated until solving convergence except the computation of coefficients of coordinate transformation in the process of differential discretization and the solution of basic equations the staggered grid method is adopted for the purpose of overcoming the difficulty of discretizing the pressure gradient term and continuity equation besides sub relaxation technique is used aiming to promote the convergence of the non linear iteration the tridiagonal matrix algorithm tdma is applied to the solution of difference equations the basis for convergence is that the error of continuous equation is less than the given value 2 2 validation of the numerical model of non uniform flow measured data of the water level z and flow velocity v f in a small reach of the lancang river are selected to validate the reliability of the numerical model of non uniform flow the average measured flow discharge at the reach on may 15 2016 was approximately 1635 m3 s 1 which was selected as the computational flow discharge to validate z and v f the reach for the validation of z is below the jinghong dam till the end of the no 243 boundary stele about 76 km and grids used to discretize were curvilinear grids the study reach includes about 40000 grids and average length and width of the grid are about 19 m and 15 m respectively river width at the validated reach changes greatly and the width of the local position is less than 100 m in the dry season while more than 100 m in the flood season the jinghong dam is located about 5 km north of jinghong city yunnan province china and it is the sixth of eight cascade power stations in the lower reaches of the lancang river the no 243 boundary stele is located at the entrance of the lancang river into myanmar cross sections for the validation of v f are located at the dafanshui and xiuhua rapids and computational grids of two rapids are presented in fig 1 dafanshui and xiuhua rapids are located at 70 3 km and 68 3 km downstream of the jinghong dam respectively results are shown in fig 2 and fig 3 respectively l b is the distance from the no 243 boundary stele and l w is the distance of cross section in the direction of river width computed values are in good agreement with the measured data indicating that the numerical model of non uniform simulates the flow motion well 3 numerical model of ship maneuvering in deep and open water 3 1 coordinate systems fig 4 shows the coordinate systems implemented in this study the spatial fixed coordinate system o 0 x 0 y 0 z 0 where the x 0 y 0 plane coincides with the still water surface and the z 0 axis points vertically downward and the moving ship fixed coordinate system o x y z where o is taken at the midship of the ship and the x y and z axes point toward the bow of the ship starboard and vertically downward respectively the heading angle ψ is defined as the angle between x 0 and x axes δ is the rudder angle and r is the yaw rate additionally u m and v m denote the ship speed components in the directions of x and y respectively the drift angle at midship position β is defined as β tan 1 v m u m and the total velocity u is defined as u u m 2 v m 2 3 2 still and deep water motion equations modeling the actual motion of a ship with six degrees of freedom is very complicated generally the maneuvering motions of a ship in still and deep water are represented in terms of the surge sway and yaw need to be considered while the roll pitch or trim and heave motion can be ignored from a practical point of view the motion equations are expressed as 9 m m x u m m m y v m r x h x r x p m m y v m m m x u m r y h y r y p i z g j z r n h n r n p subscripts h p and r mean the hull propeller and rudder respectively the lateral force component and moment are neglected here because their values are relatively small consequently these two parameters are thus incorporated into the propeller influenced hull force calculation in the mmg based model y p and n p are expressed as follows 10 y p 0 n p 0 3 2 1 hydrodynamic forces acting on ship hull surge force x h lateral force y h yaw moment n h around midship acting on ship hull are expressed as follows 11 x h 1 2 ρ l d u 2 x h y h 1 2 ρ l d u 2 y h n h 1 2 ρ l 2 d u 2 n h where v m represents the non dimensionalized lateral velocity defined as v m u and r is the non dimensionalized yaw rate defined as r l u based on the resistance theory of the cross flow calculation formulas of x h y h and n h was put forward by inoue et al 1981 and can be expressed as follows 12 x h x u m x v m v m v m 2 x v m r v m r x r r r 2 y h y v m v m y r r y v m v m v m v m y v m r r v m y r r r r n h n v m v m n r r n v m v m v m v m n v

provides detail calculation methods of the hydrodynamic derivatives 3 2 2 propeller induced hydrodynamic force in the mmg model surge force due to propeller x p can be expressed as follows 13 x p 1 t p t for simplicity the thrust deduction coefficient t p is assumed to be constant for a given propeller load propeller thrust t is written as 14 t ρ n p 2 d p 4 k t j p the thrust coefficient k t can be derived by 2nd order polynomial fitting as follows 15 k t j p k 2 j p 2 k 1 j p k 0 the advanced ration j p is defined as follows 16 j p u m 1 w p n p d p where n p and d p are the revolution speed and diameter of the propeller respectively w p is the wake fraction changing with maneuvering motions in general several formulae for w p have been summarized by yasukawa and yoshimura 2015 in this study the following formula is used 17 w p w p 0 exp 8 β p 2 where w p 0 is the wake fraction when the ship is advancing straightforward and β p is the geometrical inflow angle to the propeller which can be expressed as follows 18 β p β x p r here x p denotes the non dimensional longitudinal coordinate of propeller position in the expression of x p the steering effect on the propeller thrust is excluded instead this effect is taken into account via the rudder force component as is described in the next section 3 2 3 hydrodynamic forces induced by steering effective rudder forces x r y r and n r are expressed as 19 x r 1 t r f n sin δ y r 1 a h f n cos δ n r x r a h x h f n cos δ where f n is normal force on the rudder note that tangential force on the rudder is neglected in eq 19 t r a h and x h are the coefficients that primarily represent the hydrodynamic interactions between the ship hull and rudder the t r is the steering resistance deduction coefficient as it defines the deduction coefficient of rudder resistance versus f n sin δ which is the longitudinal component of f n it should be noted that x r includes a component of the propeller thrust change owing to steering as mentioned in subsection 3 2 2 therefore t r is a coefficient of both the rudder resistance deduction and the propeller thrust increase induced by steering the underlying reason that steering induced propeller thrust increase occurs as a result of an increase of the nominal wake at the propeller position is not clear at present however it is suggested that the tangential force component on the rudder neglected in eq 20 may involve in t r the a h and x h are the rudder force increase factor and the position of an additional lateral force component respectively the a h represents the factor of steering induced lateral force acting on the ship hull versus f n cos δ which is the lateral component of f n the x h means the longitudinal acting point of the additional lateral force component the measured value of x h was about 0 45 l and the additional lateral force was found to act on the stern portion of the hull the phenomena may be understood by considering the hydrodynamic interaction of a wing with a flap the ship hull and rudder are regarded as the main wing and the flap respectively as is shown in fig 5 the lift force lateral force in this case is induced on the rudder by steering while an additional force component δ y in fig 5 is induced on the ship hull δ y is a product of the hydrodynamic interaction between the hull main wing and rudder flap then a h is defined by δ y f n cos δ and x h can be regarded as the acting point of δ y eq 19 is not theoretically derived 1 t r is given by the regression analysis xin le et al 1999 as follows 20 1 t r 0 7382 0 0539 c b 0 1755 c b 2 the normal force f n of the rudder is expressed as follows 21 f n 1 2 ρ a r u r 2 f α sin α r where f α is the rudder lift gradient coefficient which can be estimated by using fujii s formula and is commonly applied as follows 22 f α 6 13 λ r λ r 2 25 here λ r represents the aspect ratio of the rudder the resultant inflow velocity to rudder u r is expressed as follows 23 u r u 2 1 w r 2 1 k g s in eq 23 w r is obtained via the following formula w r w r 0 w p w p 0 where the magnitude of w r 0 is approximated as 0 25 and k is obtained via the following formula xin le et al 1999 k 1 065 δ 0 0 935 δ 0 the effective inflow angle to the rudder α r can be calculated via the following formula 24 α r δ γ r β r in eq 24 β r β 2 x r r where x r 0 5 3 3 motion equations for deep water flow motion when a ship is sailing in flowing water v f is the absolute flow velocity of the ship s position and can be calculated mainly including two steps firstly coordinates of the ship are searched in flow field by the basic function in finite element method and then v f is obtained by interpolating the flow velocity at four nodes of the grid ψ f is the flow direction in the spatial fixed coordinate system u c x and u c y denote the absolute flow velocity components in the directions of x and y respectively u c x and u c y are expressed as 25 u c x v f cos ψ f ψ u c y v f sin ψ f ψ ship speeds relative to the flow in the direction of x and y can be expressed as 26 u m u x u c x u x v f cos ψ f ψ v m u y u c y u y v f sin ψ f ψ taking the derivative of eq 26 27 u m u x v f r

derivatives will not be difficult to solve but analytical solutions will hardly be obtained runge kutta method has been very much common tool to get numerical solutions thus in this study the fourth order runge kutta method is adopted to solve the ship maneuvering motion equations variables of the ship maneuvering motion equations are u x u y and r given that the initial condition is expressed as u x u x 0 u y u y 0 r r 0 eq 28 is modified as follows 29 u x x m m y u y r m x m y v f r sin ψ f ψ m m x u y y m m x u x r m x m y v f r cos ψ f ψ m m y r n i z g j z assuming eq 29 can be rewritten

numerical model of ship maneuvering validation of the numerical model is performed on a cargo ship baoshou21 sailing in the lancang river and main parameters of the baoshou21 are presented in table 1 propulsive performance and turning ability of the baoshou21 are evaluated by implementing its specifications and parameters in the numerical model of ship maneuvering motion the test environment is an imaginary and unlimitedly wide water area not the actual channel and has uniform water depth water depth of verification tests is 2 5 times designed draft namely h 2 5d and test time of propulsive performance and turning ability are 50 s and 100 s respectively the results are shown in fig 6 the verification of propulsive performance aims to check whether the designed speed of the ship is reasonable or not and the ship trajectory in the still water is a straight line or not from the sailing distance within 50s and the ship trajectory in fig 6 a it can be seen that the speed and trajectory predictions are reasonable from previous researches xiu heng and wu 1998 xin le et al 1999 turning diameter d of the inland cargo ship with better turning ability is 1 5 3 5 times the ship length l namely d 1 5l 3 5l fig 6 b shows that the simulation result is consistent with the previous research considering this it is reasonable to implement the ship maneuvering numerical model proposed in this article to calculate the propulsive performance and turning ability of the representative ship baoshou 21 another ship huapinghao sailing in the lancang river was selected as the representative ship for the zig zag motion verification test because the baoshou 21 did not conduct the zig zag motion verification testing some important parameters of the huapinghao are presented in table 2 the test water area of zig zag motion is selected in the ganlan dam water area of the lancang river the ganlan dam water area with slow flow velocity and the width ranges from 170 m to 250 m water surface is gentle and longitudinal slope is about 0 4 water depth is approximately 10 m about six times the designed draft depth of the ship generally speaking the flow velocity width and longitudinal slope of the water area meet the requirements of zig zag motion test fig 7 shows the time history curves for the rudder and heading angles during 10 10 zig zag motion verification testing for load and rotational speed ratios of 90 each k and t are the turning ability index and steering quality index respectively as is shown in table 3 the computed values of k and t are in good agreement with the measured values in practice in such the river therefore it is reasonable to utilize the ship maneuvering numerical model proposed in this article to perform numerical simulations of zig zag motion 4 numerical model of ship maneuvering motion in shallow water incorporating the shallow water effect into the numerical model of ship maneuvering motion is primarily achieved by correcting the hydrodynamic derivatives of the model in deep water consequently the motion equation is unaltered from eq 9 but values of the relevant coefficients are different 4 1 added mass and added moment of inertia currently there are three methods for calculating added mass and added moment of inertia including slender body theory method singularity distribution method and the finite element method slender body theory method belongs to two dimensional calculations although the proposed method is simple there are noticeable error between the experimental and simulation results singularity distribution method and the finite element method are both three dimensional fluid dynamics methods however the computational process is exceedingly complex in summary for the purpose of improving the accuracy of calculation and simplifying calculation added mass and added inertia moment are calculated via a regression formula mei qing 1988 the regression formula is derived from large numbers of experimental data which are expressed as 33 m x h m x h d 1 1 3 3 77 1 14 b d 0 233 l d 3 43 c b h d 1 1 3 m y h m y h d 1 0 82 0 413 0 0320 b d 0 0129 b d 2 h d 1 0 82 j z z h j z z h d 1

on the ship hull if ship hull is supposed as a wing l is equivalent to the wing s chord and 2d is treated as the wing s span as is shown in fig 8 thus the aspect ratio λ is the ratio of its span to its mean chord then taking 2d as the wing s span aims to eliminate the influence of a free surface the aspect ratio is expressed as λ 2 d l and the effective aspect ratio is defined as follows λ e λ d 2 h λ π d 2 h cot π d 2 h q the lateral hydrodynamic force and dynamic moment acting on the ship in shallow water can be decomposed into the linear and nonlinear components hirano 1985 the formula for

induced thrust and moment as the ship travels through shallow water is carried out by correcting the deep water thrust deduction factor t p and the wake fraction ω p to those in shallow water xin le

is assumed to be made up of two independent components of resistance during the upward sailing which can be expressed as r r v r j r r v and r j are navigation resistance flow resistance and slope resistance respectively flow resistance is divided into frictional resistance r f and residual resistance r r the former is mainly related to the reynolds number while the latter is related to the froude number namely r v r f r e r r f r some scholars have carried out a detailed study on the calculation of navigation resistance and the famous эиванков method was proposed guan lun 2004 relevant parameters in the эиванков formula were obtained by combining results of the actual ship tests and the ship model tests such as the friction coefficient the reduction coefficient of ship cross section and so on the baoshou 21 belongs to the power driven ship and its flow resistance is calculated by the following formula 41 r v f 1 a s v s 1 83 ξ 1 c b a m v s 1 7 4 f r in eq 41 s a s l w c 1 d c b b v s 1 15 1 3 v c p v a ξ 1 17 7 c b 2 5 l w 6 b 3 2 a m β c b d f r v s g l w here f 1 is friction coefficient of the power driven ship and the baosou 21 is the steel ship so f 1 0 17 a s is the wetted surface area of ship l w is the waterline length of ship c 1 is the coefficient for the power driven c 1 1 8 b is the ship width v s is the ship sailing speed which is modified due to taking

mean water surface gradient α is the correction coefficient for the local increase of water surface gradient α 1 1 1 2 4 7 shallow water ship maneuvering motion simulation as previously mentioned the cargo ship baoshou21 is implemented as the representative ship in a series of simulations i e straightforward motion turning motion and zig zag motion a series of simulations for varying depth draft ratios rudder angles and flow velocity aim to reveal the ship maneuverability in shallow water it should be noted that these simulations are carried out in an imaginary and unrestricted water area not the actual river and designed speed of the representative ship is treated as the initial sailing speed in the calculation of these tests besides it is not necessary to add the flow velocity for straightforward and zig zag motion simulations and whether to add the flow velocity in turning motion simulation depends on the specific situation 4 8 straightforward motion fig 9 illustrates the straightforward motion ship trajectories for the same sailing time t 50 s the same rudder angel δ 0 and various depth draft ratios h d 1 5 2 0 3 0 4 0 6 0 8 0 and l s is the sailing distance fig 10 clearly reflects the relation between l s and h d when the ship is traveling in shallow water h d 3 0 as the h decreases the resistance rapidly increases as compared to deep water travel this results in a significantly shorter l s l s tends to increase as the increase of h d however l s increases slowly when ship enters deep water h d 3 0 in this case even if h d increases continually there is no obvious increase in l s and tends to be stable this finding demonstrates the significance of the shallow water effect because as resistance gradually decreases in deep water the effect of water depth on l s is greatly weakened 4 9 turning motion in order to verify the applicability of the proposed numerical model in turning motion of the actual ship we conducted a turning test for the actual ship huapinghao in the turning test and the numerical simulation in shallow water water depth is 2 5 times the designed draft of the huapinghao the turning test is conducted in the ganlan dam water area of the lancang river the conditions of numerical simulation are that initial heading angle and rudder angle are 0 and the fixed rudder angle for ship turning motion is 25 fig 11 shows the comparison of turning diameters of the actual ship and the model in shallow and deep water obviously simulated trajectories are in good accordance with tested trajectories of the actual ship indicating that the proposed numerical model based on the shallow water effect can apply to the simulation of the turning motion of the actual ship fig 12 shows a comparison of calculated turning trajectories for various depth draft ratios h d 1 5 2 0 3 0 the results are obtained under the conditions that the flow velocity at the initial position of the ship the initial heading angle and the rudder angle are equal to zero in addition the fixed rudder angles for ship turning motion are 15 right and 15 left the turning diameter can be seen to increase as the water depth decreases this is because the damping moment is increased when the ship is turning and yields a smaller yaw rate and drift angle in deep water this smaller drift angle causes the turning speed to decrease the above two factors result in a relatively increased turning diameter in shallow water which is unfavorable for ship maneuverability in shallow waterways fig 13 shows the simulated turning trajectory results for various rudder angles δ 10 15 20 25 and a fixed depth draft ratio h d 2 0 the results are obtained under the conditions that the flow velocity at the initial position of the ship the initial heading angle and the rudder angle are equal to zero the larger rudder angle causes the turning diameter to decrease when the depth draft ratio remains constant the simulation results roughly agree with those obtained for deep water travel fig 14 compares the calculated turning trajectories for various flow velocities v w 0 0 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 m s 1 and a fixed depth draft ratio h d 2 0 the results were obtained under the following conditions initial heading angle and rudder angle are 0 and a fixed rudder angle of ship turning motion is 15 the ship is turning and deflecting towards the direction of the flow when flow velocity exists the results show that ship turning becomes increasingly abnormal as the flow velocity increases with a complete circle becoming an arc with a smaller radius at higher flow velocities the proposed numerical model of ship maneuvering motion which is based on non uniform flow and regression formulae on shallow water effect is applied to a study on waterway regulation of the dafanshui rapids and the xiuhua rapids in the lancang river the dafanshui rapids was narrow and the channel width was about 60 m in the dry season the channel width of the xiuhua rapids was narrowed to 40 m due to the constructions of dikes based on the navigation standard of inland waterway of china gang et al 2014 the restricted waterway refers to the waterway producing obvious restriction for the navigation due to narrow water surface and small coefficient of cross section c c evaluation index of the restricted waterway is c c in general if c c 10 the waterway is not the restricted waterway in addition cross section coefficient of restricted waterway should be 6 c c 10 c c can be calculated by the following formula 43 c c a c a m a c is the flow area of cross section of the waterway a m is area of midship section of ship wetted section and a m β c b d β c 0 93 b is the ship width and d is the designed draft for the baoshou 21 a m 0 93 8 3 1 95 15 05 m2 when the water levels of two rapids are the most unfavorable for ship navigation for dafanshui rapids a c is about 396 m2 c c 396 15 05 26 31 10 for xiuhua rapids a c is about 168 m2 c c 168 15 05 11 16 10 therefore the two study rapids do not belong to the restricted waterway the case study simulation is completed in three general steps at the first step flow fields of the two rapids are calculated via the 2d flow numerical model proposed in the paper and then both of deep and shallow water simulations of ship maneuvering motion are performed by incorporating flow field data into the calculations based on the proposed numerical model at the final step a comparison of ship trajectories in the deep and shallow water is performed to analyze the influence of reduced water depth on ship navigation resistance in the case of the baoshou 21 since the minimum flow discharge of the jinghong power station should be controlled at 800 1000 m3 s 1 to ensure the lowest navigable water level that would guarantee safe navigation of the fourth grade waterway the lowest water depth of the fourth grade waterway is generally from 1 6 m to 1 9 m 800 m3 s 1 serves as the most adverse flow condition which is selected as the computational flow discharge for the purpose of ensuring safe navigation in this study the initial speed required in the simulation is 5 45 m s 1 and the heading angles are 73 and 111 respectively for deep and shallow water note that the same rudder angle is implemented for the same rapids in deep and shallow water the trajectories of ship motion in deep and shallow water are shown in fig 15 the flow velocity between the bottom of the ship and the riverbed is not only related the total bottom area of the ship but also closely related to the water depth when the ship is sailing in shallow water the flow is divided and pushed along the two sides of the ship leading to the increase of velocities along these two sides furthermore the increased viscous resistance results in reduced travel distance in shallow water this is also related to the flow field because when the flow velocity is large the viscous resistance is also large thereby hindering forward movement 4 10 zig zag motion fig 16 shows the results of simulating 20 20 zig zag motion trajectories with various depth draft ratios h d 1 5 3 0 it can be seen that a smaller depth draft ratio corresponds to a larger swing and period of zig zag motion this indicates that under the influence of the shallow water effect ship resistance increases and ship maneuverability decreases time history curves for the rudder and heading angles during shallow and deep water travel are shown in fig 17 results show that the duration of zig zag motion occurring in shallow water is longer than that occurring in deep water this means that maneuverability is reduced in shallow water because of the lower water depth 5 conclusions in this study with the aim of investigating the ship maneuverability in shallow water a numerical model of ship maneuvering motion that takes account of the shallow water effect is proposed based on the mmg model the flow field data solved based on a numerical model of non uniform flow are taken as the basis for calculating hydrodynamic forces of the ship model simulations of straightforward turning and zig zag motions in an unrestricted water area are performed on a cargo ship by using various empirical methods the fourth order runge kutta method and fortran programming language ship trajectories in shallow water for varying depth draft ratio rudder angle and flow velocity are compared indicating that shallow water caused ships to increase its sailing resistance and to decrease its maneuverability as the depth draft ratio decreases an increase in the duration of zig zag motion means that shallow water effect is pronounced and ship maneuverability is reduced besides the numerical result of turning motion is compared with the available experimental data and reasonable agreement is achieved the application of the ship model in an engineering case demonstrates it is reasonable to adopt the model considering the shallow water effect to simulate and guide maneuvering motions of the ship in mountainous river ship maneuverability in shallow water will undoubtedly attract further attention of scientists and engineers due to the rapid trend of enlargement in ship size in the world market however safety operations in inland waters particularly in mountainous rivers have yet completely insured study on ships in shallow waters should be continued to deepen the understanding of the phenomena including the effects of non uniform riverbed morphology confined shallow water inclined river bed wind waves and tidal waves and shallow water waves close to the critical ship speed on ship operations acknowledgments this work was partly supported by the national key research and development program of china 2016yfc0802204 and the basic and frontier research
