composed of an adaptive filter maximum amplitude method and empirical mode decomposition emd method for estimating the cross sectional area of a stream it has been widely considered dangerous labor

stream cross section measurement mainly include contact and non contact methods the conventional methods include the usage of hand cables topographic level rods and sounding poles these contact methods are simple but labor intensive and costly of the conventional methods the sounding weight is the most convenient way to measure the cross sections in a stream as shown in fig 1 the sounding weight is suspended in water by a cable from a boat or a bridge however it poses some disadvantages firstly the cable of the sounding weight is affected by the current of stream resulting in a curvature which takes sophisticated calculations to convert into the vertical distance rantz 1982 secondly it presents discontinuity measurement of water depth in a cross section therefore the

olimpio 2000 delaney et al 1992 compared with the contact measurement method the benefits of using the gpr include 1 providing the continuous data 2 increased safety for not touching the water body and 3 improved accuracy from the electronics improvement those benefits have made the gpr become a popular tool for measuring the cross sectional areas the gpr can detect both the water surface and the channel bottom at the same time water depth is determined from the distance difference between the waves reflected from the water surface and from the channel bottom however the manual identification was a requirement in processing the gpr signals and in determining the cross sectional area fig 2 demonstrates an example of the original gpr signal output which is complicated and difficult to locate where is the channel bottom or water surface it was necessary to rely on experts to process the complicated gpr signals the manual identification is not sufficient to interpret the gpr signals thus semi automatic recognition shihab and al nuaimy 2005 was later introduced to interpret the data which is less subjective than the manual signal interpretation however subjective judgement is still involved in the semi automatic recognition approach thus an objective and automatic recognition procedure should be developed and introduced into the streaming gaging this study employs the gpr method to measure a stream cross sectional area by an adaptive algorithm that automatically interpret the gpr signals with satisfactory results a procedure is developed for the field measurements and the mechanism of interpretation through the interfacing location obtained by analyzing the amplitude of the gpr electromagnetic waves the issues in the manual signal interpretation have been solved and the continuous data of the cross sectional areas can be conveniently obtained this procedure can be further integrated into an automatic mechanism for the non contact streamgaging which may realize the usgs 1999 dream gaging station 2 measurement of water depth using a gpr gpr utilizes an antenna to send electromagnetic waves into the subsurface the transmitter sends a diverging beam of energy pulses into the subsurface and the receiver collects the energy reflected from interfaces between materials with different electrical properties the results are then shown on radiograms the basic principle of gpr is the maxwell s equations huray 2010 1 h j d t 2 e b t 3 d ρ 4 b 0 where h is magnetic field intensity j is free current density d is electric displacement field t is time e is electric field intensity b is magnetic field ρ is total free charge density electronic waves result in different reflected waves while penetrating the water concretes rocks and other deme with different dielectric properties it is possible to assess and interpret the cross sectional status of the object to be measured based on this property the conductivity of medium relative to the dielectric constants could influence the gpr surveying depth the conductivity is the intensity to transmit the electric currents with the resistivity as its inverse based on the respective characteristics mediums are divided into three types the mediums with high conductivity σ 10 2 s m are poor for the gpr survey such as seawater wet shale and wet clay the mediums with medium conductivity 10 2 σ 10 7 s m are good for gpr survey such as pure water dry clay sand and silt the mediums with low conductivity σ 10 7 s m are also good for the gpr survey such as air asphalt and concrete david and annan 1989 the relative permittivity is the ratio relative to the permittivity in vacuum the dielectric constant 1 the energy strength of the reflected signal depends on variances in the dielectric constants among different mediums the bigger variances mean the stronger the reflected signals would be mediums used in this study included two conductivity groups 1 low conductivity fresh water water saturated sands wet sandstones with the dielectric constant 81 20 30 and 6 respectively and 2 low conductivity air with dielectric constant of 1 3 computation of stream cross sectional area during a survey electromagnetic waves emitted from the gpr antenna would produce reflected waves after entering into different mediums which would change amplitudes of the electromagnetic waves the amplitudes of electromagnetic waves could be converted into a contour plot with space information the manual interpretations of the measured results would be influenced by the subjective awareness without certain criteria which should be performed by experts in this study the analysis results of amplitudes of electromagnetic waves were used to produce locations of the water air and water bottom interfaces and to convert them into the water depths the stream cross sectional area was obtained by connecting all dots the analysis results showed a bumpy boundary data electromagnetic waves entering into a different medium would be transformed into the reflected waves the receiving antenna captured recorded and saved those reflected waves in sequence the transmission of electromagnetic waves through mediums in different depths would result in different reflection amplitudes which could determine the intensity of reflected signals and its depth at the interfacing intersection between different mediums the electrical parameters of a medium are the main factors influencing the reflected signals of electromagnetic waves fig 3 demonstrates the two intersecting locations from obviously reflected amplitudes occurring at interfacing intersections which could locate the water surface and channel bottom this approach that depicts the stream cross sectional area could be made by connecting spatial locations of the water surfaces and bottoms the spatial location was determined by the amplitudes of electromagnetic waves therefore it is possible to improve the manual interpretation and establish a well defined method to analyze cross sectional areas the processes of measurement and computation of stream cross sectional areas using gpr include 1 data processing 2 determination of water depths 3 smoothing a stream cross section and 4 computation of area the respective principles and methods are explained in the following sections 3 1 data processes using an adaptive filter before processing the gpr data the general procedure includes 1 background noise removal 2 filtering processing and 3 signal amplification the background noise is shown as the persisting horizontal signals in the fig 4 with a consistent intensity and fixed lagging location the background noise is stronger than the target signals and tends to cover them during this analysis noise can be removed to improve the image interpretation the filtering processing removes those undesirable signals in high and low frequencies and retains what are practically needed the study applies the adaptive filter to process signals it could improve the accuracy of a stream cross sectional area under continuously long termed monitoring an adaptive filter uses the results previously obtained from the filter parameters to adjust the current filter parameters with the statistical characteristics of time variances that is the feedback loop from the adaptive algorithm feedback processes are fundamental in all exact sciences in fact they were first introduced by sir isaac newton and gottfried w leibniz some 300 years ago in the form of dynamic laws and it is now a standard procedure to model natural phenomena using such laws such laws determine for example the location and velocity of a particle at one time instant from its values at the preceding instant the motion of the particle is then understood as the unfolding of that law it is not essential whether the process is discrete i e it takes place in steps or continuous peitgen et al 2004 the adaptive algorithm also has been realized as the optimal filtering widrow and stearns 1985 the adaptive control is a controlling system consisting of digital filters and the adaptive algorithm its related applications include system prediction system identification noise cancellation and others fig 5 shows the adaptive filter for removing the noise the noise occurs when measuring with a gpr the study has applied the steepest descent method to renew and optimize the adaptability the steepest descent method is based on a recursive method the initial value would approach and converge into the result through increased recursions using the transversal filter based on the steepest descent method the weight w n on the time w n 1 in the equation was updated as equation 5 5 w n 1 w n 1 2 μ j n to seek the extremum by differentiating w n with j n as shown in equation 6 6 j n j n a 0 n j j n b 0 n j n a 1 n j n b 1 n j n a m 1 n j n b m 1 n 2 p 2 r u w n we have to estimate the gradient vector based on the results obtained therefore we can estimate the gradient vector and simplify the relative array ru and cross relation vector p by equation 6 the best choice is to replace ru and p with the instantaneous estimation as shown in equations 7 and 8 7 r u n u n u h n 8 p n u n d n where d n is the expected value w n is the input vector y n is the fir filter output e n is error the least value of e n 2 is obtained from continuously updated w n via computation which made the error approximating zero 3 2 determination of water depth using maximum amplitude method obvious amplitudes of reflection are produced when electromagnetic waves reach the interface of the mediums this characteristics can be applied to locate the water surface and channel bottom from each vertical line chen et al 2012 for the horizontal axis the adjacent vertical measurement line with similar amplitudes are classified as the measurement group the measurement group is called trace here the locations of water surface and river bottom were determined by the traces at the vertical direction for each trace the limited sampling number is defined as n they are divided into two groups 1 up to n and n 1 up to 512 as shown in equations 9 and 10 as follows 9 wl max y 1 y 2 y 3 y n 10 bl max y n 1 y n 2 y n 3 y 512 where n the limited sampling number yn number of samples wl location of water surface bl location of water bottom the locations of the water surface and stream bottom as well as the related amplitudes could be analyzed via computations and connected further to form a plotting the stream cross sectional area could be plotted by the depths and distances obtained from the above mentioned computation shown as the solid line in fig 6 the depth of each sampling point is obtained from the deepest depth dividing by sample number the width represented by each vertical line is obtained from the number of vertical lines dividing by the measured stream width the water depth was obtained by the following formula the water surface subtraction the water bottom then multiplying the depth represented by each sampling point from each vertical line the top width of river can be obtained by the number of vertical lines multiplied by its respective width 3 3 application of emd to smoothing stream cross section boundary in fig 6 oscillation is observed at river bottom boundary therefore the empirical mode decomposition emd method huang et al 1998 was employed to decompose the signals into several intrinsic mode functions imfs to smooth the cross section boundary chen et al 2014 it s necessary for each imf to meet the following conditions firstly the number of extreme values in the overall data must match the number of zero crossings or differ by only one secondly at any given point in time the mean value of the maximal and minimal envelopes must be zero to prevent instantaneous frequencies from producing undesired oscillations due to asymmetric waveforms when dealing with the original signals with nonlinear and non stationary behaviors at least two extreme signals the maximum and minimum would be applied to restrain the signals the local time scale huang et al 1998 is defined as the time difference between the two extreme signals if the signals do not contain any extreme value but inflection points one may differentiate the signals once or several times in order to acquire the extreme values the final result can be obtained through the respective integrals the decomposition process of the emd which employs a shifting process to decompose the original data into several imfs firstly identify the local extreme value in the original data x t indicated as the one by comparing three continuous sampling points in fig 7 a secondly connect all the extreme values by a cubic spline line in order to obtain the upper envelope e u t defined by the local maxima shown as the dashed lines in fig 7 b the lower envelope e l t defined by the local minima shown as the solid lines in fig 7 c finally obtain the mean of the envelopes from the upper and lower envelopes as illustrated in fig 7 d the equation for decomposing emd is shown in 11 and that of the extracted result in 12 11 m t eu t e l t 2 12 d t x t m t repeat the above procedures till d t satisfies the definition of an imf at this time let d t as d 1 t namely imf1 then retreat r1 t x t d1 t r1 t will be the original data for the imf2 repeat the above procedures for r1 t until rn t satisfies the requirements of imf otherwise it should repeat the above procedures record n number of imfs as cn t cn t d1 t d2 t dn t and the residual rn t can be calculated in as 13 r n t x t c n t therefore the original data x t can be expressed as n number of imf components and a residual rn t 14 x t k 1 n c k t r n t using emd to analyze values of the stream bottom boundary is to cancel out effects from noises after analyzing the signals using emd the original values would be decomposed into several imfs and a residual which could be eliminated as noises then a continuously smoothened stream cross sectional area is obtained from the result of stream bottom smoothened by emd shown as the dashed lines shown in fig 6 it depicts the entire shape of the cross sectional area 3 4 computation of area using the trapezoidal rule when the stream bed shape is obtained the cross sectional area can be divided into several subsections mathematically the cross sectional area of a stream can be represented by 15 a a b f z d z where a is the cross sectional area f z is the water depth of the stream bed z is the distance from the reference point evaluated between the limits z a to z b usually the stream width is discretized into n equally spaced distances when the water depth is measured by the sounding weight by applying the trapezoidal rule the cross sectional area can be expressed as 16 a b a f a 2 i 1 n 1 f x i f b 2 n 4 descriptions of the study site and measuring kits the study site is located at the du nan bridge along the beishi stream in the feisui reservoir catchment the location and current condition as shown in fig 8 the mainstream of the beishi stream is 48 51 km in length with a catchment area about 153 02 km2 the du nan bridge is located at the upstream in the backwater area of the feisui reservoir the water stage of du nan bridge is influenced by the reservoir backwater during a flood therefore the flood flow velocity is respectively slow at the du nan bridge the water surface width is about 60 110 m in the high flow period and 40 50 m in the low flow period the stream bed around the bridge consists of laccoliths small pebbles and fine gravels this study applied both the gpr and the sounding weigh to measure the same stream cross section and compared the differences in results given by these two methods fig 9 a and 9 a demonstrates respectively that the crew used the sounding weight and gpr measured the area of the stream cross section the vertical distance between the surfaces of bridge and water is around 15 m gpr is operated by a truck mounted crane and suspended in air but close to the water surface to continuously and rapidly measure the precise stream cross sectional area without having contact with the water different from the conventional method which measures the entire cross section point by point with the sounding weight in a 3 m interval fig 9 b shows the way to apply a gpr to measure a stream cross section a gpr kit consists of a gpr system with an antenna of 300 mhz in frequency and crane mounted truck 5 results all the experiments in this study were measured in the constant flow periods the stream flow was steady and no obviously scouring and silting occurred to the streambed 11 measuring sessions in total employed in 2011 including 6 sessions in april and 5 sessions in june the measured amplitude data was processed with an adaptive filter system the obtained results of the cross section were compared with the sounding weight method the measuring system for the cross section was established and the ability of adaptive filter algorithm was explored in the adaptive algorithm two inputs one original and one reference are needed the amplitude data of the original images was input then processed with the adaptive filter to eliminate noises in the first measuring session the reference noise n 0 was filtered out the background values and noises with the gpr software the result obtained from the adaptive filter was used as the updated reference noise for the next measurement and as the correcting basis for the filter parameters in this study an antenna with a frequency of 300 mhz was employed in the first session the signal delay time and range were 100 ns and 1 67 m respectively the dielectric constant of the medium is 81 the high pass filter was turned off during the measurement the delayed time is 719 ns the number of tracks is 1258 the sampling number is 512 the width of cross section is 73 m the gpr measuring depth is 1 61 m the gpr file was exported into the amplitude values of electromagnetic waves after filtering was processed with the emd analysis after analysis the locations of the water surface and stream bottom could be obtained from the analyzed electromagnetic waves the signals at different locations could be then converted into depths however oscillations caused by noises occurred at the stream bed the continuous smoothened cross section was obtained from the emd analysis to have noises cancelled the stream cross section obtained from the 11 measurement runs by the gpr and the sounding weight are shown respectively in fig 10 and table 1 in which 6 measurement runs were carried out in april within the dry season and 5 runs carried out in june within the wet season the horizontal axis represents the distance from the reference point and the vertical axis represents the water depth fig 10 a to 10 f show that the flows were low between april 11 2011 and april 29 2011 making the sand bar in the middle of the stream bed occasionally approaches to the water surface the water remained in two deep cuts in the depth of 1 m the stream cross sections from the gpr and the sounding weight are similar in which the sounding weight was not a continuous measurement the shape resulted from the depth measuring was not as complete as those of the gpr the five measurements runs after june 6 were carried out in high flows observations on changes in the cross sectional area based on the time shift have shown that the cross section of the du nan bridge has changed since april 19 from fig 10 f and 10 g one may observe that the heavy rain by end of may 2011 has increase the water depth and also changed the shape of the stream cross section the deep cut along the left bank was flushed deeper while the deep cut along the right bank was silted up fig 10 g was the measurement run carried on june 6th and was processed with the adaptive filter with the initial parameter inputs observed from the previous run carried out during the low flow on april 19th thus fig 10 g shows that the two cross sections given by the gpr and the sounding weight were very different as the water depth measured by the gpr was shallower than that by the sounding weight however with the continuous feedback computation the stream cross sections measured by the gpr and the sounding weight can get closer to each other comparing fig 10 g and 10 h one may find the measurement by the gpr with the adaptive filter is getting closer to that by the sounding weight particularly fig 10 i was the measurement run carried out on the same day of fig 10 h the cross section given by the gps showed slight difference from that given by the sounding weight variances between the estimated noises and actual noises could be used to determine if the adaptive filter effective in noise cancelling however the margin of error actually couldn t explain whether the algorithm performance was good or poor therefore the root mean square error is often used to evaluate the accuracy 22 rmse d obs d est 2 n where d obs and d est are the measured value and estimated value respectively from the sounding weight n is number of vertical lines the measured data by the gpr were processed with the adaptive filter to obtain the water depth which was combined with the water depth obtained from the sounding weight to obtain an rmse in fig 11 the rmse of each measurement represents that when obvious changes occur in a cross section measurements with the auto gpr signal determination tend to result in larger errors but with the adaptive processing the margin of error would reduce significantly after a few measurements the adaptive filter enables the automatic accurate and fast calculation of cross sections with intensive gpr measurements when significant changes differences in the cross section area can be obtained from both the sounding weight and the gpr methods at each measuring site as shown in table 1 the differences between two methods range between 3 and 20 the largest differences took place on april 11 and june 6 it s because they were at the beginning of each serial measuring group without any expected value for adaptation the previous cross section was also used as the expected value even when the stream cross section changes vastly therefore the parameters were adjusted adaptively resulting in larger difference that is characteristics of the feedback mechanism however those differences can be reduced along with the continuous iterative operations observationally from the results the second operation can reduce drastically the differences between those given by the gpr and the sounding weight another difference source is within the cross section measurements the difference increases when the stream cross sections become smaller the difference will increase that s because the complete shape of stream bottom can be hardly obtained through the conventional method which is unable to measure the water depth continuity but at interval distances thus the measuring differences in changes to the stream bottom have obvious impacts on the results the stream cross section increases with the rising water level which brings impacts to the stream cross sectional measurements however those differences in the two methods tend to narrow down with a larger stream cross sectional area fig 11 demonstrates the comparison with the measurement results of the gpr and sounding weight methods at each experimental site in the same vertical line with the measured water depth ranging 0 m to 6 m this plot shows that in a larger water depth the two methods give larger differences in water depth measurements in which the gpr method gives a larger water depth than the sounding weight considering higher water level with a larger water depther the sounding weight method would be influenced by strong flows we thus convince that water depth measurements given by the gpr method approximate the reality fig 12 demonstrates the cross sectional areas of all experiments given by the two methods this plot shows that the cross sectional areas given by the gpr method have gradually stabilized through the adaptive filter indicating the well applicability of the gpr method and the adaptive filter furthermore the gpr method has several practical advantages shorter labor time securer and safer during survey and better resolution of measured data 6 conclusions to eliminate risks encountered by the hydrographic surveyors during measurements the non contact instruments and methods will become the mainstream trend for the measurements on the stream cross sections usgs 1999 plotted an ultimate streamgaging station that measures the stream without any contact this study developed a procedure that realized the usgs future streamgaging the gpr measurement is a non contact method in which the instrument itself and connecting cables do not contact the water body significantly reducing risk when measurements are being conducted this study employed the adaptive filter to construct a determining mechanism for the gpr data to reduce difficulties in data interpretation to select a measuring point for a sounding weight it s necessary to address the characteristic point of a cross section the cross sectional line is artificially constructed by connecting each measuring point forming a discontinuous cross section risks for manually selecting the measuring points include omissions of critical data during the high flow and deformations of streambed the stream cross section measured by the gpr method is continuous without interruption surveyors do not need to select characteristic points which makes it possible to eliminate omissions of any critical data these advantages of the gpr method do not only simplify the task for measuring stream cross sections but also process the mega data and spatial data by combining the gpr method with the adaptive filter from the field survey no significant differences have been obtained between the non contact method with the gpr method and the adaptive filter and the contact method with a sounding weight furthermore the gpr method not only improves the security and safety during hydrological surveying but also the cost and time efficiency during a flood event it may potentially be used to register the erosion and deposition processes moreover in the near future one may integrate this automatic and non contact stream cross section measuring method with non contact velocimeter into an automatic stream gaging for obtaining the flow discharge during a flood event credit authorship contribution statement yen chang chen conceptualization methodology writing original draft su pai kao

the dielectric constants could influence the gpr surveying depth the conductivity is the intensity to transmit the electric currents with the resistivity as its inverse based on the respective characteristics mediums are divided into three types the mediums with high conductivity σ 10 2 s m are poor for the gpr survey such as seawater wet shale and wet clay the mediums with medium conductivity 10 2 σ 10 7 s m are good for gpr survey such as pure water dry clay sand and silt the mediums with low conductivity σ 10 7 s m are also good for the gpr survey such as air asphalt and concrete david and annan 1989 the relative permittivity is the ratio relative to the permittivity in vacuum the dielectric constant 1 the energy strength of the reflected signal depends on variances in the dielectric constants among different mediums the bigger variances mean the stronger the reflected signals would be mediums used in this study included two conductivity groups 1 low conductivity fresh water water saturated sands wet sandstones with the dielectric constant 81 20 30 and 6 respectively and 2 low conductivity air with dielectric constant of 1 3 computation of stream cross sectional area during a survey electromagnetic waves emitted from the gpr antenna would produce reflected waves after entering into different mediums which would change amplitudes of the electromagnetic waves the amplitudes of electromagnetic waves could be converted into a contour plot with space information the manual interpretations of the measured results would be influenced by the subjective awareness without certain criteria which should be performed by experts in this study the analysis results of amplitudes of electromagnetic waves were used to produce locations of the water air and water bottom interfaces and to convert them into the water depths the stream cross sectional area was obtained by connecting all dots the analysis results showed a bumpy boundary data electromagnetic waves entering into a different medium would be transformed into the reflected waves the receiving antenna captured recorded and saved those reflected waves in sequence the transmission of electromagnetic waves through mediums in different depths would result in different reflection amplitudes which could determine the intensity of reflected signals and its depth at the interfacing intersection between different mediums the electrical parameters of a medium are the main factors influencing the reflected signals of electromagnetic waves fig 3 demonstrates the two intersecting locations from obviously reflected amplitudes occurring at interfacing intersections which could locate the water surface and channel bottom this approach that depicts the stream cross sectional area could be made by connecting spatial locations of the water surfaces and bottoms the spatial location was determined by the amplitudes of electromagnetic waves therefore it is possible to improve the manual interpretation and establish a well defined method to analyze cross sectional areas the processes of measurement and computation of stream cross sectional areas using gpr include 1 data processing 2 determination of water depths 3 smoothing a stream cross section and 4 computation of area the respective principles and methods are explained in the following sections 3 1 data processes using an adaptive filter before processing the gpr data the general procedure includes 1 background noise removal 2 filtering processing and 3 signal amplification the background noise is shown as the persisting horizontal signals in the fig 4 with a consistent intensity and fixed lagging location the background noise is stronger than the target signals and tends to cover them during this analysis noise can be removed to improve the image interpretation the filtering processing removes those undesirable signals in high and low frequencies and retains what are practically needed the study applies the adaptive filter to process signals it could improve the accuracy of a stream cross sectional area under continuously long termed monitoring an adaptive filter uses the results previously obtained from the filter parameters to adjust the current filter parameters with the statistical characteristics of time variances that is the feedback loop from the adaptive algorithm feedback processes are fundamental in all exact sciences in fact they were first introduced by sir isaac newton and gottfried w leibniz some 300 years ago in the form of dynamic laws and it is now a standard procedure to model natural phenomena using such laws such laws determine for example the location and velocity of a particle at one time instant from its values at the preceding instant the motion of the particle is then understood as the unfolding of that law it is not essential whether the process is discrete i e it takes place in steps or continuous peitgen et al 2004 the adaptive algorithm also has been realized as the optimal filtering widrow and stearns 1985 the adaptive control is a controlling system consisting of digital filters and the adaptive algorithm its related applications include system prediction system identification noise cancellation and others fig 5 shows the adaptive filter for removing the noise the noise occurs when measuring with a gpr the study has applied the steepest descent method to renew and optimize the adaptability the steepest descent method is based on a recursive method the initial value would approach and converge into the result through increased recursions using the transversal filter based on the steepest descent method the weight w n on the time w n 1 in the equation was updated as equation 5 5 w n 1 w n 1 2 μ j n to seek the extremum by differentiating w n with j n as shown in equation 6 6 j n j n a 0 n j j n b 0 n j n a 1 n j n b 1 n j n a m 1 n j n b m 1 n 2 p 2 r u w n we have to estimate the gradient vector based on the results obtained therefore we can estimate the gradient vector and simplify the relative array ru and cross relation vector p by equation 6 the best choice is to replace ru and p with the instantaneous estimation as shown in equations 7 and 8 7 r u n u n u h n 8 p n u n d n where d n is the expected value w n is the input vector y n is the fir filter output e n is error the least value of e n 2 is obtained from continuously updated w n via computation which made the error approximating zero 3 2 determination of water depth using maximum amplitude method obvious amplitudes of reflection are produced when electromagnetic waves reach the interface of the mediums this characteristics can be applied to locate the water surface and channel bottom from each vertical line chen et al 2012 for the horizontal axis the adjacent vertical measurement line with similar amplitudes are classified as the measurement group the measurement group is called trace here the locations of water surface and river bottom were determined by the traces at the vertical direction for each trace the limited sampling number is defined as n they are divided into two groups 1 up to n and n 1 up to 512 as shown in equations 9 and 10 as follows 9 wl max y 1 y 2 y 3 y n 10 bl max y n 1 y n 2 y n 3 y 512 where n the limited sampling number yn number of samples wl location of water surface bl location of water bottom the locations of the water surface and stream bottom as well as the related amplitudes could be analyzed via computations and connected further to form a plotting the stream cross sectional area could be plotted by the depths and distances obtained from the above mentioned computation shown as the solid line in fig 6 the depth of each sampling point is obtained from the deepest depth dividing by sample number the width represented by each vertical line is obtained from the number of vertical lines dividing by the measured stream width the water depth was obtained by the following formula the water surface subtraction the water bottom then multiplying the depth represented by each sampling point from each vertical line the top width of river can be obtained by the number of vertical lines multiplied by its respective width 3 3 application of emd to smoothing stream cross section boundary in fig 6 oscillation is observed at river bottom boundary therefore the empirical mode decomposition emd method huang et al 1998 was employed to decompose the signals into several intrinsic mode functions imfs to smooth the cross section boundary chen et al 2014 it s necessary for each imf to meet the following conditions firstly the number of extreme values in the overall data must match the number of zero crossings or differ by only one secondly at any given point in time the mean value of the maximal and minimal envelopes must be zero to prevent instantaneous frequencies from producing undesired oscillations due to asymmetric waveforms when dealing with the original signals with nonlinear and non stationary behaviors at least two extreme signals the maximum and minimum would be applied to restrain the signals the local time scale huang et al 1998 is defined as the time difference between the two extreme signals if the signals do not contain any extreme value but inflection points one may differentiate the signals once or several times in order to acquire the extreme values the final result can be obtained through the respective integrals the decomposition process of the emd which employs a shifting process to decompose the original data into several imfs firstly identify the local extreme value in the original data x t indicated as the one by comparing three continuous sampling points in fig 7 a secondly connect all the extreme values by a cubic spline line in order to obtain the upper envelope e u t defined by the local maxima shown as the dashed lines in fig 7 b the lower envelope e l t defined by the local minima shown as the solid lines in fig 7 c finally obtain the mean of the envelopes from the upper and lower envelopes as illustrated in fig 7 d the equation for decomposing emd is shown in 11 and that of the extracted result in 12 11 m t eu t e l t 2 12 d t x t m t repeat the above procedures till d t satisfies the definition of an imf at this time let d t as d 1 t namely imf1 then retreat r1 t x t d1 t r1 t will be the original data for the imf2 repeat the above procedures for r1 t until rn t satisfies the requirements of imf otherwise it should repeat the above procedures record n number of imfs as cn t cn t d1 t d2 t dn t and the residual rn t can be calculated in as 13 r n t x t c n t therefore the original data x t can be expressed as n number of imf components and a residual rn t 14 x t k 1 n c k t r n t using emd to analyze values of the stream bottom boundary is to cancel out effects from noises after analyzing the signals using emd the original values would be decomposed into several imfs and a residual which could be eliminated as noises then a continuously smoothened stream cross sectional area is obtained from the result of stream bottom smoothened by emd shown as the dashed lines shown in fig 6 it depicts the entire shape of the cross sectional area 3 4 computation of area using the trapezoidal rule when the stream bed shape is obtained the cross sectional area can be divided into several subsections mathematically the cross sectional area of a stream can be represented by 15 a a b f z d z where a is the cross sectional area f z is the water depth of the stream bed z is the distance from the reference point evaluated between the limits z a to z b usually the stream width is discretized into n equally spaced distances when the water depth is measured by the sounding weight by applying the trapezoidal rule the cross sectional area can be expressed as 16 a b a f a 2 i 1 n 1 f x i f b 2 n 4 descriptions of the study site and measuring kits the study site is located at the du nan bridge along the beishi stream in the feisui reservoir catchment the location and current condition as shown in fig 8 the mainstream of the beishi stream is 48 51 km in length with a catchment area about 153 02 km2 the du nan bridge is located at the upstream in the backwater area of the feisui reservoir the water stage of du nan bridge is influenced by the reservoir backwater during a flood therefore the flood flow velocity is respectively slow at the du nan bridge the water surface width is about 60 110 m in the high flow period and 40 50 m in the low flow period the stream bed around the bridge consists of laccoliths small pebbles and fine gravels this study applied both the gpr and the sounding weigh to measure the same stream cross section and compared the differences in results given by these two methods fig 9 a and 9 a demonstrates respectively that the crew used the sounding weight and gpr measured the area of the stream cross section the vertical distance between the surfaces of bridge and water is around 15 m gpr is operated by a truck mounted crane and suspended in air but close to the water surface to continuously and rapidly measure the precise stream cross sectional area without having contact with the water different from the conventional method which measures the entire cross section point by point with the sounding weight in a 3 m interval fig 9 b shows the way to apply a gpr to measure a stream cross section a gpr kit consists of a gpr system with an antenna of 300 mhz in frequency and crane mounted truck 5 results all the experiments in this study were measured in the constant flow periods the stream flow was steady and no obviously scouring and silting occurred to the streambed 11 measuring sessions in total employed in 2011 including 6 sessions in april and 5 sessions in june the measured amplitude data was processed with an adaptive filter system the obtained results of the cross section were compared with the sounding weight method the measuring system for the cross section was established and the ability of adaptive filter algorithm was explored in the adaptive algorithm two inputs one original and one reference are needed the amplitude data of the original images was input then processed with the adaptive filter to eliminate noises in the first measuring session the reference noise n 0 was filtered out the background values and noises with the gpr software the result obtained from the adaptive filter was used as the updated reference noise for the next measurement and as the correcting basis for the filter parameters in this study an antenna with a frequency of 300 mhz was employed in the first session the signal delay time and range were 100 ns and 1 67 m respectively the dielectric constant of the medium is 81 the high pass filter was turned off during the measurement the delayed time is 719 ns the number of tracks is 1258 the sampling number is 512 the width of cross section is 73 m the gpr measuring depth is 1 61 m the gpr file was exported into the amplitude values of electromagnetic waves after filtering was processed with the emd analysis after analysis the locations of the water surface and stream bottom could be obtained from the analyzed electromagnetic waves the signals at different locations could be then converted into depths however oscillations caused by noises occurred at the stream bed the continuous smoothened cross section was obtained from the emd analysis to have noises cancelled the stream cross section obtained from the 11 measurement runs by the gpr and the sounding weight are shown respectively in fig 10 and table 1 in which 6 measurement runs were carried out in april within the dry season and 5 runs carried out in june within the wet season the horizontal axis represents the distance from the reference point and the vertical axis represents the water depth fig 10 a to 10 f show that the flows were low between april 11 2011 and april 29 2011 making the sand bar in the middle of the stream bed occasionally approaches to the water surface the water remained in two deep cuts in the depth of 1 m the stream cross sections from the gpr and the sounding weight are similar in which the sounding weight was not a continuous measurement the shape resulted from the depth measuring was not as complete as those of the gpr the five measurements runs after june 6 were carried out in high flows observations on changes in the cross sectional area based on the time shift have shown that the cross section of the du nan bridge has changed since april 19 from fig 10 f and 10 g one may observe that the heavy rain by end of may 2011 has increase the water depth and also changed the shape of the stream cross section the deep cut along the left bank was flushed deeper while the deep cut along the right bank was silted up fig 10 g was the measurement run carried on june 6th and was processed with the adaptive filter with the initial parameter inputs observed from the previous run carried out during the low flow on april 19th thus fig 10 g shows that the two cross sections given by the gpr and the sounding weight were very different as the water depth measured by the gpr was shallower than that by the sounding weight however with the continuous feedback computation the stream cross sections measured by the gpr and the sounding weight can get closer to each other comparing fig 10 g and 10 h one may find the measurement by the gpr with the adaptive filter is getting closer to that by the sounding weight particularly fig 10 i was the measurement run carried out on the same day of fig 10 h the cross section given by the gps showed slight difference from that given by the sounding weight variances between the estimated noises and actual noises could be used to determine if the adaptive filter effective in noise cancelling however the margin of error actually couldn t explain whether the algorithm performance was good or poor therefore the root mean square error is often used to evaluate the accuracy 22 rmse d obs d est 2 n where d obs and d est are the measured value and estimated value respectively from the sounding weight n is number of vertical lines the measured data by the gpr were processed with the adaptive filter to obtain the water depth which was combined with the water depth obtained from the sounding weight to obtain an rmse in fig 11 the rmse of each measurement represents that when obvious changes occur in a cross section measurements with the auto gpr signal determination tend to result in larger errors but with the adaptive processing the margin of error would reduce significantly after a few measurements the adaptive filter enables the automatic accurate and fast calculation of cross sections with intensive gpr measurements when significant changes differences in the cross section area can be obtained from both the sounding weight and the gpr methods at each measuring site as shown in table 1 the differences between two methods range between 3 and 20 the largest differences took place on april 11 and june 6 it s because they were at the beginning of each serial measuring group without any expected value for adaptation the previous cross section was also used as the expected value even when the stream cross section changes vastly therefore the parameters were adjusted adaptively resulting in larger difference that is characteristics of the feedback mechanism however those differences can be reduced along with the continuous iterative operations observationally from the results the second operation can reduce drastically the differences between those given by the gpr and the sounding weight another difference source is within the cross section measurements the difference increases when the stream cross sections become smaller the difference will increase that s because the complete shape of stream bottom can be hardly obtained through the conventional method which is unable to measure the water depth continuity but at interval distances thus the measuring differences in changes to the stream bottom have obvious impacts on the results the stream cross section increases with the rising water level which brings impacts to the stream cross sectional measurements however those differences in the two methods tend to narrow down with a larger stream cross sectional area fig 11 demonstrates the comparison with the measurement results of the gpr and sounding weight methods at each experimental site in the same vertical line with the measured water depth ranging 0 m to 6 m this plot shows that in a larger water depth the two methods give larger differences in water depth measurements in which the gpr method gives a larger water depth than the sounding weight considering higher water level with a larger water depther the sounding weight method would be influenced by strong flows we thus convince that water depth measurements given by the gpr method approximate the reality fig 12 demonstrates the cross sectional areas of all experiments given by the two methods this plot shows that the cross sectional areas given by the gpr method have gradually stabilized through the adaptive filter indicating the well applicability of the gpr method and the adaptive filter furthermore the gpr method has several practical advantages shorter labor time securer and safer during survey and better resolution of measured data 6 conclusions to eliminate risks encountered by the hydrographic surveyors during measurements the non contact instruments and methods will become the mainstream trend for the measurements on the stream cross sections usgs 1999 plotted an ultimate streamgaging station that measures the stream without any contact this study developed a procedure that realized the usgs future streamgaging the gpr measurement is a non contact method in which the instrument itself and connecting cables do not contact the water body significantly reducing risk when measurements are being conducted this study employed the adaptive filter to construct a determining mechanism for the gpr data to reduce difficulties in data interpretation to select a measuring point for a sounding weight it s necessary to address the characteristic point of a cross section the cross sectional line is artificially constructed by connecting each measuring point forming a discontinuous cross section risks for manually selecting the measuring points include omissions of critical data during the high flow and deformations of streambed the stream cross section measured by the gpr method is continuous without interruption surveyors do not need to select characteristic points which makes it possible to eliminate omissions of any critical data these advantages of the gpr method do not only simplify the task for measuring stream cross sections but also process the mega data and spatial data by combining the gpr method with the adaptive filter from the field survey no significant differences have been obtained between the non contact method with the gpr method and the adaptive filter and the contact method with a sounding weight furthermore the gpr method not only improves the security and safety during hydrological surveying but also the cost and time efficiency during a flood event it may potentially be used to register the erosion and deposition processes moreover in the near future one may integrate this automatic and non contact stream cross section measuring method with non contact velocimeter into an automatic stream gaging for obtaining the flow discharge during a flood event credit authorship contribution statement yen chang chen conceptualization methodology writing original draft su pai kao

4426,aquifers with time variant catchment boundaries regional flows and inflows from surface streams and accumulations are common in karst areas due to the lack of reliable methods for determination of water balance in the phreatic zone of such aquifers groundwater recharge estimation is a challenge task this paper introduces a new method for estimation of groundwater recharge in karst the so called partial correlation method pcm the basic hypothesis is that the groundwater recharge rates can be determined from the time series of precipitation air temperature relative humidity and spring discharge by using a partial cross correlation function as objective function following this hypothesis a simple conceptual model of water balance in the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone is developed and an objective function for estimation of the optimal value of parameter of this model is proposed pcm is applied on the catchment of žrnovnica spring located in the dinaric karst area of croatia the results of application are compared with the results of previous studies as well as with the results obtained by five empirical models that have been used for estimation of groundwater recharge in the mediterranean karst the effective infiltration coefficients obtained by pcm for the žrnovnica spring are generally in accordance with the previously published ones keywords karst hydrology groundwater recharge partial cross correlation function conceptual hydrological model water balance objective function 1 introduction groundwater recharge is defined as the portion of total precipitation that ultimately reaches the water table in the phreatic zone of an aquifer infiltration surface runoff and evapotranspiration are crucial hydrological processes for the groundwater recharge understanding and modelling wu et al 1996 1997 de vries and simmers 2002 all these processes are highly variable in space and time the process of groundwater recharge in karst is significantly different from non karst regions e g milanović 1981 bonacci 1987 ford and williams 2007 generally the surface runoff can be generated by infiltration excess saturation excess from subsurface layers or its combination calvo cases et al 2003 li et al 2011 carlier et al 2018 the karst catchments are often characterized by a thin soil cover epikarst with high infiltration capacity and vadose and phreatic zone containing networks of fractures fissures and conduits williams 1983 2008 bakalowicz 1995 perrin et al 2003 hartmann et al 2014 depending on the capacity of these voids and the rainfall intensity certain amount of water rapidly flows towards the phreatic zone while the rest of it remains in the epikarst and vadose zone from which it slowly evaporates or percolates such structure has significant influence on the process of transformation of precipitation to groundwater recharge e g plummer et al 1998 aquilina et al 2005 lange et al 2010 peng and wang 2012 liu et al 2020a so the complete lack of surface runoff is a basic characteristic of many karst catchments most often three components can be identified in groundwater recharge of karst systems white 2002 1 diffuse infiltration entering the phreatic zone slowly through the soil cover and the fracture and matrix permeability of the underlying carbonate bedrock 2 internal runoff into closed depressions where the water enters the phreatic zone quickly through the sinkhole drains and 3 concentrated recharge through the ponors or swallets the first two components represent autogenic recharge the third component is allogenic recharge which is the result of surface streams generated on the catchment non karstic parts that flow directly to the adjacent soluble carbonate bedrock e g through ponors sometimes additional components also exist such as regional groundwater flows from karst aquifers located at higher elevations e g milanović 1986 sauter 1992 terzić et al 2014 overflows from perched aquifers weiss and gvirtzman 2007 or groundwater exchanges between neighboring karst springs with overlapping catchments the term overlapping illustrates the existence of parts of catchment gravitating temporarily or permanently to two or several karst springs e g bonacci 1999 bonacci et al 2019 denić jukić et al 2020 ravbar et al 2011 stroj et al 2020 kovačić and ravbar 2016 petrić 2010 since the groundwater recharge cannot be measured directly it is estimated based on groundwater levels hydrological and hydrometeorological data as well as the results of hydrological geological and hydrogeological investigations scanlon et al 2002 it can be estimated on daily monthly or annual basis and it can be expressed in rates or coefficients the effective infiltration coefficient is defined as the ratio between groundwater recharge and precipitation the runoff coefficient is defined as the ratio between runoff and precipitation these two coefficients are probably the most significant hydrological coefficients which provide basic information about the rainfall runoff transformation e g merz et al 2006 merz and bloschl 2009 zhang et al 2014 crow et al 2019 liu et al 2020a in karst the runoff is generated by the discharge from karst springs at catchment scale assuming that the groundwater recharge is equal to the discharge from karst springs during a long period the effective infiltration coefficient and the runoff coefficients are the same various methods have been used for groundwater recharge estimation in karst the simplest method is the estimation by empirical models i e by empirical expressions between precipitation and runoff that were developed from the meteorological and hydrological data collected globally or regionally e g turc 1954 kessler 1967 santoro 1970 srebrenović 1986 žugaj 1995 lebecherel et al 2013 schmidt et al 2013 barreiras and ribeiro 2019 borzi et al 2020 a common characteristic of other methods is a mass balance calculation which can be carried out on the daily monthly or annual basis for the water or tracers for the entire aquifer or separately for the soil cover epikarst vadose zone and phreatic zone examples of such approaches include hydrograph separation method bonacci 2001 various conceptual models e g jocson et al 2002 perrin et al 2003 tritz et al 2011 physically based models accounting for the spatial variability of parameters contractor and jenson 2000 weiss and gvirtzman 2007 hartmann et al 2012 mudarra et al 2019 coupled water balance models sophocleous 1991 sheffer et al 2010 zagana et al 2007 chloride mass balance models marei et al 2010 as well as various integrated approaches e g andreo et al 2008 allocca et al 2014 ries et al 2015 concerning the soil cover the water balance approach assumes that the precipitation left after evapotranspiration is accumulated in the soil and when the soil capacity is reached water begins to percolate through the vadose zone towards the phreatic zone rushton and ward 1979 the water lost in the process of evapotranspiration is estimated by measurements or by empirical equations e g wu et al 1996 pandey et al 2016 the soil capacity is determined from the observation of total discharge and precipitation falling on the catchment which implies that the catchment size should be known this approach can be applied also to the epikarst jukić and denić jukić 2009 however the problem of water balance estimation is much more complicated for the phreatic zone the area of topographically delineated catchment is usually completely different from the apparent or effective catchment area required for the water balance hartmann et al 2013 liu et al 2020b inflows from surface streams and accumulations regional flows groundwater exchanges with adjacent catchments through underground piracy routes as well as catchment boundaries dependent on groundwater levels are common in karst all the above cause difficulties in identifying groundwater basins and estimating water balance for the phreatic zone due to the lack of information a precise catchment delineation and groundwater balance most often are not possible to be achieved in karst consequently the soil capacity can be determined directly from the observation of total discharge and precipitation only for the karst catchments showing simple geological structures and clear boundaries soulios 1984 otherwise the soil and epikarst capacities are estimated indirectly by using for example conceptual models jukić and denić jukić 2009 željković and kadić 2015 composite

role in studies of karst hydrological systems during the last decades this method was most frequently based on the determination of correlation coefficients and correlation functions e g mangin 1984 padilla and pulido bosch 1995 larocque et al 1998 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 gill et al 2013 bailly comte et al 2008 2011 mayaud et al 2014 dufoyer et al 2019 partial correlation functions are a relatively new mathematical tool of correlation analysis that has been used in karst hydrology during the last ten years to resolve some ambiguities in correlation functions and to provide additional information about the effects of meteorological and hydrological parameters on karst spring discharge e g denić jukić et al 2020 jukić and denić jukić 2011 2015 kadić et al 2018 2019 however the practical applicability of these functions is still insufficiently explored the most recent investigations show that a partial cross correlation function can be used as an objective function this approach was applied in medicine to assess controlled directed interactions between the cardiac respiratory and brain activities marzbanrad et al 2020 this paper presents an alternative method for groundwater recharge estimation that is based on a water balance in the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone the basic hypothesis is that the groundwater recharge rates can be determined from the hydrological and meteorological time series by using a partial cross correlation function as the objective function the method is applied to the karst catchment of žrnovnica spring located in croatia the aims of this research are the following 1 introduction of a new method for groundwater recharge estimation in karst including the first application of a partial cross correlation function as an objective function in hydrology 2 analysis of the applicability of empirical models applied to the mediterranean karst for the estimation of groundwater recharge in the dinaric karst and 3 extension of the existing hydrological knowledge about the žrnovnica spring 2 study area and data the žrnovnica spring is situated in vicinity of the city of split on the adriatic sea coast fig 1 the water emerges in the foothill of mosor mountain at the contact of the coastal flysch belt and the carbonate rocks in the hinterland the spring zone consists of three permanent and six temporary springs which emerge at different elevations from 78 to 90 m a s l depending on the groundwater level in the karst aquifer the žrnovnica spring is an adjacent spring of the much larger and more significant jadro spring that has been used for water supply since the roman time geological hydrogeological and other information about these two springs are described in several publications e g magdalenić 1971 fritz 1981 bonacci et al 1998 kapelj et al 2011 2013 bonacci and andrić 2015a 2015b loborec et al 2015 consequently only a short summary of basic hydrological characteristics and tracer tests are presented hereafter the catchment is in the dinaric karst at altitudes between 261 m a s l in dugopolje and 1339 m a s l on the mosor mountain it is dominantly composed of permeable carbonate rocks limestone and dolomite the topographic catchment area of žrnovnica spring is only 8 4 km2 and it is significantly different from the effective catchment area that is estimated between 40 and 83 km2 bonacci 1987 denić jukić et al 2007 jukić and denić jukić 2008 bonacci et al 1998 bonacci and andrić 2015a 2015b a reliable hydrological delineation between the catchment of žrnovnica spring and the catchment of jadro spring does not exist and probably it depends on groundwater levels hypothetical boundaries of the entire catchment of the two springs enclosing approximately 450 km2 are presented in fig 1 the northern and the southern boundaries of this catchment are relatively accurate the northern boundary is the complete hydrogeological barrier of clastic impermeable deposits located north of the mućko polje whereas the southern boundary is the hydrogeological barrier of the coastal region the western boundary delineation is based on less confident indicators kapelj et al 2013 so it is generally unreliable the assumed eastern boundary is in the vicinity of the cetina river and it is determined mostly by tracer tests the first tracer test was carried out in 1963 by injecting the tracer inside the ponor grabov mlin which is located near the right bank of cetina river this test confirmed underground connections between the riverbed of cetina river and both springs tracer appeared at the jadro spring after 23 days and 16 days later at the žrnovnica spring after heavy rainfall about 95 8 of injected tracer appeared at the jadro spring and only 3 1 at the žrnovnica spring the tracer test performed in 1978 confirmed underground connections between these two springs and the ponor jablan situated in the eastern part of mućko polje apparent groundwater flow velocities were 10 6 cm s towards the jadro spring and 12 2 cm s towards the žrnovnica spring the ponor ponikva situated in the srijansko polje was used for tracer tests in 1992 results revealed that only 2 3 of injected tracer appeared at the jadro spring and 87 7 at the žrnovnica spring apparent groundwater flow velocities were 3 8 cm s and 3 1 cm s for the springs jadro and žrnovnica respectively the tracer test of the ponor postinje situated in the western part of mućko polje was performed in 2008 it revealed that this part of mućko polje is shared between the jadro spring and the adjacent karst catchments of the ribnik spring near the morinje bay and the mandrača spring near the town of marina apparent groundwater flow velocity towards the jadro spring was 0 55 cm s the last tracer test was performed in 2010 tracer was injected in the ponor bazin which is situated in the bisko polje about 76 3 of the injected tracer was observed at the jadro spring and only 3 5 at the žrnovnica spring apparent groundwater flow velocities were 6 7 and 1 9 cm s for the springs jadro and žrnovnica respectively in addition to these tests several tracer tests were carried out in boreholes to improve the understanding of the catchment hydrological functioning these results are also presented in fig 1 the climate on the catchment is typical mediterranean with very warm and relatively dry summers annual average air temperature is about 13 c temperature maximum exceeds 38 c in summer annual precipitation varies in a large range between 800 and 2100 mm depending on location while the average is about 1300 mm during the period of natural flow in the cetina river before 1961 the žrnovnica spring occasionally dried up in dry seasons the construction of hydroelectric power plants along the cetina river had a strong influence on the hydrological regime of this river bonacci and roje bonacci 2003 and both springs the capacity of the jadro spring increased and the žrnovnica spring has never dried up since 1961 bonacci 1987 however a reliable time series of discharge from that period does not exist as the hydrological station located downstream of the žrnovnica spring started with operation in 1990 in this research the following data are used 1 daily rainfall from the rain gauges in dugopolje p d muć p m dicmo p c and bisko p b 2 daily rainfall p s daily mean air temperature t and daily mean relative humidity rh from the nearest available meteorological station in sinj and 3 daily mean discharge from the žrnovnica spring q graphical presentations of these time series are in fig 2 a 2e basic statistical characteristics of the time series for period from 1 8 1995 to 31 7 2017 are presented in table 1 during this period daily mean air temperature at the meteorological station in sinj ranged from 7 7 to 30 4 c with the mean value for entire period of 13 1 c seasonal oscillations of daily mean relative humidity were approximately between 50 in summer and 90 in winter where the minimum mean and maximum values for entire period were 22 69 and 100 respectively the maximum value of daily mean discharge from the žrnovnica spring was observed in february 2015 17 0 m3 s minimums were not below 0 30 m3 s the mean discharge from the žrnovnica springs for entire period is 1 86 m3 s spatial distribution of rainfall on the catchment is non uniform the minimum value of the mean daily rainfall is obtained for the rain gauge in sinj 3 18 mm which corresponds to a mean annual rainfall of 1161 mm the rain gauge with the most abundant rainfall is in bisko which is situated close to the assumed eastern catchment boundary the mean daily rainfall at this location is 4 19 mm which corresponds to a mean annual rainfall of 1531 mm the maximum daily rainfall of 199 mm was also observed at this location in january 2010 the rain gauge in dugopolje which is the closest to the žrnovnica spring has a mean daily rainfall of 3 59 mm it is equivalent to the mean annual rainfall of 1311 mm that represents approximately the average annual rainfall on the catchment fig 3 a 3c present the annual values of rainfall air temperature and spring discharge for 22 hydrological years from 1995 96 to 2016 17 it is assumed that a hydrological year starts on 1 august and ends on 31 july in this time of the year soil cover and epikarst are usually dry so the initial conditions for annual water balance calculations are approximately fulfilled significant annual variations in the rainfall and discharge are evident annual rainfall ranges from 798 mm during the hydrological year 2011 12 to 1798 mm during the hydrological year 2009 10 for dugopolje and from 961 mm during the hydrological year 2011 12 to even 2155 mm during the hydrological year 2008 09 for bisko annual mean discharge is between 1 12 and 2 64 m3 s and it can be noted that the minimum value is not obtained for 2011 12 but for 2016 17 that has annual rainfall of 1091 mm for dugopolje and 1106 mm for bisko annual mean air temperature ranges between 12 3 and 14 2 c 3 methods 3 1 water balance model wbm assuming that soil cover epikarst and vadose zone can be analyzed integral as one storage fig 4 the water balance at the karst surface can be expressed in the form of daily inputs and outputs 1 p o r r e et ks where p o is the precipitations et ks is the evapotranspiration from karst surface r e is the recharge of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone and r represents the water that ultimately reaches the water table of the phreatic zone i e groundwater recharge it can be noted that et ks can be expressed as 2 et ks e t l e where et is the actual evapotranspiration and l e is the evaporation from the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone so the following equation for calculation of the groundwater recharge can be obtained 3 r p o l e e t r e the values of l e et and r e are defined by water availability they depend on the existence of an excess water e or a water deficit d which are determined as 4 e p o et p d et p p o where et p is a potential evapotranspiration in this conceptual model the potential evapotranspiration is estimated by using the expression of eagleman 1967 adjusted for daily values et p 0 0292 c t p s 100 r h 1 2 p s 6 109 e 17 625 t 243 04 t 5 c t 0 63 t 0 c 0 63 0 024 t 0 t 21 c 1 13 t 21 c where p s is the saturation vapor pressure hpa c t is the vegetative factor t is an air temperature c and rh is a relative humidity the obtained daily potential evapotranspiration is in mm it is assumed that the evaporation from the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone depends on their saturation in the following way 6 l e 0 d 0 d s e s ce 0 d s e s e d s e where s e is a water stored in the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone storage and s ce is a capacity of this storage the recharge of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone depends on the excess water 7 r e 0 e 0 e 0 e s ce s e s ce s e e s ce s e the actual evapotranspiration also depends on the excess water 8 et et p e 0 p o l e e 0 the resulting daily difference in the stored water is 9 δ s e r e l e for an initial value of the stored water s e daily precipitations p o and daily mean values t and rh observed during an analyzed period daily groundwater recharge rates r are estimated consecutively this conceptual model has only one parameter the capacity of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone s ce the optimal value of s ce is obtained by partial correlation method 3 2 partial correlation method pcm let p o represent a time series of daily precipitation observed on the catchment of a karst spring r represents a time series of daily groundwater recharge estimated from precipitation p o p represents a time series of daily precipitation registered at a neighboring location inside the catchment and q represents a time series of daily discharge from the karst spring for time series of length n the covariance function between p and q is defined by 10 c pq k 1 n t 1 n k p t μ p q t k μ q k 0 1 2 m where μ p and μ q are the means of p and q respectively the truncation point m determinates the domain of this function i e the time interval in which the analysis is carried out it is recommended that m n 3 the cross correlation function ccf between series p and q is 11 r pq k c pq k σ p σ q k 0 c qp k σ p σ q k 0 where σ p and σ q are the standard deviations of p and q respectively the groundwater recharge r controls the discharge q so the linear effect of r can be removed from r pq k by calculating the partial cross correlation function pccf 12 r pq r k r pq k r pr r rq k 1 r pr 2 k 1 r rq 2 k where r pr k is the ccf between series p and r obtained by replacing q with r in eq 11 r rq k is the ccf between series r and q obtained by replacing p with r in eq 11 and where r pr is the correlation coefficient between time series p and r obtained as r pr r pr 0 the confidence interval for pccf is the same as for ccf which means that the lower and upper limits can be estimated to recognize statistically significant values of pccf e g banik and kibria 2016 approximately 95 confidence limits are 2 n the effect of the time series r is investigated by comparing r pq k and r pq r k generally the values of r pq r k can be the same lower or higher than r pq k and theoretically five types of effects can be distinguished at a lag k 1 explanation effect r pq r k 0 time series r is correlated with q and time series p is uncorrelated with r and q 2 control effect r pq r k 0 time series r is correlated with q and p is also correlated with q because of spurious correlation between p and r but p has no effect on q 3 partial explanation effect 0 r pq r k r pq k time series r and p both are correlated with q and p and r affects q 4 no effect r pq r k r pq k there is no correlation between r and the other two time series 5 suppression effect r pq r k r pq k time series r is correlated with only one of the other two time series or r has hypothetically a positive correlation through one path and a negative through the other path r pr 0 or r rq k 0 however in practical applications where p and p o are two correlated time series of precipitations observed at two neighboring locations inside a catchment of karst spring it can be noted that only a partial explanation effect can be expected if precipitation p is observed outside of the karst spring catchment then a control effect may be obtained generally the stronger linear relationship between r and q implies the lower value of partial cross correlation function r pq r k i e when the estimated groundwater recharge r approaches to the value of actual recharge ra then r pq r k becomes minimal or statistically insignificant consequently the following objective function for the estimation of daily groundwater recharge is proposed 13 f s ce k 0 l r pq r s ce k where l is a length of partial correlation effect whereas r s ce is a time series of groundwater recharge estimated by wbm for a capacity of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone s ce if r s ce r a then f s ce m i n which means that the optimal value of parameter s ce can be obtained by minimization of f s ce the calculation procedure includes the following steps 1 selection of the time series p o which represents the precipitation on the analyzed catchment 2 selection of the input time series p which represents the precipitation observed at a rain gauge inside the catchment 3 selection of the length of partial correlation effect l 4 determination of the control time series of groundwater recharge r s ce j from the precipitation p o by using wbm for various values of parameter s ce j j 1 2 5 calculation of the values of objective function f s ce j for each j 6 identification of the optimal value of parameter s ce o that gives the minimum value of objective function the corresponding time series r o r s ce o represents the best estimate of groundwater recharge according to pcm using daily time series r o the effective infiltration coefficient for a period of m days can be determined 14 eic t 1 m r o t t 1 m p o t as well as the effective catchment area 15 eca t 1 m q t t 1 m r o t where the subscript t denotes the value for the t th day 3 3 empirical models the results of application of pcm are compared with the results obtained by five empirical models the first is the model of turc 1954 which reliability has been confirmed by several studies in the mediterranean area with humid climate allocca et al 2014 annual runoff deficit d expressed in mm is estimated by 16 d p 0 9 p 2 l 2 0 5 l 300 25 t 0 05 t 3 where p is an annual precipitation mm t is an annual average air temperature oc whereas l represents atmospheric evapotranspiration power annual groundwater recharge is obtained as r p d and it is also expressed in mm in addition to this original turc formulation a correction of the annual average air temperature is sometimes performed to consider the effect of humidity on evapotranspiration rate borzi et al 2020 the result is a modified turc formulation 17 d p 0 9 p 2 l 2 0 5 l 300 25 t 0 05 t 3 t i 1 12 p i t i i 1 12 p i where p i is monthly precipitation mm and t i is monthly average air temperature oc this model is recommended for application on catchments with arid and semi arid climate a specific form of the modified turc formulation was proposed by santoro 1970 for application in sicilian basins where a correction of the expression for atmospheric evapotranspiration power is also performed 18 l 586 10 t 0 05 t 3 the fourth model used in this research is the empirical expression of srebrenović 1986 which is the result of analyses carried out in the karst and non karst areas of former yugoslavia mostly having the continental climate annual runoff coefficient is obtained as 19 c 0 88 215 f p 420 p where f is a factor of karst which actually represents a ratio between the area of catchment influenced by karst and the total catchment area annual runoff is obtained as r c p the last model is the one of žugaj 1995 which is the result of analyses performed in the karst area of croatia annual effective precipitation is estimated by the following expressions 20 p ef 0 83 p 250 p efl 0 68 p 205 p efu 0 98 p 300 where p efl and p efu are the lower and upper limits of estimated values all expressed in mm annual groundwater recharge is equivalent to annual effective precipitation from this point forward the following general rule for the notation of functions is used n a m e x y z where n a m e is a function abbreviation ccf or pccf x is an input time series y is an output time series and z is a control time series for example the partial cross correlation function r pq p o k is presented as p c c f p q p o 4 results in this research the control time series of groundwater recharge r s ce in eq 13 is estimated by wbm from the daily rainfall observed at the rain gauge in dugopolje p d which is the closest to the žrnovnica spring fig 1 it is assumed that this rainfall time series represents adequately the temporal variations in daily rainfall on the catchment of žrnovnica spring it is assumed also that the regime of air temperature and relative humidity on the catchment can be represented by the time series observed at the meteorological station in sinj the input time series p in eq 13 is selected between the rainfall time series observed at three available neighboring rain gauges located in muć p m dicmo p c and bisko p b by using partial cross correlation functions as criterium where the stronger linear relationship between rainfall and discharge implies the higher value of partial cross correlation function the cross correlation functions between the rainfall time series p m p c p b and the discharge time series q as well as the corresponding partial cross correlation functions obtained by using rainfall p d as the control time series are presented in fig 5 the response of spring to rainfall is fast so the maximal correlations are obtained for lags 0 and 1 day it can be noted that c c f p d q c c f p m q c c f p c q and c c f p b q are very similar which is a consequence of similar daily variations in rainfall and spurious correlations between rainfall observed at neighboring locations denić jukić et al 2020 however it is not the case with the partial cross correlation functions the obtained results show that a relationship between the rainfall observed in dicmo and the discharge of žrnovnica spring practically does not exist because p c c f p c q p d is statistically insignificant evidently the rain gauge in dicmo is situated in the part catchment that has not a direct underground connection to the žrnovnica spring so the time series p c is not convenient for application concerning the other two time series it is clear that p c c f p b q p d has higher values than p c c f p m q p d i e the rainfall observed at the rain gauge in bisko has stronger linear relationship with the discharge of žrnovnica spring consequently the time series of rainfall p b is used as the input time series the selection of the length of partial correlation effect l in eq 13 is arbitrary however for the range of values of l between 1 and 20 days sensitivity analysis revealed that the resulting difference in effective infiltration coefficient eic is about 5 consequently the length l is determined by calibration the available period is divided in two subperiods 1995 2006 and 2006 2017 each embracing 11 hydrological years basic statistical characteristics of time series p d p b t rh and q for these two periods are presented in tables 2 and 3 although the second period has about 10 larger total rainfall it can be noted that the difference in the mean discharge is only 3 statistical characteristics of air temperature and relative humidity for two periods are similar the length l is determined assuming that the optimal values of capacity s ce should be similar for both periods the length of partial correlation effect that gives the smallest difference between the optimal values for two periods is l 9 days which practically corresponds to the duration of the quick flow component fig 5 the objective functions obtained for three analyzed periods are presented in fig 6 all functions are smooth and their minimums are evident the optimal values of capacity s ce are 60 67 and 64 mm for periods 1995 2006 2006 2017 and 1995 2017 respectively however the lower part of the curve for period 1995 2006 is quite flat which indicates the uncertainty associated to the choice of the minimum value for this period such results may be obtained when wbm is unable to simulate the groundwater recharge with sufficient accuracy so a wide range of values of parameter s ce produces similar groundwater recharge rates more evident minimum for this period probably would be obtained by using a more complex water balance model the time series of daily groundwater recharge r o determined by wbm for s ce 64 mm is presented in fig 7 a comparing the groundwater recharge r o in fig 7a with the spring discharge q in fig 7b it can be noted a good correspondence between the periods without groundwater recharge and the recession periods in discharge which indicates that the obtained time series of daily groundwater recharge explains correctly temporal variations in the discharge of žrnovnica spring in fig 7c the annual values of eic calculated from the groundwater recharge obtained by pcm are compared with the annual values obtained by empirical models of turc modified turc santoro srebrenović and žugaj the annual precipitation in the empirical models is calculated from the daily rainfall observed at the rain gauge in dugopolje and the annual average air temperature from the daily values observed at the meteorological station in sinj the lower and upper limits for estimated values determined by žugaj 1995 are also presented it can be noted that the results of pcm are located inside these limits and they are very similar to the results obtained by the model of santoro the model of srebrenović produces the highest eic but all values are still below the upper limit on the other hand the lowest values of eic are obtained by the model of turc these values are mostly located below the lower limit the hydrological parameters of žrnovnica spring catchment obtained for three analyzed periods are summarized in table 4 the values of eic estimated by pcm are practically identical for all three periods about 0 60 whereas the values of eca range between 71 7 and 77 8 km2 the results obtained by empirical models for three analyzed periods range widely from 0 484 to 0 717 for eic and from 60 2 to even 96 6 km2 for eca the lowest value of eca is obtained by the model of srebrenović the highest by the model of turc 5 discussion in this research daily groundwater recharge rates are estimated from the daily time series of rainfall air temperature relative humidity and spring discharge by using a simple conceptual model of water balance in the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone it is assumed that the evaporation from soil cover epikarst and vadose zone depends on their saturation the optimal value of parameter is determined by using the proposed partial cross correlation function as objective function since pcm has the background in partial correlation permanent inflows from surface streams and reservoirs permanent regional flows random changes of catchment boundaries or random groundwater exchanges with neighboring aquifers have minor impact on the accuracy of result for a long period although they can change completely the groundwater balance pcm has two drawbacks the first is linearity a correlation coefficient measures the linear part of the relationship between two time series a partial correlation coefficient measures the correlation that remains between the two initial time series once the variance explained by the control time series has been removed from each of them it implies that only the linear part of the relationship between groundwater recharge and karst spring discharge is detected by pcm consequently more reliable results are expected for the karst catchments with scarce soil cover and vegetation and the highly karstified aquifers where the retention capacity of surface layers is small and the response of karst spring to rainfall is fast the second is the required time series length generally more reliable results are obtained for longer periods it is recommended that the analyzed period should be longer than 10 years to obtain a smooth form for the objective function and an evident minimum anyway the uncertainties associated to the choice of the minimum values exist so it is better sometime to consider ranges where the curve is at a minimum value rather than a point the impact of uncertainties on the results depends significantly on the analyzed period usually an increase or decrease of 10 mm in the value of parameter s ce may change the value of eic between 2 and 3 the values of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone capacity obtained by pcm for the žrnovnica spring range between 60 and 67 mm the objective function obtained for the entire period 1995 2017 has the single global minimum located at the value of 64 mm these values are similar to the value of 57 mm obtained previously by the spectral method jukić and denić jukić 2008 comparing to other karst catchments soulios 1984 found that the soil moisture capacities in greece karst regions range between 10 and 60 mm sauter 1992 estimated that the storage capacity of epikarst in the swabian alb of southern germany is between 20 and 33 mm perrin et al 2003 provided an analysis of the relative role of soil cover and epikarst in a catchment in switzerland and noted that the soil moisture storage may amount to about 140 mm željković and kadić 2015 used the value of 120 mm for the estimation of groundwater balance for the opačac spring in croatia the value of eic is controlled by several factors such as slope steepness vegetation soil type and thickness land use development of epikarst as well as composition and fracturing of deeper carbonate rocks several estimations were carried out for karst catchments in italy boni et al 1982 greece soulios 1984 france drogue 1972 and croatia bonacci 2001 finding values ranging from 0 35 to 0 76 allocca 2014 the mean values of eic obtained for the žrnovnica spring are 0 61 jukić and denić jukić 2008 and 0 54 bonacci and andrić 2015b the results of pcm 0 60 are in accordance with the previous values the value of eca for the žrnovnica spring was estimated in several studies and the obtained results range widely from 40 km2 bonacci 1987 bonacci et al 1998 78 83 km2 denić jukić et al 2007 to 70 80 km2 bonacci and andrić 2015a 2015b the mean eca for the žrnovnica spring obtained by pcm for period 1995 2017 is about 75 km2 result obtained by using the rainfall observed in dugopolje comparison with five empirical methods for the estimation of effective infiltration shows that pcm produces about 5 lower values of eic than the model of žugaj which was determined from the hydrological data collected in dinaric karst of croatia in contrast the model of srebrenović based on hydrological data mostly collected in the continental part of former yugoslavia including non karst catchments probably overestimates eic because all calculated values are close to the upper limit the worst correspondence with pcm is the original model of turc which is a global empirical model developed by using hydrological data from even 254 catchments and which has not been specifically designed for karst the turc model tends to underestimate the actual values of eic for the žrnovnica spring it should be noted that several studies attempted to regionalize this model improve efficiency and extend its applicability e g lebecherel et al 2013 borzi et al 2020 in this research two modified formulations were applied the first considers the effect of humidity by using a corrected value of annual average air temperature the values of eic obtained by this model are located above or close to the lower limit so it produces more adequate results for application on the žrnovnica spring than the original model of turc the model of santoro provides the closest results to the ones obtained by the pcm approach in this empirical model the annual average air temperature and the atmospheric evapotranspiration power are both corrected 6 conclusion pcm is proposed for estimation of groundwater recharge in karst daily groundwater recharge rates are determined from meteorological and hydrological time series by a simple conceptual model of water balance this model has only one parameter the capacity of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone the optimal value of parameter is determined by minimization of the partial cross correlation function where the input time series is precipitation from a neighboring location the output time series is discharge from spring and the control time series is groundwater recharge determined by the conceptual model the uncertainties associated to the choice of the minimum values of the proposed objective function exist when the conceptual model is unable to simulate groundwater recharge with sufficient accuracy more reliable results are expected for the highly karstified aquifers and the karst catchments with scarce soil cover and vegetation the results of application of pcm are compared with previous studies as well as with the results of five empirical models that have been used for estimation of groundwater recharge in the mediterranean karst the results obtained for the žrnovnica spring are generally in accordance with the previously published ones the estimated mean eca for this spring is about 75 km2 whereas the mean eic is about 0 60 credit authorship contribution statement damir jukić conceptualization methodology software writing review editing vesna denić jukić

4426,aquifers with time variant catchment boundaries regional flows and inflows from surface streams and accumulations are common in karst areas due to the lack of reliable methods for determination of water balance in the phreatic zone of such aquifers groundwater recharge estimation is a challenge task this paper introduces a new method for estimation of groundwater recharge in karst the so called partial correlation method pcm the basic hypothesis is that the groundwater recharge rates can be determined from the time series of precipitation air temperature relative humidity and spring discharge by using a partial cross correlation function as objective function following this hypothesis a simple conceptual model of water balance in the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone is developed and an objective function for estimation of the optimal value of parameter of this model is proposed pcm is applied on the catchment of žrnovnica spring located in the dinaric karst area of croatia the results of application are compared with the results of previous studies as well as with the results obtained by five empirical models that have been used for estimation of groundwater recharge in the mediterranean karst the effective infiltration coefficients obtained by pcm for the žrnovnica spring are generally in accordance with the previously published ones keywords karst hydrology groundwater recharge partial cross correlation function conceptual hydrological model water balance objective function 1 introduction groundwater recharge is defined as the portion of total precipitation that ultimately reaches the water table in the phreatic zone of an aquifer infiltration surface runoff and evapotranspiration are crucial hydrological processes for the groundwater recharge understanding and modelling wu et al 1996 1997 de vries and simmers 2002 all these processes are highly variable in space and time the process of groundwater recharge in karst is significantly different from non karst regions e g milanović 1981 bonacci 1987 ford and williams 2007 generally the surface runoff can be generated by infiltration excess saturation excess from subsurface layers or its combination calvo cases et al 2003 li et al 2011 carlier et al 2018 the karst catchments are often characterized by a thin soil cover epikarst with high infiltration capacity and vadose and phreatic zone containing networks of fractures fissures and conduits williams 1983 2008 bakalowicz 1995 perrin et al 2003 hartmann et al 2014 depending on the capacity of these voids and the rainfall intensity certain amount of water rapidly flows towards the phreatic zone while the rest of it remains in the epikarst and vadose zone from which it slowly evaporates or percolates such structure has significant influence on the process of transformation of precipitation to groundwater recharge e g plummer et al 1998 aquilina et al 2005 lange et al 2010 peng and wang 2012 liu et al 2020a so the complete lack of surface runoff is a basic characteristic of many karst catchments most often three components can be identified in groundwater recharge of karst systems white 2002 1 diffuse infiltration entering the phreatic zone slowly through the soil cover and the fracture and matrix permeability of the underlying carbonate bedrock 2 internal runoff into closed depressions where the water enters the phreatic zone quickly through the sinkhole drains and 3 concentrated recharge through the ponors or swallets the first two components represent autogenic recharge the third component is allogenic recharge which is the result of surface streams generated on the catchment non karstic parts that flow directly to the adjacent soluble carbonate bedrock e g through ponors sometimes additional components also exist such as regional groundwater flows from karst aquifers located at higher elevations e g milanović 1986 sauter 1992 terzić et al 2014 overflows from perched aquifers weiss and gvirtzman 2007 or groundwater exchanges between neighboring karst springs with overlapping catchments the term overlapping illustrates the existence of parts of catchment

since the groundwater recharge cannot be measured directly it is estimated based on groundwater levels hydrological and hydrometeorological data as well as the results of hydrological geological and hydrogeological investigations scanlon et al 2002 it can be estimated on daily monthly or annual basis and it can be expressed in rates or coefficients the effective infiltration coefficient is defined as the ratio between groundwater recharge and precipitation the runoff coefficient is defined as the ratio between runoff and precipitation these two coefficients are probably the most significant hydrological coefficients which provide basic information about the rainfall runoff transformation e g merz et al 2006 merz and bloschl 2009 zhang et al 2014 crow et al 2019 liu et al 2020a in karst the runoff is generated by the discharge from karst springs at catchment scale assuming that the groundwater recharge is equal to the discharge from karst springs during a long period the effective infiltration coefficient and the runoff coefficients are the same various methods have been used for groundwater recharge estimation in karst the simplest method is the estimation by empirical models i e by empirical expressions between precipitation and runoff that were developed from the meteorological and hydrological data collected globally or regionally e g turc 1954 kessler

phreatic zone rushton and ward 1979 the water lost in the process of evapotranspiration is estimated by measurements or by empirical equations e g wu et al 1996 pandey et al 2016 the soil capacity is determined from the observation of total discharge and precipitation falling on the catchment which implies that the catchment size should be known this approach can be applied also to the epikarst jukić and denić jukić 2009 however the problem of water balance estimation is much more complicated for the phreatic zone the area of topographically delineated catchment is usually completely different from the apparent or effective catchment area required for the water balance hartmann et al 2013 liu et al 2020b inflows from surface streams and accumulations regional flows groundwater exchanges with adjacent catchments through underground piracy routes as well as catchment boundaries dependent on groundwater levels are common in karst all the above cause difficulties in identifying groundwater basins and estimating water balance for the phreatic zone due to the lack of information a precise catchment delineation and groundwater balance most often are not possible to be achieved in karst consequently the soil capacity can be determined directly from the observation of total discharge and precipitation only for the karst catchments showing simple geological structures and clear boundaries soulios 1984 otherwise the soil and epikarst capacities are estimated indirectly by using for example conceptual models jukić and denić jukić 2009 željković and kadić 2015 composite transfer functions denić jukić and jukić 2003 denić jukić et al 2007 or spectral method jukić and denić jukić 2004 2008 correlation analysis is a method of time series analysis that has an important role in studies of karst hydrological systems during the last decades this method was most frequently based on the determination of correlation coefficients and correlation functions e g mangin 1984 padilla and pulido bosch 1995 larocque et al 1998 panagopoulos and lambrakis 2006 gill et al 2013 bailly comte et al 2008 2011 mayaud et al 2014 dufoyer et al 2019 partial correlation functions are a relatively new mathematical tool of correlation analysis that has been used in karst hydrology during the last ten years to resolve some ambiguities in correlation functions and to provide additional information about the effects of meteorological and hydrological parameters on karst spring discharge e g denić jukić et al 2020 jukić and denić jukić 2011 2015 kadić et al 2018 2019 however the practical applicability of these functions is still insufficiently explored the most recent investigations show that a partial cross correlation function can be used as an objective function this approach was applied in medicine to assess controlled directed interactions between the cardiac respiratory and brain activities marzbanrad et al 2020 this paper presents an alternative method for groundwater recharge estimation that is based on a water balance in the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone the basic hypothesis is that the groundwater recharge rates can be determined from the hydrological and meteorological time series by using a partial cross correlation function as the objective function the method is applied to the karst catchment of žrnovnica spring located in croatia the aims of this research are the following 1 introduction of a new method for groundwater recharge estimation in karst including the first application of a partial cross correlation function as an objective function in hydrology 2 analysis of the applicability of empirical models applied to the mediterranean karst for the estimation of groundwater recharge in the dinaric karst and 3 extension of the existing hydrological knowledge about the žrnovnica spring 2 study area and data the žrnovnica spring is situated in vicinity of the city of split on the adriatic sea coast fig 1 the water emerges in the foothill of mosor mountain at the contact of the coastal flysch belt and the carbonate rocks in the hinterland the spring zone consists of three permanent and six temporary springs which emerge at different elevations from 78 to 90 m a s l depending on the groundwater level in the karst aquifer the žrnovnica spring is an adjacent spring of the much larger and more significant jadro spring that has been used for water supply since the roman time geological hydrogeological and other information about these two springs are described in several publications e g magdalenić 1971 fritz 1981 bonacci et al 1998 kapelj et al 2011 2013 bonacci and andrić 2015a 2015b loborec et al 2015 consequently only a short summary of basic hydrological characteristics and tracer tests are presented hereafter the catchment is in the dinaric karst at altitudes between 261 m a s l in dugopolje and 1339 m a s l on the mosor mountain it is dominantly composed of permeable carbonate rocks limestone and dolomite the topographic catchment area of žrnovnica spring is only 8 4 km2 and it is significantly different from the effective catchment area that is estimated between 40 and 83 km2 bonacci 1987 denić jukić et al 2007 jukić and denić jukić 2008 bonacci et al 1998 bonacci and andrić 2015a 2015b a reliable hydrological delineation between the catchment of žrnovnica spring and the catchment of jadro spring does not exist and probably it depends on groundwater levels hypothetical boundaries of the entire catchment of the two springs enclosing approximately 450 km2 are presented in fig 1 the northern and the southern boundaries of this catchment are relatively accurate the northern boundary is the complete hydrogeological barrier of clastic impermeable deposits located north of the mućko polje whereas the southern boundary is the hydrogeological barrier of the coastal region the western boundary delineation is based on less confident indicators kapelj et al 2013 so it is generally unreliable the assumed eastern boundary is in the vicinity of the cetina river and it is determined mostly by tracer tests the first tracer test was carried out in 1963 by injecting the tracer inside the ponor grabov mlin which is located near the right bank of cetina river this test confirmed underground connections between the riverbed of cetina river and both springs tracer appeared at the jadro spring after 23 days and 16 days later at the žrnovnica spring after heavy rainfall about 95 8 of injected tracer appeared at the jadro spring and only 3 1 at the žrnovnica spring the tracer test performed in 1978 confirmed underground connections between these two springs and the ponor jablan situated in the eastern part of mućko polje apparent groundwater flow velocities were 10 6 cm s towards the jadro spring and 12 2 cm s towards the žrnovnica spring the ponor ponikva situated in the srijansko polje was used for tracer tests in 1992 results revealed that only 2 3 of injected tracer appeared at the jadro spring and 87 7 at the žrnovnica spring apparent groundwater flow velocities were 3 8 cm s and 3 1 cm s for the springs jadro and žrnovnica respectively the tracer test of the ponor postinje situated in the western part of mućko polje was performed in 2008 it revealed that this part of mućko polje is shared between the jadro spring and the adjacent karst catchments of the ribnik spring near the morinje bay and the mandrača spring near the town of marina apparent groundwater flow velocity towards the jadro spring was 0 55 cm s the last tracer test was performed in 2010 tracer was injected in the ponor bazin which is situated in the bisko polje about 76 3 of the injected tracer was observed at the jadro spring and only 3 5 at the žrnovnica spring apparent groundwater flow velocities were 6 7 and 1 9 cm s for the springs jadro and žrnovnica respectively in addition to these tests several tracer tests were carried out in boreholes to improve the understanding of the catchment hydrological functioning these results are also presented in fig 1 the climate on the catchment is typical mediterranean with very warm and relatively dry summers annual average air temperature is about 13 c temperature maximum exceeds 38 c in summer annual precipitation varies in a large range between 800 and 2100 mm depending on location while the average is about 1300 mm during the period of natural flow in the cetina river before 1961 the žrnovnica spring occasionally dried up in dry seasons the construction of hydroelectric power plants along the cetina river had a strong influence on the hydrological regime of this river bonacci and roje bonacci 2003 and both springs the capacity of the jadro spring increased and the žrnovnica spring has never dried up since 1961 bonacci 1987 however a reliable time series of discharge from that period does not exist as the hydrological station located downstream of the žrnovnica spring started with operation in 1990 in this research the following data are used 1 daily rainfall from the rain gauges in dugopolje p d muć p m dicmo p c and bisko p b 2 daily rainfall p s daily mean air temperature t and daily mean relative humidity rh from the nearest available meteorological station in sinj and 3 daily mean discharge from the žrnovnica spring q graphical presentations of these time series are in fig 2 a 2e basic statistical characteristics of the time series for period from 1 8 1995 to 31 7 2017 are presented in table 1 during this period daily mean air temperature at the meteorological station in sinj ranged from 7 7 to 30 4 c with the mean value for entire period of 13 1 c seasonal oscillations of daily mean relative humidity were approximately between 50 in summer and 90 in winter where the minimum mean and maximum values for entire period were 22 69 and 100 respectively the maximum value of daily mean discharge from the žrnovnica spring was observed in february 2015 17 0 m3 s minimums were not below 0 30 m3 s the mean discharge from the žrnovnica springs for entire period is 1 86 m3 s spatial distribution of rainfall on the catchment is non uniform the minimum value of the mean daily rainfall is obtained for the rain gauge in sinj 3 18 mm which corresponds to a mean annual rainfall of 1161 mm the rain gauge with the most abundant rainfall is in bisko which is situated close to the assumed eastern catchment boundary the mean daily rainfall at this location is 4 19 mm which corresponds to a mean annual rainfall of 1531 mm the maximum daily rainfall of 199 mm was also observed at this location in january 2010 the rain gauge in dugopolje which is the closest to the žrnovnica spring has a mean daily rainfall of 3 59 mm it is equivalent to the mean annual rainfall of 1311 mm that represents approximately the average annual rainfall on the catchment fig 3 a 3c present the annual values of rainfall air temperature and spring discharge for 22 hydrological years from 1995 96 to 2016 17 it is assumed that a hydrological year starts on 1 august and ends on 31 july in this time of the year soil cover and epikarst are usually dry so the initial conditions for annual water balance calculations are approximately fulfilled significant annual variations in the rainfall and discharge are evident annual rainfall ranges from 798 mm during the hydrological year 2011 12 to 1798 mm during the hydrological year 2009 10 for dugopolje and from 961 mm during the hydrological year 2011 12 to even 2155 mm during the hydrological year 2008 09 for bisko annual mean discharge is between 1 12 and 2 64 m3 s and it can be noted that the minimum value is not obtained for 2011 12 but for 2016 17 that has annual rainfall of 1091 mm for dugopolje and 1106 mm for bisko annual mean air temperature ranges between 12 3 and 14 2 c 3 methods 3 1 water balance model wbm assuming that soil cover epikarst and vadose zone can be analyzed integral as one storage fig 4 the water balance at the karst surface can be expressed in the form of daily inputs and outputs 1 p o r r e et ks where p o is the precipitations et ks is the evapotranspiration from karst surface r e is the recharge of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone and r represents the water that ultimately reaches the water table of the phreatic zone i e groundwater recharge it can be noted that et ks can be expressed as 2 et ks e t l e where et is the actual evapotranspiration and l e is the evaporation from the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone so the following equation for calculation of the groundwater recharge can be obtained 3 r p o l e e t r e the values of l e et and r e are defined by water availability they depend on the existence of an excess water e or a water deficit d which are determined as 4 e p o et p d et p p o where et p is a potential evapotranspiration in this conceptual model the potential evapotranspiration is estimated by using the expression of eagleman 1967 adjusted for daily values et p 0 0292 c t p s 100 r h 1 2 p s 6 109 e 17 625 t 243 04 t 5 c t 0 63 t 0 c 0 63 0 024 t 0 t 21 c 1 13 t 21 c where p s is the saturation vapor pressure hpa c t is the vegetative factor t is an air temperature c and rh is a relative humidity the obtained daily potential evapotranspiration is in mm it is assumed that the evaporation from the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone depends on their saturation in the following way 6 l e 0 d 0 d s e s ce 0 d s e s e d s e where s e is a water stored in the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone storage and s ce is a capacity of this storage the recharge of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone depends on the excess water 7 r e 0 e 0 e 0 e s ce s e s ce s e e s ce s e the actual evapotranspiration also depends on the excess water 8 et et p e 0 p o l e e 0 the resulting daily difference in the stored water is 9 δ s e r e l e for an initial value of the stored water s e daily precipitations p o and daily mean values t and rh observed during an analyzed period daily groundwater recharge rates r are estimated consecutively this conceptual model has only one parameter the capacity of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone s ce the optimal value of s ce is obtained by partial correlation method 3 2 partial correlation method pcm let p o represent a time series of daily precipitation observed on the catchment of a karst spring r represents a time series of daily groundwater recharge estimated from precipitation p o p represents a time series of daily precipitation registered at a neighboring location inside the catchment and q represents a time series of daily discharge from the karst spring for time series of length n the covariance function between p and q is defined by 10 c pq k 1 n t 1 n k p t μ p q t k μ q k 0 1 2 m where μ p and μ q are the means of p and q respectively the truncation point m determinates the domain of this function i e the time interval in which the analysis is carried out it is recommended that m n 3 the cross correlation function ccf between series p and q is 11 r pq k c pq k σ p σ q k 0 c qp k σ p σ q k 0 where σ p and σ q are the standard deviations of p and q respectively the groundwater recharge r controls the discharge q so the linear effect of r can be removed from r pq k by calculating the partial cross correlation function pccf 12 r pq r k r pq k r pr r rq k 1 r pr 2 k 1 r rq 2 k where r pr k is the ccf between series p and r obtained by replacing q with r in eq 11 r rq k is the ccf between series r and q obtained by replacing p with r in eq 11 and where r pr is the correlation coefficient between time series p and r obtained as r pr r pr 0 the confidence interval for pccf is the same as for ccf which means that the lower and upper limits can be estimated to recognize statistically significant values of pccf e g banik and kibria 2016 approximately 95 confidence limits are 2 n the effect of the time series r is investigated by comparing r pq k and r pq r k generally the values of r pq r k can be the same lower or higher than r pq k and theoretically five types of effects can be distinguished at a lag k 1 explanation effect r pq r k 0 time series r is correlated with q and time series p is uncorrelated with r and q 2 control effect r pq r k 0 time series r is correlated with q and p is also correlated with q because of spurious correlation between p and r but p has no effect on q 3 partial explanation effect 0 r pq r k r pq k time series r and p both are correlated with q and p and r affects q 4 no effect r pq r k r pq k there is no correlation between r and the other two time series 5 suppression effect r pq r k r pq k time series r is correlated with only one of the other two time series or r has hypothetically a positive correlation through one path and a negative through the other path r pr 0 or r rq k 0 however in practical applications where p and p o are two correlated time series of precipitations observed at two neighboring locations inside a catchment of karst spring it can be noted that only a partial explanation effect can be expected if precipitation p is observed outside of the karst spring catchment then a control effect may be obtained generally the stronger linear relationship between r and q implies the lower value of partial cross correlation function r pq r k i e when the estimated groundwater recharge r approaches to the value of actual recharge ra then r pq r k becomes minimal or statistically insignificant consequently the following objective function for the estimation of daily groundwater recharge is proposed 13 f s ce k 0 l r pq r s ce k where l is a length of partial correlation effect whereas r s ce is a time series of groundwater recharge estimated by wbm for a capacity of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone s ce if r s ce r a then f s ce m i n which means that the optimal value of parameter s ce can be obtained by minimization of f s ce the calculation procedure includes the following steps 1 selection of the time series p o which represents the precipitation on the analyzed catchment 2 selection of the input time series p which represents the precipitation observed at a rain gauge inside the catchment 3 selection of the length of partial correlation effect l 4 determination of the control time series of groundwater recharge r s ce j from the precipitation p o by using wbm for various values of parameter s ce j j 1 2 5 calculation of the values of objective function f s ce j for each j 6 identification of the optimal value of parameter s ce o that gives the minimum value of objective function the corresponding time series r o r s ce o represents the best estimate of groundwater recharge according to pcm using daily time series r o the effective infiltration coefficient for a period of m days can be determined 14 eic t 1 m r o t t 1 m p o t as well as the effective catchment area 15 eca t 1 m q t t 1 m r o t where the subscript t denotes the value for the t th day 3 3 empirical models the results of application of pcm are compared with the results obtained by five empirical models the first is the model of turc 1954 which reliability has been confirmed by several studies in the mediterranean area with humid climate allocca et al 2014 annual runoff deficit d expressed in mm is estimated by 16 d p 0 9 p 2 l 2 0 5 l 300 25 t 0 05 t 3 where p is an annual precipitation mm t is an annual average air temperature oc whereas l represents atmospheric evapotranspiration power annual groundwater recharge is obtained as r p d and it is also expressed in mm in addition to this original turc formulation a correction of the annual average air temperature is sometimes performed to consider the effect of humidity on evapotranspiration rate borzi et al 2020 the result is a modified turc formulation 17 d p 0 9 p 2 l 2 0 5 l 300 25 t 0 05 t 3 t i 1 12 p i t i i 1 12 p i where p i is monthly precipitation mm and t i is monthly average air temperature oc this model is recommended for application on catchments with arid and semi arid climate a specific form of the modified turc formulation was proposed by santoro 1970 for application in sicilian basins where a correction of the expression for atmospheric evapotranspiration power is also performed 18 l 586 10 t 0 05 t 3 the fourth model used in this research is the empirical expression of srebrenović 1986 which is the result of analyses carried out in the karst and non karst areas of former yugoslavia mostly having the continental climate annual runoff coefficient is obtained as 19 c 0 88 215 f p 420 p where f is a factor of karst which actually represents a ratio between the area of catchment influenced by karst and the total catchment area annual runoff is obtained as r c p the last model is the one of žugaj 1995 which is the result of analyses performed in the karst area of croatia annual effective precipitation is estimated by the following expressions 20 p ef 0 83 p 250 p efl 0 68 p 205 p efu 0 98 p 300 where p efl and p efu are the lower and upper limits of estimated values all expressed in mm annual groundwater recharge is equivalent to annual effective precipitation from this point forward the following general rule for the notation of functions is used n a m e x y z where n a m e is a function abbreviation ccf or pccf x is an input time series y is an output time series and z is a control time series for example the partial cross correlation function r pq p o k is presented as p c c f p q p o 4 results in this research the control time series of groundwater recharge r s ce in eq 13 is estimated by wbm from the daily rainfall observed at the rain gauge in dugopolje p d which is the closest to the žrnovnica spring fig 1 it is assumed that this rainfall time series represents adequately the temporal variations in daily rainfall on the catchment of žrnovnica spring it is assumed also that the regime of air temperature and relative humidity on the catchment can be represented by the time series observed at the meteorological station in sinj the input time series p in eq 13 is selected between the rainfall time series observed at three available neighboring rain gauges located in muć p m dicmo p c and bisko p b by using partial cross correlation functions as criterium where the stronger linear relationship between rainfall and discharge implies the higher value of partial cross correlation function the cross correlation functions between the rainfall time series p m p c p b and the discharge time series q as well as the corresponding partial cross correlation functions obtained by using rainfall p d as the control time series are presented in fig 5 the response of spring to rainfall is fast so the maximal correlations are obtained for lags 0 and 1 day it can be noted that c c f p d q c c f p m q c c f p c q and c c f p b q are very similar which is a consequence of similar daily variations in rainfall and spurious correlations between rainfall observed at neighboring locations denić jukić et al 2020 however it is not the case with the partial cross correlation functions the obtained results show that a relationship between the rainfall observed in dicmo and the discharge of žrnovnica spring practically does not exist because p c c f p c q p d is statistically insignificant evidently the rain gauge in dicmo is situated in the part catchment that has not a direct underground connection to the žrnovnica spring so the time series p c is not convenient for application concerning the other two time series it is clear that p c c f p b q p d has higher values than p c c f p m q p d i e the rainfall observed at the rain gauge in bisko has stronger linear relationship with the discharge of žrnovnica spring consequently the time series of rainfall p b is used as the input time series the selection of the length of partial correlation effect l in eq 13 is arbitrary however for the range of values of l between 1 and 20 days sensitivity analysis revealed that the resulting difference in effective infiltration coefficient eic is about 5 consequently the length l is determined by calibration the available period is divided in two subperiods 1995 2006 and 2006 2017 each embracing 11 hydrological years basic statistical characteristics of time series p d p b t rh and q for these two periods are presented in tables 2 and 3 although the second period has about 10 larger total rainfall it can be noted that the difference in the mean discharge is only 3 statistical characteristics of air temperature and relative humidity for two periods are similar the length l is determined assuming that the optimal values of capacity s ce should be similar for both periods the length of partial correlation effect that gives the smallest difference between the optimal values for two periods is l 9 days which practically corresponds to the duration of the quick flow component fig 5 the objective functions obtained for three analyzed periods are presented in fig 6 all functions are smooth and their minimums are evident the optimal values of capacity s ce are 60 67 and 64 mm for periods 1995 2006 2006 2017 and 1995 2017 respectively however the lower part of the curve for period 1995 2006 is quite flat which indicates the uncertainty associated to the choice of the minimum value for this period such results may be obtained when wbm is unable to simulate the groundwater recharge with sufficient accuracy so a wide range of values of parameter s ce produces similar groundwater recharge rates more evident minimum for this period probably would be obtained by using a more complex water balance model the time series of daily groundwater recharge r o determined by wbm for s ce 64 mm is presented in fig 7 a comparing the groundwater recharge r o in fig 7a with the spring discharge q in fig 7b it can be noted a good correspondence between the periods without groundwater recharge and the recession periods in discharge which indicates that the obtained time series of daily groundwater recharge explains correctly temporal variations in the discharge of žrnovnica spring in fig 7c the annual values of eic calculated from the groundwater recharge obtained by pcm are compared with the annual values obtained by empirical models of turc modified turc santoro srebrenović and žugaj the annual precipitation in the empirical models is calculated from the daily rainfall observed at the rain gauge in dugopolje and the annual average air temperature from the daily values observed at the meteorological station in sinj the lower and upper limits for estimated values determined by žugaj 1995 are also presented it can be noted that the results of pcm are located inside these limits and they are very similar to the results obtained by the model of santoro the model of srebrenović produces the highest eic but all values are still below the upper limit on the other hand the lowest values of eic are obtained by the model of turc these values are mostly located below the lower limit the hydrological parameters of žrnovnica spring catchment obtained for three analyzed periods are summarized in table 4 the values of eic estimated by pcm are practically identical for all three periods about 0 60 whereas the values of eca range between 71 7 and 77 8 km2 the results obtained by empirical models for three analyzed periods range widely from 0 484 to 0 717 for eic and from 60 2 to even 96 6 km2 for eca the lowest value of eca is obtained by the model of srebrenović the highest by the model of turc 5 discussion in this research daily groundwater recharge rates are estimated from the daily time series of rainfall air temperature relative humidity and spring discharge by using a simple conceptual model of water balance in the soil cover epikarst and vadose zone it is assumed that the evaporation from soil cover epikarst and vadose zone depends on their saturation the optimal value of parameter is determined by using the proposed partial cross correlation function as objective function since pcm has the background in partial correlation permanent inflows from surface streams and reservoirs permanent regional flows random changes of catchment boundaries or random groundwater exchanges with neighboring aquifers have minor impact on the accuracy of result for a long period although they can change completely the groundwater balance pcm has two drawbacks the first is linearity a correlation coefficient measures the linear part of the relationship between two time series a partial correlation coefficient measures the correlation that remains between the two initial time series once the variance explained by the control time series has been removed from each of them it implies that only the linear part of the relationship between groundwater recharge and karst spring discharge is detected by pcm consequently more reliable results are expected for the karst catchments with scarce soil cover and vegetation and the highly karstified aquifers where the retention capacity of surface layers is small and the response of karst spring to rainfall is fast the second is the required time series length generally more reliable results are obtained for longer periods it is recommended that the analyzed period should be longer than 10 years to obtain a smooth form for the objective function and an evident minimum anyway the uncertainties associated to the choice of the minimum values exist so it is better sometime to consider ranges where the curve is at a minimum value rather than a point the impact of uncertainties on the results depends significantly on the analyzed period usually an increase or decrease of 10 mm in the value of parameter s ce may change the value of eic between 2 and 3 the values of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone capacity obtained by pcm for the žrnovnica spring range between 60 and 67 mm the objective function obtained for the entire period 1995 2017 has the single global minimum located at the value of 64 mm these values are similar to the value of 57 mm obtained previously by the spectral method jukić and denić jukić 2008 comparing to other karst catchments soulios 1984 found that the soil moisture capacities in greece karst regions range between 10 and 60 mm sauter 1992 estimated that the storage capacity of epikarst in the swabian alb of southern germany is between 20 and 33 mm perrin et al 2003 provided an analysis of the relative role of soil cover and epikarst in a catchment in switzerland and noted that the soil moisture storage may amount to about 140 mm željković and kadić 2015 used the value of 120 mm for the estimation of groundwater balance for the opačac spring in croatia the value of eic is controlled by several factors such as slope steepness vegetation soil type and thickness land use development of epikarst as well as composition and fracturing of deeper carbonate rocks several estimations were carried out for karst catchments in italy boni et al 1982 greece soulios 1984 france drogue 1972 and croatia bonacci 2001 finding values ranging from 0 35 to 0 76 allocca 2014 the mean values of eic obtained for the žrnovnica spring are 0 61 jukić and denić jukić 2008 and 0 54 bonacci and andrić 2015b the results of pcm 0 60 are in accordance with the previous values the value of eca for the žrnovnica spring was estimated in several studies and the obtained results range widely from 40 km2 bonacci 1987 bonacci et al 1998 78 83 km2 denić jukić et al 2007 to 70 80 km2 bonacci and andrić 2015a 2015b the mean eca for the žrnovnica spring obtained by pcm for period 1995 2017 is about 75 km2 result obtained by using the rainfall observed in dugopolje comparison with five empirical methods for the estimation of effective infiltration shows that pcm produces about 5 lower values of eic than the model of žugaj which was determined from the hydrological data collected in dinaric karst of croatia in contrast the model of srebrenović based on hydrological data mostly collected in the continental part of former yugoslavia including non karst catchments probably overestimates eic because all calculated values are close to the upper limit the worst correspondence with pcm is the original model of turc which is a global empirical model developed by using hydrological data from even 254 catchments and which has not been specifically designed for karst the turc model tends to underestimate the actual values of eic for the žrnovnica spring it should be noted that several studies attempted to regionalize this model improve efficiency and extend its applicability e g lebecherel et al 2013 borzi et al 2020 in this research two modified formulations were applied the first considers the effect of humidity by using a corrected value of annual average air temperature the values of eic obtained by this model are located above or close to the lower limit so it produces more adequate results for application on the žrnovnica spring than the original model of turc the model of santoro provides the closest results to the ones obtained by the pcm approach in this empirical model the annual average air temperature and the atmospheric evapotranspiration power are both corrected 6 conclusion pcm is proposed for estimation of groundwater recharge in karst daily groundwater recharge rates are determined from meteorological and hydrological time series by a simple conceptual model of water balance this model has only one parameter the capacity of soil cover epikarst and vadose zone the optimal value of parameter is determined by minimization of the partial cross correlation function where the input time series is precipitation from a neighboring location the output time series is discharge from spring and the control time series is groundwater recharge determined by the conceptual model the uncertainties associated to the choice of the minimum values of the proposed objective function exist when the conceptual model is unable to simulate groundwater recharge with sufficient accuracy more reliable results are expected for the highly karstified aquifers and the karst

4427,this study provides guidelines for the selection of proper goodness of fit criteria for the calibration and evaluation of hydrological models popular goodness of fit criteria and good practices for hydrological modeling are reviewed the review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of several criteria and is followed by a case study that focuses on the review s main findings the main recommendation is for hydrologists to avoid using threshold values to assess model performance and preferably set a proper benchmark series the case study was developed using the gr5j hydrological model and data from 179 watersheds in the brazilian cerrado biome several single and multi objective functions are used in optimization runs to assess the outcome for different goodness of fit criteria the model performance is evaluated for each optimization run considering overall conditions i e entire time series and conditions under low and peak flow conditions the study case reinforces that the popular nash sutcliffe efficiency index should be avoided as an objective function alternatively the kling gupta efficiency index showed to be a more reliable criterion resulting in lower bias for both calibration and validation and balanced results for both low and peak flow conditions additionally combining different criteria in multi objective functions can result in robust trade offs general guidelines are summarized and additional emphasis is given to tropical watersheds where low flows deserve due attention keywords gr5j model particle swarm optimization hydrological

coffey et al 2004 gupta et al 2009 krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 nash and sutcliffe 1970 richter et al 2011 willmott 1981 willmott and matsuura 2005 usually these criteria are used to assess whether a model can adequately reproduce historic patterns predict future behavior and measure the improvements from different modeling strategies krause et al 2005 there is no agreement on a standard procedure for assessing model performance ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the consensus is however that the evaluation of models should be multi objective coffey et al 2004 gupta et al 1998 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2017 in this matter the process of model calibration can be treated as a single objective or multiple objective optimization problem using a single criterion is convenient for automated search algorithms ardia et al 2011 molina et al 2010 parsopoulos and vrahatis 2002 while multiple criteria may result in pareto set of non dominated solutions gupta et al 2009 1998 this problem may be dealt with by combining the different criteria in a single loss function however it is expected that these criteria are mathematically related and decomposable into separate components gupta et al 2009 wȩglarczyk 1998 what is concerning nevertheless is that many modelers seem more attracted to the higher efficiency values regardless of what this means for a model previous studies have shown that some commonly used criteria are not sensitive to systematic over and underpredictions and can even overestimate a model performance due to their oversensitivity to extreme values gupta et al 2009 krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 despite that many studies have used such criteria and recommended thresholds or intervals for criteria as guidelines for a model evaluation moriasi et al 2017 richter et al 2011 saleh et al 2010 santhi et al 2001 this approach can often be subjective as the same criterion score is not equivalent among basins under different contexts other authors have also focused on less subjective model evaluation guidance coffey et al 2004 gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019a ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 many of these studies have assessed the sensibility of one or more criterion for different watersheds scenarios and simulations chai and draxler 2014 coffey et al 2004 gupta et al 2009 krause et al 2005 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 willmott and matsuura 2005 to understand whether the modeling process is adequate researchers should address the important questions properly do these criteria capture important information for the study region are they good for the comparison among different watersheds does the criterion chosen for the optimization of the hydrological model adequately reflect its purpose different contexts call for a distinguished selection of criteria and benchmarking strategies floods usually receive higher attention in the news and scientific literature because of their clear and immediate consequences loon 2015 low flows on the other hand are also part of a recurrent and natural hazard but are often overlooked drought events can result in vast ecological and economic impacts pushpalatha et al 2011 such as in energy and food production transportation and recreation sheffield and wood 2012 tallaksen and lanen 2004 besides the direct impacts of human activities on streamflow are particularly enlarged during dry periods smakhtin 2001 for example abstractions for industrial agricultural or urban supplying purposes can increase water disputes while direct effluent flowing into river streams can lead to significant deterioration of water quality under low flow conditions moreover the selection of goodness of fit criteria should reflect the objective of the model for the proper development of water resource management strategies and planning instead of a single high value a holistic look should be taken upon the problem this is fundamental to adequately choose i a set of criteria to evaluate the model ii a reasonable series to benchmark the performance and iii a criterion or criteria to be optimized 1 2 scope of the paper the objectives of the present study are to review popular goodness of fit criteria and good practices for hydrological modeling and to assess the outcomes from using different criteria as the objective function for the calibration of a hydrological model the main findings are drawn from a case study to provide general guidelines additional emphasis is given to tropical regions where low flows are strategic for energy and food production and should receive more attention the increasing pressure on water resources increases the environmental and economic importance of low flows thus addressing hydrological modeling for low flow conditions especially in highly seasonal watersheds as tropical ones can fulfill an important need finally the study case is based on watersheds of the cerrado biome and the guidelines elaborate mainly on the selection of goodness of fit criteria for the calibration of hydrological models and the selection of functional benchmarking strategies the paper is organized as follows section 2 reviews the goodness of fit criteria and practices used in hydrological modeling section 3 describes the experimental design of the case study and the single and multi objective optimizations adopted for the hydrological model section 4 discusses the results concerning performance indexes error criteria hydrological signatures and trade offs of using multi objective functions section 5 presents the main conclusions 2 goodness of fit criteria in hydrological modeling in this section we present a review concerning different goodness of fit criteria used for calibration and performance evaluation in hydrological modeling studies the calibration of a hydrological model is often based on a single goodness of fit criterion which is either maximized or minimized by adjusting the model s parameters among the many recommendations for evaluating the performance of a hydrological model is to include at least one dimensionless criterion and one criterion in the same unit of the target variable criss and winston 2008 legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 in general the ideal value for a performance index dimensionless criterion is 1 and should be maximized as an objective function while the ideal value for an error measure is 0 and should be minimized to minimize an error measure criterion is the reason why the objective function is usually termed loss or cost function i e the optimization seeks to minimize the loss or cost aside from performance indexes and error measures signature measures or hydrological signatures have gained a lot of popularity in recent years these signatures have been used to describe flow behavior and watershed functions addor et al 2018 mcmillan 2020a 2020b sawicz et al 2014 westerberg et al 2016 such signatures have also been adapted to evaluate the hydrological model consistency i e ability to reproduce observed hydrological behaviors beck et al 2016 euser et al 2013 kratzert et al 2019 yilmaz et al 2008 the idea is that the modelers should not seek high performance indexes at the cost of hydrological consistency in summary the main objective of this section is to synthesize the goodness of fit criteria its advantages and disadvantages and the good practices of studies well reported in the literature coffey et al 2004 euser et al 2013 gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019a krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 mcmillan 2020a ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 schaefli and gupta 2007 yilmaz et al 2008 some of these studies also report on adaption strategies and based on case studies and or simulations the strengths and drawbacks of different criteria a diagram of the goodness fit criteria discussed in this section is presented in fig 1 2 1 performance indexes the performance indexes presented in this section are the coefficient of determination r2 the index of agreement d the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the kling gupta efficiency kge and the volumetric efficiency ve despite some of these criteria having their demerits widely reported in the literature they are still at times used to evaluated models performance and therefore are reported here to reinforce that precaution is necessary when these indexes are used 2 1 1 coefficient of determination the coefficient of determination r2 represents the amount of variance in observed data that is explained by the model it is proposed as a measure of how close the observed predicted regression line approaches the ideal fit coffey et al 2004 its value is dimensionless and its range is bounded from 0 to 1 where 0 means that the model is incapable of detecting variance in observed data and1 indicates the perfect fit r2 is calculated as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 0 r 2 1 oi and pi are observed and predicted simulated values at time step i the overbar denotes the mean for the entire period and n denotes the total number of time steps despite some authors having reported r2 values above 0 50 to be considered acceptable santhi et al 2001 one of its major drawbacks is its oversensitivity to extreme values krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2017 this means that by following observed data during extreme events a model will yield a high r2 value which confuses the true relationship between observed and predicted data legates and mccabe 1999 another important drawback is that r2 is insensitive to systematic under or overprediction moriasi et al 2017 for these reasons additional information should always be considered when assessing a model r2 value for instance krause et al 2005 suggest that the slope of the fitted regression line b should always be discussed together with r2 ideally the fitted regression line should present an intercept equal to 0 and a slope equal to 1 thus krause et al 2005 proposed a weighted version of the coefficient of determination wr2 an adaption that accounts for b the weighting is performed as follows 2 w r 2 b r 2 for b 1 b 1 r 2 for b 1 0 wr 2 1 while better reflecting a model s poor performance this criterion still shows sensitivity to peak flows and is nearly insensitive to improvements of the low flow conditions krause et al 2005 for this reason r2 is more commonly seen accompanying regression plots but not used for the evaluation or optimization of hydrological models 2 1 2 index of agreement the index of agreement d was initially proposed by willmott 1981 to overcome the drawbacks of the r2 such as the differences in observed and predicted means and variances legates and mccabe 1999 d is also dimensionless and bounded between 0 and 1 and can be interpreted similarly to r2 the general formula of the index may be defined as 3 d 1 i 1 n o i p i j i 1 n o i o p i o j 0 d 1 where j is the exponent coefficient j 2 in its original form and d roughly represents the subtraction of the ratio between mean squared error and potential error from one willmott s index is widely used and a reliable coefficient of performance where d is multiplied by pearson s coefficient of correlation has even been proposed by camargo and sentelhas 1997 along with a set of interpretable threshold values however krause et al 2005 and legates and mccabe 1999 point out that relatively high values of d 0 65 may be found for poorly performing models despite being developed to overcome some drawbacks of correlation based criteria such as the r2 d has shown to be sensitive to peak flows and insensitive to low flows and systematic errors krause et al 2005 adaption strategies to overcome d sensitivity to peak flows and insensitivity to low flows include using j 1 willmott et al 1985 or its relative form eq 4 note that the values calculated by modified forms are in general lower than the values calculated by the original form according to krause et al 2005 the modified exponent j 1 leads to a criterion less sensitive to peak flows and more sensitive to low flows while its relative form show close to no sensitivity to peak flows but is very sensitive to low flows 4 d rel 1 i 1 n o i p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o p i o o 2 0 d 1 with time the index shortcomings led to a decrease in popularity d may at times be presented alongside other indexes but is not seen for decisive tasks as for the calibration of models 2 1 3 nash sutcliffe efficiency index the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse is perhaps the most popular and widely used goodness of fit criterion in hydrological studies its main improvement upon r2 and d for performance evaluation is its higher sensitivity to systematic under or overprediction this means that the nse is penalized when the slope and intercept of the fitted regression line depart from 1 and 0 respectively on the other hand the nse lower limit is unbounded and its interpretation differs from r2 and d it is defined as one minus the mean squared error mse normalized by the variance of the observed values σ2 therefore a high nse value indicates a low mismatch between predicted and observed values in relation to the standard deviation of observed values its general form is 5 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i j i 1 n o i b i j n s e 1 where bi is the benchmark series at time step i in its original form j 2 and bi o the different interpretability of the nse is its biggest advantage its value is interpretable as a skill score of the model s ability to reproduce the observed data in relation to a baseline or benchmark model gupta et al 2009 in its original form the baseline is the mean of observed data and an nse value smaller than or equal to 0 means that the model is no better than using the baseline model mean of observed data as the predictor in the past studies have considered a model as useful when nse 0 i e the model can make better predictions of streamflow than by assuming the mean of observed data however this threshold has long been condemned garrick et al 1978 knoben et al 2019a legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 many authors attempted to establish new threshold values for performance ratings bracmort et al 2006 motovilov et al 1999 saleh et al 2010 santhi et al 2001 singh et al 2005 in a thorough review of many of these works moriasi et al 2017 suggested that a model can be trustful when nse 0 50 yet despite these thresholds being apparently useful basins with different seasonality and rainfall runoff dynamics should not have nse values directly compared gupta et al 2009 instead a more appropriate baseline should be set for its benchmark series eq 5 such as seasonal or climatological mean garrick et al 1978 gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019a legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 schaefli and gupta 2007 in this case nse 0 would truly mean that the model is useful albeit an improved index the drawbacks of the nse are similar to that of r2 and d as its original form squares the differences between observed and predicted values it is also oversensitive to peak flows other researchers have also documented the nse to underestimate observed flows variability gupta et al 2009 mizukami et al 2019 this may result in inflated nse which does not adequately represent the model bias and performance similar to d adaptions strategies include modified versions as adopting j 1 legates and mccabe 1999 a relative form eq 6 and a logarithmic form eq 7 krause et al 2005 6 nse rel 1 i 1 n o i p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o o 2 n s e 1 7 nse log 1 i 1 n log o i log p i 2 i 1 n log o i log o 2 n s e 1 krause et al 2005 illustrated the nse using j 1 or termed here as modified nse mnse to be less sensitive to peak flows and more sensitive to low flows according to the authors the logarithmic form is even less sensitive to peak flows while the relative form is almost insensitive the logarithmic and relative forms are also more sensitive to low flows while the latter is the most sensitive 2 1 4 volumetric efficiency index the volumetric efficiency index ve was originally proposed by criss and winston 2008 to circumvent some of the nse flaws ve values are also bounded 0 1 and represent the fraction of water delivered at the proper time while its complement represents the mismatch the index is calculated as 8 ve 1 i 1 n p i o i i 1 n o i 0 v e 1 the main advantages of the index are its obvious significance and easy interpretability ve presents a linear correlation to the slope of the fitted regression line and decreases linearly when the model degrades as opposed to other criteria the criterion is less frequently presented alongside other criteria and has not been used as an objective function for decisive tasks in hydrological modeling furthermore it is analogous to the mnse and the mean absolute error criterion see section 2 2 but normalized by the average observation yet if the index was chosen as an objective function the expected results are similar to using mnse as only the sum of the absolute error numerator is not constant in the equation 2 1 5 kling gupta efficiency index the kling gupta efficiency index kge was proposed by gupta et al 2009 to better diagnosticate the relative importance of three components correlation bias and measure of variability gupta et al 2009 wȩglarczyk 1998 they showed that maximizing nse leads to the underestimation of flow variability the kge is then presented as an alternative criterion to reduce such problems the index is formulated by calculating the euclidian distance of all three components 9 kge 1 e d k g e 1 with ed s r r 1 2 s α α 1 2 s β β 1 2 where ed is the euclidian distance r is the linear correlation coefficient between oi and pi α is the variability ratio or ratio between the standard deviation of simulated values and standard deviation of observed values σ p σ o β is the ratio between mean of the simulated and observed values μ p μ o or p o sr sα and sβ are scaling factors that can re scale the criteria space before computing the ed that is emphasizing different components conventionally the scaling factors have equal weight i e sr sα sβ 1 gupta et al 2009 detail how optimizing a model using kge or nse leads to the underestimation of peak flows overestimation of low flows but in the case of kge it is not as severe the authors also argue that there are many reasons for a model performance to deteriorate during the evaluation period however when optimizing a hydrological model for several basins using nse resulted in an underestimation of the variability ratio while kge retained the ratio close to unity a further adaption is also presented for the variability ratio by kling et al 2012 the authors recommend the variability ratio to be the ratio between coefficient of variation of the simulated and observed values cvp cvo kling et al 2012 comment that the modified kge kge2 ensures that the variability ratio and bias are not cross correlated which may occur for biased inputs although kge is set to the same interval of nse to 1 knoben et al 2019 highlight that modelers should not guide their interpretability in the same way for instance using the mean observed as prediction results in nse 0 but kge 0 41 therefore nse and kge values should not be treated as approximately equivalent knoben et al 2019a however kge 0 41 should not be set as a benchmark for similar reasons as mentioned for nse other benchmark categories have been proposed towner et al 2019 which may be informative but should be used carefully 2 2 error measures error measures are frequently presented in conjunction with performance indexes for their informative value while indexes are usually bounded and dimensionless error criteria measures are generally in absolute units a number of these criteria have been used and recommended over the years chai and draxler 2014 moriasi et al 2017 richter et al 2011 willmott and matsuura 2005 perhaps the most popular ones are the percentage bias pbias mean error mbe mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse note that the mse is simply the squared version of rmse the advantage of rmse over mse is that the criterion is in the same unit as the target variable being more easily interpretable they are calculated as 10 pbias 100 i 1 n p i o i i 1 n o i p b i a s 11 mbe i 1 n p i o i n m b e 12 mae i 1 n p i o i n 0 m a e 13 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 0 r m s e the mean error or bias mbe measures the general tendency of the simulated values to under or overestimate the observed values the pbias has the same purpose but is normalized by the average of observed values i e it is equivalent to mbe o a pbias threshold of 25 was set by moriasi et al 2017 for a model to be considered satisfactory although the criterion alone is insufficient for model evaluation the mae represents the magnitude of the average error of the simulation rmse serves a similar purpose to mae but because of its squared components it weighs more heavily on larger errors by definition rmse is never smaller than mae chai and draxler 2014 discussed that despite their similar purpose it is important to present both rmse and mae values according to the authors the rmse is sensitive to outliers and operates as a criterion of the error distribution mae and rmse do however present a clear disadvantage when used to compare the performance of a model across different watersheds as different watersheds can have different hydrologic dynamics the magnitude and variability of discharge values may significantly fluctuate even when adopting units that are independent of the watershed area e g l s 1 km 1 or mm day 1 other error criteria that deserve to be mentioned despite not being in absolute units is the normalized root mean square error i e the ratio between rmse and the range of the observations nrmse or ratio of rmse to the standard deviation of the observations rsr and the mean absolute relative error mare nrmse and rsr penalize the criteria for a large variation in observed data while mare gives the same emphasis to relative errors regardless of peak or low flow conditions these criteria are better used in the comparison of performances across different watersheds although using the range of the observations in nrmse may be more subjective to outliers than the standard deviation used for rsr additionally despite moriasi et al 2007 recommending threshold values for both rsr and nse one criterion essentially reveals the other this is because nse can also be described as 1 mse σ o 2 or 1 rmse σ o 2 which ultimately is the same as 1 rsr 2 regarding the use of such criteria as cost functions the pbias and mbe are not seen at all as using a simple average of observed data as predictions could result in a perfect fit the average of observed values has already been discussed here to be an undesirable benchmark let alone a model prediction among the other aforementioned error criteria the rmse or mse is the most widely used as a loss function its drawbacks however are similar to those of r2 d and nse because it squares the errors it is oversensitive to peak flows additionally minimizing either rmse nrmse or rsr in optimization tasks is equivalent to maximizing nse since σ o is constant during the task mae on the other hand is rarely seen as a loss function it is likely used only in special cases when more emphasis should be given to lower values moreover to optimize mae would stand the same purpose optimizing the mnse as mnse can also be described as 1 mae σ o mare is likewise rarely seen in optimization tasks nonetheless it is expected to present a similar outcome to using nserel as the objective function although it does not square the errors this perhaps indicates that mare may be less sensitive to low flow conditions than nserel 2 3 hydrological signatures as a descriptor of watershed characteristics hydrological signatures can be derived from multiple data sources for example satellite derived soil moisture rainfall snow etc addor et al 2018 euser et al 2013 such signatures are particularly useful in regionalization studies however the focus here is on signatures used to best describe and evaluate hydrological models thus this section focuses on signatures based on discharge time series only considering the diversity of hydrologic signatures the selection of appropriate ones can be challenging addor et al 2018 euser et al 2013 mcmillan 2020a the choice must enable the characterization of hydrological features processes of interest during modeling but without redundancy different studies have used different signatures or even calculated signatures by different equations e g baseflow index addor et al 2018 among the most commonly used signatures are the ones derived from flow duration curves fdc for example the study by yilmaz et al 2008 presented the percent bias in the fdc low and high segment volume flv and fhv in the fdc midsegment slope fms and in median log flow fmm flv is a diagnostic signature for long term baseflow while fhv and fms are diagnostic measures for vertical redistribution and fmm a diagnostic measure for midflow behavior yilmaz et al 2008 they are calculated as 14 flv 100 l 1 l log p l log p l l 1 l log o l log o l l 1 l log o l log o l f l v 15 fhv 100 h 1 h p h o h h 1 h o h f h v 16 fms 100 log p m 1 log p m 2 log o m 1 log o m 2 log o m 1 log o m 2 f m s 17 fmm 100 log p med log o med log o med f m m where l 1 2 l are the indices for flow values located in the low flow segment exceedance probabilities between 70 and 100 h 1 2 h are the indices for flow values located in the high flow segment exceedance probability lower than 2 m1 and m2 are the highest and lowest flow exceedance probabilities within the midsegment of the fdc 20 and 70 respectively and med the index for median flow values other hydrological signatures that are used mainly to describe hydrologic behavior have also been used to assess the performance of hydrological models some of the more popular are also based on the fdc as flow values at specific exceedance probabilities e g 1 5 10 50 90 95 99 and their transformed values beck et al 2016 westerberg et al 2016 or a performance index for the fdcs of predicted and observed discharge values other signatures are based on flow dynamics as the baseflow index bfi gustard et al 1992 flow lag 1 autocorrelation euser et al 2013 shafii and tolson 2015 mean flow transformed mean flow squared log etc and flow variability coefficient of variation aside from the aforementioned signatures there is a range of other signatures that have been used in different studies especially when considering other sources of data than discharge addor et al 2018 euser et al 2013 mcmillan 2020a shafii and tolson 2015 2015 westerberg et al 2016 yilmaz et al 2008 yet for signatures describing hydrogram characteristics to be used as goodness of fit criteria a few formulations have been suggested as hydrological signature scores hss beck et al 2016 proposed a score hss1 based on the absolute difference between signatures normalized by the signature standard deviation obtained over a large sample of watersheds eq 18 while euser et al 2013 suggested using the absolute relative difference between signatures hss2 eq 19 18 hs s 1 hs p hs o σ hs 19 hs s 2 1 hs o hs p hs o where hsp and hso are the hydrological signatures computed for the predicted and observed discharge series and σ hs the standard deviation of the signature other authors have also suggested more elaborate scoring systems where the relative difference between signatures passes through a binary 0 or 1 or a continuous scoring function ranging from 0 to 1 2 4 good practices 2 4 1 benchmarking and skill scores as previously discussed the use of intervals and threshold values of criteria is a subjective means to evaluate the performance of a hydrological model especially across different basins most of these criteria rely on the basins dynamics and seasonality instead a benchmark series should be purpose dependent set with justifiable values and achieve basic requirements that a hydrologist can promptly understand knoben et al 2019a schaefli and gupta 2007 although an alternative way of benchmarking has already been discussed for the nse section 2 1 3 other criteria lack an inherent benchmarking method a useful practice reported in different studies hirpa et al 2018 knoben et al 2019a towner et al 2019 is to set a proper benchmark series and compute a criterion skill score the skill score is therefore used to assess the relative improvement deterioration of a given criterion in relation to the benchmark series an example of skill score improvement for the kge is as follows 20 kge ss kge model kge benchmark 1 kge benchmark where kgess is the relative improvement of the kge skill score kgemodel is the kge achieved by the hydrological model eq 9 and kgebenchmark is the kge achieved by the benchmark series i e kge calculated using flow values from a previously set benchmark series instead of the values simulated by the hydrological model for a single hydrological model it is common to set the benchmark series to a default run i e a comparative run using default parameters towner et al 2019 mean monthly values are also justifiable and indicated for basins with strong seasonality althoff et al 2021 garrick et al 1978 legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 for models developed for forecasting it is common to use the naïve guess as a benchmark i e estimate the river discharge on the next time step to be equal to the last available measurement on the other hand when comparing many different hydrological models it is also common to set the benchmark series as the simpler model to which improvements are pursued on 2 4 2 multi objective optimization the complexity of the calibration problem makes it difficult if not impossible to find a single set of optimal parameters duan et al 1992 gupta et al 1998 in an attempt to find more coherent results several studies have aggregated objective functions as a single objective function beck et al 2016 shafii and tolson 2015 the kge is an example of an aggregated multi objective function that is based on the decomposition of errors in terms of flow bias flow variability and flow dynamics gupta et al 2009 the shortcoming of this practice is that the trade off between individual components may not be explored wöhling et al 2013 additionally the choice of redundant correlated criteria can lead to disproportional weighting and bias in the last two decades multi objective optimization techniques have shown more realistic and robust parameter estimation it is not possible to find a parameter set that optimizes conflicting criteria simultaneously however acceptable trade offs may be found for a subset of solutions equally efficient parameter sets are often referred to as pareto optimal or nondominated solutions however the number of pareto solutions tends to increase when a large number of objective functions is used dominance resistance issue shafii and tolson 2015 shafii and tolson 2015 dealt with dominance resistance by i aggregating a few of the objective functions or ii using a binary scoring function for some of the objective functions to be optimized up to an acceptable level and not unconditionally overall multi objective optimization leads to parameters sets with better compromised solutions and undoubtedly better hydrological consistency efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 shafii and tolson 2015 wöhling et al 2013 2 4 3 other techniques other researchers have elaborated on different practices for instance ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 propose to assess the confidence interval of the calculated criteria via bootstrapping i e aggregating the criteria achieved through many resamples with replacement of predicted and observed values harmel et al 2010 suggest incorporating a correction factor to goodness of fit criteria to account for sources of uncertainty some authors have also suggested using the aforementioned multi objective model calibration gupta et al 1998 wöhling et al 2013 alongside goodness of fit criteria graphical results are also considered good practice gupta et al 2009 legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 willmott et al 1985 among these we highlight the use of scatterplots time series plot and accumulated frequency curves which are useful in diagnosing systematic issues with the chosen model 3 case study the case study consisted of calibrating a hydrological model to several watersheds individually pooling their calibration and validation performances and repeating this process for different objective functions several goodness of fit criteria were evaluated for each objective function being optimized the goodness of fit criteria were chosen based on the review presented in section 2 especial emphasis is given to different ranges of the observed values i e aside from assessing the criteria for all observed simulated pairs a percentage of the upper and lower observed values are assessed separately this allows for more conclusions to be drawn from the results for a given objective function 3 1 hydrological model the model chosen for the case study is the gr5j le moine 2008 a five parameter daily lumped rainfall runoff hydrological model the water balance of this model includes a soil moisture accounting reservoir s and a conceptual water exchange function f the routing structure consists of two unit hydrographs and a non linear reservoir providing two flow components the water exchange function f allows simulating the imports or exports of water with deep aquifers or surrounding reservoirs pushpalatha et al 2011 according to pushpalatha et al 2011 by including a threshold parameter to f the gr5j model presented a significant performance improvement over the gr4j model perrin et al 2003 especially in low flow conditions therefore the model should be reasonably sensitive to the use of objective functions with different purposes the only variables required by the gr5j model are the potential evaporation and rainfall the model runs were performed using r environment and programming language r core team 2020 and airgr package coron et al 2020 2017 3 2 study area and data the area chosen for the study is the brazilian savanna biome the cerrado fig 2 most of the cerrado presents tropical savannah climate classification alvares et al 2014 köppen 1936 aw i e distinct wet and dry seasons with dry winter and monthly mean temperatures above 18 c the relevance of the study area to the study comes from its climate seasonality tropical watersheds present high and seasonal inputs of water and energy which result in extreme hydrological cycles pereira 2019 this study area was also chosen for its relevance to the country the cerrado distributes water for many important rivers and has been considered one of the most important biomes for water resources in brazil oliveira et al 2016 the cerrado is also a focal point of agricultural frontiers and irrigation expansion althoff and rodrigues 2019 rada 2013 rodrigues et al 2012 its strong seasonality however requires special attention to water resources despite the abundance of water availability during the wet season the long lasting dry season results in water shortage and conflicts over its use in many regions moreover most of the rivers in the region are ungauged and lack information for proper water planning and management 3 2 1 discharge data discharge data of gauge stations were collected at the hidroweb portal electronic address http www snirh gov br hidroweb serieshistoricas which is part of the national system of water resources information in pt sistema nacional de informações sobre recursos hídricos snirh the snirh offers access to the database containing information collected by the national hydrometeorological network in pt rede hidrometeorológica nacional rhn the governmental agency responsible for the rhn is the national water agency in pt agência nacional de águas the study period of 14 5 years from 1 june 2000 to 31 december 2014 was chosen considering the temporal coverage of used datasets the discharge dataset only presented consisted data up to 31 december 2014 while evapotranspiration and rainfall data were only available from 1 june 2000 in the screening process gauge stations with 10 missing data were removed from the analyses the mean monthly discharge and their cumulative frequencies are presented in fig 3 for all of the 179 tropical watersheds used in this study 3 2 2 rainfall and potential evapotranspiration to adequately address the rainfall and evapotranspiration across the watersheds gridded data products at daily resolution were chosen the integrated multi satellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement gpm mission imerg huffman et al 2019b 2019a was chosen to represent rainfall while the eto brazil althoff et al 2020a 2020b was chosen to represent the potential evapotranspiration over the watersheds the imerg data set has been widely tested and is considered one of the most reliable gridded rainfall estimates as showcased for brazil by gadelha et al 2019 the eto brazil on the other hand is a gridded database developed for the penman monteith allen et al 1998 reference evapotranspiration using state of art techniques and matching the imerg spatial and temporal resolution although not for potential evapotranspiration many hydrological models have been developed and adopted reference evapotranspiration in their use arnold et al 1998 xiang et al 2020 yuan et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 besides this dataset compensates for the low density of weather stations in the region as the gr5j is a lumped model both variables had their daily values extracted and averaged for the gauge stations corresponding watersheds the watersheds were delimited using the taudem toolset tarboton 2008 and the srtm void filled earth resources observation and science center 2017 at 3 arc seconds 90 m spatial resolution the imerg and eto brazil mean monthly data are presented in fig 4 3 3 model calibration and validation the data set temporal coverage was split into three periods the first 2 5 years were used for the hydrological model warm up the following 9 years for the calibration of the model s parameters and the latest 3 years for validation two calibration approaches were assessed single objective optimization and multi objective optimizations the model was calibrated several times for each watershed individually each time considering a different calibration approach and objective function 3 3 1 single objective functions based on the review the criteria which we considered more relevant to be used as the objective function in the model calibration were the kge kge2 nse mnse nselog nserel mare the r2 d and their adapted versions were not chosen for this task because they have long been considered less fit than the chosen criteria to do so as also discussed using mae or ve as an objective function would stand the same purpose as would mnse while mse rmse nrmse and rsr would stand for the same purpose as would nse the model was optimized using the r environment and programming language r core team 2020 and the technique adopted was the particle swarm optimization pso clerc 2012 parsopoulos and vrahatis 2002 zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 the pso was implemented using hydropso package zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2020 3 3 2 multi objective functions four different scenarios of multi objective optimizations mo were assessed the first scenario mo1 was set as an attempt to adjust better predictions for both extreme high and low flow conditions while the second to fourth scenarios of multi objective optimizations mo2 to mo4 were designed to weigh more heavily on low flow conditions considering that the main issue for the cerrado is water availability putting more weight on low flow conditions is of particular interest when calibrating hydrological models for the biome mo1 and mo2 consisted of only performance indexes while mo3 consisted of both a performance index and a hydrological signature and mo4 consisted of a performance index and an aggregate function of hydrological signatures that should correlate well under low flow conditions although using redundant hydrological signatures is not recommended they were aggregated and therefore do not overweigh on the model calibration mo1 consisted of maximizing both the kge calculated under peak and low flow conditions upper 10 and lower 25 of the observed discharges kgelow kgehigh mo2 maximized the kge and the nserel kge nserel mo3 maximized the kge and the bfi kge bfi and mo4 maximized kge and an aggregate function of multiple hydrologic signature scores designed to assess discharge under low flow conditions kge hslow the aggregate function is a simple average of the hydrological signature scores for flv and the discharges at exceedance probabilities of 90 and 95 q90 and q95 respectively q90 and q95 are flow indexes commonly used as a reference for water grants in brazil the hydrological signature scores were calculated using eq 19 for q90 and q95 while for flv we used 1 flv the solution of the pareto front with the smallest euclidean distance to 1 was subset to evaluate performance this choice gives equal weights to both criteria and is a simple alternative to choosing the solution closer to the optimal point the model was optimized using the r environment and programming language r core team 2020 and the technique adopted was the multi objective particle swarm optimization with crowding distance mopso cd raquel and naval 2005 the crowding distance computation ensures that an even spread of non dominated solutions is found the mopso cd was implemented using mopsocd package naval 2013 3 4 model evaluation the models were evaluated both for their calibration and validation periods in this step several criteria were chosen aside from the performance indexes used in optimization tasks the error criteria rmse mae and pbias and the hydrological signatures flv fhv fms fmm bfi q90 and q95 were also included in the evaluation the signature scores eq 19 were calculated for bfi q90 and q95 flv fhv fms and fmm were kept as in their original form for each watershed objective function and period calibration and validation the performance indexes and error criteria were evaluated for i the entire series ii peak flow conditions and iii the low flow conditions for the evaluation of peak and low flow conditions the upper 10 and lower 25 of the observations were assessed separately these percentiles were set considering the skewness of the discharge data i e more data observations are available for low flow conditions when compared to peak flow conditions fig 2b almost 90 of the peak flow values came from the months from december to march while almost 90 of the low flow values came from june to october the hydrological signatures are designed for specific ranges in the cumulative distribution functions or consider the time series entirely for this reason they were not included in the evaluation under peak and low flow conditions skill scores were calculated for all the performance indexes using a benchmark series the benchmark series was set to each gauge station as their corresponding mean monthly discharges calculated for the calibration period this seems to be a reasonable benchmark for the tropical watersheds althoff et al 2021 especially given their strong seasonality fig 2a 4 results and discussion 4 1 assessing the performance of hydrological models the model performance during both the calibration and validation period for all watersheds and different objective functions is shown in figs 4 6 there is an overall deterioration of performance when comparing the calibration and validation periods perhaps a better validation could arise from assessing different calibration periods however this would significantly increase the computation cost for the analyses and is not the objective of the current study besides gupta et al 2009 report that there are many reasonable reasons for model deterioration during the validation period such as over fitting non stationarity between periods and lack of power in the optimized function moreover the objective in this section is to address the first question hydrologists or modelers should consider do these models have value we addressed this question by considering the skill scores eq 20 obtained over a reasonable benchmark series i e naïvely set to the mean monthly discharges of the calibration period for each gauge station thus it is possible to objectively conclude on the hydrological model efficacy fig 5 shows the skill scores for all the performance indexes considered in the evaluation of the hydrological model for all watersheds a red dashed horizontal line was set at 0 in fig 5 to indicate whether the calibrated models outperformed the benchmark series the skill score is particularly useful when assessing large scale hydrological modeling because it is easier to declare models as useful by reporting them higher than zero i e outperforming a reasonable benchmark series in contrast using the same range values for watersheds under different hydrological contexts can be misleading considering all the observations each criterion presented values closer to 1 when they were used as the objective function which was expected the objective functions showed similar performance concerning indexes based on absolute values mnse and ve while the kge kge2 nse and nselog resulted in better performance among themselves when they were used as the objective function a similar performance was also observed for the relative based criteria nserel and mare under low flow conditions the best results from best to worst were achieved by optimizing mare nserel mnse nselog kge kge2 and nse the poor overall performance from the nse is an outcome of squaring errors which makes the model insensitive to low flow conditions kge kge2 and nselog performed better than the nse under low flow conditions but still worse than mare and nserel which can be attributed to their correlation based nature in contrast optimizing mare and nserel lead to higher values for all the performance indexes under low flow conditions mare presented slightly higher criteria than nserel under low flow conditions which can be attributed to using absolute relative errors instead of squared relative errors optimizing mnse showed balanced results under both low and peak flow conditions as for peak flow conditions optimizing mare and nserel resulted in the worse values for all the indexes while optimizing the other criteria resulted in a similar performance the error measures reinforce the behavior shown by the performance indexes fig 6 optimizing indexes based on relative errors nserel and mare resulted in lower errors and biases under low flow conditions while optimizing nse resulted in the largest errors in contrast using nserel and mare as objective functions resulted in larger biases and absolute errors under peak flow and overall conditions under peak flow conditions the optimization of kge kge2 nse and nselog led to similar results every objective function resulted in some extent of biases the pbias shows that using mare and nserel as objective functions led to the underestimation of peak flow conditions and overall discharge values in contrast nse mnse and nselog resulted in the general underestimation of peak flows and over estimation of low flows as has already been reported for nse criteria by other authors gupta et al 2009 mizukami et al 2019 the kge and kge2 showed the best performances concerning bias for all the observations and low and peak flow conditions thus optimizing nse as traditionally done in many hydrological modeling studies seems to have no clear benefit when compared to the other criteria for example the nselog and mnse as objective functions showed similar performance to the nse under peak flow conditions but resulted in much more balanced predictions under low flow conditions especially the mnse the performance indexes show that the overall performance for low flow conditions was worse than for peak flow conditions despite the smaller magnitude of errors seen under low flow conditions they are high relative to the observed values high mare in fig 6 also the lower standard deviation seen under low flow conditions low slope in cdf compared to that under peak flow conditions high slope in cdf fig 2b makes it so higher relative errors result in a decrease in performance for the correlation based indexes besides different hydrological models put different emphasis on different hydrological processes which means certain processes may be underrepresented and perform poorly in different ranges of the cumulative distribution function anyhow the high skill scores 0 achieved for low flow conditions still mean that the models outperformed the baseline we set the comparison between the hydrological signatures of observed and predicted discharge series i e hydrological signature scores are shown in fig 7 bfi showed similar performance as the objective functions did for kge in overall observations thus the high bfi scores for optimizing kge are likely an outcome of more balanced predictions concerning the biases in contrast the lack of sensitivity of mare and rnse to peak flow conditions resulted in worse bfi scores no criteria performed particularly better than the other for the diagnostic signature measures flv although kge kge2 and nse showed large dispersion of the measures kge and kge2 did on the other hand result in measures closer to the desired for fms fmm and fhv which may be an outcome for the more balanced overall biases the objective functions showed a similar trend in performance when comparing the q90 and q95 to predictions under low flow conditions i e the relative based criteria resulted in better estimates under low flow conditions and more consistency in estimating the discharge for low exceedance probability levels high performance for such criteria is crucial considering that water grants in brazil are for the most part based on these hydrological signatures in this sense hydrological signatures are useful to assess if the predictions are consistent for the desired hydrological processes 4 2 comparison between single and multi objective optimization the performance of the multi objective optimizations is compared to that of the single objective functions kge nse and nserel figs 8 10 these three single objective functions were chosen because one of them provided overall good performance and low bias kge one is considered the traditional criterion nse and the other excelled under low flow conditions nserel concerning the performance indexes fig 8 and error criteria fig 9 optimizing the kge of low and peak flow conditions kgelow and kgehigh respectively at the same time did not result in satisfactory results despite showing improvements concerning low flow conditions the model performed considerably worse for peak flow conditions it seems that neglecting the predictions in between low and peak flow conditions resulted in poor modeling and trade off benefits in addition despite high kge under low flow conditions the model presented higher mare than the single objective alternative nserel including bfi in the multi objective function did not bring any benefit on the contrary the performance concerning all goodness of fit criteria seems to have deteriorated the model showed minor improvements for the bfi criteria fig 10 but presented larger deterioration to all the goodness of fit criteria when compared to models using only the kge as an optimization function perhaps the limitation of the conceptual model led to inconsistent results for the index and made it difficult to find a decent trade off another possible explanation is that the index is useful for comparisons among different watersheds but somehow inconsistent due to small changes in discharge simulations the multi objective functions developed by including an aggregate of hydrological signatures designed to weigh more heavily on low flow conditions showed only minor improvements when compared to kge these improvements concern low flow conditions and the hydrological signatures q90 and q95 but still performing worse than nserel in these matters on the other hand the multi objective function based in both kge and nserel which are the criteria that provided alone the better performance overall and under low flow conditions led to robust results the trade off between these two complementary criteria resulted in lower bias under all conditions similarly to kge the performance was similar to that of kge under peak flow conditions and to that of nserel under low flow conditions as for the hydrological signatures it resulted in better performance than nserel for flv fhv fms and bfi but worse for q90 and q95 some hydrologic signatures seem too one dimensional and despite being useful in diagnosing inconsistencies in a model they can lead to subjective trade offs during calibration in contrast the mechanism of performance indexes in reducing biases or errors under certain conditions can lead multi objective optimization functions into a more goal oriented and robust direction for example the outcome of optimizing the multi objective function kge nserel resulted in a somewhat similar flv and better q90 and q95 estimates than did kge hslow which included these scores in the aggregate function 4 3 summary and guidelines the best all around performances were achieved when kge and kge2 were used as objective functions this can be attributed to the index improving predictions in terms of bias variability and dynamics gupta et al 2009 they showed lower errors under low flow conditions than the nse and the lowest pbias among all objective functions the lowest bias for both low and peak flows means that kge and kge2 are more adequate to weigh in the discharge variability in overall conditions among the two kge showed a slight superiority concerning relative errors in addition to kge based criteria the mnse also resulted in good overall performance despite underestimating the variability as seen by the pbias under low and peak flow conditions it presented smaller errors than kge for low flows and mostly positive skill scores for peak flow conditions the advantage of calibrating mnse for low flows when compared to nse is because it uses absolute errors instead of squared errors since errors are generally larger under peak flow conditions figs 6 and 9 squaring them makes nse oversensitive to such conditions and less sensitive to errors under overall and low flow conditions under peak flow conditions except for mare and nserel all criteria used as objective functions presented similar results despite showing lower mare for the peak flow conditions optimizing nse or nselog resulted in the underestimation of discharge variability i e underestimation of peak flow negative pbias and overestimation of low flow conditions positive pbias the simulations from nse optimized models also presented similar mae and rmse to the models optimized for kge and kge2 therefore using nse and nselog as objective functions did not show much of an advantage in any condition however maximizing nselog resulted in better simulations than maximizing nse because log transformation generally reduces data skewness when its distribution is closely related to log normal distributions fig 3b there is less emphasis on peak flows thus nselog optimized streamflow predictions showed better performance for low flows and overall flow conditions but were still able to score similar performances to nse for peak flows in other words optimizing nselog instead of nse resulted in more reliable models for the tropical watersheds other more specific criteria have also been developed to improve extreme flow simulations for instance mizukami et al 2019 proposed a metric specifically targeted at annual peak flows despite achieving high performance for peak flow simulations the authors reported poor performance regarding other criteria and in the overall simulation of the hydrologic behavior therefore the application specific criterion should be used carefully the optimization of objective functions based on relative values mare and nserel resulted in a more significant improvement for the goodness of fit criteria under low flow conditions despite errors being smaller when compared to errors under overall and peak flow conditions see mae and rmse in fig 6 they are relatively larger when compared to observed flows see mare in fig 6 therefore putting more emphasis on relative errors during calibration will generally lead to better streamflow predictions for low flows although nserel squares the relative errors as an objective function it performed close to mare under low flow conditions these criteria should then be used as objective functions for regions where water availability is the major issue i e arid semi arid regions or regions with intensive water use abstractions during dry periods as for irrigation purposes however a downside of these objective functions is that they cannot be used for intermittent rivers as the denominator in their equation would in some situations be 0 in this case the mnse optimized models presented the next best performance under low flow conditions alternatively a small constant fraction of the mean observed flow can be added to streamflow observations or before log transformation to avoid the zero flow issue pushpalatha et al 2012 santos et al 2018 concerning hydrological signatures they are particularly useful to assess if a hydrological model is inconsistently good i e shows high performance but fails to describe certain hydrological processes or signatures thus using multi objective functions can help model specific scenarios e g adjusting parameters that perform well and are consistent with specific hydrological signatures multi objective functions enable the modeler to find decent trade offs between criteria that assess complementary aspects resulting in more robust models the main findings concerning the performance indexes and error measures are summarized in table 1 finally setting a reasonable benchmark series is strongly recommended in any case assessing relative improvements over a benchmark series or skill scores can provide objectiveness in concluding whether a model has value especially in large scale modeling in addition hydrological signatures can be assessed to check consistency for flow characteristics and hydrological processes 4 3 1 hydrological modeling in the cerrado in many regions of the cerrado the availability of water has been the motive for conflicts and disputes carvalho and magrini 2006 pousa et al 2019 despite the water abundance in some of its regions ana 2017 the water availability must be assessed carefully especially considering the current scenario for irrigation expansion althoff and rodrigues 2019 thus the calibration of hydrological models in these regions should be purposed oriented i e adequate choice of model optimization criteria and benchmark series the cerrado region is poorly monitored and most rivers are ungauged this results in low confidence for water managers to take action the long lasting dry season and lack of information can result in vulnerabilities and ineffective water management thus the main purpose for using hydrological models for watersheds in the cerrado biome is to assess the availability of water under low flow conditions concerning the benchmark series the low coefficient of variation of discharges during the dry season means that mean monthly discharges are a good option and therefore recommended here as a baseline for a model to improve on however it should be noted that mean monthly discharges are likely to provide inconsistent hydrological signatures and should not be considered in this matter considering either mare or nserel as a single objective function for the calibration of the hydrological model resulted in the best performance under low flow conditions this is because despite the errors being smaller under low flow conditions they are relatively large thus minimizing relative errors result in improvements under low flow conditions the single objective optimization for nserel resulted in better performance under low flow conditions when compared to the multi objective optimization for both kge and nserel however the multi objective optimization resulted in a more robust and realistic model that is with a better balance for overall conditions alternatively for intermittent rivers the multi objective function considering the kge along with specific hydrological signatures and or the mnse can provide balanced performance under low flow conditions especially when compared to the traditional nse 5 conclusions in this study we reviewed and explored a range of goodness of fit criteria and good practices for hydrological modeling the case study considering 179 watersheds in the cerrado biome reinforces aspects that have been discussed in several papers but also provides additional insights into hydrological modeling for tropical watersheds for example the nse criterion is insensitive to low flow conditions and resulted in the largest relative errors under low flow and overall conditions when used as an optimization function alternatively we recommend the kge kge resulted in similar performance as the nse under peak flow conditions but provided well rounded predictions with low biases in both extreme flow conditions the mnse also provided balanced predictions under low and peak flow conditions but with higher bias than the kge a reasonable benchmark series should also be set to compute relative improvements or skill scores of the model especially when working with a large sample of watersheds using thresholds for indexes should be avoided as they can be subjective under different hydrological contexts tropical watersheds on the other hand are regions playing a key role in energy and food production by considering the cerrado region to represent tropical watersheds we were able to put together guidelines for hydrological modeling in such regions because water availability in dry periods is a sensitive matter in the cerrado region performance indexes based on relative values are recommended e g the mare and nserel the optimization of multi objective functions is appealing well rounded robust models were calibrated using the kge and nserel as multi objective functions which reduced relative errors under both extreme and overall conditions as benchmark series mean monthly discharges are reasonable baselines for tropical watersheds especially in

4427,this study provides guidelines for the selection of proper goodness of fit criteria for the calibration and evaluation of hydrological models popular goodness of fit criteria and good practices for hydrological modeling are reviewed the review discusses the advantages and disadvantages of several criteria and is followed by a case study that focuses on the review s main findings the main recommendation is for hydrologists to avoid using threshold values to assess model performance and preferably set a proper benchmark series the case study was developed using the gr5j hydrological model and data from 179 watersheds in the brazilian cerrado biome several single and multi objective functions are used in optimization runs to assess the outcome for different goodness of fit criteria the model performance is evaluated for each optimization run considering overall conditions i e entire time series and conditions under low and peak flow conditions the study case reinforces that the popular nash sutcliffe efficiency index should be avoided as an objective function alternatively the kling gupta efficiency index showed to be a more reliable criterion resulting in lower bias for both calibration and validation and balanced results for both low and peak flow conditions additionally combining different criteria in multi objective functions can result in robust trade offs general guidelines are summarized and additional emphasis is given to tropical watersheds where low flows deserve due attention keywords gr5j model particle swarm optimization hydrological

assess whether a model can adequately reproduce historic patterns predict future behavior and measure the improvements from different modeling strategies krause et al 2005 there is no agreement on a standard procedure for assessing model performance ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 the consensus is however that the evaluation of models should be multi objective coffey et al 2004 gupta et al 1998 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2017 in this matter the process of model calibration can be treated as a single objective or multiple objective optimization problem using a single criterion is convenient for automated search algorithms ardia et al 2011 molina et al 2010 parsopoulos and vrahatis 2002 while multiple criteria may result in pareto set of non dominated solutions gupta et al 2009 1998 this problem may be dealt with by combining the different criteria in a single loss function however it is expected that these criteria are mathematically related and decomposable into separate components gupta et al 2009 wȩglarczyk 1998 what is concerning nevertheless is that many modelers seem more attracted to the higher efficiency values regardless of what this means for a model previous studies have shown that some commonly used criteria are not sensitive to systematic over and underpredictions and can even overestimate a model performance due to their oversensitivity to extreme values gupta et al 2009 krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 despite that many studies have used such criteria and recommended thresholds or intervals for criteria as guidelines for a model evaluation moriasi et al 2017 richter et al 2011 saleh et al 2010 santhi et al 2001 this approach can often be subjective as the same criterion score is not equivalent among basins under different contexts other authors have also focused on less subjective model evaluation guidance coffey et al 2004 gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019a ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 many of these studies have assessed the sensibility of one or more criterion for different watersheds scenarios and simulations chai and draxler 2014 coffey et al 2004 gupta et al 2009 krause et al 2005 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 willmott and matsuura 2005 to understand whether the modeling process is adequate researchers should address the important questions properly do these criteria capture important information for the study region are they good for the comparison among different watersheds does the criterion chosen for the optimization of the hydrological model adequately reflect its purpose different contexts call for a distinguished selection of criteria and benchmarking strategies floods usually receive higher attention in the news and scientific literature because of their clear and immediate consequences loon 2015 low flows on the other hand are also part of a recurrent and natural hazard but are often overlooked drought events can result in vast ecological and economic impacts pushpalatha et al 2011 such as in energy and food production transportation and recreation sheffield and wood 2012 tallaksen and lanen 2004 besides the direct impacts of human activities on streamflow are particularly enlarged during dry periods smakhtin 2001 for example abstractions for industrial agricultural or urban supplying purposes can increase water disputes while direct effluent flowing into river streams can lead to significant deterioration of water quality under low flow conditions moreover the selection of goodness of fit criteria should reflect the objective of the model for the proper development of water resource management strategies and planning instead of a single high value a holistic look should be taken upon the problem this is fundamental to adequately choose i a set of criteria to evaluate the model ii a reasonable series to benchmark the performance and iii a criterion or criteria to be optimized 1 2 scope of the paper the objectives of the present study are to review popular goodness of fit criteria and good practices for hydrological modeling and to assess the outcomes from using different criteria as the objective function for the calibration of a hydrological model the main findings are drawn from a case study to provide general guidelines additional emphasis is given to tropical regions where low flows are strategic for energy and food production and should receive more attention the increasing pressure on water resources increases the environmental and economic importance of low flows thus addressing hydrological modeling for low flow conditions especially in highly seasonal watersheds as tropical ones can fulfill an important need finally the study case is based on watersheds of the cerrado biome and the guidelines elaborate mainly on the selection of goodness of fit criteria for the calibration of hydrological models and the selection of functional benchmarking strategies the paper is organized as follows section 2 reviews the goodness of fit criteria and practices used in hydrological modeling section 3 describes the experimental design of the case study and the single and multi objective optimizations adopted for the hydrological model section 4 discusses the results concerning performance indexes error criteria hydrological signatures and trade offs of using multi objective functions section 5 presents the main conclusions 2 goodness of fit criteria in hydrological modeling in this section we present a review concerning different goodness of fit criteria used for calibration and performance evaluation in hydrological modeling studies the calibration of a hydrological model is often based on a single goodness of fit criterion which is either maximized or minimized by adjusting the model s parameters among the many recommendations for evaluating the performance of a hydrological model is to include at least one dimensionless criterion and one criterion in the same unit of the target variable criss and winston 2008 legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 in general the ideal value for a performance index dimensionless criterion is 1 and should be maximized as an objective function while the ideal value for an error measure is 0 and should be minimized to minimize an error measure criterion is the reason why the objective function is usually termed loss or cost function i e the optimization seeks to minimize the loss or cost aside from performance indexes and error measures signature measures or hydrological signatures have gained a lot of popularity in recent years these signatures have been used to describe flow behavior and watershed functions addor et al 2018 mcmillan 2020a 2020b sawicz et al 2014 westerberg et al 2016 such signatures have also been adapted to evaluate the hydrological model consistency i e ability to reproduce observed hydrological behaviors beck et al 2016 euser et al 2013 kratzert et al 2019 yilmaz et al 2008 the idea is that the modelers should not seek high performance indexes at the cost of hydrological consistency in summary the main objective of this section is to synthesize the goodness of fit criteria its advantages and disadvantages and the good practices of studies well reported in the literature coffey et al 2004 euser et al 2013 gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019a krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 mcmillan 2020a ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 schaefli and gupta 2007 yilmaz et al 2008 some of these studies also report on adaption strategies and based on case studies and or simulations the strengths and drawbacks of different criteria a diagram of the goodness fit criteria discussed in this section is presented in fig 1 2 1 performance indexes the performance indexes presented in this section are the coefficient of determination r2 the index of agreement d the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse the kling gupta efficiency kge and the volumetric efficiency ve despite some of these criteria having their demerits widely reported in the literature they are still at times used to evaluated models performance and therefore are reported here to reinforce that precaution is necessary when these indexes are used 2 1 1 coefficient of determination the coefficient of determination r2 represents the amount of variance in observed data that is explained by the model it is proposed as a measure of how close the observed predicted regression line approaches the ideal fit coffey et al 2004 its value is dimensionless and its range is bounded from 0 to 1 where 0 means that the model is incapable of detecting variance in observed data and1 indicates the perfect fit r2 is calculated as follows 1 r 2 i 1 n o i o p i p i 1 n o i o 2 i 1 n p i p 2 2 0 r 2 1 oi and pi are observed and predicted simulated values at time step i the overbar denotes the mean for the entire period and n denotes the total number of time steps despite some authors having reported r2 values above 0 50 to be considered acceptable santhi et al 2001 one of its major drawbacks is its oversensitivity to extreme values krause et al 2005 legates and mccabe 1999 moriasi et al 2017 this means that by following observed data during extreme events a model will yield a high r2 value which confuses the true relationship between observed and predicted data legates and mccabe 1999 another important drawback is that r2 is insensitive to systematic under or overprediction moriasi et al 2017 for these reasons additional information should always be considered when assessing a model r2 value for instance krause et al 2005 suggest that the slope of the fitted regression line b should always be discussed together with r2 ideally the fitted regression line should present an intercept equal to 0 and a slope equal to 1 thus krause et al 2005 proposed a weighted version of the coefficient of determination wr2 an adaption that accounts for b the weighting is performed as follows 2 w r 2 b r 2 for b 1 b 1 r 2 for b 1 0 wr 2 1 while better reflecting a model s poor performance this criterion still shows sensitivity to peak flows and is nearly insensitive to improvements of the low flow conditions krause et al 2005 for this reason r2 is more commonly seen accompanying regression plots but not used for the evaluation or optimization of hydrological models 2 1 2 index of agreement the index of agreement d was initially proposed by willmott 1981 to overcome the drawbacks of the r2 such as the differences in observed and predicted means and variances legates and mccabe 1999 d is also dimensionless and bounded between 0 and 1 and can be interpreted similarly to r2 the general formula of the index may be defined as 3 d 1 i 1 n o i p i j i 1 n o i o p i o j 0 d 1 where j is the exponent coefficient j 2 in its original form and d roughly represents the subtraction of the ratio between mean squared error and potential error from one willmott s index is widely used and a reliable coefficient of performance where d is multiplied by pearson s coefficient of correlation has even been proposed by camargo and sentelhas 1997 along with a set of interpretable threshold values however krause et al 2005 and legates and mccabe 1999 point out that relatively high values of d 0 65 may be found for poorly performing models despite being developed to overcome some drawbacks of correlation based criteria such as the r2 d has shown to be sensitive to peak flows and insensitive to low flows and systematic errors krause et al 2005 adaption strategies to overcome d sensitivity to peak flows and insensitivity to low flows include using j 1 willmott et al 1985 or its relative form eq 4 note that the values calculated by modified forms are in general lower than the values calculated by the original form according to krause et al 2005 the modified exponent j 1 leads to a criterion less sensitive to peak flows and more sensitive to low flows while its relative form show close to no sensitivity to peak flows but is very sensitive to low flows 4 d rel 1 i 1 n o i p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o p i o o 2 0 d 1 with time the index shortcomings led to a decrease in popularity d may at times be presented alongside other indexes but is not seen for decisive tasks as for the calibration of models 2 1 3 nash sutcliffe efficiency index the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse is perhaps the most popular and widely used goodness of fit criterion in hydrological studies its main improvement upon r2 and d for performance evaluation is its higher sensitivity to systematic under or overprediction this means that the nse is penalized when the slope and intercept of the fitted regression line depart from 1 and 0 respectively on the other hand the nse lower limit is unbounded and its interpretation differs from r2 and d it is defined as one minus the mean squared error mse normalized by the variance of the observed values σ2 therefore a high nse value indicates a low mismatch between predicted and observed values in relation to the standard deviation of observed values its general form is 5 nse 1 i 1 n o i p i j i 1 n o i b i j n s e 1 where bi is the benchmark series at time step i in its original form j 2 and bi o the different interpretability of the nse is its biggest advantage its value is interpretable as a skill score of the model s ability to reproduce the observed data in relation to a baseline or benchmark model gupta et al 2009 in its original form the baseline is the mean of observed data and an nse value smaller than or equal to 0 means that the model is no better than using the baseline model mean of observed data as the predictor in the past studies have considered a model as useful when nse 0 i e the model can make better predictions of streamflow than by assuming the mean of observed data however this threshold has long been condemned garrick et al 1978 knoben et al 2019a legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 many authors attempted to establish new threshold values for performance ratings bracmort et al 2006 motovilov et al 1999 saleh et al 2010 santhi et al 2001 singh et al 2005 in a thorough review of many of these works moriasi et al 2017 suggested that a model can be trustful when nse 0 50 yet despite these thresholds being apparently useful basins with different seasonality and rainfall runoff dynamics should not have nse values directly compared gupta et al 2009 instead a more appropriate baseline should be set for its benchmark series eq 5 such as seasonal or climatological mean garrick et al 1978 gupta et al 2009 knoben et al 2019a legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 schaefli and gupta 2007 in this case nse 0 would truly mean that the model is useful albeit an improved index the drawbacks of the nse are similar to that of r2 and d as its original form squares the differences between observed and predicted values it is also oversensitive to peak flows other researchers have also documented the nse to underestimate observed flows variability gupta et al 2009 mizukami et al 2019 this may result in inflated nse which does not adequately represent the model bias and performance similar to d adaptions strategies include modified versions as adopting j 1 legates and mccabe 1999 a relative form eq 6 and a logarithmic form eq 7 krause et al 2005 6 nse rel 1 i 1 n o i p i o i 2 i 1 n o i o o 2 n s e 1 7 nse log 1 i 1 n log o i log p i 2 i 1 n log o i log o 2 n s e 1 krause et al 2005 illustrated the nse using j 1 or termed here as modified nse mnse to be less sensitive to peak flows and more sensitive to low flows according to the authors the logarithmic form is even less sensitive to peak flows while the relative form is almost insensitive the logarithmic and relative forms are also more sensitive to low flows while the latter is the most sensitive 2 1 4 volumetric efficiency index the volumetric efficiency index ve was originally proposed by criss and winston 2008 to circumvent some of the nse flaws ve values are also bounded 0 1 and represent the fraction of water delivered at the proper time while its complement represents the mismatch the index is calculated as 8 ve 1 i 1 n p i o i i 1 n o i 0 v e 1 the main advantages of the index are its obvious significance and easy interpretability ve presents a linear correlation to the slope of the fitted regression line and decreases linearly when the model degrades as opposed to other criteria the criterion is less frequently presented alongside other criteria and has not been used as an objective function for decisive tasks in hydrological modeling furthermore it is analogous to the mnse and the mean absolute error criterion see section 2 2 but normalized by the average observation yet if the index was chosen as an objective function the expected results are similar to using mnse as only the sum of the absolute error numerator is not constant in the equation 2 1 5 kling gupta efficiency index the kling gupta efficiency index kge was proposed by gupta et al 2009 to better diagnosticate the relative importance of three components correlation bias and measure of variability gupta et al 2009 wȩglarczyk 1998 they showed that maximizing nse leads to the underestimation of flow variability the kge is then presented as an alternative criterion to reduce such problems the index is formulated by calculating the euclidian distance of all three components 9 kge 1 e d k g e 1 with ed s r r 1 2 s α α 1 2 s β β 1 2 where ed is the euclidian distance r is the linear correlation coefficient between oi and pi α is the variability ratio or ratio between the standard deviation of simulated values and standard deviation of observed values σ p σ o β is the ratio between mean of the simulated and observed values μ p μ o or p o sr sα and sβ are scaling factors that can re scale the criteria space before computing the ed that is emphasizing different components conventionally the scaling factors have equal weight i e sr sα sβ 1 gupta et al 2009 detail how optimizing a model using kge or nse leads to the underestimation of peak flows overestimation of low flows but in the case of kge it is not as severe the authors also argue that there are many reasons for a model performance to deteriorate during the evaluation period however when optimizing a hydrological model for several basins using nse resulted in an underestimation of the variability ratio while kge retained the ratio close to unity a further adaption is also presented for the variability ratio by kling et al 2012 the authors recommend the variability ratio to be the ratio between coefficient of variation of the simulated and observed values cvp cvo kling et al 2012 comment that the modified kge kge2 ensures that the variability ratio and bias are not cross correlated which may occur for biased inputs although kge is set to the same interval of nse to 1 knoben et al 2019 highlight that modelers should not guide their interpretability in the same way for instance using the mean observed as prediction results in nse 0 but kge 0 41 therefore nse and kge values should not be treated as approximately equivalent knoben et al 2019a however kge 0 41 should not be set as a benchmark for similar reasons as mentioned for nse other benchmark categories have been proposed towner et al 2019 which may be informative but should be used carefully 2 2 error measures error measures are frequently presented in conjunction with performance indexes for their informative value while indexes are usually bounded and dimensionless error criteria measures are generally in absolute units a number of these criteria have been used and recommended over the years chai and draxler 2014 moriasi et al 2017 richter et al 2011 willmott and matsuura 2005 perhaps the most popular ones are the percentage bias pbias mean error mbe mean absolute error mae and root mean squared error rmse note that the mse is simply the squared version of rmse the advantage of rmse over mse is that the criterion is in the same unit as the target variable being more easily interpretable they are calculated as 10 pbias 100 i 1 n p i o i i 1 n o i p b i a s 11 mbe i 1 n p i o i n m b e 12 mae i 1 n p i o i n 0 m a e 13 rmse i 1 n p i o i 2 n 0 r m s e the mean error or bias mbe measures the general tendency of the simulated values to under or overestimate the observed values the pbias has the same purpose but is normalized by the average of observed values i e it is equivalent to mbe o a pbias threshold of 25 was set by moriasi et al 2017 for a model to be considered satisfactory although the criterion alone is insufficient for model evaluation the mae represents the magnitude of the average error of the simulation rmse serves a similar purpose to mae but because of its squared components it weighs more heavily on larger errors by definition rmse is never smaller than mae chai and draxler 2014 discussed that despite their similar purpose it is important to present both rmse and mae values according to the authors the rmse is sensitive to outliers and operates as a criterion of the error distribution mae and rmse do however present a clear disadvantage when used to compare the performance of a model across different watersheds as different watersheds can have different hydrologic dynamics the magnitude and variability of discharge values may significantly fluctuate even when adopting units that are independent of the watershed area e g l s 1 km 1 or mm day 1 other error criteria that deserve to be mentioned despite not being in absolute units is the normalized root mean square error i e the ratio between rmse and the range of the observations nrmse or ratio of rmse to the standard deviation of the observations rsr and the mean absolute relative error mare nrmse and rsr penalize the criteria for a large variation in observed data while mare gives the same emphasis to relative errors regardless of peak or low flow conditions these criteria are better used in the comparison of performances across different watersheds although using the range of the observations in nrmse may be more subjective to outliers than the standard deviation used for rsr additionally despite moriasi et al 2007 recommending threshold values for both rsr and nse one criterion essentially reveals the other this is because nse can also be described as 1 mse σ o 2 or 1 rmse σ o 2 which ultimately is the same as 1 rsr 2 regarding the use of such criteria as cost functions the pbias and mbe are not seen at all as using a simple average of observed data as predictions could result in a perfect fit the average of observed values has already been discussed here to be an undesirable benchmark let alone a model prediction among the other aforementioned error criteria the rmse or mse is the most widely used as a loss function its drawbacks however are similar to those of r2 d and nse because it squares the errors it is oversensitive to peak flows additionally minimizing either rmse nrmse or rsr in optimization tasks is equivalent to maximizing nse since σ o is constant during the task mae on the other hand is rarely seen as a loss function it is likely used only in special cases when more emphasis should be given to lower values moreover to optimize mae would stand the same purpose optimizing the mnse as mnse can also be described as 1 mae σ o mare is likewise rarely seen in optimization tasks nonetheless it is expected to present a similar outcome to using nserel as the objective function although it does not square the errors this perhaps indicates that mare may be less sensitive to low flow conditions than nserel 2 3 hydrological signatures as a descriptor of watershed characteristics hydrological signatures can be derived from multiple data sources for example satellite derived soil moisture rainfall snow etc addor et al 2018 euser et al 2013 such signatures are particularly useful in regionalization studies however the focus here is on signatures used to best describe and evaluate hydrological models thus this section focuses on signatures based on discharge time series only considering the diversity of hydrologic signatures the selection of appropriate ones can be challenging addor et al 2018 euser et al 2013 mcmillan 2020a the choice must enable the characterization of hydrological features processes of interest during modeling but without redundancy different studies have used different signatures or even calculated signatures by different equations e g baseflow index addor et al 2018 among the most commonly used signatures are the ones derived from flow duration curves fdc for example the study by yilmaz et al 2008 presented the percent bias in the fdc low and high segment volume flv and fhv in the fdc midsegment slope fms and in median log flow fmm flv is a diagnostic signature for long term baseflow while fhv and fms are diagnostic measures for vertical redistribution and fmm a diagnostic measure for midflow behavior yilmaz et al 2008 they are calculated as 14 flv 100 l 1 l log p l log p l l 1 l log o l log o l l 1 l log o l log o l f l v 15 fhv 100 h 1 h p h o h h 1 h o h f h v 16 fms 100 log p m 1 log p m 2 log o m 1 log o m 2 log o m 1 log o m 2 f m s 17 fmm 100 log p med log o med log o med f m m where l 1 2 l are the indices for flow values located in the low flow segment exceedance probabilities between 70 and 100 h 1 2 h are the indices for flow values located in the high flow segment exceedance probability lower than 2 m1 and m2 are the highest and lowest flow exceedance probabilities within the midsegment of the fdc 20 and 70 respectively and med the index for median flow values other hydrological signatures that are used mainly to describe hydrologic behavior have also been used to assess the performance of hydrological models some of the more popular are also based on the fdc as flow values at specific exceedance probabilities e g 1 5 10 50 90 95 99 and their transformed values beck et al 2016 westerberg et al 2016 or a performance index for the fdcs of predicted and observed discharge values other signatures are based on flow dynamics as the baseflow index bfi gustard et al 1992 flow lag 1 autocorrelation euser et al 2013 shafii and tolson 2015 mean flow transformed mean flow squared log etc and flow variability coefficient of variation aside from the aforementioned signatures there is a range of other signatures that have been used in different studies especially when considering other sources of data than discharge addor et al 2018 euser et al 2013 mcmillan 2020a shafii and tolson 2015 2015 westerberg et al 2016 yilmaz et al 2008 yet for signatures describing hydrogram characteristics to be used as goodness of fit criteria a few formulations have been suggested as hydrological signature scores hss beck et al 2016 proposed a score hss1 based on the absolute difference between signatures normalized by the signature standard deviation obtained over a large sample of watersheds eq 18 while euser et al 2013 suggested using the absolute relative difference between signatures hss2 eq 19 18 hs s 1 hs p hs o σ hs 19 hs s 2 1 hs o hs p hs o where hsp and hso are the hydrological signatures computed for the predicted and observed discharge series and σ hs the standard deviation of the signature other authors have also suggested more elaborate scoring systems where the relative difference between signatures passes through a binary 0 or 1 or a continuous scoring function ranging from 0 to 1 2 4 good practices 2 4 1 benchmarking and skill scores as previously discussed the use of intervals and threshold values of criteria is a subjective means to evaluate the performance of a hydrological model especially across different basins most of these criteria rely on the basins dynamics and seasonality instead a benchmark series should be purpose dependent set with justifiable values and achieve basic requirements that a hydrologist can promptly understand knoben et al 2019a schaefli and gupta 2007 although an alternative way of benchmarking has already been discussed for the nse section 2 1 3 other criteria lack an inherent benchmarking method a useful practice reported in different studies hirpa et al 2018 knoben et al 2019a towner et al 2019 is to set a proper benchmark series and compute a criterion skill score the skill score is therefore used to assess the relative improvement deterioration of a given criterion in relation to the benchmark series an example of skill score improvement for the kge is as follows 20 kge ss kge model kge benchmark 1 kge benchmark where kgess is the relative improvement of the kge skill score kgemodel is the kge achieved by the hydrological model eq 9 and kgebenchmark is the kge achieved by the benchmark series i e kge calculated using flow values from a previously set benchmark series instead of the values simulated by the hydrological model for a single hydrological model it is common to set the benchmark series to a default run i e a comparative run using default parameters towner et al 2019 mean monthly values are also justifiable and indicated for basins with strong seasonality althoff et al 2021 garrick et al 1978 legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 for models developed for forecasting it is common to use the naïve guess as a benchmark i e estimate the river discharge on the next time step to be equal to the last available measurement on the other hand when comparing many different hydrological models it is also common to set the benchmark series as the simpler model to which improvements are pursued on 2 4 2 multi objective optimization the complexity of the calibration problem makes it difficult if not impossible to find a single set of optimal parameters duan et al 1992 gupta et al 1998 in an attempt to find more coherent results several studies have aggregated objective functions as a single objective function beck et al 2016 shafii and tolson 2015 the kge is an example of an aggregated multi objective function that is based on the decomposition of errors in terms of flow bias flow variability and flow dynamics gupta et al 2009 the shortcoming of this practice is that the trade off between individual components may not be explored wöhling et al 2013 additionally the choice of redundant correlated criteria can lead to disproportional weighting and bias in the last two decades multi objective optimization techniques have shown more realistic and robust parameter estimation it is not possible to find a parameter set that optimizes conflicting criteria simultaneously however acceptable trade offs may be found for a subset of solutions equally efficient parameter sets are often referred to as pareto optimal or nondominated solutions however the number of pareto solutions tends to increase when a large number of objective functions is used dominance resistance issue shafii and tolson 2015 shafii and tolson 2015 dealt with dominance resistance by i aggregating a few of the objective functions or ii using a binary scoring function for some of the objective functions to be optimized up to an acceptable level and not unconditionally overall multi objective optimization leads to parameters sets with better compromised solutions and undoubtedly better hydrological consistency efstratiadis and koutsoyiannis 2010 shafii and tolson 2015 wöhling et al 2013 2 4 3 other techniques other researchers have elaborated on different practices for instance ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 propose to assess the confidence interval of the calculated criteria via bootstrapping i e aggregating the criteria achieved through many resamples with replacement of predicted and observed values harmel et al 2010 suggest incorporating a correction factor to goodness of fit criteria to account for sources of uncertainty some authors have also suggested using the aforementioned multi objective model calibration gupta et al 1998 wöhling et al 2013 alongside goodness of fit criteria graphical results are also considered good practice gupta et al 2009 legates and mccabe 1999 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 willmott et al 1985 among these we highlight the use of scatterplots time series plot and accumulated frequency curves which are useful in diagnosing systematic issues with the chosen model 3 case study the case study consisted of calibrating a hydrological model to several watersheds individually pooling their calibration and validation performances and repeating this process for different objective functions several goodness of fit criteria were evaluated for each objective function being optimized the goodness of fit criteria were chosen based on the review presented in section 2 especial emphasis is given to different ranges of the observed values i e aside from assessing the criteria for all observed simulated pairs a percentage of the upper and lower observed values are assessed separately this allows for more conclusions to be drawn from the results for a given objective function 3 1 hydrological model the model chosen for the case study is the gr5j le moine 2008 a five parameter daily lumped rainfall runoff hydrological model the water balance of this model includes a soil moisture accounting reservoir s and a conceptual water exchange function f the routing structure consists of two unit hydrographs and a non linear reservoir providing two flow components the water exchange function f allows simulating the imports or exports of water with deep aquifers or surrounding reservoirs pushpalatha et al 2011 according to pushpalatha et al 2011 by including a threshold parameter to f the gr5j model presented a significant performance improvement over the gr4j model perrin et al 2003 especially in low flow conditions therefore the model should be reasonably sensitive to the use of objective functions with different purposes the only variables required by the gr5j model are the potential evaporation and rainfall the model runs were performed using r environment and programming language r core team 2020 and airgr package coron et al 2020 2017 3 2 study area and data the area chosen for the study is the brazilian savanna biome the cerrado fig 2 most of the cerrado presents tropical savannah climate classification alvares et al 2014 köppen 1936 aw i e distinct wet and dry seasons with dry winter and monthly mean temperatures above 18 c the relevance of the study area to the study comes from its climate seasonality tropical watersheds present high and seasonal inputs of water and energy which result in extreme hydrological cycles pereira 2019 this study area was also chosen for its relevance to the country the cerrado distributes water for many important rivers and has been considered one of the most important biomes for water resources in brazil oliveira et al 2016 the cerrado is also a focal point of agricultural frontiers and irrigation expansion althoff and rodrigues 2019 rada 2013 rodrigues et al 2012 its strong seasonality however requires special attention to water resources despite the abundance of water availability during the wet season the long lasting dry season results in water shortage and conflicts over its use in many regions moreover most of the rivers in the region are ungauged and lack information for proper water planning and management 3 2 1 discharge data discharge data of gauge stations were collected at the hidroweb portal electronic address http www snirh gov br hidroweb serieshistoricas which is part of the national system of water resources information in pt sistema nacional de informações sobre recursos hídricos snirh the snirh offers access to the database containing information collected by the national hydrometeorological network in pt rede hidrometeorológica nacional rhn the governmental agency responsible for the rhn is the national water agency in pt agência nacional de águas the study period of 14 5 years from 1 june 2000 to 31 december 2014 was chosen considering the temporal coverage of used datasets the discharge dataset only presented consisted data up to 31 december 2014 while evapotranspiration and rainfall data were only available from 1 june 2000 in the screening process gauge stations with 10 missing data were removed from the analyses the mean monthly discharge and their cumulative frequencies are presented in fig 3 for all of the 179 tropical watersheds used in this study 3 2 2 rainfall and potential evapotranspiration to adequately address the rainfall and evapotranspiration across the watersheds gridded data products at daily resolution were chosen the integrated multi satellite retrievals for the global precipitation measurement gpm mission imerg huffman et al 2019b 2019a was chosen to represent rainfall while the eto brazil althoff et al 2020a 2020b was chosen to represent the potential evapotranspiration over the watersheds the imerg data set has been widely tested and is considered one of the most reliable gridded rainfall estimates as showcased for brazil by gadelha et al 2019 the eto brazil on the other hand is a gridded database developed for the penman monteith allen et al 1998 reference evapotranspiration using state of art techniques and matching the imerg spatial and temporal resolution although not for potential evapotranspiration many hydrological models have been developed and adopted reference evapotranspiration in their use arnold et al 1998 xiang et al 2020 yuan et al 2018 zhao et al 2013 besides this dataset compensates for the low density of weather stations in the region as the gr5j is a lumped model both variables had their daily values extracted and averaged for the gauge stations corresponding watersheds the watersheds were delimited using the taudem toolset tarboton 2008 and the srtm void filled earth resources observation and science center 2017 at 3 arc seconds 90 m spatial resolution the imerg and eto brazil mean monthly data are presented in fig 4 3 3 model calibration and validation the data set temporal coverage was split into three periods the first 2 5 years were used for the hydrological model warm up the following 9 years for the calibration of the model s parameters and the latest 3 years for validation two calibration approaches were assessed single objective optimization and multi objective optimizations the model was calibrated several times for each watershed individually each time considering a different calibration approach and objective function 3 3 1 single objective functions based on the review the criteria which we considered more relevant to be used as the objective function in the model calibration were the kge kge2 nse mnse nselog nserel mare the r2 d and their adapted versions were not chosen for this task because they have long been considered less fit than the chosen criteria to do so as also discussed using mae or ve as an objective function would stand the same purpose as would mnse while mse rmse nrmse and rsr would stand for the same purpose as would nse the model was optimized using the r environment and programming language r core team 2020 and the technique adopted was the particle swarm optimization pso clerc 2012 parsopoulos and vrahatis 2002 zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2013 the pso was implemented using hydropso package zambrano bigiarini and rojas 2020 3 3 2 multi objective functions four different scenarios of multi objective optimizations mo were assessed the first scenario mo1 was set as an attempt to adjust better predictions for both extreme high and low flow conditions while the second to fourth scenarios of multi objective optimizations mo2 to mo4 were designed to weigh more heavily on low flow conditions considering that the main issue for the cerrado is water availability putting more weight on low flow conditions is of particular interest when calibrating hydrological models for the biome mo1 and mo2 consisted of only performance indexes while mo3 consisted of both a performance index and a hydrological signature and mo4 consisted of a performance index and an aggregate function of hydrological signatures that should correlate well under low flow conditions although using redundant hydrological signatures is not recommended they were aggregated and therefore do not overweigh on the model calibration mo1 consisted of maximizing both the kge calculated under peak and low flow conditions upper 10 and lower 25 of the observed discharges kgelow kgehigh mo2 maximized the kge and the nserel kge nserel mo3 maximized the kge and the bfi kge bfi and mo4 maximized kge and an aggregate function of multiple hydrologic signature scores designed to assess discharge under low flow conditions kge hslow the aggregate function is a simple average of the hydrological signature scores for flv and the discharges at exceedance probabilities of 90 and 95 q90 and q95 respectively q90 and q95 are flow indexes commonly used as a reference for water grants in brazil the hydrological signature scores were calculated using eq 19 for q90 and q95 while for flv we used 1 flv the solution of the pareto front with the smallest euclidean distance to 1 was subset to evaluate performance this choice gives equal weights to both criteria and is a simple alternative to choosing the solution closer to the optimal point the model was optimized using the r environment and programming language r core team 2020 and the technique adopted was the multi objective particle swarm optimization with crowding distance mopso cd raquel and naval 2005 the crowding distance computation ensures that an even spread of non dominated solutions is found the mopso cd was implemented using mopsocd package naval 2013 3 4 model evaluation the models were evaluated both for their calibration and validation periods in this step several criteria were chosen aside from the performance indexes used in optimization tasks the error criteria rmse mae and pbias and the hydrological signatures flv fhv fms fmm bfi q90 and q95 were also included in the evaluation the signature scores eq 19 were calculated for bfi q90 and q95 flv fhv fms and fmm were kept as in their original form for each watershed objective function and period calibration and validation the performance indexes and error criteria were evaluated for i the entire series ii peak flow conditions and iii the low flow conditions for the evaluation of peak and low flow conditions the upper 10 and lower 25 of the observations were assessed separately these percentiles were set considering the skewness of the discharge data i e more data observations are available for low flow conditions when compared to peak flow conditions fig 2b almost 90 of the peak flow values came from the months from december to march while almost 90 of the low flow values came from june to october the hydrological signatures are designed for specific ranges in the cumulative distribution functions or consider the time series entirely for this reason they were not included in the evaluation under peak and low flow conditions skill scores were calculated for all the performance indexes using a benchmark series the benchmark series was set to each gauge station as their corresponding mean monthly discharges calculated for the calibration period this seems to be a reasonable benchmark for the tropical watersheds althoff et al 2021 especially given their strong seasonality fig 2a 4 results and discussion 4 1 assessing the performance of hydrological models the model performance during both the calibration and validation period for all watersheds and different objective functions is shown in figs 4 6 there is an overall deterioration of performance when comparing the calibration and validation periods perhaps a better validation could arise from assessing different calibration periods however this would significantly increase the computation cost for the analyses and is not the objective of the current study besides gupta et al 2009 report that there are many reasonable reasons for model deterioration during the validation period such as over fitting non stationarity between periods and lack of power in the optimized function moreover the objective in this section is to address the first question hydrologists or modelers should consider do these models have value we addressed this question by considering the skill scores eq 20 obtained over a reasonable benchmark series i e naïvely set to the mean monthly discharges of the calibration period for each gauge station thus it is possible to objectively conclude on the hydrological model efficacy fig 5 shows the skill scores for all the performance indexes considered in the evaluation of the hydrological model for all watersheds a red dashed horizontal line was set at 0 in fig 5 to indicate whether the calibrated models outperformed the benchmark series the skill score is particularly useful when assessing large scale hydrological modeling because it is easier to declare models as useful by reporting them higher than zero i e outperforming a reasonable benchmark series in contrast using the same range values for watersheds under different hydrological contexts can be misleading considering all the observations each criterion presented values closer to 1 when they were used as the objective function which was expected the objective functions showed similar performance concerning indexes based on absolute values mnse and ve while the kge kge2 nse and nselog resulted in better performance among themselves when they were used as the objective function a similar performance was also observed for the relative based criteria nserel and mare under low flow conditions the best results from best to worst were achieved by optimizing mare nserel mnse nselog kge kge2 and nse the poor overall performance from the nse is an outcome of squaring errors which makes the model insensitive to low flow conditions kge kge2 and nselog performed better than the nse under low flow conditions but still worse than mare and nserel which can be attributed to their correlation based nature in contrast optimizing mare and nserel lead to higher values for all the performance indexes under low flow conditions mare presented slightly higher criteria than nserel under low flow conditions which can be attributed to using absolute relative errors instead of squared relative errors optimizing mnse showed balanced results under both low and peak flow conditions as for peak flow conditions optimizing mare and nserel resulted in the worse values for all the indexes while optimizing the other criteria resulted in a similar performance the error measures reinforce the behavior shown by the performance indexes fig 6 optimizing indexes based on relative errors nserel and mare resulted in lower errors and biases under low flow conditions while optimizing nse resulted in the largest errors in contrast using nserel and mare as objective functions resulted in larger biases and absolute errors under peak flow and overall conditions under peak flow conditions the optimization of kge kge2 nse and nselog led to similar results every objective function resulted in some extent of biases the pbias shows that using mare and nserel as objective functions led to the underestimation of peak flow conditions and overall discharge values in contrast nse mnse and nselog resulted in the general underestimation of peak flows and over estimation of low flows as has already been reported for nse criteria by other authors gupta et al 2009 mizukami et al 2019 the kge and kge2 showed the best performances concerning bias for all the observations and low and peak flow conditions thus optimizing nse as traditionally done in many hydrological modeling studies seems to have no clear benefit when compared to the other criteria for example the nselog and mnse as objective functions showed similar performance to the nse under peak flow conditions but resulted in much more balanced predictions under low flow conditions especially the mnse the performance indexes show that the overall performance for low flow conditions was worse than for peak flow conditions despite the smaller magnitude of errors seen under low flow conditions they are high relative to the observed values high mare in fig 6 also the lower standard deviation seen under low flow conditions low slope in cdf compared to that under peak flow conditions high slope in cdf fig 2b makes it so higher relative errors result in a decrease in performance for the correlation based indexes besides different hydrological models put different emphasis on different hydrological processes which means certain processes may be underrepresented and perform poorly in different ranges of the cumulative distribution function anyhow the high skill scores 0 achieved for low flow conditions still mean that the models outperformed the baseline we set the comparison between the hydrological signatures of observed and predicted discharge series i e hydrological signature scores are shown in fig 7 bfi showed similar performance as the objective functions did for kge in overall observations thus the high bfi scores for optimizing kge are likely an outcome of more balanced predictions concerning the biases in contrast the lack of sensitivity of mare and rnse to peak flow conditions resulted in worse bfi scores no criteria performed particularly better than the other for the diagnostic signature measures flv although kge kge2 and nse showed large dispersion of the measures kge and kge2 did on the other hand result in measures closer to the desired for fms fmm and fhv which may be an outcome for the more balanced overall biases the objective functions showed a similar trend in performance when comparing the q90 and q95 to predictions under low flow conditions i e the relative based criteria resulted in better estimates under low flow conditions and more consistency in estimating the discharge for low exceedance probability levels high performance for such criteria is crucial considering that water grants in brazil are for the most part based on these hydrological signatures in this sense hydrological signatures are useful to assess if the predictions are consistent for the desired hydrological processes 4 2 comparison between single and multi objective optimization the performance of the multi objective optimizations is compared to that of the single objective functions kge nse and nserel figs 8 10 these three single objective functions were chosen because one of them provided overall good performance and low bias kge one is considered the traditional criterion nse and the other excelled under low flow conditions nserel concerning the performance indexes fig 8 and error criteria fig 9 optimizing the kge of low and peak flow conditions kgelow and kgehigh respectively at the same time did not result in satisfactory results despite showing improvements concerning low flow conditions the model performed considerably worse for peak flow conditions it seems that neglecting the predictions in between low and peak flow conditions resulted in poor modeling and trade off benefits in addition despite high kge under low flow conditions the model presented higher mare than the single objective alternative nserel including bfi in the multi objective function did not bring any benefit on the contrary the performance concerning all goodness of fit criteria seems to have deteriorated the model showed minor improvements for the bfi criteria fig 10 but presented larger deterioration to all the goodness of fit criteria when compared to models using only the kge as an optimization function perhaps the limitation of the conceptual model led to inconsistent results for the index and made it difficult to find a decent trade off another possible explanation is that the index is useful for comparisons among different watersheds but somehow inconsistent due to small changes in discharge simulations the multi objective functions developed by including an aggregate of hydrological signatures designed to weigh more heavily on low flow conditions showed only minor improvements when compared to kge these improvements concern low flow conditions and the hydrological signatures q90 and q95 but still performing worse than nserel in these matters on the other hand the multi objective function based in both kge and nserel which are the criteria that provided alone the better performance overall and under low flow conditions led to robust results the trade off between these two complementary criteria resulted in lower bias under all conditions similarly to kge the performance was similar to that of kge under peak flow conditions and to that of nserel under low flow conditions as for the hydrological signatures it resulted in better performance than nserel for flv fhv fms and bfi but worse for q90 and q95 some hydrologic signatures seem too one dimensional and despite being useful in diagnosing inconsistencies in a model they can lead to subjective trade offs during calibration in contrast the mechanism of performance indexes in reducing biases or errors under certain conditions can lead multi objective optimization functions into a more goal oriented and robust direction for example the outcome of optimizing the multi objective function kge nserel resulted in a somewhat similar flv and better q90 and q95 estimates than did kge hslow which included these scores in the aggregate function 4 3 summary and guidelines the best all around performances were achieved when kge and kge2 were used as objective functions this can be attributed to the index improving predictions in terms of bias variability and dynamics gupta et al 2009 they showed lower errors under low flow conditions than the nse and the lowest pbias among all objective functions the lowest bias for both low and peak flows means that kge and kge2 are more adequate to weigh in the discharge variability in overall conditions among the two kge showed a slight superiority concerning relative errors in addition to kge based criteria the mnse also resulted in good overall performance despite underestimating the variability as seen by the pbias under low and peak flow conditions it presented smaller errors than kge for low flows and mostly positive skill scores for peak flow conditions the advantage of calibrating mnse for low flows when compared to nse is because it uses absolute errors instead of squared errors since errors are generally larger under peak flow conditions figs 6 and 9 squaring them makes nse oversensitive to such conditions and less sensitive to errors under overall and low flow conditions under peak flow conditions except for mare and nserel all criteria used as objective functions presented similar results despite showing lower mare for the peak flow conditions optimizing nse or nselog resulted in the underestimation of discharge variability i e underestimation of peak flow negative pbias and overestimation of low flow conditions positive pbias the simulations from nse optimized models also presented similar mae and rmse to the models optimized for kge and kge2 therefore using nse and nselog as objective functions did not show much of an advantage in any condition however maximizing nselog resulted in better simulations than maximizing nse because log transformation generally reduces data skewness when its distribution is closely related to log normal distributions fig 3b there is less emphasis on peak flows thus nselog optimized streamflow predictions showed better performance for low flows and overall flow conditions but were still able to score similar performances to nse for peak flows in other words optimizing nselog instead of nse resulted in more reliable models for the tropical watersheds other more specific criteria have also been developed to improve extreme flow simulations for instance mizukami et al 2019 proposed a metric specifically targeted at annual peak flows despite achieving high performance for peak flow simulations the authors reported poor performance regarding other criteria and in the overall simulation of the hydrologic behavior therefore the application specific criterion should be used carefully the optimization of objective functions based on relative values mare and nserel resulted in a more significant improvement for the goodness of fit criteria under low flow conditions despite errors being smaller when compared to errors under overall and peak flow conditions see mae and rmse in fig 6 they are relatively larger when compared to observed flows see mare in fig 6 therefore putting more emphasis on relative errors during calibration will generally lead to better streamflow predictions for low flows although nserel squares the relative errors as an objective function it performed close to mare under low flow conditions these criteria should then be used as objective functions for regions where water availability is the major issue i e arid semi arid regions or regions with intensive water use abstractions during dry periods as for irrigation purposes however a downside of these objective functions is that they cannot be used for intermittent rivers as the denominator in their equation would in some situations be 0 in this case the mnse optimized models presented the next best performance under low flow conditions alternatively a small constant fraction of the mean observed flow can be added to streamflow observations or before log transformation to avoid the zero flow issue pushpalatha et al 2012 santos et al 2018 concerning hydrological signatures they are particularly useful to assess if a hydrological model is inconsistently good i e shows high performance but fails to describe certain hydrological processes or signatures thus using multi objective functions can help model specific scenarios e g adjusting parameters that perform well and are consistent with specific hydrological signatures multi objective functions enable the modeler to find decent trade offs between criteria that assess complementary aspects resulting in more robust models the main findings concerning the performance indexes and error measures are summarized in table 1 finally setting a reasonable benchmark series is strongly recommended in any case assessing relative improvements over a benchmark series or skill scores can provide objectiveness in concluding whether a model has value especially in large scale modeling in addition hydrological signatures can be assessed to check consistency for flow characteristics and hydrological processes 4 3 1 hydrological modeling in the cerrado in many regions of the cerrado the availability of water has been the motive for conflicts and disputes carvalho and magrini 2006 pousa et al 2019 despite the water abundance in some of its regions ana 2017 the water availability must be assessed carefully especially considering the current scenario for irrigation expansion althoff and rodrigues 2019 thus the calibration of hydrological models in these regions should be purposed oriented i e adequate choice of model optimization criteria and benchmark series the cerrado region is poorly monitored and most rivers are ungauged this results in low confidence for water managers to take action the long lasting dry season and lack of information can result in vulnerabilities and ineffective water management thus the main purpose for using hydrological models for watersheds in the cerrado biome is to assess the availability of water under low flow conditions concerning the benchmark series the low coefficient of variation of discharges during the dry season means that mean monthly discharges are a good option and therefore recommended here as a baseline for a model to improve on however it should be noted that mean monthly discharges are likely to provide inconsistent hydrological signatures and should not be considered in this matter considering either mare or nserel as a single objective function for the calibration of the hydrological model resulted in the best performance under low flow conditions this is because despite the errors being smaller under low flow conditions they are relatively large thus minimizing relative errors result in improvements under low flow conditions the single objective optimization for nserel resulted in better performance under low flow conditions when compared to the multi objective optimization for both kge and nserel however the multi objective optimization resulted in a more robust and realistic model that is with a better balance for overall conditions alternatively for intermittent rivers the multi objective function considering the kge along with specific hydrological signatures and or the mnse can provide balanced performance under low flow conditions especially when compared to the traditional nse 5 conclusions in this study we reviewed and explored a range of goodness of fit criteria and good practices for hydrological modeling the case study considering 179 watersheds in the cerrado biome reinforces aspects that have been discussed in several papers but also provides additional insights into hydrological modeling for tropical watersheds for example the nse criterion is insensitive to low flow conditions and resulted in the largest relative errors under low flow and overall conditions when used as an optimization function alternatively we recommend the kge kge resulted in similar performance as the nse under peak flow conditions but provided well rounded predictions with low biases in both extreme flow conditions the mnse also provided balanced predictions under low and peak flow conditions but with higher bias than the kge a reasonable benchmark series should also be set to compute relative improvements or skill scores of the model especially when working with a large sample of watersheds using thresholds for indexes should be avoided as they can be subjective under different hydrological contexts tropical watersheds on the other hand are regions playing a key role in energy and food production by considering the cerrado region to represent tropical watersheds we were able to put together guidelines for hydrological modeling in such regions because water availability in dry periods is a sensitive matter in the cerrado region performance indexes based on relative values are recommended e g the mare and nserel the optimization of multi objective functions is appealing well rounded robust models were calibrated using the kge and nserel as multi objective functions which reduced relative errors under both extreme and overall conditions as benchmark series mean monthly discharges are reasonable baselines for tropical watersheds especially in the cerrado where the discharges show low variability during the dry season credit authorship contribution statement daniel althoff conceptualization methodology data curation formal analysis

4428,drought events show a continuous spatiotemporal structure the evolution of drought and its probabilistic modeling from a three dimensional perspective are important for drought mitigation and risk management this study therefore aimed to extract hydrological drought variables using a three dimensional identification method in the upstream of heihe river basin uhhrb in northwest china during 1961 2014 then the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution of hydrological drought event was quantified and drought frequency was evaluated using copula functions results showed that the spatiotemporal structure of drought can be satisfactorily reflected using the three dimensional framework the most severe drought originated in the middle part of the basin and propagated towards the eastern part with variable migration velocity the gumbel copula was the most suitable model for determining the joint distribution of drought duration severity and area the conditional probability of drought variables with a given conditional factors decreases as the values of factor increase and the increasing trend had no significant effect on reducing the probability of drought occurrence for a relatively higher value of drought variable drought risks would be underestimated or overestimated if simply the and or or case return periods were considered drought frequency analysis considering the spatiotemporal drought features can be regarded as a reliable method this study could help to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution of drought and to facilitate water resources allocation and drought mitigation keywords hydrological drought dynamic evolution copula drought frequency analysis heihe river basin 1 introduction drought is an extreme climatic phenomenon resulting from water deficiency when precipitation falls below average for a prolonged period muli wambua 2018 zeleke et al 2017 drought occurs in almost all climate zones whether dry or wet dai 2011 lamneithem and parmendra 2018 zhang et al 2021 drought with long duration could lead to water shortage ecological damage and undermining human activities and socio economic development feng et al 2020 reddy and ganguli 2013 wmo 2006 the occurrence and spatiotemporal evolution of drought is important for developing measures for drought mitigation and management several studies have considered the spatiotemporal nature of drought to understand drought characteristics at the regional scale livada and assimakopoulos 2007 reddy and ganguli 2013 sheffield et al 2009 moreover several statistical methods such as wavelet analysis min et al 2003 principal component analysis pca cluster analysis chen and yang 2013 gocic and trajkovic 2014 and entropy theory she and xia 2012 have been used in the assessment of spatial pattern of drought these methods reduce drought events to a lower order subspace which discards some vital spatiotemporal information thereby limiting the real modeling of the spatiotemporal drought structures lloyd hughes 2012 xu et al 2015a although several studies have investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of drought deng et al 2018 li et al 2019 liu et al 2016 drought evolution has been generally analyzed in time and space separately either the time evolution of drought over a fixed area or the drought spatial patterns at a certain time moreover the areal average values or the areal extents in terms of percentage of total area are always considered as the spatial feature rather than the drought affected area which is one of the most important drought variables in the spatiotemporal analysis these analyses are often inadequate to describe the continuous spatiotemporal structure of drought moreover the evolution and frequency analysis of hydrological drought based on a three dimensional identification method has rarely been carried out stochastic characteristics of drought have been studied by employing probabilistic and stochastic methods ayantobo et al 2018c cancelliere and salas 2004 shiau 2006 and drought frequency analysis has been regularly utilized to describe their probabilistic nature many studies have focused on univariate or bivariate frequency analyses which cannot provide a multivariate assessment of droughts and explain the significant correlations among their variables serinaldi et al 2009 ayantobo et al 2018c liu et al 2015 therefore it is essential to examine drought frequencies from a multivariate perspective drought identification and characterization are imperative for the evolution and frequency analysis of drought xu et al 2015b intrinsically drought is a three dimensional continuum at space time scales and consideration of the space time drought structure is essential to understand the development of drought currently the common drought identification methods simplify the three dimensional drought structure to one dimension time or two dimensions longitude and latitude meaning drought features are separately identified in space and time a drought identification method called truncation method or run theory was proposed by yevjevich 1967 which can only extract temporal drought features from drought index time series on a one dimensional scale therefore several studies have developed the drought identification method in space time dimensions andreadis et al 2005 used a simple clustering algorithm that incorporated spatial contiguity to describe a spatial drought identification procedure lloyd hughes 2012 extended this clustering algorithm to an explicit three dimensional longitude latitude time structure based method which fulfilled the complete spatiotemporal representation of the drought event xu et al 2015a developed a three dimensional identification method to identify drought events and validate the rationality of identified drought events using remotely sensed soil moisture data due to the complexity of these methods the three dimensional drought identification method has not been widely used in drought evaluation copula functions have been extensively used to construct multivariate joint probability distributions of drought salvadori and de michele 2015 tosunoglu and can 2016 zhang and singh 2019 and multivariate drought frequency analysis has increased considerably in the last decades for example in the bivariate context shiau and modarres 2009 derived drought severity and duration frequency curves by using a copula function in iran mirakbari et al 2010 investigated regional meteorological drought frequency through bivariate copula functions lee et al 2013 applied frank and gumbel copula functions for bivariate drought frequency analysis in the trivariate context song and singh 2010 used a trivariate plackett copula to model the joint probability distribution of drought duration severity and inter arrival time ma et al 2013 utilized trivariate gaussian and student t copulas to model the joint distribution of drought duration severity and peak other studies also employed copula functions to study drought frequency analysis huang et al 2014a huang et al 2014b zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 in these studies the temporal nature of drought e g duration interval time and severity was often considered in drought frequency analysis however the spatial features as one important aspect to characterize the spatiotemporal structures of drought e g drought affected area were usually ignored this study aims at revealing the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution and risk of drought events in the upstream of heihe river basin uhhrb in northwest china firstly drought variables will be extracted using the three dimensional clustering methods then the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution of drought will be analyzed based on the identification results moreover the copula based multivariate modeling of drought variables is built to evaluate the occurrence probability and return period of drought events the objectives therefore are to 1 identify drought events from a three dimensional perspective 2 investigate the evolution of drought characteristics including duration severity and affected area 3 evaluate the multivariate drought probability and return periods using the copula based model the findings from this study will contribute to improving understanding of hydrological drought and could help water resources management of hhrb 2 study area and data the heihe river basin hhrb is the second largest inland river basin in northwest china the upper reach of hhrb 98 46 101 25 e 37 59 39 20 n with a drainage area of about 10 005 km2 is located above yingluoxia station fig 1 the upper reach of hhrb accounts for about 20 of the total basin area and contributes about 70 of the total runoff to the middle and lower reaches which supports the demands of agriculture ecology and socio economic development chen et al 2005 qin et al 2016 yang et al 2015 the study area has relatively abundant vegetation types with an elevation of about 1900 5000 m deng et al 2013 gao et al 2015 herzschuh et al 2006 the annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm to 700 mm and increases with elevation and the annual average temperature is approximately 2 c the annual average runoff is approximately 1 6 109 m3 and the intra annual variability of runoff is comparatively weak jin et al 2015 zhao and zhang 2005 in this study the standardized runoff index sri calculated using gridded runoff data will be utilized to describe drought events and their features shukla and wood 2008 liu et al 2019 the gridded runoff data were derived from the geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm gao et al 2015 yang et al 2015 which was available through the cold and arid regions science data center http westdc westgis ac cn the temporal and spatial resolution of the gridded runoff data are at monthly scale and 1 km respectively and the data length covers periods from 1961 to 2014 the gbehm has been validated using available observations and provided a satisfactory simulation of runoff in the study basin with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient ranging from 0 67 to 0 80 and absolute values of relative error re smaller than 10 gao et al 2015 3 methodology 3 1 standardized runoff index sri the standardized runoff index sri developed by shukla and wood 2008 was employed to evaluate the hydrological drought conditions based on the method of mckee et al 1993 for the standardized precipitation index spi the sri was also computed at multiple temporal scales the main difference is that the runoff series used as input for sri is fitted with a lognormal distribution duan and mei 2014 the classification standard for the sri is the same as that for spi and the value of 0 5 was selected as a threshold value indicating that sri values below 0 5 were regarded as drought occurrence wu et al 2015 the gbehm simulated runoff data were used to calculate the sri the 3 month time scale sri sri 3 was selected in the following analysis since the sri 1 is sensitive to the variation of influencing factors and owing to the reactivity of the sri 12 that slows down 3 2 identification of drought variables based on a three dimensional identification method drought evolution exhibits a space time structure longitude latitude and time the sri values were calculated for each 0 01 0 01 raster during 1961 2014 and drought variables were identified based on the three dimensional identification method proposed by andreadis et al 2005 the main steps include spatial identification and temporal connection in a three dimensional array and the applicability of this method has been validated liu et al 2019 xu et al 2015a the specific implementation steps are as follows 1 identify drought patches across the study area for each monthly time step 54 years 12 months the grids with sri values less than 0 5 were regarded as drought events and were further classified into different drought patches using the spatial clustering algorithm in this algorithm the adjacent drought grids were combined into one patch and if no drought grids existed in the adjacent positions of the current drought grids a new patch was created for the next drought grid the procedure was repeated for 54 12 months and drought patches were marked with different symbols 2 determine the temporal connection of drought patches in two adjacent months assuming two adjacent months namely the ith and i 1th if the overlap area of any couple of patches between the two adjacent months was beyond a minimum area threshold then the corresponding two patches belonged to the same drought event 3 extract the three dimensional drought events during the study period this procedure was implemented sequentially from the second month to the last month following the second step above a series of drought patches in continuous time were obtained and marked with different symbols a set of voxels with the same symbol represents one drought event based on the identification results of drought events six spatiotemporal drought variables were defined and calculated as follows drought duration d is the persistent time of a drought event i e the temporal span from the initiation time to the termination time of the event drought affected area a is the cumulative area affected by a drought event during the entire period it is the projected area of a three dimensional drought event over the longitude latitude surface drought severity s is the total amount of water deficit during a drought episode in the three dimensional space it is a cumulative value of the water deficit for a spatiotemporally continuous voxel in other words it is calculated over the whole drought duration and areal extent drought intensity i is calculated using drought severity divided by drought duration and drought area the center of a drought event c is the spatiotemporal location longitude latitude time of the event which can track the migration trajectory of the drought migration distance of drought md is the distance of the drought centroid between two adjacent months this requires converting the longitude and latitude of the monthly drought centroid to distance as follows fang et al 2019 1 δ x 110 94 cos y m π 180 x m 1 x m 2 δ y 110 94 y m 1 y m 3 l δ x 2 δ y 2 where δx andδy are respectively the migration distances of the drought centroid along the longitude and latitude directions from the m th month to the m 1 th month km l is the migration distance of the drought centroid between two adjacent months km xm and ym refer to the longitude and latitude coordinates of the drought centroid at the m th month xm 1 and ym 1 refer to the longitude and latitude coordinates of the drought centroid at the m 1 th month respectively 3 3 marginal distribution marginal distributions are needed for computing multivariate distributions of drought variables it is known that if there are errors in fitting marginal distributions then errors of the joint distribution calculation will increase huang et al 2014b thus it is necessary to accurately fit marginal distributions to drought variables seven three parameter distributions ayantobo et al 2018a ayantobo et al 2021 ma et al 2013 xiao et al 2019 were compared to select the best distributions for fitting d s and a detailed information on these distributions is given in table 1 the kolmogorov smirnov k s goodness of fit gof test was used to show whether these distributions passed the test at p 0 05 significance level if the distributions were admissible at the significance level then the anderson darling a d test was employed to assess the adequacy of each probability distribution and determined the best fitted distribution sherly et al 2016 the smaller statistic values of a d test imply a better fit for the variables moreover the parameters of marginal distributions were estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method before modeling the joint distribution the dependence among drought variables were estimated using pearson s r kendall s τ and spearman s ρ correlation coefficient lamneithem and parmendra 2018 3 4 selection of optimal copula function for modeling the dependence between random variables copula functions have been frequently utilized to describe the statistical features of variables in meteorology and hydrology fields azam et al 2018 reddy and ganguli 2013 zhang et al 2013 for more details on copulas one can refer to some published research joe 1997 nelson 2006 sklar 1959 zhang and singh 2019 for simplicity and representativeness huang et al 2015 the theoretical archimedean frank clayton gumbel and joe and elliptical normal and t copulas were used as the candidate copula functions the copula parameters were estimated using the inversion of kendall s itau genest and favre 2007 xu et al 2015b detailed information on these copulas is given in table 2 the root mean square error rmse akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterions bic were utilized to test the gof of these copulas the optimal copula function were selected to model the dependence structure among drought variables chen et al 2013 yusof et al 2013 zhang and singh 2007 zhang and singh 2019 3 5 copula based modeling of drought variables the d s and a variables were considered as random variables and their corresponding marginal cumulative distribution functions cdf were denoted as fd d fs s and fa a respectively assuming c represents the copula function the joint cdf jcdf of drought variables based on bivariate and trivariate copula functions can be expressed as follows 4 f d s p d d s s c f d d f s s 5 f d a p d d a a c f d d f a a 6 f s a p s s a a c f s s f a a 7 f d s a p d d s s a a c f d d f s s f a a 3 5 1 joint occurrence probability of drought events the bivariate and trivariate joint occurrence probabilities were estimated in two different cases 1 d and s d and a s and a d and s and a exceeded a particular value denoted as p dsa and 2 d or s d or a s or a d or s or a exceeded a particular value denoted as p dsa or and the calculation formulas are as follows 8 p ds and p d d s s 1 f d d f s s c f d d f s s 9 p ds or p d d s s 1 c f d d f s s 10 p dsa and d d s s a a 1 f d d f s s f a a c f d d f s s c f d d f a a c f s s f a a c f

constructed copula based distribution the conditional distribution function of d given s s defined as fd s d s can be expressed as a function of copula as 12 f d s s d p d d s s f d d c f d d f s s 1 f s s similarly the conditional distribution function of d given s s and a a simultaneously defined as fd s a s a d can be expressed as a function of copula as 13 f d s a s a d p d d s s a a f d d c f d d f s s c f d d f a a c f d d f s s f a a 1 f s s f a a c f s s f a a likewise the joint conditional distribution function of d and s given a a defined as fd s a a d s can be expressed as a function

salvadori et al 2011 since the joint return period shows an inverse relationship with the joint exceeding probability it is defined for two cases of drought risk corresponding to drought events with d d and s s d d and a a s s and a a d d and s s and a a and drought events with d d or s s d d or a a s s or a a d d or s s or a a the copula based return period procedure can be outlined as follows 15

4 1 identification and dynamic evolution of drought events using the three dimensional identification method a total of 326 drought events were identified based on sri 3 from 1961 to 2014 throughout the study basin which accounted for 50 of the total number of months moreover there were 112 drought events with duration 3 months the 10 most serious drought events ranked by their severity are summarized in table 3 the duration of these events was all 7 months while the affected area of most of the events almost exceeded 55 of the total study area and the smallest affected area also accounted for 45 of the total area for instance drought event no 77 which occurred from april 1970 to january 1971 was considered the most severe this event had a severity of 5 8078 104 month km2 and covered about 80 9 of the study area yang et al 2017 found that the drought intensity from june 1970 to august 1971 reached a maximum during the study period and it was basically consistent with our study the second severe drought no 107 lasted for 13 months which was a little longer than the no 77 drought event and its affected area was similar to the no 77 drought event also persistent drought events of varying properties frequently occurred in the study area such as the no 281 drought event with the longest duration of 17 months occurring between july 2000 and november 2001 previous studies have shown that severe drought occurred within this region during 2000 2001 and caused great damage to the social economy with direct economic losses of nearly 62 36 million yuan which was a rare occurrence in the past 70 years wen and wang 2007 this indicates that the results of drought identification using the three dimensional identification method are reasonable figs 2 and 3 show the spatiotemporal evolution of the most severe drought event no 77 fig 2a and b illustrate the temporal evolution of severity and spatial area extent during the event respectively it can be observed that the severity and affected area of this event showed the same tendency of change with an upward trend from april to september 1970 and a downward trend thereafter the affected area and severity culminated in august and september 1970 were with a value of 1 207 104 month km2 and 6 862 103 km2 respectively the cumulative value of the drought index throughout the lifetime of this event and the migration trajectory of drought centroid are shown in fig 3a and b and fig 3b is part of 3a sharing the same colorbar the red arrows represent the migration trajectory of drought while the length of the arrow indicates the drought migration velocity also the green triangles show the centroid of drought extent for each month and the triangle size represents the monthly value of drought intensity fig 3a explains that the relatively severe affected area of this event concentrated in the west of the area i e enclosed by the ellipse from fig 3b it was evident that this event originated in the middle part of the study area 98 46 101 25 e 37 59 39 20 n and extended towards the eastern part as a whole from april to october 1970 this drought event moved relatively slowly and displayed a hovering characteristic with a triangle it moved approximately 16 99 km towards the southeast from april to june 1970 and changed the direction towards the northeast with an average velocity of 9 99 km month from june to september 1970 the drought centroids in july august and september were relatively concentrated with higher drought intensity thereafter it extended towards the southwest from september to october 1970 with the intensity decreasing by 0 32 from october 1970 to january 1971 it moved along the heihe river towards the east with a higher velocity of 25 33 km month and finally diminished in january 1971 the origination and migration of drought have become more complex within the context of climate change moreover the significance of drought migration at a spatial scale has been emphasized by herrera estrada et al 2017 the regional or spatial characteristics of droughts can be considered as an important reference for water resources management therefore in this study the spatiotemporal evolution and migration trajectory of each drought event during different periods were examined which is helpful for drought assessment and provides an objective reference for drought prevention 4 2 analysis of the dependence of drought variables the scatter plots of each drought variable against each other were employed to examine the qualitative dependence between d s and a ayantobo et al 2018b as illustrated in fig 4 the pairwise dependence between drought variables can be clearly observed for each pair of variables most of the points concentrated in the lower left corner and an increasingly positive linear relationship existed from left to right with the coefficient of determination 0 4 pearson s r kendall s τ and spearman s ρ correlation coefficients were thereafter estimated to measure the strength of dependence between drought variables results of correlation coefficients table 4 revealed that positive and significant relationships p 0 01 existed between drought variables the r τ and ρ values between d and s as well as s and a were greater than those between d and a moreover the r τ and ρ values between s and a were the highest among the three pairs of variables the dependence analysis indicated that the mutual dependence between drought variables was large therefore it was appropriate for modeling the joint distribution based on copula functions 4 3 estimation of marginal distributions since droughts with long duration are more disastrous and cause more serious impact on water resources security and the drought events with short duration can affect the estimation of the upper tail therefore only drought events lasting 3 months or longer totally 112 drought events were selected for frequency analysis xu et al 2015b based on the significant correlation between different drought variables the distribution functions with the best gof were selected as the marginal distribution types of drought characteristic variables in general distribution functions with three or more parameters yield less biased estimates of quantiles in the tails of the distributions mortuza et al 2018 therefore the seven three parameter distributions table 1 being considered as candidate distributions for fitting drought variables were reasonable the results of gof and the estimated parameters of the selected marginal distributions are listed in table 5 at the p 0 05 level of significance among distributions passed the k s test the distribution with the minimum a d statistic was selected as the optimal distribution for a given drought variable according to table 5 the optimal distribution of d s and a were lognormal log logistic and log logistic respectively with their statistic values marked in bold the parameters of the optimal distribution were estimated using the maximum likelihood method and were expressed in table 5 from the optimal distribution and estimated parameters theoretical probabilities of d s and a were obtained which were compared with empirical probabilities as shown in fig 5 as observed in fig 5 these points aligned along the 1 1 straight line in all cases which showed a good correspondence between the best fitted theoretical and empirical cumulative distributions for drought variables 4 4 selection of optimal copula functions the gumbel clayton frank joe normal and t copula functions were chosen as candidate copulas while the rmse aic and bic criteria were used to evaluate their gof the copula parameters were estimated using the itau method table 6 shows the results of gof and the parameters of the optimal copula the lower the rmse aic and bic values the better the gof of copula functioni it was observed that the gumbel copula generated the minimum error with the lowest rmse aic and bic values which indicated that it was the best selection to model the pair dependence of d s similarly for the pairwise dependence of d a s a and d s a the gumbel copula with the lowest values of the gof test performed much better than did the other copula functions and was selected to construct the joint distribution consequently the bivariate and trivariate gumbel copulas were selected to model the drought variables for frequency analysis fig 6 compares the best fitted copula and the empirical copula for pairwise dependence this relationship was close to the diagonal line and exhibited a good agreement between the theoretical and empirical probabilities which confirmed that the gumbel copula function was appropriate for modeling the dependence among drought variables 4 5 copula based multivariate dependence modeling 4 5 1 joint occurrence probabilities of drought episodes two types of joint occurrence probabilities of pairwise d s and a were considered in this study 1 the probability that either d s or a is greater than or equal to a certain value i e p d 5 s 2 p d 5 s 2 a 3 and 2 the probability that d s and a are greater than or equal to a certain value i e p d 5 s 2 p d 5 s 2 a 3 fig 7 illustrates the bivariate and trivariate joint occurrence probability of drought episodes it was seen that the or case had a larger extent of high probability level than the and case the values of joint probability in the or case were greater than those in the and case under the situation of the same combination of drought variables for all the and cases the pattern of joint exceedance probability presented an upward trend with the decrease of the values of drought variables i e the probability tended to be higher for lower combinations for example when d and s exceeded 5 15 and 0 79 respectively p ds and was 0 19 while d and s exceeded 3 83 and 0 33 respectively p ds and equalled 0 44 for the pairwise dependence of d s and a the probability values were uncertain for a less than 1 because few drought events occurred within this range nonetheless the joint probability could still quantitatively capture the drought occurrence probability in the context of variation of drought variables more significantly the drought risk may be overrated or underrated if only the or or and case drought occurrence probability was considered hence the or and and cases need to be comprehensively analyzed to accurately assess the drought occurrence probability the joint occurrence probability of drought variables could also provide some important information for drought management for example the drought occurrence probability of d and s exceeding certain thresholds has been used as a critical condition for recognizing a specific water supply system and to trigger a drought contingency plan shiau 2006 4 5 2 conditional probability of drought episodes the conditional probabilities of drought episodes can be derived from the copula based bivariate and trivariate joint probabilities the estimated conditional probabilities of d s and a denoted as ps d d pd s s pa d d pd a a ps a a pa s s pds a a and pd s s and a a are delineated in figs 8 9 10 for the bivariate conditional probability it was evident from fig 8 a that the conditional probability of s with a given d decreases as the d values increase and the values of ps d d and pd s s under various conditions can be identified handily for example the conditional probabilities of s less than 2 and 4 with a given d exceeding 3 months corresponded to 0 9 and 0 96 respectively this implied that there was 90 possibility of occurrence of a drought with s less than 2 when d exceeded 3 months likewise the conditional probabilities of d less than 10 months for a certain s that exceeded 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 corresponded to 0 80 0 62 0 36 0 22 0 15 and 0 11 respectively while the conditional probabilities of d less than 19 months with a given s that exceeded 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 corresponded to 0 96 0 92 0 83 0 74 0 65 and 0 57 respectively meanwhile it was observed that the probability curves in all cases expressed obvious characteristics of denseness at both ends and sparseness in the middle which manifested evident differences between the various rates of conditional probabilities of d s or a these results illustrated that the increase of the conditional factor s would reduce the probability of drought occurrence with lesser d in other words the increase of the conditional factor s had no significant effect on reducing the probability of drought occurrence for a longer d similarly the conditional probabilities of other bivariate pair dependences could be obtained and they were consistent with the conclusions reported by yusof et al 2013 these results will enable water managers to judge whether a specific water supply system could satisfy the normal water requirement under a given drought condition the outcome could also be useful in determining the needed auxiliary water resources for the trivariate pair dependence two types of conditional probabilities were examined and illustrated in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows the conditional probability of d with a given s exceeding various thresholds and a exceeding 2 fig 9a and 4 fig 9b from the figures the conditional probability of d less than 12 months with a given s exceeding 3 and a exceeding 2 was 0 31 while the conditional probability of d less than 12 months with a given s exceeding 4 and a exceeding 2 was 0 20 and the conditional probability of d below 12 months with a given s exceeding 3 and a exceeding 4 was 0 22 this implied that the conditional probability of d with a given s and a decreased with the conditional factors increasing fig 10 depicts the conditional joint probability of d and s with a given a exceeding 2 fig 10a and 10b and 4 fig 10c and 10d according to fig 10 for a given a exceeding 2 the conditional joint probability of drought event with d and s less than 10 and 3 respectively was 0 69 indicating a 69 chance of drought occurrence under that given condition moreover when a increased to 4 the conditional joint probability decreased to 0 29 similar observations about the conditional probability of drought variables under these conditions had also been reported by hui mean et al 2019 4 5 3 comparison of multivariate return periods of drought episodes an inverse relationship existed between the return period and the probability of drought table 7 compares univariate and multivariate return periods of drought variables for the study region for instance with a 10 year univariate return period the values of d s and a were computed as 12 18 3 12 and 5 59 respectively the bivariate joint response of drought variables resulted in return periods of 7 45 6 63 and 8 30 years for t ds or d 12 18 or s 3 12 t da or d 12 18 or a 6 63 and t sa or s 3 12 or a 6 63 respectively and also resulted in 15 18 20 25 and 12 53 years for t ds and d 12 18 and s 3 12 t da and d 12 18 and a 6 63 and t sa and s 3 12 and a 6 63 respectively in the trivariate case the return periods of t dsa or d 12 18 or s 3 12 or a 6 63 and t dsa and d 12 18 and s 3 12 and a 6 63 were evaluated as 6 56 and 21 16 years respectively in comparison with the univariate return period of 10 years the decrease in return period for t ds or t da or t sa or and t dsa or was calculated as 25 5 33 7 17 and 34 4 while the percentage increase in return periods for t ds and t da and t sa and and t dsa and was found to be 34 1 50 6 20 2 and 52 7 respectively in line with previous studies the univariate frequency analysis did not offer sufficient cognition about drought risk compared with multivariate drought frequency analysis lamneithem and parmendra 2018 ayantobo et al 2018b with the enhancement of drought variable values the corresponding bivariate and trivariate drought return periods increased gradually in all cases the return period calculated using univariate distributions was found greater than the multivariate joint return period obtained in the or case and less than the multivariate joint return period computed in the and case additionally the trivariate return period in the and case was greater than the corresponding pairwise bivariate return period which showed that there was a lower probability of occurrence of a drought with d s and a simultaneously exceeding the threshold it was also observed that the multivariate joint return periods in the and case were overestimated which means that the drought risks would be underestimated if only the and case return periods were considered on the contrary the multivariate joint return periods in the or case were underestimated which means that the drought risks would be overestimated if simply the or case return periods were considered and the risk of failure of drought control measures and drought mitigation techniques might increase to some extent lee et al 2013 ayantobo et al 2018b 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in this study we encountered several uncertainties during drought identification and frequency analysis first the minimum area threshold as the only parameter controlling the aggregation degree of data should be determined in advance the smaller drought patches with the area below the predetermined threshold were filtered out and no longer included in further investigation the selection of this threshold played an important role in determining the drought events and the drought identification results based on various area thresholds were quite different therefore a series of minimum area thresholds were selected within the three dimensional identification method to test their effect on drought identification in the study area as observed from our study if the threshold was set as 30 km2 approximately accounting for 0 33 of the study area 1475 drought events would be detected and 72 4 of these events 1068 drought events were minor events with a duration of 1 month and affected area less than 0 5 of the study area such a sample of drought events can scarcely interpret extreme drought conditions sheffield et al 2009 liu et al 2019 moreover the clustering method with a smaller area threshold can also lead to drought lasting for a long time through tenuous spatial connectivity for example a drought event with long duration of 200 months was recognized under the current assumptions sheffield et al 2009 used a threshold of 500 000 km2 in their drought study for global scale and obtained conclusions similar to our study additionally with the minimum area threshold increasing the number of drought events showed a continuous downward trend and the ration of minor events reduced simultaneously but it arrived at a relatively stable level when the area threshold was equal to 160 km2 approximately 1 6 of the study area therefore we chose 160 km2 as the area threshold for drought event identification in related studies wang et al 2011 investigated the effect of area threshold on drought identification and discovered that a threshold of 150 000 km2 was appropriate for their drought study in china xu et al 2015a and liu et al 2019 also suggested that approximately 1 6 of the study area should be selected as the minimum area threshold these findings are highly consistent with our results second all drought events recognized using the three dimensional identification method were generally contained and the severe drought events with long duration high severity and large affected area were paid more attention in drought frequency analysis chen et al 2013 yusof et al 2013 therefore it was important to investigate the upper tails of the univariate drought distributions however there were uncertainties in the upper tail estimation because of the existence of a lot of drought variables with small values this would lead to incorrect occurrence probabilities or return periods of extreme drought events commonly two methods are utilized to reduce this uncertainty one is the lower bound censored sampling method in which only the samples beyond a specified threshold value are selected the feasibility and robustness of this method have been demonstrated in previous studies moisello 2007 xu et al 2015b in the second method samples with large values are apportioned more weights in estimating the parameters of the probability distribution which makes the distribution more dependent on these samples song et al 2012 xu et al 2015b employed the first method in their drought study and determined a specified threshold value of 3 in other words drought events that lasted 3 months were selected for analysis the residual samples after removing the drought events lasting 3 months were enough for the accurate estimation of distribution parameters e g 30 samples therefore we selected drought events with 3 months or longer for frequency analysis to avoid the influence of drought events with short duration on the estimation of the upper tail finally six candidate copula functions were selected in the current study however there are many methods for the determination of optimal copula function including rmse aic bic nash sutcliffe efficiency criteria etc different copulas may be selected by using different estimation methods which will result in different joint probabilities hence this study selected three methods including rmse aic and bic to determine the optimal copula functionto ensure the accuracy of results fan et al 2018 5 2 advantages and limitations traditional drought frequency analysis considering univariate drought variables does not provide enough information on drought assessment and warning in this study the basin is the main runoff yield area and is frequently affected by drought events therefore it is imperative to investigate the changing properties of drought with various combinations of estimated variables from a multivariate perspective the joint and conditional probabilities as well as return periods are beneficial for the assessment of water supply capability and are important references for needed auxiliary water resources during extreme droughts apart from this the return period can also be considered as a criterion in water resources system planning and management for a new water conservancy project some limitations still exist currently three drought variables duration severity and affected area were employed to model the bivariate and trivariate dependence since drought is a multivariate phenomenon the low dimensional frequency analysis may lead to a deficient drought risk estimation hence the application of high dimensional copulas will become a key research direction in the future furthermore the hydrological factor is regarded as a stationary series in this study but the stationarity is decreasing under climate change therefore the non stationarity of hydrological series in drought risk assessment should be considered in future research 6 conclusions in this study hydrological drought was characterized by the sri calculated using the gridded runoff datafrom 1961 to 2014 drought events and variables were identified and extracted based on a three dimensional identification method and the spatiotemporal evolution of drought was investigated seven three parameter distributions were selected to fit the drought variables and the optimal distribution was determined based on the k s and a d tests the rmse aic and bic methods were employed to choose the optimal copula from six copula functions for each pairwise dependence then the drought risk was estimated based on bivariate and trivariate joint probability conditional probabilities and return period the main conclusions can be summaried as follows 1 the continuous spatiotemporal structure and dynamic evolution of drought are described effectively from a three dimensional perspective the spatiotemporal dynamic migration of typical drought events is reproduced based on six drought variables and the identification results are consistent with the actual drought records this shed a new light for the quantitative study of drought evolution 2 the mutual dependence between drought variables is relatively large and the optimal distributions for d s and a are lognormal log logistic and log logistic respectively the bivariate and trivariate gumbel copula are appropriate for the pairwise dependence of drought variables 3 the joint occurrence probabilities in the or case were greater than that in the and case under the same combination of drought variables for all the and cases the probability tends to be higher for lower value combinations the conditional probability of drought variables with a given conditional factors decreases as the values of factor increase the increasing conditional factors could obviously reduce the probability of drought occurrences for a lesser drought variable 4 the return periods calculated using univariate distributions were found to be greater than the multivariate joint return period obtained in the or case and less than the multivariate joint return period computed in the and case drought risks will be underestimated if simply the and case return periods were considered and the drought risks will be overestimated if only the or case return periods were considered in summary the drought dynamic variation from a three dimensional perspective can provide effective support for drought mitigation and warning and drought risk analysis based on multivariate modeling is valuable for water

4428,drought events show a continuous spatiotemporal structure the evolution of drought and its probabilistic modeling from a three dimensional perspective are important for drought mitigation and risk management this study therefore aimed to extract hydrological drought variables using a three dimensional identification method in the upstream of heihe river basin uhhrb in northwest china during 1961 2014 then the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution of hydrological drought event was quantified and drought frequency was evaluated using copula functions results showed that the spatiotemporal structure of drought can be satisfactorily reflected using the three dimensional framework the most severe drought originated in the middle part of the basin and propagated towards the eastern part with variable migration velocity the gumbel copula was the most suitable model for determining the joint distribution of drought duration severity and area the conditional probability of drought variables with a given conditional factors decreases as the values of factor increase and the increasing trend had no significant effect on reducing the probability of drought occurrence for a relatively higher value of drought variable drought risks would be underestimated or overestimated if simply the and or or case return periods were considered drought frequency analysis considering the spatiotemporal drought features can be regarded as a reliable method this study could help to better understand the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution of drought and to facilitate water resources allocation and drought mitigation keywords hydrological drought dynamic evolution copula drought frequency analysis heihe river basin 1 introduction drought is an extreme climatic phenomenon resulting from water deficiency when precipitation falls below average for a prolonged period muli wambua 2018 zeleke et al 2017 drought occurs in almost all climate zones whether dry or wet dai 2011 lamneithem and parmendra 2018 zhang et al 2021 drought with long duration could lead to water shortage ecological damage and undermining human activities and socio economic development feng et al 2020 reddy and ganguli 2013 wmo 2006 the occurrence and spatiotemporal evolution of drought is important for developing measures for drought mitigation and management several studies have considered the spatiotemporal nature of drought to understand drought characteristics at the regional scale livada and assimakopoulos 2007 reddy and ganguli 2013 sheffield et al 2009 moreover several statistical methods such as wavelet analysis min et al 2003 principal component analysis pca cluster analysis chen and yang 2013 gocic and trajkovic 2014 and entropy theory she and xia 2012 have been used in the assessment of spatial pattern of drought these methods reduce drought events to a lower order subspace which discards some vital spatiotemporal information thereby limiting the real modeling of the spatiotemporal drought structures lloyd hughes 2012 xu et al 2015a although several studies have investigated the spatial and temporal characteristics of drought deng et al 2018 li et al 2019 liu et al 2016 drought evolution has been generally analyzed in time and space separately either the time evolution of drought over a fixed area or the drought spatial patterns at a certain time moreover the areal average values or the areal extents in terms of percentage of total area are always considered as the spatial feature rather than the drought affected area which is one of the most important drought variables in the spatiotemporal analysis these analyses are often inadequate to describe the continuous spatiotemporal structure of drought moreover the evolution and frequency analysis of hydrological drought based on a three dimensional identification method has rarely been carried out stochastic characteristics of drought have been studied by employing probabilistic and stochastic methods ayantobo et al 2018c cancelliere and salas 2004 shiau 2006 and drought frequency analysis has been regularly utilized to describe their probabilistic nature many studies have focused on univariate or bivariate frequency analyses which cannot provide a multivariate assessment of droughts and explain the significant correlations among their variables serinaldi et al 2009 ayantobo et al 2018c liu et al 2015 therefore it is essential to examine drought frequencies from a multivariate perspective drought identification and characterization are imperative for the evolution and frequency analysis of drought xu et al 2015b intrinsically drought is a three dimensional continuum at space time scales and consideration of the space time drought structure is essential to understand the development of drought currently the common drought identification methods simplify the three dimensional drought structure to one dimension time or two dimensions longitude and latitude meaning drought features are separately identified in space and time a drought identification method called truncation method or run theory was proposed by yevjevich 1967 which can only extract temporal drought features from drought index time series on a one dimensional scale therefore several studies have developed the drought identification method in space time dimensions andreadis et al 2005 used a simple clustering algorithm that incorporated spatial contiguity to describe a spatial drought identification procedure lloyd hughes 2012 extended this clustering algorithm to an explicit three dimensional longitude latitude time structure based method which fulfilled the complete spatiotemporal representation of the drought event xu et al 2015a developed a three dimensional identification method to identify drought events and validate the rationality of identified drought events using remotely sensed soil moisture data due to the complexity of these methods the three dimensional drought identification method has not been widely used in drought evaluation copula functions have been extensively used to construct multivariate joint probability distributions of drought salvadori and de michele 2015 tosunoglu and can 2016 zhang and singh 2019 and multivariate drought frequency analysis has increased considerably in the last decades for example in the bivariate context shiau and modarres 2009 derived drought severity and duration frequency curves by using a copula function in iran mirakbari et al 2010 investigated regional meteorological drought frequency through bivariate copula functions lee et al 2013 applied frank and gumbel copula functions for bivariate drought frequency analysis in the trivariate context song and singh 2010 used a trivariate plackett copula to model the joint probability distribution of drought duration severity and inter arrival time ma et al 2013 utilized trivariate gaussian and student t copulas to model the joint distribution of drought duration severity and peak other studies also employed copula functions to study drought frequency analysis huang et al 2014a huang et al 2014b zhang et al 2017 zhang et al 2015 in these studies the temporal nature of drought e g duration interval time and severity was often considered in drought frequency analysis however the spatial features as one important aspect to characterize the spatiotemporal structures of drought e g drought affected area were usually ignored this study aims at revealing the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution and risk of drought events in the upstream of heihe river basin uhhrb in northwest china firstly drought variables will be extracted using the three dimensional clustering methods then the spatiotemporal dynamic evolution of drought will be analyzed based on the identification results moreover the copula based multivariate modeling of drought variables is built to evaluate the occurrence probability and return period of drought events the objectives therefore are to 1 identify drought events from a three dimensional perspective 2 investigate the evolution of drought characteristics including duration severity and affected area 3 evaluate the multivariate drought probability and return periods using the copula based model the findings from this study will contribute to improving understanding of hydrological drought and could help water resources management of hhrb 2 study area and data the heihe river basin hhrb is the second largest inland river basin in northwest china the upper reach of hhrb 98 46 101 25 e 37 59 39 20 n with a drainage area of about 10 005 km2 is located above yingluoxia station fig 1 the upper reach of hhrb accounts for about 20 of the total basin area and contributes about 70 of the total runoff to the middle and lower reaches which supports the demands of agriculture ecology and socio economic development chen et al 2005 qin et al 2016 yang et al 2015 the study area has relatively abundant vegetation types with an elevation of about 1900 5000 m deng et al 2013 gao et al 2015 herzschuh et al 2006 the annual precipitation ranges from 200 mm to 700 mm and increases with elevation and the annual average temperature is approximately 2 c the annual average runoff is approximately 1 6 109 m3 and the intra annual variability of runoff is comparatively weak jin et al 2015 zhao and zhang 2005 in this study the standardized runoff index sri calculated using gridded runoff data will be utilized to describe drought events and their features shukla and wood 2008 liu et al 2019 the gridded runoff data were derived from the geomorphology based eco hydrological model gbehm gao et al 2015 yang et al 2015 which was available through the cold and arid regions science data center http westdc westgis ac cn the temporal and spatial resolution of the gridded runoff data are at monthly scale and 1 km respectively and the data length covers periods from 1961 to 2014 the gbehm has been validated using available observations and provided a satisfactory simulation of runoff in the study basin with nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient ranging from 0 67 to 0 80 and absolute values

hydrological drought conditions based on the method of mckee et al 1993 for the standardized precipitation index spi the sri was also computed at multiple temporal scales the main difference is that the runoff series used as input for sri is fitted with a lognormal distribution duan and mei 2014 the classification standard for the sri is the same as that for spi and the value of 0 5 was selected as a threshold value indicating that sri values below 0 5 were regarded as drought occurrence wu et al 2015 the gbehm simulated runoff data were used to calculate the sri the 3 month time scale sri sri 3 was selected in the following analysis since the sri 1 is sensitive to the variation of influencing factors and owing to the reactivity of the sri 12 that slows down 3 2 identification of

raster during 1961 2014 and drought variables were identified based on the three dimensional identification method proposed by andreadis et al 2005 the main steps include spatial identification and temporal connection in a three dimensional array and the applicability of this method has been validated liu et al 2019 xu et al 2015a the specific implementation steps are as follows 1 identify drought patches across the study area for each monthly time step 54 years 12 months the grids with sri values less than 0 5 were regarded as drought events and were further classified into different drought patches using the spatial clustering algorithm in this algorithm the adjacent drought grids were combined into one patch and if no drought grids existed in the adjacent positions of the current drought grids a new patch was created for the next drought grid the procedure was repeated for 54 12 months and drought patches were marked with different symbols 2 determine the temporal connection of drought patches in two adjacent months assuming two adjacent months namely the ith and i 1th if the overlap area of any couple of patches between the two adjacent months was beyond a minimum area threshold then the corresponding two patches belonged to the same drought event 3 extract the three dimensional drought events during the study period this procedure was implemented sequentially from the second month to the last month following the second step above a series of drought patches in continuous time were obtained and marked with different symbols a set of voxels with the same symbol represents one drought event based on the identification results of drought events six spatiotemporal drought variables were defined and calculated as follows drought duration d is the persistent time of a drought event i e the temporal span from the initiation time to the termination time of the event drought affected area a is the cumulative area affected by a drought event during the entire period it is the projected area of a three dimensional drought event over the longitude latitude surface drought severity s is the total amount of water deficit during a drought episode in the three dimensional space it is a cumulative value of the water deficit for a spatiotemporally continuous voxel in other words it is calculated over the whole drought duration and areal extent drought intensity i is calculated using drought severity divided by drought duration and drought area the center of a drought event c is the spatiotemporal location longitude latitude time of the event which can track the migration trajectory of the drought migration distance of drought md is the distance of the drought centroid between two adjacent months this requires converting the longitude and latitude of the monthly drought centroid to distance as follows fang et al 2019 1 δ x 110 94 cos y m π 180 x m 1 x m 2 δ y 110 94 y m 1 y m 3 l δ x 2 δ y 2 where δx andδy are respectively the migration distances of the drought centroid along the longitude and latitude directions from the m th month to the m 1 th month km l is the migration distance of the drought centroid between two adjacent months km xm and ym refer to the longitude and latitude coordinates of the drought centroid at the m th month xm 1 and ym 1 refer to the longitude and latitude coordinates of the drought centroid at the m 1 th month respectively 3 3 marginal distribution marginal distributions are needed for computing multivariate distributions of drought variables it is known that if there are errors in fitting marginal distributions then errors of the joint distribution calculation will increase huang et al 2014b thus it is necessary to accurately fit marginal distributions to drought variables seven three parameter distributions ayantobo et al 2018a ayantobo et al 2021 ma et al 2013 xiao et al 2019 were compared to select the best distributions for fitting d s and a detailed information on these distributions is given in table 1 the kolmogorov smirnov k s goodness of fit gof test was used to show whether these distributions passed the test at p 0 05 significance level if the distributions were admissible at the significance level then the anderson darling a d test was employed to assess the adequacy of each probability distribution and determined the best fitted distribution sherly et al 2016 the smaller statistic values of a d test imply a better fit for the variables moreover the parameters of marginal distributions were estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method before modeling the joint distribution the dependence among drought variables were estimated using pearson s r kendall s τ and spearman s ρ correlation coefficient lamneithem and parmendra 2018 3 4 selection of optimal copula function for modeling the dependence between random variables copula functions have been frequently utilized to describe the statistical features of variables in meteorology and hydrology fields azam et al 2018 reddy and ganguli 2013 zhang et al 2013 for more details on copulas one can refer to some published research joe 1997 nelson 2006 sklar 1959 zhang and singh 2019 for simplicity and representativeness huang et al 2015 the theoretical archimedean frank clayton gumbel and joe and elliptical normal and t copulas were used as the candidate copula functions the copula parameters were estimated using the inversion of kendall s itau genest and favre 2007 xu et al 2015b detailed information on these copulas is given in table 2 the root mean square error rmse akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterions bic were utilized to test the gof of these copulas the optimal copula function were selected to model the dependence structure among drought variables chen et al 2013 yusof et al 2013 zhang and singh 2007 zhang and singh 2019 3 5 copula based modeling of drought variables the d s and a variables were considered as random variables and their corresponding marginal cumulative distribution functions cdf were denoted as fd d fs s and fa a respectively assuming c represents the copula function the joint cdf jcdf of drought variables based on bivariate and trivariate copula functions can be expressed as follows 4 f d s p d d s s c f d d f s s 5 f d a p d d a a c f d d f a a 6 f s a p s s a a c f s s f a a 7 f d s a p d d s s a a c f d d f s s f a a 3 5 1 joint occurrence probability of drought events the bivariate and trivariate joint occurrence probabilities were estimated in two different cases 1 d and s d and a s and a d and s and a exceeded a particular value denoted as p dsa and 2 d or s d or a s or a d or s or a exceeded a particular value denoted as p dsa or and the calculation formulas are as follows 8 p ds and p d d s s 1 f d d f s s c f d d f s s 9 p ds or p d d s s 1 c f d d f s s 10 p dsa and d d s s a a 1 f d d f s s f a a c f d d f s s c f d d f a a c f s s f a a c f d d f s s f a a 11 p dsa or d d s s a a 1 c f d d f s s f a a 3 5 2 conditional probability of drought events the conditional drought probabilities of drought variables were obtained using the constructed copula based distribution the conditional distribution function of d given s s defined as fd s d s can be expressed as a function of copula as 12 f d s s d p d d s s f d d c f d d f s s 1 f s s similarly the conditional distribution function of d given s s and a a simultaneously defined as fd s a s a d can be expressed as a function of copula as 13 f d s a s a d p d d s s a a f d d c f d d f s s c f d d f a a c f d d f s s f a a 1 f s s f a a c f s s f a a likewise the joint conditional distribution function of d and s given a a defined as fd s a a d s can be expressed as a function of copula as 14 f d s a a d s p d d s s a a c f d d f s s c f d d f s s f a a 1 f a a 3 5 3 drought return period return period is the average time elapsing between two successive drought events salvadori et al 2011 since the joint return period shows an inverse relationship with the joint exceeding probability it is defined for two cases of drought risk corresponding to drought events with d d and s s d d and a a s s and a a d d and s s and a a and drought events with d d or s s d d or a a s s or a a d d or s s or a a the copula based return period procedure can be outlined as follows 15 t ds and μ p d d s s μ 1 f d d f s s c f d d f s s 16 t dsa and μ p d d s s a a μ 1 f d d f s s f a a c f d d f s s c f d d f a a c f s s f a a c f d d f s s f a a 17 t ds or μ p d d s s μ 1 c f d d f

4 1 identification and dynamic evolution of drought events using the three dimensional identification method a total of 326 drought events were identified based on sri 3 from 1961 to 2014 throughout the study basin which accounted for 50 of the total number of months moreover there were 112 drought events with duration 3 months the 10 most serious drought events ranked by their severity are summarized in table 3 the duration of these events was all 7 months while the affected area of most of the events almost exceeded 55 of the total study area and the smallest affected area also accounted for 45 of the total area for instance drought event no 77 which occurred from april 1970 to january 1971 was considered the most severe this event had a severity of 5 8078 104 month km2 and covered about 80 9 of the study area yang et al 2017 found that the drought intensity from june 1970 to august 1971 reached a maximum during the study period and it was basically consistent with our study the second severe drought no 107 lasted for 13 months which was a little longer than the no 77 drought event and its affected area was similar to the no 77 drought event also persistent drought events of varying properties frequently occurred in the study area such as the no 281 drought event with the longest duration of 17 months occurring between july 2000 and november 2001 previous studies have shown that severe drought occurred within this region during 2000 2001 and caused great damage to the social economy with direct economic losses of nearly 62 36 million yuan which was a rare occurrence in the past 70 years wen and wang 2007 this indicates that the results of drought identification using the three dimensional identification method are reasonable figs 2 and 3 show the spatiotemporal evolution of the most severe drought event no 77 fig 2a and b illustrate the temporal evolution of severity and spatial area extent during the event respectively it can be observed that the severity and affected area of this event showed the same tendency of change with an upward trend from april to september 1970 and a downward trend thereafter the affected area and severity culminated in august and september 1970 were with a value of 1 207 104 month km2 and 6 862 103 km2 respectively the cumulative value of the drought index throughout the lifetime of this event and the migration trajectory of drought centroid are shown in fig 3a and b and fig 3b is part of 3a sharing the same colorbar the red arrows represent the migration trajectory of drought while the length of the arrow indicates the drought migration velocity also the green triangles show the centroid of drought extent for each month and the triangle size represents the monthly value of drought intensity fig 3a explains that the relatively severe affected area of this event concentrated in the west of the area i e enclosed by the ellipse from fig 3b it was evident that this event originated in the middle part of the study area 98 46 101 25 e 37 59 39 20 n and extended towards the eastern part as a whole from april to october 1970 this drought event moved relatively slowly and displayed a hovering characteristic with a triangle it moved approximately 16 99 km towards the southeast from april to june 1970 and changed the direction towards the northeast with an average velocity of 9 99 km month from june to september 1970 the drought centroids in july august and september were relatively concentrated with higher drought intensity thereafter it extended towards the southwest from september to october 1970 with the intensity decreasing by 0 32 from october 1970 to january 1971 it moved along the heihe river towards the east with a higher velocity of 25 33 km month and finally diminished in january 1971 the origination and migration of drought have become more complex within the context of climate change moreover the significance of drought migration at a spatial scale has been emphasized by herrera estrada et al 2017 the regional or spatial characteristics of droughts can be considered as an important reference for water resources management therefore in this study the spatiotemporal evolution and migration trajectory of each drought event during different periods were examined which is helpful for drought assessment and provides an objective reference for drought prevention 4 2 analysis of the dependence of drought variables the scatter plots of each drought variable against each other were employed to examine the qualitative dependence between d s and a ayantobo et al 2018b as illustrated in fig 4 the pairwise dependence between drought variables can be clearly observed for each pair of variables most of the points concentrated in the lower left corner and an increasingly positive linear relationship existed from left to right with the coefficient of determination 0 4 pearson s r kendall s τ and spearman s ρ correlation coefficients were thereafter estimated to measure the strength of dependence between drought variables results of correlation coefficients table 4 revealed that positive and significant relationships p 0 01 existed between drought variables the r τ and ρ values between d and s as well as s and a were greater than those between d and a moreover the r τ and ρ values between s and a were the highest among the three pairs of variables the dependence analysis indicated that the mutual dependence between drought variables was large therefore it was appropriate for modeling the joint distribution based on copula functions 4 3 estimation of marginal distributions since droughts with long duration are more disastrous and cause more serious impact on water resources security and the drought events with short duration can affect the estimation of the upper tail therefore only drought events lasting 3 months or longer totally 112 drought events were selected for frequency analysis xu et al 2015b based on the significant correlation between different drought variables the distribution functions with the best gof were selected as the marginal distribution types of drought characteristic variables in general distribution functions with three or more parameters yield less biased estimates of quantiles in the tails of the distributions mortuza et al 2018 therefore the seven three parameter distributions table 1 being considered as candidate distributions for fitting drought variables were reasonable the results of gof and the estimated parameters of the selected marginal distributions are listed in table 5 at the p 0 05 level of significance among distributions passed the k s test the distribution with the minimum a d statistic was selected as the optimal distribution for a given drought variable according to table 5 the optimal distribution of d s and a were lognormal log logistic and log logistic respectively with their statistic values marked in bold the parameters of the optimal distribution were estimated using the maximum likelihood method and were expressed in table 5 from the optimal distribution and estimated parameters theoretical probabilities of d s and a were obtained which were compared with empirical probabilities as shown in fig 5 as observed in fig 5 these points aligned along the 1 1 straight line in all cases which showed a good correspondence between the best fitted theoretical and empirical cumulative distributions for drought variables 4 4 selection of optimal copula functions the gumbel clayton frank joe normal and t copula functions were chosen as candidate copulas while the rmse aic and bic criteria were used to evaluate their gof the copula parameters were estimated using the itau method table 6 shows the results of gof and the parameters of the optimal copula the lower the rmse aic and bic values the better the gof of copula functioni it was observed that the gumbel copula generated the minimum error with the lowest rmse aic and bic values which indicated that it was the best selection to model the pair dependence of d s similarly for the pairwise dependence of d a s a and d s a the gumbel copula with the lowest values of the gof test performed much better than did the other copula functions and was selected to construct the joint distribution consequently the bivariate and trivariate gumbel copulas were selected to model the drought variables for frequency analysis fig 6 compares the best fitted copula and the empirical copula for pairwise dependence this relationship was close to the diagonal line and exhibited a good agreement between the theoretical and empirical probabilities which confirmed that the gumbel copula function was appropriate for modeling the dependence among drought variables 4 5 copula based multivariate dependence modeling 4 5 1 joint occurrence probabilities of drought episodes two types of joint occurrence probabilities of pairwise d s and a were considered in this study 1 the probability that either d s or a is greater than or equal to a certain value i e p d 5 s 2 p d 5 s 2 a 3 and 2 the probability that d s and a are greater than or equal to a certain value i e p d 5 s 2 p d 5 s 2 a 3 fig 7 illustrates the bivariate and trivariate joint occurrence probability of drought episodes it was seen that the or case had a larger extent of high probability level than the and case the values of joint probability in the or case were greater than those in the and case under the situation of the same combination of drought variables for all the and cases the pattern of joint exceedance probability presented an upward trend with the decrease of the values of drought variables i e the probability tended to be higher for lower combinations for example when d and s exceeded 5 15 and 0 79 respectively p ds and was 0 19 while d and s exceeded 3 83 and 0 33 respectively p ds and equalled 0 44 for the pairwise dependence of d s and a the probability values were uncertain for a less than 1 because few drought events occurred within this range nonetheless the joint probability could still quantitatively capture the drought occurrence probability in the context of variation of drought variables more significantly the drought risk may be overrated or underrated if only the or or and case drought occurrence probability was considered hence the or and and cases need to be comprehensively analyzed to accurately assess the drought occurrence probability the joint occurrence probability of drought variables could also provide some important information for drought management for example the drought occurrence probability of d and s exceeding certain thresholds has been used as a critical condition for recognizing a specific water supply system and to trigger a drought contingency plan shiau 2006 4 5 2 conditional probability of drought episodes the conditional probabilities of drought episodes can be derived from the copula based bivariate and trivariate joint probabilities the estimated conditional probabilities of d s and a denoted as ps d d pd s s pa d d pd a a ps a a pa s s pds a a and pd s s and a a are delineated in figs 8 9 10 for the bivariate conditional probability it was evident from fig 8 a that the conditional probability of s with a given d decreases as the d values increase and the values of ps d d and pd s s under various conditions can be identified handily for example the conditional probabilities of s less than 2 and 4 with a given d exceeding 3 months corresponded to 0 9 and 0 96 respectively this implied that there was 90 possibility of occurrence of a drought with s less than 2 when d exceeded 3 months likewise the conditional probabilities of d less than 10 months for a certain s that exceeded 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 corresponded to 0 80 0 62 0 36 0 22 0 15 and 0 11 respectively while the conditional probabilities of d less than 19 months with a given s that exceeded 0 5 1 2 3 4 and 5 corresponded to 0 96 0 92 0 83 0 74 0 65 and 0 57 respectively meanwhile it was observed that the probability curves in all cases expressed obvious characteristics of denseness at both ends and sparseness in the middle which manifested evident differences between the various rates of conditional probabilities of d s or a these results illustrated that the increase of the conditional factor s would reduce the probability of drought occurrence with lesser d in other words the increase of the conditional factor s had no significant effect on reducing the probability of drought occurrence for a longer d similarly the conditional probabilities of other bivariate pair dependences could be obtained and they were consistent with the conclusions reported by yusof et al 2013 these results will enable water managers to judge whether a specific water supply system could satisfy the normal water requirement under a given drought condition the outcome could also be useful in determining the needed auxiliary water resources for the trivariate pair dependence two types of conditional probabilities were examined and illustrated in figs 9 and 10 fig 9 shows the conditional probability of d with a given s exceeding various thresholds and a exceeding 2 fig 9a and 4 fig 9b from the figures the conditional probability of d less than 12 months with a given s exceeding 3 and a exceeding 2 was 0 31 while the conditional probability of d less than 12 months with a given s exceeding 4 and a exceeding 2 was 0 20 and the conditional probability of d below 12 months with a given s exceeding 3 and a exceeding 4 was 0 22 this implied that the conditional probability of d with a given s and a decreased with the conditional factors increasing fig 10 depicts the conditional joint probability of d and s with a given a exceeding 2 fig 10a and 10b and 4 fig 10c and 10d according to fig 10 for a given a exceeding 2 the conditional joint probability of drought event with d and s less than 10 and 3 respectively was 0 69 indicating a 69 chance of drought occurrence under that given condition moreover when a increased to 4 the conditional joint probability decreased to 0 29 similar observations about the conditional probability of drought variables under these conditions had also been reported by hui mean et al 2019 4 5 3 comparison of multivariate return periods of drought episodes an inverse relationship existed between the return period and the probability of drought table 7 compares univariate and multivariate return periods of drought variables for the study region for instance with a 10 year univariate return period the values of d s and a were computed as 12 18 3 12 and 5 59 respectively the bivariate joint response of drought variables resulted in return periods of 7 45 6 63 and 8 30 years for t ds or d 12 18 or s 3 12 t da or d 12 18 or a 6 63 and t sa or s 3 12 or a 6 63 respectively and also resulted in 15 18 20 25 and 12 53 years for t ds and d 12 18 and s 3 12 t da and d 12 18 and a 6 63 and t sa and s 3 12 and a 6 63 respectively in the trivariate case the return periods of t dsa or d 12 18 or s 3 12 or a 6 63 and t dsa and d 12 18 and s 3 12 and a 6 63 were evaluated as 6 56 and 21 16 years respectively in comparison with the univariate return period of 10 years the decrease in return period for t ds or t da or t sa or and t dsa or was calculated as 25 5 33 7 17 and 34 4 while the percentage increase in return periods for t ds and t da and t sa and and t dsa and was found to be 34 1 50 6 20 2 and 52 7 respectively in line with previous studies the univariate frequency analysis did not offer sufficient cognition about drought risk compared with multivariate drought frequency analysis lamneithem and parmendra 2018 ayantobo et al 2018b with the enhancement of drought variable values the corresponding bivariate and trivariate drought return periods increased gradually in all cases the return period calculated using univariate distributions was found greater than the multivariate joint return period obtained in the or case and less than the multivariate joint return period computed in the and case additionally the trivariate return period in the and case was greater than the corresponding pairwise bivariate return period which showed that there was a lower probability of occurrence of a drought with d s and a simultaneously exceeding the threshold it was also observed that the multivariate joint return periods in the and case were overestimated which means that the drought risks would be underestimated if only the and case return periods were considered on the contrary the multivariate joint return periods in the or case were underestimated which means that the drought risks would be overestimated if simply the or case return periods were considered and the risk of failure of drought control measures and drought mitigation techniques might increase to some extent lee et al 2013 ayantobo et al 2018b 5 discussion 5 1 uncertainties in this study we encountered several uncertainties during drought identification and frequency analysis first the minimum area threshold as the only parameter controlling the aggregation degree of data should be determined in advance the smaller drought patches with the area below the predetermined threshold were filtered out and no longer included in further investigation the selection of this threshold played an important role in determining the drought events and the drought identification results based on various area thresholds were quite different therefore a series of minimum area thresholds were selected within the three dimensional identification method to test their effect on drought identification in the study area as observed from our study if the threshold was set as 30 km2 approximately accounting for 0 33 of the study area 1475 drought events would be detected and 72 4 of these events 1068 drought events were minor events with a duration of 1 month and affected area less than 0 5 of the study area such a sample of drought events can scarcely interpret extreme drought conditions sheffield et al 2009 liu et al 2019 moreover the clustering method with a smaller area threshold can also lead to drought lasting for a long time through tenuous spatial connectivity for example a drought event with long duration of 200 months was recognized under the current assumptions sheffield et al 2009 used a threshold of 500 000 km2 in their drought study for global scale and obtained conclusions similar to our study additionally with the minimum area threshold increasing the number of drought events showed a continuous downward trend and the ration of minor events reduced simultaneously but it arrived at a relatively stable level when the area threshold was equal to 160 km2 approximately 1 6 of the study area therefore we chose 160 km2 as the area threshold for drought event identification in related studies wang et al 2011 investigated the effect of area threshold on drought identification and discovered that a threshold of 150 000 km2 was appropriate for their drought study in china xu et al 2015a and liu et al 2019 also suggested that approximately 1 6 of the study area should be selected as the minimum area threshold these findings are highly consistent with our results second all drought events recognized using the three dimensional identification method were generally contained and the severe drought events with long duration high severity and large affected area were paid more attention in drought frequency analysis chen et al 2013 yusof et al 2013 therefore it was important to investigate the upper tails of the univariate drought distributions however there were uncertainties in the upper tail estimation because of the existence of a lot of drought variables with small values this would lead to incorrect occurrence probabilities or return periods of extreme drought events commonly two methods are utilized to reduce this uncertainty one is the lower bound censored sampling method in which only the samples beyond a specified threshold value are selected the feasibility and robustness of this method have been demonstrated in previous studies moisello 2007 xu et al 2015b in the second method samples with large values are apportioned more weights in estimating the parameters of the probability distribution which makes the distribution more dependent on these samples song et al 2012 xu et al 2015b employed the first method in their drought study and determined a specified threshold value of 3 in other words drought events that lasted 3 months were selected for analysis the residual samples after removing the drought events lasting 3 months were enough for the accurate estimation of distribution parameters e g 30 samples therefore we selected drought events with 3 months or longer for frequency analysis to avoid the influence of drought events with short duration on the estimation of the upper tail finally six candidate copula functions were selected in the current study however there are many methods for the determination of optimal copula function including rmse aic bic nash sutcliffe efficiency criteria etc different copulas may be selected by using different estimation methods which will result in different joint probabilities hence this study selected three methods including rmse aic and bic to determine the optimal copula functionto ensure the accuracy of results fan et al 2018 5 2 advantages and limitations traditional drought frequency analysis considering univariate drought variables does not provide enough information on drought assessment and warning in this study the basin is the main runoff yield area and is frequently affected by drought events therefore it is imperative to investigate the changing properties of drought with various combinations of estimated variables from a multivariate perspective the joint and conditional probabilities as well as return periods are beneficial for the assessment of water supply capability and are important references for needed auxiliary water resources during extreme droughts apart from this the return period can also be considered as a criterion in water resources system planning and management for a new water conservancy project some limitations still exist currently three drought variables duration severity and affected area were employed to model the bivariate and trivariate dependence since drought is a multivariate phenomenon the low dimensional frequency analysis may lead to a deficient drought risk estimation hence the application of high dimensional copulas will become a key research direction in the future furthermore the hydrological factor is regarded as a stationary series in this study but the stationarity is decreasing under climate change therefore the non stationarity of hydrological series in drought risk assessment should be considered in future research 6 conclusions in this study hydrological drought was characterized by the sri calculated using the gridded runoff datafrom 1961 to 2014 drought events and variables were identified and extracted based on a three dimensional identification method and the spatiotemporal evolution of drought was investigated seven three parameter distributions were selected to fit the drought variables and the optimal distribution was determined based on the k s and a d tests the rmse aic and bic methods were employed to choose the optimal copula from six copula functions for each pairwise dependence then the drought risk was estimated based on bivariate and trivariate joint probability conditional probabilities and return period the main conclusions can be summaried as follows 1 the continuous spatiotemporal structure and dynamic evolution of drought are described effectively from a three dimensional perspective the spatiotemporal dynamic migration of typical drought events is reproduced based on six drought variables and the identification results are consistent with the actual drought records this shed a new light for the quantitative study of drought evolution 2 the mutual dependence between drought variables is relatively large and the optimal distributions for d s and a are lognormal log logistic and log logistic respectively the bivariate and trivariate gumbel copula are appropriate for the pairwise dependence of drought variables 3 the joint occurrence probabilities in the or case were greater than that in the and case under the same combination of drought variables for all the and cases the probability tends to be higher for lower value combinations the conditional probability of drought variables with a given conditional factors decreases as the values of factor increase the increasing conditional factors could obviously reduce the probability of drought occurrences for a lesser drought variable 4 the return periods calculated using univariate distributions were found to be greater than the multivariate joint return period obtained in the or case and less than the multivariate joint return period computed in the and case drought risks will be underestimated if simply the and case return periods were considered and the drought risks will be overestimated if only the or case return periods were considered in summary the drought dynamic variation from a three dimensional perspective can provide effective support for drought mitigation and warning and drought risk analysis based on multivariate modeling is valuable for water

4429,land subsidence due to groundwater depletion significantly obstructs regional economic and social development and long term high precision monitoring of land subsidence is the prerequisite for solving this problem based on precise leveling data covering 50 000 km since 1952 in the north china plain ncp this study investigated dynamic patterns of land subsidence over three periods 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s with unprecedented spatial extent and accuracy the main results were as follows 1 the extent of the ncp subsidence gradually expanded in 1960 1980s subsidence regions mainly located at central and coastal plain covering 6 200 km2 with subsidence rates 20 mm yr over time the subsidence region gradually expanded westward to the eastern foot of the taihang mountains northward to the south foot of the yanshan mountains and southward to the shandong hills areas with subsidence rates 20 mm yr increased to 22 800 km2 and 41 800 km2 respectively in 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s 2 the subsidence rate significantly accelerated statistics for points with settlement rates 5 mm yr showed that the average values in the three periods were 12 2 17 3 and 26 5 mm yr respectively the subsidence zone covered by the profile line from dingzhou to cangzhou showed the most prominent acceleration and the average settlement rates in the three periods were 16 4 29 6 and 55 3 mm yr respectively 3 subsidence in tianjin was mitigating gradually with rate slowing from 58 2 mm yr in 1960 1980s to 33 6 mm yr in 1990 2010s primarily by limiting groundwater exploitation 4 by comparing with the variation of groundwater level we infer that groundwater depletion is mainly responsible for the land subsidence of the ncp nowadays the problem of land subsidence is still very serious in the ncp requiring further control measures keywords precise leveling land subsidence spatiotemporal evolution groundwater depletion 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is an important agricultural production base as well as a political and economic center in eastern china the ncp is located east of the taihang mountains north of the huaihe river and south of the yanshan mountains fig 1 with the rapid development of industry and agriculture in recent years the exploitation and utilization of groundwater have increased dramatically which led to severe land subsidence in the ncp gong et al 2018 guo et al 2015 xue et al 2005 ye et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 as a result the ncp underwent a direct economic loss of nearly 10 billion renminbi per year yin et al 2005 and subsidence has become one of the important environmental factors restricting the sustainable development of the regional economy thus a systematic study of the resulting spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and the evolutionary mechanism of ground subsidence is important prerequisite for the prevention and control of the sinking processes in recent years many researchers have used space earth geodetic techniques such as the interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar and global navigation satellite system gnss to investigate land subsidence phenomena in the local regions of the ncp such as beijing guo et al 2019 li et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 tianjin luo et al 2014 tao et al 2004 zhang et al 2019 cangzhou zhou et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 jinan liu et al 2016b the yellow river delta liu et al 2016c and haihe river plain hrp zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 these results are of great significance in understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of land subsidence in these local areas gnss insar and other space earth observation technologies have incomparable advantages over traditional geodetic observations such as the high temporal sampling rate and high accuracy of continuously monitoring gnss cgnss and the high spatial resolution of insar however there are still notable deficiencies in extracting dynamic characteristics of land subsidence at large spatial scales and longtime spans such as the 60 year scale ground subsidence evolution characteristics of the ncp studied in this paper the spatial resolution of cgnss stations is sparse wang et al 2017 the accuracy of campaign gnss stations is insufficient the interpretation of insar is affected by decorrelation caused by temporal variation and large baselines wright et al 2004 although the spatial resolution of space earth observation technologies can be increased to a certain extent through multiple dataset integration fuhrmann et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2002 the problem of short time coverage cannot be overcome because the epochs of gnss and insar data do not exceed 30 years in the ncp therefore traditional geodetic leveling remains one of the most effective methods for studying large scale long term and high precision vertical land movement lyon et al 2018 qin et al 2018 saberi et al 2017 spampinato et al 2013 which is widely used in monitoring vertical tectonic movement hao et al 2014 ji et al 2014 reilinger et al 1980 vestøl 2006 land subsidence due to withdrawal of groundwater oil or gas sarychikhina et al 2011 volcanoes dzurisin et al 2002 murase et al 2016 and deformation of high speed railways dams and huge buildings liu et al 2016a in order to study the characteristics of land subsidence in the ncp during the past 60 years we systematically collected up to 50 000 km of precise leveling data measured from four campaigns from 1952 through 2017 then based on previous studies of the local area or a single period estimated from precise leveling data guo et al 2009 hu et al 1993 yang et al 2002 we presented the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of land subsidence in the ncp for the first time from a long term large scale and dynamic perspective we conducted two leveling campaigns of 141 8 km total to connect some benchmarks in the leveling network to eight cgnss stations what we called connection leveling established a direct relation between leveling and gnss allowing gnss data to be used to determine the reference datum of vertical land movement on this basis we estimated the ncp vertical rates and rate errors of repeat points during 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s using a joint adjustment method and then comprehensively studied dynamic patterns of land subsidence these results will provide important references for land subsidence control and scientific research such as verifying space earth geodetic techniques calibrating the coupling model of groundwater depletion and land subsidence and inverting hydrogeological parameters 2 data and method 2 1 leveling data the principal data used in this study are acquired by geodetic leveling fig 1 shows the collected route distribution of the leveling network in the ncp the network includes 46 closed loops with an average distance between adjacent benchmarks of 4 km moreover benchmarks embedded in the bedrock are set 400 km from one to another along the leveling line black triangles in fig 1 indicate bedrock points measured more than four times in terms of leveling data the collected height differences were obtained from four leveling campaigns 50 000 km in length the first campaign was mainly completed between 1952 and 1969 including first order second order and third order leveling data of 7 000 5 000 and 200 km respectively as shown in fig s1 a in the supplementary material the second third and fourth campaigns were mainly completed during 1976 1986 1991 2001 and 2012 2016 respectively with observation route lengths of 11 000 12 000 and 14 000 km respectively all of which were first order leveling data fig s1 b d in particular 1 000 km of data were not included in each period mentioned above and we classified them into the nearest campaign according to the observation time for convenience of description these four campaigns are described as the 1960s 1980s 1990s and the 2010s respectively in the following sections according to the specifications for the precise leveling published by standardization administration of the people s republic of china 2006 the maximum tolerance of the root mean square of the misclosures between back and forth leveling i e m δ of the equation 1 and the leveling error per kilometer i e m w of the equation 2 are different for different order leveling surveying the m δ and m w is 0 45 mm and 1 0 mm for the first order and the corresponding values are 1 0 mm and 2 0 mm for the second order 1 m δ 1 4 n i 1 n δ i 2 l i where δ i is the i th segment misclosure between back and forth leveling surveying l i is the i th segment length n is the number of leveling segment 2 m w 1 n i 1 n w i 2 f i where w i is the i th leveling loop misclosure f i is the i th leveling loop length n is the number of leveling loop to suppress the influence of leveling errors e g lacking of orthometric correction staves scale errors atmospheric refraction some measures were adopted according to standardization administration of the people s republic of china 2006 firstly the orthometric correction in height differences were applied to eliminate the influence of the non parallel equipotential surface with the field gravity data hwang and hsiao 2003 secondly the high precision leveling staff were calibrated in the laboratory before and after surveying campaigns to suppress the staves errors of which magnitude is slope dependent stein 1981 jackson and bilham 1994 then we strictly limit the observation time e g the observation time is limited in between 30 min after sunrise and 30 min before sunset and not allowed between 10 a m and 14p m of the local time and sight length e g the sight length discrepancies between backsight and foresight in each setup are constrained in 3 m 30 m and 1 0 m 1 0 m for the first order leveling to suppress the influence of the refraction error mark et al 1987 lastly for the other factors such as the influence of ocean tide and solid earth tide their corrections are not applied owing to lacking accurate records of observation time nevertheless dong et al 2002 reports that the tides effects would be weakened during the differential processing of the leveling data and it is not significant enough to bias the long term movement rates as the tides have a similar effect on the repeat leveling 2 2 gnss data to determine the reference datum of vertical movement and ensure that the vertical movement results at large spatial scales were comparable we selected eight cgnss stations spatial distribution shown in fig 1 in the non subsidence regions to conduct two connection leveling campaigns the first and second campaigns completed a total of 79 1 km and 62 7 km lengths of first order leveling observations in 2010 and 2017 respectively through connection leveling we established a direct relationship between the vertical movement rates derived from cgnss and height differences acquired by geodetic leveling fig 2 shows the collected vertical coordinate time series of eight cgnss stations specific processing methods and strategies are defined in zhan et al 2017 before performing a joint adjustment with the leveling data we first estimated the linear rates by using the linear annual cycle semi annual cycle movement model to fit the cgnss time series in which model parameters were solved using the least squares method the linear secular rates are shown in fig 2 2 3 data processing method 2 3 1 joint dynamic adjustment through a differential processing between observation datasets of adjacent leveling campaigns we acquired the vertical deformations occurring in the corresponding periods 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s due to the large time span of each leveling campaign especially the first which lasted 17 years the static adjustment model was not applicable to the data collected in this study fuhrmann et al 2014 therefore to account for the temporal inhomogeneity and achieve complementary advantages between leveling height differences and vertical velocities of cgnss a joint dynamic adjustment model derived by wu et al 2021 was applied as shown in equation 3 the first and second equations are the error observation equations of leveling height differences and linear rates of cgnss respectively moreover a variance component estimation method helmert method was employed in the adjustment to assign the weight of the two kinds of observation data reasonably and its detail explanation can refer to wu et al 2021 3 v m n σ h n σ h m v e l n t t 0 v e l m t t 0 h m n v k v e l k l k where t is the observation time of the leveling segment mn t 0 is the reference epoch the average observation time of the adjacent campaigns was taken here h mn is the measured height difference between benchmark m and n vel m and vel n are vertical rates of m and n respectively v mn is the correction number of h mn σ h m and σ h n are the correction numbers of height v e l k is the vertical rate of point k l k is the measured rate and v k is the correction number of l k 2 3 2 method for unifying the reference datum maintaining the consistency of the reference datum in different periods is an essential requirement for studying the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of the vertical movement field first with the leveling data acquired from the last two campaigns 1990s and 2010s and the eight cgnss rates we estimated the unknown rates at repeat points during the 1990 2010s the third period using the aforementioned joint method as the data were all leveling height differences and there was no cgnss rate in the adjustment computation of the first 1960 1980s and second 1980 1990s periods to determine the reference datum and maintain consistency over the three periods a few benchmarks were used to transmit the datum of the third period 1990 2010s to the first two the selection principles of the transition points were as follows 1 these points should be embedded in bedrock and located in non subsidence areas 2 these points should be measured in each campaign and 3 these points should be distributed evenly to suppress the rapid accumulation of errors with distance in some local areas according to these principles seven transition points were selected in this study black triangles in fig 1 for which rates and rate errors estimated using the joint adjustment in the 1990 2010s are shown in table 1 these rates were then substituted into the second equation in equation 3 when processing the data of the first two periods meanwhile the unknown rates of repeat points in the first two periods were also estimated using the helmert method finally we obtained three vertical movement results with a relatively unified reference datum in the 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s the flowchart of data processing is shown in fig 3 3 results and analyses dynamic adjustment results revealed that the average errors of the vertical movement rates during the 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s periods in the ncp were 2 49 1 42 and 1 31 mm yr respectively 3 1 vertical velocity field analysis to estimate the vertical rates of the leveling points the repeated points that defined as the common points in the adjacent leveling campaigns are determined firstly for the 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s periods the repeated points are 461 1523 and 952 respectively it is noted that the count of repeated points in the period 1960 1980s are much smaller than other periods as it is difficult to collect historical data from paper media 3 1 1 1960 1980s fig 4 shows the vertical movement results of 461 repeat points during the 1960 1980s in the ncp in which 24 000 km of leveling data were used the vertical movement vectors in fig 4 a show that the vertical movement rates at the benchmarks were between 101 7 4 8 mm yr and 5 5 2 2 mm yr and the points with the subsidence rates 5 mm yr black vectors were mainly concentrated in tianjin cangzhou dezhou and hengshui with tianjin suffering the most severe settlement with subsidence rates between 60 and 100 mm yr in the core area the extent and rate of this subsidence agreed with hu et al 1993 moreover a small number of points in shangqiu and binzhou subsided with values ranging from 3 0 to 10 0 mm yr according to the statistics for points with subsidence rate 5 mm yr the average was 12 2 mm yr except for several rapid subsidence points in tianjin other regions such as the shandong peninsula taihang mountains and the southern foot of the yanshan mountains showed weak deformation characteristics with vertical movement velocities in the range of 1 to 5 mm yr which fit well into the geologic and tectonic contexts meanwhile the spatial distribution of rate errors in fig 4 a background produced by a interpolation using the least squares collocation method wu et al 2017 indicated that the magnitudes around the benchmarks were principally concentrated within 1 0 3 0 mm yr poor accuracy areas were distributed near hengshui and shangqiu where the time interval between the younger and older leveling campaigns was short to intuitively depict the vertical movement characteristics in the ncp we interpreted discrete rates in fig 4 a to a continuous deformation field using the least squares collocation method wu et al 2017 on this basis we mapped the vertical movement contour lines in fig 4 b land subsidence during this period mainly occurred in tianjin and its neighboring areas on the eastern coastal plain the subsidence patterns were as follows tianjin was the center of the subsidence funnel with a subsidence velocity 40 mm yr the funnel westward and northward rapidly converged toward the piedmont plain of the taihang mountains and south of the yanshan mountains the funnel extended southward to cangzhou in the central plain with the subsidence rates gradually decaying to 10 mm yr which was connected to the hengshui subsidence funnel furthermore other regions such as binzhou shangqiu and suqian showed slight settlement statistics on the area of the land subsidence funnel showed that the area affected by ground subsidence settlement rate 5 mm yr reached 33 900 km2 in which the severe settlement area settlement rate 20 mm yr was 6 200 km2 the slight settlement area with rates 5 to 20 mm yr was 27 700 km2 3 1 2 1980 1990s fig 5 shows the adjustment results of 1 523 repeat points using 23 000 km leveling data during the 1980 1990s in the ncp the vector results in fig 5 a show that vertical movement rates ranged from 73 9 1 4 to 3 6 1 1 mm yr from the perspective of the spatial distribution of benchmarks suffering subsidence besides tianjin hengshui dezhou and cangzhou in the former period benchmarks in baoding handan shijiazhuang binzhou beijing shangqiu and yancheng underwent obvious subsidence black vector in fig 5 a at rates ranging from 5 to 44 mm yr the largest descending rates were still concentrated in tianjin and surrounding areas with a maximum value of 73 9 1 4 mm yr based on the statistics of benchmarks with settlement rates 5 mm yr in the ncp the average was 17 3 mm yr showing a remarkable acceleration compared with the previous period of 12 2 mm yr vertical movements in the shandong peninsula taihang mountains and yanshan mountains were still exposed to weak deformation with a velocity ranging from 1 to 3 mm yr the spatial distribution of rate errors background in fig 5 a indicated that most areas were less than 2 mm yr except for the southeast coastal regions at the edge of the surveying area a n s striking line located on the shandong peninsula showed a relatively larger error due to the short time interval of the two leveling campaigns conducted in 1996 and 1999 the contour lines in fig 5 b show that compared with the 1960 1980s the subsidence extent significantly expanded during the 1980 1990s the amount of subsidence funnels increased from two comprising tianjin and hengshui in the previous period to seven comprising tianjin hengshui baoding handan beijing binzhou and yancheng during the 1980 1990s period furthermore some of these funnels e g tianjin hengshui and baoding had a tendency to evolve into a single larger one in terms of spatial distribution characteristics the descending regions in the former period were mainly concentrated on the eastern coastal plain and the central flood plain such as tianjin and cangzhou while in this period it extended westward and southward to the taihang mountains and shandong hills respectively with the rates rapidly decreasing to 0 mm yr at the junction of the plains and mountains meanwhile a ne striking settlement strip composed of the handan hengshui baoding and beijing funnels was formed in the west of the ncp the statistics of the subsidence area indicated that the areas with sinking rates 5 mm yr and 20 mm yr in the ncp increased by 1 8 fold and 2 7 fold respectively and from 33 900 km2 and 6 200 km2 during the 1960 1980s to 94 200 km2 and 22 800 km2 during the 1980 1990s respectively 3 1 3 1990 2010s fig 6 shows the results of rates and rate errors at 952 re measured benchmarks during the 1990 2010s the adjustment result indicated that vertical movement rates ranged from 101 2 2 2 to 5 1 0 9 mm yr collectively the spatial distribution of settlement benchmarks with rates 5 mm yr in the 1990 2010s was consistent with the former period black arrows in fig 5 a and fig 6 a however the subsidence rates in the 1990 2010s were significantly increased as shown by the beijing tianjin baoding cangzhou and shijiazhuang jinan leveling lines all of which were characterized by accelerated descent the statistical results based on benchmarks with a settlement rate 5 mm yr showed an average of 26 5 mm yr an increase of 9 3 mm yr compared to the 1980 1990s period the leveling routes near the shandong peninsula taihang mountains and yanshan mountains were still mainly defined by weak deformation features simultaneously the spatial distribution characteristics of the subsidence regions were in accordance with those demonstrated by li et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 and zhang et al 2016 using insar and gnss the spatial distribution of errors for most of the repeat points were 2 mm yr and relatively uniform in space as shown by the contours in fig 6 b both the subsidence range and rate of the ncp increased in the 1990 2010s compared to the two former periods first in terms of the spatial distribution characteristic of subsidence the settlement funnels during the two former periods were characterized by a scattered point distribution while the 1990 2010s exhibited the characteristics of combining from individual pieces in which funnel shaped subsidence areas such as tianjin cangzhou baoding shijiazhuang dezhou and hengshui extended merged and developed into a single larger one in addition compared to the previous periods there was a change in the gravity center of subsidence in the two former periods the fastest subsidence area was located in the tianjin area coastal plain while in the third period this shifted into the region near baoding hebei province piedmont plain or alluvial fan plain the statistical results show that the severe subsidence area with settlement rates 20 mm yr reached 41 800 km2 an increase of 0 8 fold and 5 7 fold compared to the 1980 1990s and 1960 1980s respectively similarly the area suffering settlement subsidence rate 5 mm yr increased from 33 900 km2 in the 1960 1980s and 94 200 km2 in the 1980 1990s to 108 700 km2 in the 1990 2010s 3 2 vertical velocity profile analysis to map the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of vertical movement at a local scale in detail figs 7 10 show four profile projections through the settlement area profile locations marked by red lines in fig 1 in these figures the abscissa indicates the distance from the leveling point to the reference projection line black dashed line approximately perpendicular to the profile in fig 1 and the ordinate indicates the rate of vertical movement fig 7 shows the vertical rate results for the beijing tianjin profile with a nw se strike in the northern ncp the terrain elevation gradually decreased from nw to se with an average elevation of 17 m and a minimum of 1 4 m during the 1960 1980s tianjin experienced serious land subsidence from 80 to 175 km on the profile with a maximum and average of 87 2 6 6 mm yr at 135 3 km and 58 2 5 5 mm yr respectively by the 1980 1990s the subsidence zone at 80 175 km formed in the former epoch slowed with all repeat points 50 mm yr except for a point at 95 4 km 73 9 1 4 mm yr and the average decreased by 25 4 mm yr to 32 8 1 3 mm yr in the last period 1990 2010s the shape and magnitude of this subsidence zone were approximately consistent with the previous period with a maximum and average of 71 7 1 9 mm yr at 137 km and 33 6 1 7 mm yr respectively indicating that land subsidence in this area tended to be stable the alleviation is benefit from the strict groundwater managements adopted by the tianjin government since 1986 the detail measures include four round of three year land subsidence control plans from 1986 to 1997 and a water source conversion project since 2003 dong et al 2008 guo et al 2009 however the uneven settlement exhibited in the 1990 2010s requires further attention in addition the region near beijing from 5 to 22 km subsided during the 1980 1990s with a maximum of 15 4 1 2 mm yr by the 1990 2010s this subsidence funnel extended eastward to 35 km and the maximum increased by 21 6 mm yr to 37 0 1 8 mm yr overall these results revealed the alleviation of land subsidence in tianjin and the formation and acceleration of subsidence near beijing fig 8 shows the dingzhou cangzhou vertical movement profile along a w e strike in the northern ncp where the topography gradually decreases from w to e with an average elevation of 16 m in the first period 1960 1980s subsidence mainly occurred in cangzhou with a width maximum and average value of 60 km from 125 to 185 km 23 8 3 8 mm yr and 16 4 3 3 mm yr respectively by the second period the settlement extent rapidly expanded westward to dingzhou at 50 km and formed a 135 km wide subsidence funnel 2 3 fold higher than the former period from 50 to 185 km with maximum and average values of 44 7 1 3 mm yr at 79 5 km and 29 6 1 3 mm yr in the last period subsidence continued to worsen and its extent continued to expand westward to 20 km from the piedmont plain of the taihang mountains the maximum magnitude at 69 8 km reached 101 2 2 2 mm yr uplift with 2 9 1 7 mm yr in the 1960 1980s and sinking with 41 6 1 3 mm yr in the 1980 1990s at the same position and the average from 50 to 185 km increased by 25 7 mm yr to 55 3 1 8 mm yr furthermore the obvious velocity difference of adjacent repeat points e g 29 4 2 1 mm yr at 90 0 km and 93 4 km indicated evident uneven settlement in the 1990 2010s these results showed that land subsidence from dingzhou to cangzhou began in the 1960s and continued its expansion acceleration and unevenness after the 1980s fig 9 shows the profile from shijiazhuang capital of hebei province through hengshui dezhou to jinan capital of shandong province with a nw se strike in the central ncp the terrain gradually decreased from nw to se with an average elevation of 38 m a subsidence zone with a width of about 100 km 130 230 km maximum of 18 1 3 6 mm yr at 192 km and average of 8 2 3 7 mm yr occurred around hengshui and dezhou in the 1960 1980s by the second period this subsidence zone quickly extended nw and se to 60 km and 270 km respectively an overall expansion of 110 km compared to the previous period in terms of magnitude the maximum sinking rate at 133 8 km reached 35 4 1 7 mm yr and the average doubled 15 7 1 5 mm yr in the last period the spatial pattern of the previous period generally continued while the subsidence rate significantly accelerated the average from 60 to 260 km increased by 10 8 mm yr to 26 5 1 3 mm yr and the maximum reached 47 1 1 3 mm yr overall the ground subsidence extent covered by this profile expanded and the subsidence rate accelerated fig 10 shows the profile from handan to yanzhou in the central ncp with a general nw se strike and an average altitude of 43 m there was slight ground subsidence near handan in the 1960 1980s with width maximum and average values of 40 km 10 50 km 15 9 2 1 mm yr and 9 2 3 0 mm yr by the 1980 1990s the subsidence range expanded eastward by 60 km to 110 km and the maximum value reached 47 2 1 1 mm yr at 25 2 km with an average value of 16 7 1 2 mm yr compared to the previous periods the 1990 2010s profile showed a nearly identical subsidence range but an accelerated subsidence the average value at 10 110 km increased by 13 8 mm yr to 30 5 1 4 mm yr similar to the dingzhou cangzhou and shijiazhuang jinan profiles the handan yanzhou profile also featured a pattern of spatial enlargement and rate acceleration 4 discussion 4 1 relation between the land subsidence and groundwater depletion figs 4 6 show that land subsidence funnels in the ncp are primarily distributed in the hrp bounded by taihang mountains yanshan mountains yellow river and bohai sea fig 11 a based on the characteristics of sedimentology hrp can be divided into piedmont plain alluvial fan plain flood plain and coastal plain from west to east wu et al 1996 the thickness of unconsolidated quaternary sediment consisting of pebble gravel sand silt and clay ranges from 200 m to 600 m in the hrp jin 1988 these loose sediments store considerable amounts of groundwater currently approximately 60 of water consumption in hrp comes from groundwater zhao et al 2019 and the numerical groundwater flow models cao et al 2013 zhang and li 2013 show that irrigation dominated groundwater extraction has led to continuous decline of the groundwater level since 1970s fig 11 b presents a long term shallow groundwater level variation during 1970 2008 cao et al 2013 and deep groundwater level variation during 1970 2003 fei et al 2009 zheng et al 2010 in the hrp the results show that the shallow groundwater funnels are concentrated in the piedmont plain and alluvial fan plain with a maximum drawdown of 60 m which was also confirmed by the situ observation well fei et al 2009 the deep groundwater funnels are distributed in the flood plain and coastal plain among which the groundwater level declined 70 m in tianjin cangzhou and dezhou guo et al 2017 to verify whether the groundwater consumption is the potential triggers of land subsidence we estimated the cumulative subsidence from 1960s to 2010s based on the results of the figs 4 6 as the blue contour line in fig 11 b the results show that settlement funnels 0 5 m are primarily located in baoding shijiazhuang handan tianjin cangzhou and dezhou with a total area of 35 000 km2 which shares a similar spatial distribution characteristic with the groundwater depression cone specifically the subsidence funnels in beijing baoding shijiazhuang and handan in the piedmont plain correspond to the falling funnels of shallow groundwater tianjin and cangzhou in the central and coastal plain correspond to the falling funnels of deep groundwater for further confirmation of the coupling relationship between groundwater consumption and land subsidence we collected a groundwater level dataset of 47 situ wells in the hrp from zhao et al 2019 the starting observation time of these data is from 2003 to 2011 and the average time span is 8 6 years after eliminating abnormal jumps and outliers we calculated the linear rate of groundwater variation at 47 wells fig 11 c colored circle the results show that the groundwater level of 42 wells dropped with an average rate of 1 5 m yr in which 10 wells 2 0 m yr in terms of spatial distribution the falling rate of wells inside the hrp is significantly greater than that in the peripheral area which shows a similar spatial feature to the vertical land motion captured by the repeat leveling to quantify the spatial consistency the fit lines between groundwater level variation rate and land subsidence rate estimated by spatial interpolation at the 47 wells show their correlation coefficient is 0 83 fig 11 d in addition a vertical displacement time series recorded by cgnss station which is 300 m from the cx well and marked by red rectangle in fig 11 c by red rectangle is shown in fig 11 e the displacement and groundwater level depth show a high consistency i e correlation coefficient is 0 98 in general as shown in fig 11 b e the land subsidence and groundwater fall funnel show a high spatial and temporal consistency indicating that groundwater depletion large possibly triggered the land subsidence 4 2 other driving factors of land subsidence in fact the mechanism of land subsidence in some regions such as tianjin and canghou is complex apart from the groundwater depletion guo et al 2015 suggests that land subsidence is also related to the thickness and compressibility of the clay in the aquifer system as shown in fig 12 both the subsidence rates profiles from dinghzou to cangzhou in 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s shows a roughly consistent trend with the thickness of quaternary clay besides the compaction of aquifers the tectonic loading is also responsible for the vertical displacement of land surface liu et al 2018 reports that the vertical tectonic movement rates estimated from the bedrock located cgnss in the ncp range from 0 69 to 1 5 mm yr similarly the bedrock point in the subsidence cone of tianjin fig 7 in this study with a base buried in intact cambrian dolomites at a depth of 1 070 m from the surface shows an uplift rate about 1 4 mm yr these researches show the influence of the present tectonic loading on the vertical movement is much smaller than the compaction of aquifers driven by groundwater depletion in addition active faults would control the spatial development of land subsidence for example the spatial development of subsidence in the beijing plain was affected by the nw se striking nankou sunhe fault guo et al 2020 other factors such as drought caused by reduced rainfall complex land use types and increased loads caused by infrastructure construction accelerated the process of land subsidence gong et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 5 conclusions by collecting and collating precise leveling data since 1952 and combining them with a small amount of cgnss data the long term spatiotemporal evolution patterns of land subsidence in the ncp are investigated with an unprecedented scope the results indicate that the extent of ncp subsidence increased significantly during the 1960 2010s subsidence regions during the 1960 1980s were mainly concentrated in tianjin and cangzhou in the central and eastern plains by the 1990 2010s these areas gradually extended westward northward and southward to the east foot of the taihang mountains south foot of the yanshan mountains and shandong hills respectively meanwhile areas with a settlement rate 20 mm yr expanded by 5 7 times the descending rate in the ncp showed an uneven acceleration the average value of benchmarks with a sinking rate 5 mm yr changed from 12 2 mm yr during the first period to 26 5 mm yr during the last period meanwhile through acceleration expansion and merging the discrete subsidence funnels found during the 1960 1980s and 1980 1990s evolved into a large settlement funnel during the 1990 2010s in contrast the land subsidence rates in tianjin slowed down benefiting from strict groundwater managements implemented in 1986 including replenishing groundwater and limiting extraction the velocity profile results show that the average ground subsidence rate slowed from 58 2 mm yr in the first period to 33 6 mm yr in the last period moreover the vertical velocity of the shandong peninsula yanshan mountains taihang mountains and other areas remained stable during the three periods with values approximately between 1 and 3 mm yr in general the groundwater depletion is the primary factor of the land subsidence in the ncp nowadays the land subsidence of the ncp is still very serious and far from comprehensive mitigation although some local areas such as tianjin have made significant progress in order to effectively mitigate land subsidence in the future it is essential to integrate multiple technologies to acquire high precision high reliability and high spatial resolution subsidence information furthermore we should develop insights into the driving mechanisms and causes of settlement and act appropriately to the local situation moreover special attention should be paid to the fact that the unequal spatial settlement reflected by vertical movement profiles in this paper may result in the distortion and deformation of large buildings bridges railways and underground pipe networks 6 data availability the vertical movement results in the north china plain during the 1960 1980s 1980 1990s

4429,land subsidence due to groundwater depletion significantly obstructs regional economic and social development and long term high precision monitoring of land subsidence is the prerequisite for solving this problem based on precise leveling data covering 50 000 km since 1952 in the north china plain ncp this study investigated dynamic patterns of land subsidence over three periods 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s with unprecedented spatial extent and accuracy the main results were as follows 1 the extent of the ncp subsidence gradually expanded in 1960 1980s subsidence regions mainly located at central and coastal plain covering 6 200 km2 with subsidence rates 20 mm yr over time the subsidence region gradually expanded westward to the eastern foot of the taihang mountains northward to the south foot of the yanshan mountains and southward to the shandong hills areas with subsidence rates 20 mm yr increased to 22 800 km2 and 41 800 km2 respectively in 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s 2 the subsidence rate significantly accelerated statistics for points with settlement rates 5 mm yr showed that the average values in the three periods were 12 2 17 3 and 26 5 mm yr respectively the subsidence zone covered by the profile line from dingzhou to cangzhou showed the most prominent acceleration and the average settlement rates in the three periods were 16 4 29 6 and 55 3 mm yr respectively 3 subsidence in tianjin was mitigating gradually with rate slowing from 58 2 mm yr in 1960 1980s to 33 6 mm yr in 1990 2010s primarily by limiting groundwater exploitation 4 by comparing with the variation of groundwater level we infer that groundwater depletion is mainly responsible for the land subsidence of the ncp nowadays the problem of land subsidence is still very serious in the ncp requiring further control measures keywords precise leveling land subsidence spatiotemporal evolution groundwater depletion 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is an important agricultural production base as well as a political and economic center in eastern china the ncp is located east of the taihang mountains north of the huaihe river and south of the yanshan mountains fig 1 with the rapid development of industry and agriculture in recent years the exploitation and utilization of groundwater have increased dramatically which led to severe land subsidence in the ncp gong et al 2018 guo et al 2015 xue et al 2005 ye et al 2015 zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 as a result the ncp underwent a direct economic loss of nearly 10 billion renminbi per year yin et al 2005 and subsidence has become one of the important environmental factors restricting the sustainable development of the regional economy thus a systematic study of the resulting spatial and temporal distribution characteristics and the evolutionary mechanism of ground subsidence is important prerequisite for the prevention and control of the sinking processes in recent years many researchers have used space earth geodetic techniques such as the interferometric synthetic aperture radar insar and global navigation satellite system gnss to investigate land subsidence phenomena in the local regions of the ncp such as beijing guo et al 2019 li et al 2017 zhou et al 2019 tianjin luo et al 2014 tao et al 2004 zhang et al 2019 cangzhou zhou et al 2018 jiang et al 2018 jinan liu et al 2016b the yellow river delta liu et al 2016c and haihe river plain hrp zhang et al 2016 zhou et al 2020 these results are of great significance in understanding the characteristics and mechanisms of land subsidence in these local areas gnss insar and other space earth observation technologies have incomparable advantages over traditional geodetic observations such as the high temporal sampling rate and high accuracy of continuously monitoring gnss cgnss and the high spatial resolution of insar however there are still notable deficiencies in extracting dynamic characteristics of land subsidence at large spatial scales and longtime spans such as the 60 year scale ground subsidence evolution characteristics of the ncp studied in this paper the spatial resolution of cgnss stations is sparse wang et al 2017 the accuracy of campaign gnss stations is insufficient the interpretation of insar is affected by decorrelation caused by temporal variation and large baselines wright et al 2004 although the spatial resolution of space earth observation technologies can be increased to a certain extent through multiple dataset integration fuhrmann et al 2015 gudmundsson et al 2002 the problem of short time coverage cannot be overcome because the epochs of gnss and insar data do not exceed 30 years in the ncp therefore traditional geodetic leveling remains one of the most effective methods for studying large scale long term and high precision vertical land movement lyon et al 2018 qin et al 2018 saberi et al 2017 spampinato et al 2013 which is widely used in monitoring vertical tectonic movement hao et al 2014 ji et al 2014 reilinger et al 1980 vestøl 2006 land subsidence due to withdrawal of groundwater oil or gas sarychikhina et al 2011 volcanoes dzurisin et al 2002 murase et al 2016 and deformation of high speed railways dams and huge buildings liu et al 2016a in order to study the characteristics of land subsidence in the ncp during the past 60 years we systematically collected up to 50 000 km of precise leveling data measured from four campaigns from 1952 through 2017 then based on previous studies of the local area or a single period estimated from precise leveling data guo et al 2009 hu et al 1993 yang et al 2002 we presented the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of land subsidence in the ncp for the first time from a long term large scale and dynamic perspective we conducted two leveling campaigns of 141 8 km total to connect some benchmarks in the leveling network to eight cgnss stations what we called connection leveling established a direct relation between leveling and gnss allowing gnss data to be used to determine the reference datum of vertical land movement on this basis we estimated the ncp vertical rates and rate errors of repeat points during 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s using a joint adjustment method and then comprehensively studied dynamic patterns of land subsidence these results will provide important references for land subsidence control and scientific research such as verifying space earth geodetic techniques calibrating the coupling model of groundwater depletion and land subsidence and inverting hydrogeological parameters 2 data and method 2 1 leveling data the principal data used in this study are acquired by geodetic leveling fig 1 shows the collected route distribution of the leveling network in the ncp the network includes 46 closed loops with an average distance between adjacent benchmarks of 4 km moreover benchmarks embedded in the bedrock are set 400 km from one to another along the leveling line black triangles in fig 1 indicate bedrock points measured more than four times in terms of leveling data the collected height differences were obtained from four leveling campaigns 50 000 km in length the first campaign was mainly completed between 1952 and 1969 including first order second order and third order leveling data of 7 000 5 000 and 200 km respectively as shown in fig s1 a in the supplementary material the second third and fourth campaigns were mainly completed during 1976 1986 1991 2001 and 2012 2016 respectively with observation route lengths of 11 000 12 000 and 14 000 km respectively all of which were first order leveling data fig s1 b d in particular 1 000 km of data were not included in each period mentioned above and we classified them into the nearest campaign according to the observation time for convenience of description these four campaigns are described as the 1960s 1980s 1990s and the 2010s respectively in the following sections according to the specifications for the precise leveling published by standardization administration of the people s republic of china 2006 the maximum tolerance of the root mean square of the misclosures between back and forth leveling i e m δ of the equation 1 and the leveling error per kilometer i e m w of the equation 2 are different for different order leveling surveying the m δ and m w is 0 45 mm and 1 0 mm for the first order and the corresponding values are 1 0 mm and 2 0 mm for the second order 1 m δ 1 4 n i 1 n δ i 2 l i where δ i is the i th segment misclosure between back and forth leveling surveying l i is the i th segment length n is the number of leveling segment 2 m w 1 n i 1 n w i 2 f i where w i is the i th leveling loop misclosure f i is the i th leveling loop length n is the number of leveling loop to suppress the influence of leveling errors e g lacking of orthometric correction staves scale errors atmospheric refraction some measures were adopted according to standardization administration of the people s republic of china 2006 firstly the orthometric correction in height differences were applied to eliminate the influence of the non parallel equipotential surface with the field gravity data hwang and hsiao 2003 secondly the high precision leveling staff were calibrated in the laboratory before and after surveying campaigns to suppress the staves errors of which magnitude is slope dependent stein 1981 jackson and bilham 1994 then we strictly limit the observation time e g the observation time is limited in between 30 min after sunrise and 30 min before sunset and not allowed between 10 a m and 14p m of the local time and sight length e g the sight length discrepancies between backsight and foresight in each setup are constrained in 3 m 30 m and 1 0 m 1 0 m for the first order leveling to suppress the influence of the refraction error mark et al 1987 lastly for the other factors such as the influence of ocean tide and solid earth tide their corrections are not applied owing to lacking accurate records of observation time nevertheless dong et al 2002 reports that the tides effects would be weakened during the differential processing of the leveling data and it is not significant enough to bias the long term movement rates as the tides have a similar effect on the repeat leveling 2 2 gnss data to determine the reference datum of vertical movement and ensure that the vertical movement results at large spatial scales were comparable we selected eight cgnss stations spatial distribution shown in fig 1 in the non subsidence regions to conduct two connection leveling campaigns the first and second campaigns completed a total of 79 1 km and 62 7 km lengths of first order leveling observations in 2010 and 2017 respectively through connection leveling we established a direct relationship between the vertical movement rates derived from cgnss and height differences acquired by geodetic leveling fig 2 shows the collected vertical coordinate time series of eight cgnss stations specific processing methods and strategies are defined in zhan et al 2017 before performing a joint adjustment with the leveling data we first estimated the linear rates by using the linear annual cycle semi annual cycle movement model to fit the cgnss time series in which model parameters were solved using the least squares method the linear secular rates are shown in fig 2 2 3 data processing method 2 3 1 joint dynamic adjustment through a differential processing between observation datasets of adjacent leveling campaigns we acquired the vertical deformations occurring in the corresponding periods 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s due to the large time span of each leveling campaign especially the first which lasted 17 years the static adjustment model was not applicable to the data collected in this study fuhrmann et al 2014 therefore to account for the temporal inhomogeneity and achieve complementary advantages between leveling height differences and vertical velocities of cgnss a joint dynamic adjustment model derived by wu et al 2021 was applied as shown in equation 3 the first and second equations are the error observation equations of leveling height differences and linear rates of cgnss respectively moreover a variance component estimation method helmert method was employed in the adjustment to assign the weight of the two kinds of observation data reasonably and its detail explanation can refer to wu et al 2021 3 v m n σ h n σ h m v e l n t t 0 v e l m t t 0 h m n v k v e l k l k where t is the observation time of the leveling segment mn t 0 is the reference epoch the average observation time of the adjacent campaigns was taken here h mn is the measured height difference between benchmark m and n vel m and vel n are vertical rates of m and n respectively v mn is the correction number of h mn σ h m and σ h n are the correction numbers of height v e l k is the vertical rate of point k l k is the measured rate and v k is the correction number of l k 2 3 2 method for unifying the reference datum maintaining the consistency of the reference datum in different periods is an essential requirement for studying the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of the vertical movement field first with the leveling data acquired from the last two campaigns 1990s and 2010s and the eight cgnss rates we estimated the unknown rates at repeat points during the 1990 2010s the third period using the aforementioned joint method as the data were all leveling height differences and there was no cgnss rate in the adjustment computation of the first 1960 1980s and second 1980 1990s periods to determine the reference datum and maintain consistency over the three periods a few benchmarks were used to transmit the datum of the third period 1990 2010s to the first two the selection principles of the transition points were as follows 1 these points should be embedded in bedrock and located in non subsidence areas 2 these points should be measured in each campaign and 3 these points should be distributed evenly to suppress the rapid accumulation of errors with distance in some local areas according to these principles seven transition points were selected in this study black triangles in fig 1 for which rates and rate errors estimated using the joint adjustment in the 1990 2010s are shown in table 1 these rates were then substituted into the second equation in equation 3 when processing the data of the first two periods meanwhile the unknown rates of repeat points in the first two periods were also estimated using the helmert method finally we obtained three vertical movement results with a relatively unified reference datum in the 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s the flowchart of data processing is shown in fig 3 3 results and analyses dynamic adjustment results revealed that the average errors of the vertical movement rates during the 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s periods in the ncp were 2 49 1 42 and 1 31 mm yr respectively 3 1 vertical velocity field analysis to estimate the vertical rates of the leveling points the repeated points that defined as the common points in the adjacent leveling campaigns are determined firstly for the 1960 1980s 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s periods the repeated points are 461 1523 and 952 respectively it is noted that the count of repeated points in the period 1960 1980s are much smaller than other periods as it is difficult to collect historical data from paper media 3 1 1 1960 1980s fig 4 shows the vertical movement results of 461 repeat points during the 1960 1980s in the ncp in which 24 000 km of leveling data were used the vertical movement vectors in fig 4 a show that the vertical movement rates at the benchmarks were between 101 7 4 8 mm yr and 5 5 2 2 mm yr and the points with the subsidence rates 5 mm yr black vectors were mainly concentrated in tianjin cangzhou dezhou and hengshui with tianjin suffering the most severe settlement with subsidence rates between 60 and 100 mm yr in the core area the extent and rate of this subsidence agreed with hu et al 1993 moreover a small number of points in shangqiu and binzhou subsided with values ranging from 3 0 to 10 0 mm yr according to the statistics for points with subsidence rate 5 mm yr the average was 12 2 mm yr except for several rapid subsidence points in tianjin other regions such as the shandong peninsula taihang mountains and the southern foot of the yanshan mountains showed weak deformation characteristics with vertical movement velocities in the range of 1 to 5 mm yr which fit well into the geologic and tectonic contexts meanwhile the spatial distribution of rate errors in fig 4 a background produced by a interpolation using the least squares collocation method wu et al 2017 indicated that the magnitudes around the benchmarks were principally concentrated within 1 0 3 0 mm yr poor accuracy areas were distributed near hengshui and shangqiu where the time interval between the younger and older leveling campaigns was short to intuitively depict the vertical movement characteristics in the ncp we interpreted discrete rates in fig 4 a to a continuous deformation field using the least squares collocation method wu et al 2017 on this basis we mapped the vertical movement contour lines in fig 4 b land subsidence during this period mainly occurred in tianjin and its neighboring areas on the eastern coastal plain the subsidence patterns were as follows tianjin was the center of the subsidence funnel with a subsidence velocity 40 mm yr the funnel westward and northward rapidly converged toward the piedmont plain of the taihang mountains and south of the yanshan mountains the funnel extended southward to cangzhou in the central plain with the subsidence rates gradually decaying to 10 mm yr which was connected to the hengshui subsidence funnel furthermore other regions such as binzhou shangqiu and suqian showed slight settlement statistics on the area of the land subsidence funnel showed that the area affected by ground subsidence settlement rate 5 mm yr reached 33 900 km2 in which the severe settlement area settlement rate 20 mm yr was 6 200 km2 the slight settlement area with rates 5 to 20 mm yr was 27 700 km2 3 1 2 1980 1990s fig 5 shows the adjustment results of 1 523 repeat points using 23 000 km leveling data during the 1980 1990s in the ncp the vector results in fig 5 a show that vertical movement rates ranged from 73 9 1 4 to 3 6 1 1 mm yr from the perspective of the spatial distribution of benchmarks suffering subsidence besides tianjin hengshui dezhou and cangzhou in the former period benchmarks in baoding handan shijiazhuang binzhou beijing shangqiu and yancheng underwent obvious subsidence black vector in fig 5 a at rates ranging from 5 to 44 mm yr the largest descending rates were still concentrated in tianjin and surrounding areas with a maximum value of 73 9 1 4 mm yr based on the statistics of benchmarks with settlement rates 5 mm yr in the ncp the average was 17 3 mm yr showing a remarkable acceleration compared with the previous period of 12 2 mm yr vertical movements in the shandong peninsula taihang mountains and yanshan mountains were still exposed to weak deformation with a velocity ranging from 1 to 3 mm yr the spatial distribution of rate errors background in fig 5 a indicated that most areas were less than 2 mm yr except for the southeast coastal regions at the edge of the surveying area a n s striking line located on the shandong peninsula showed a relatively larger error due to the short time interval of the two leveling campaigns conducted in 1996 and 1999 the contour lines in fig 5 b show that compared with the 1960 1980s the subsidence extent significantly expanded during the 1980 1990s the amount of subsidence funnels increased from two comprising tianjin and hengshui in the previous period to seven comprising tianjin hengshui baoding handan beijing binzhou and yancheng during the 1980 1990s period furthermore some of these funnels e g tianjin hengshui and baoding had a tendency to evolve into a single larger one in terms of spatial distribution characteristics the descending regions in the former period were mainly concentrated on the eastern coastal plain and the central flood plain such as tianjin and cangzhou while in this period it extended westward and southward to the taihang mountains and shandong hills respectively with the rates rapidly decreasing to 0 mm yr at the junction of the plains and mountains meanwhile a ne striking settlement strip composed of the handan hengshui baoding and beijing funnels was formed in the west of the ncp the statistics of the subsidence area indicated that the areas with sinking rates 5 mm yr and 20 mm yr in the ncp increased by 1 8 fold and 2 7 fold respectively and from 33 900 km2 and 6 200 km2 during the 1960 1980s to 94 200 km2 and 22 800 km2 during the 1980 1990s respectively 3 1 3 1990 2010s fig 6 shows the results of rates and rate errors at 952 re measured benchmarks during the 1990 2010s the adjustment result indicated that vertical movement rates ranged from 101 2 2 2 to 5 1 0 9 mm yr collectively the spatial distribution of settlement benchmarks with rates 5 mm yr in the 1990 2010s was consistent with the former period black arrows in fig 5 a and fig 6 a however the subsidence rates in the 1990 2010s were significantly increased as shown by the beijing tianjin baoding cangzhou and shijiazhuang jinan leveling lines all of which were characterized by accelerated descent the statistical results based on benchmarks with a settlement rate 5 mm yr showed an average of 26 5 mm yr an increase of 9 3 mm yr compared to the 1980 1990s period the leveling routes near the shandong peninsula taihang mountains and yanshan mountains were still mainly defined by weak deformation features simultaneously the spatial distribution characteristics of the subsidence regions were in accordance with those demonstrated by li et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 and zhang et al 2016 using insar and gnss the spatial distribution of errors for most of the repeat points were 2 mm yr and relatively uniform in space as shown by the contours in fig 6 b both the subsidence range and rate of the ncp increased in the 1990 2010s compared to the two former periods first in terms of the spatial distribution characteristic of subsidence the settlement funnels during the two former periods were characterized by a scattered point distribution while the 1990 2010s exhibited the characteristics of combining from individual pieces in which funnel shaped subsidence areas such as tianjin cangzhou baoding shijiazhuang dezhou and hengshui extended merged and developed into a single larger one in addition compared to the previous periods there was a change in the gravity center of subsidence in the two former periods the fastest subsidence area was located in the tianjin area coastal plain while in the third period this shifted into the region near baoding hebei province piedmont plain or alluvial fan plain the statistical results show that the severe subsidence area with settlement rates 20 mm yr reached 41 800 km2 an increase of 0 8 fold and 5 7 fold compared to the 1980 1990s and 1960 1980s respectively similarly the area suffering settlement subsidence rate 5 mm yr increased from 33 900 km2 in the 1960 1980s and 94 200 km2 in the 1980 1990s to 108 700 km2 in the 1990 2010s 3 2 vertical velocity profile analysis to map the spatiotemporal dynamic characteristics of vertical movement at a local scale in detail figs 7 10 show four profile projections through the settlement area profile locations marked by red lines in fig 1 in these figures the abscissa indicates the distance from the leveling point to the reference projection line black dashed line approximately perpendicular to the profile in fig 1 and the ordinate indicates the rate of vertical movement fig 7 shows the vertical rate results for the beijing tianjin profile with a nw se strike in the northern ncp the terrain elevation gradually decreased from nw to se with an average elevation of 17 m and a minimum of 1 4 m during the 1960 1980s tianjin experienced serious land subsidence from 80 to 175 km on the profile with a maximum and average of 87 2 6 6 mm yr at 135 3 km and 58 2 5 5 mm yr respectively by the 1980 1990s the subsidence zone at 80 175 km formed in the former epoch slowed with all repeat points 50 mm yr except for a point at 95 4 km 73 9 1 4 mm yr and the average decreased by 25 4 mm yr to 32 8 1 3 mm yr in the last period 1990 2010s the shape and magnitude of this subsidence zone were approximately consistent with the previous period with a maximum and average of 71 7 1 9 mm yr at 137 km and 33 6 1 7 mm yr respectively indicating that land subsidence in this area tended to be stable the alleviation is benefit from the strict groundwater managements adopted by the tianjin government since 1986 the detail measures include four round of three year land subsidence control plans from 1986 to 1997 and a water source conversion project since 2003 dong et al 2008 guo et al 2009 however the uneven settlement exhibited in the 1990 2010s requires further attention in addition the region near beijing from 5 to 22 km subsided during the 1980 1990s with a maximum of 15 4 1 2 mm yr by the 1990 2010s this subsidence funnel extended eastward to 35 km and the maximum increased by 21 6 mm yr to 37 0 1 8 mm yr overall these results revealed the alleviation of land subsidence in tianjin and the formation and acceleration of subsidence near beijing fig 8 shows the dingzhou cangzhou vertical movement profile along a w e strike in the northern ncp where the topography gradually decreases from w to e with an average elevation of 16 m in the first period 1960 1980s subsidence mainly occurred in cangzhou with a width maximum and average value of 60 km from 125 to 185 km 23 8 3 8 mm yr and 16 4 3 3 mm yr respectively by the second period the settlement extent rapidly expanded westward to dingzhou at 50 km and formed a 135 km wide subsidence funnel 2 3 fold higher than the former period from 50 to 185 km with maximum and average values of 44 7 1 3 mm yr at 79 5 km and 29 6 1 3 mm yr in the last period subsidence continued to worsen and its extent continued to expand westward to 20 km from the piedmont plain of the taihang mountains the maximum magnitude at 69 8 km reached 101 2 2 2 mm yr uplift with 2 9 1 7 mm yr in the 1960 1980s and sinking with 41 6 1 3 mm yr in the 1980 1990s at the same position and the average from 50 to 185 km increased by 25 7 mm yr to 55 3 1 8 mm yr furthermore the obvious velocity difference of adjacent repeat points e g 29 4 2 1 mm yr at 90 0 km and 93 4 km indicated evident uneven settlement in the 1990 2010s these results showed that land subsidence from dingzhou to cangzhou began in the 1960s and continued its expansion acceleration and unevenness after the 1980s fig 9 shows the profile from shijiazhuang capital of hebei province through hengshui dezhou to jinan capital of shandong province with a nw se strike in the central ncp the terrain gradually decreased from nw to se with an average elevation of 38 m a subsidence zone with a width of about 100 km 130 230 km maximum of 18 1 3 6 mm yr at 192 km and average of 8 2 3 7 mm yr occurred around hengshui and dezhou in the 1960 1980s by the second period this subsidence zone quickly extended nw and se to 60 km and 270 km respectively an overall expansion of 110 km compared to the previous period in terms of magnitude the maximum sinking rate at 133 8 km reached 35 4 1 7 mm yr and the average doubled 15 7 1 5 mm yr in the last period the spatial pattern of the previous period generally continued while the subsidence rate significantly accelerated the average from 60 to 260 km increased by 10 8 mm yr to 26 5 1 3 mm yr and the maximum reached 47 1 1 3 mm yr overall the ground subsidence extent covered by this profile expanded and the subsidence rate accelerated fig 10 shows the profile from handan to yanzhou in the central ncp with a general nw se strike and an average altitude of 43 m there was slight ground subsidence near handan in the 1960 1980s with width maximum and average values of 40 km 10 50 km 15 9 2 1 mm yr and 9 2 3 0 mm yr by the 1980 1990s the subsidence range expanded eastward by 60 km to 110 km and the maximum value reached 47 2 1 1 mm yr at 25 2 km with an average value of 16 7 1 2 mm yr compared to the previous periods the 1990 2010s profile showed a nearly identical subsidence range but an accelerated subsidence the average value at 10 110 km increased by 13 8 mm yr to 30 5 1 4 mm yr similar to the dingzhou cangzhou and shijiazhuang jinan profiles the handan yanzhou profile also featured a pattern of spatial enlargement and rate acceleration 4 discussion 4 1 relation between the land subsidence and groundwater depletion figs 4 6 show that land subsidence funnels in the ncp are primarily distributed in the hrp bounded by taihang mountains yanshan mountains yellow river and bohai sea fig 11 a based on the characteristics of sedimentology hrp can be divided into piedmont plain alluvial fan plain flood plain and coastal plain from west to east wu et al 1996 the thickness of unconsolidated quaternary sediment consisting of pebble gravel sand silt and clay ranges from 200 m to 600 m in the hrp jin 1988 these loose sediments store considerable amounts of groundwater currently approximately 60 of water consumption in hrp comes from groundwater zhao et al 2019 and the numerical groundwater flow models cao et al 2013 zhang and li 2013 show that irrigation dominated groundwater extraction has led to continuous decline of the groundwater level since 1970s fig 11 b presents a long term shallow groundwater level variation during 1970 2008 cao et al 2013 and deep groundwater level variation during 1970 2003 fei et al 2009 zheng et al 2010 in the hrp the results show that the shallow groundwater funnels are concentrated in the piedmont plain and alluvial fan plain with a maximum drawdown of 60 m which was also confirmed by the situ observation well fei et al 2009 the deep groundwater funnels are distributed in the flood plain and coastal plain among which the groundwater level declined 70 m in tianjin cangzhou and dezhou guo et al 2017 to verify whether the groundwater consumption is the potential triggers of land subsidence we estimated the cumulative subsidence from 1960s to 2010s based on the results of the figs 4 6 as the blue contour line in fig 11 b the results show that settlement funnels 0 5 m are primarily located in baoding shijiazhuang handan tianjin cangzhou and dezhou with a total area of 35 000 km2 which shares a similar spatial distribution characteristic with the groundwater depression cone specifically the subsidence funnels in beijing baoding shijiazhuang and handan in the piedmont plain correspond to the falling funnels of shallow groundwater tianjin and cangzhou in the central and coastal plain correspond to the falling funnels of deep groundwater for further confirmation of the coupling relationship between groundwater consumption and land subsidence we collected a groundwater level dataset of 47 situ wells in the hrp from zhao et al 2019 the starting observation time of these data is from 2003 to 2011 and the average time span is 8 6 years after eliminating abnormal jumps and outliers we calculated the linear rate of groundwater variation at 47 wells fig 11 c colored circle the results show that the groundwater level of 42 wells dropped with an average rate of 1 5 m yr in which 10 wells 2 0 m yr in terms of spatial distribution the falling rate of wells inside the hrp is significantly greater than that in the peripheral area which shows a similar spatial feature to the vertical land motion captured by the repeat leveling to quantify the spatial consistency the fit lines between groundwater level variation rate and land subsidence rate estimated by spatial interpolation at the 47 wells show their correlation coefficient is 0 83 fig 11 d in addition a vertical displacement time series recorded by cgnss station which is 300 m from the cx well and marked by red rectangle in fig 11 c by red rectangle is shown in fig 11 e the displacement and groundwater level depth show a high consistency i e correlation coefficient is 0 98 in general as shown in fig 11 b e the land subsidence and groundwater fall funnel show a high spatial and temporal consistency indicating that groundwater depletion large possibly triggered the land subsidence 4 2 other driving factors of land subsidence in fact the mechanism of land subsidence in some regions such as tianjin and canghou is complex apart from the groundwater depletion guo et al 2015 suggests that land subsidence is also related to the thickness and compressibility of the clay in the aquifer system as shown in fig 12 both the subsidence rates profiles from dinghzou to cangzhou in 1980 1990s and 1990 2010s shows a roughly consistent trend with the thickness of quaternary clay besides the compaction of aquifers the tectonic loading is also responsible for the vertical displacement of land surface liu et al 2018 reports that the vertical tectonic movement rates estimated from the bedrock located cgnss in the ncp range from 0 69 to 1 5 mm yr similarly the bedrock point in the subsidence cone of tianjin fig 7 in this study with a base buried in intact cambrian dolomites at a depth of 1 070 m from the surface shows an uplift rate about 1 4 mm yr these researches show the influence of the present tectonic loading on the vertical movement is much smaller than the compaction of aquifers driven by groundwater depletion in addition active faults would control the spatial development of land subsidence for example the spatial development of subsidence in the beijing plain was affected by the nw se striking nankou sunhe fault guo et al 2020 other factors such as drought caused by reduced rainfall complex land use types and increased loads caused by infrastructure construction accelerated the process of land subsidence gong et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 zhou et al 2020 5 conclusions by collecting and collating precise leveling data since 1952 and combining them with a small amount of cgnss data the long term spatiotemporal evolution patterns of land subsidence in the ncp are investigated with an unprecedented scope the results indicate that the extent of ncp subsidence increased significantly during the 1960 2010s subsidence regions during the 1960 1980s were mainly concentrated in tianjin and cangzhou in the central and eastern plains by the 1990 2010s these areas gradually extended westward northward and southward to the east foot of the taihang mountains south foot of the yanshan mountains and shandong hills respectively meanwhile areas with a settlement rate 20 mm yr expanded by 5 7 times the descending rate in the ncp showed an uneven acceleration the average value of benchmarks with a sinking rate 5 mm yr changed from 12 2 mm yr during the first period to 26 5 mm yr during the last period meanwhile through acceleration expansion and merging the discrete subsidence funnels found during the 1960 1980s and 1980 1990s evolved into a large settlement funnel during the 1990 2010s in contrast the land subsidence rates in tianjin slowed down benefiting from strict groundwater managements implemented in 1986 including replenishing groundwater and limiting extraction the velocity profile results show that the average ground subsidence rate slowed from 58 2 mm yr in the first period to 33 6 mm yr in the last period moreover the vertical velocity of the shandong peninsula yanshan mountains taihang mountains and other areas remained stable during the three periods with values approximately between 1 and 3 mm yr in general the groundwater depletion is the primary factor of the land subsidence in the ncp nowadays the land subsidence of the ncp is still very serious and far from comprehensive mitigation although some local areas such as tianjin have made significant progress in order to effectively mitigate land subsidence in the future it is essential to integrate multiple technologies to acquire high precision high reliability and high spatial resolution subsidence information furthermore we should develop insights into the driving mechanisms and causes of settlement and act appropriately to the local situation moreover special attention should be paid to the fact that the unequal spatial settlement reflected by vertical movement profiles in this paper may result in the distortion and deformation of large buildings bridges railways and underground pipe networks 6 data availability the vertical movement results in the north china plain during the 1960 1980s 1980 1990s
