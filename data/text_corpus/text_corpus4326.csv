21630,in order to obtain a larger viv response and harvest energy more efficiently in wider flow velocity ranges in long distance transport pipelines the effects of the elastic modulus of material mass ratio and cross sectional shapes circular cylinder squa cir prism cir squa prism of flow around structure on the viv performance are numerically investigated in this paper urans equations with k ω sst turbulence model are employed to calculate the two dimensional flow field with reynolds number ranging from 2000 to 50000 and newmark β method is adopted to capture the one degree of freedom motion of the system the numerical results show that the elastic modulus of material and mass ratio are two important factors affecting the natural frequency of the system which is closely related to the vibration response of system the range of synchronization increases with an increase in elastic modulus and the onset of synchronization is more gradual for systems with higher natural frequency and the maximum amplitude ratio and the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region all increase with the decrease of mass ratio moreover the bluff body with squa cir cross section shows highest amplitude response of 1 16d due to its forward vortex shedding position indicating the direction for the design of the cross sectional shapes of bluff body in the pipeline for viv energy harvesting thereby it can be concluded that the natural frequency of system and vortex shedding position caused by the cross sectional shapes are important factors affecting the viv

liquified natural gas over long distances are in long term service throughout the country since the pipelines suffered from corrosion and man made drilling oil stolen and led to frequent oil leakage which not only seriously disturbed the normal oil production and caused huge economics losses but also resulted in environmental pollution as well as caused fire explosion and so on the solution to reduce or avoid the above mentioned problems is to install sensors along the pipeline to achieve pipeline divulging examination and pinpointing and the technical key to achieve the above mentioned solution is to solve the problem of power supply for related sensors installed along the pipelines currently these sensors can be powered by batteries solar panels small scale wind turbines and hydraulic turbines however these power supply methods have their disadvantages such as the batteries need to be replaced frequently due to limited capacity solar power and wind power are subjected to weather conditions and easily stolen due to externally installation hydraulic turbine power generator has short life and high maintenance costs due to the internal moving parts like impellers therefore a new power generation method is urgently needed to meet the long term and uninterrupted power supply demands for these sensors along the pipelines wang et al 2012 sun et al 2019a some scholars have proposed a novel concept of generating electricity converting vibrations caused by wind or water in the environment into electrical energy thereby powering these low power electronics such as sensors li et al 2016a sun et al 2019a this type of vibration caused by wind or water in the environment is often called flow induced vibration based on the principle of flow induced vibration we proposed a self generating device a flow around structure with built in power generation module is vertically installed in the pipeline and a small part of kinetic energy of the fluid is captured by the flow around structure which is then converted into electrical energy by the built in power generation module to power the low power sensors along the pipeline the power generation module can be flexible piezoelectric membrane or combination of electromagnetic and coils orrego et al 2017 naseer et al 2017 franzini and bunzel 2018 the proposed self generating device has the following advantages a maintenance free and long life due to no moving parts b guard against theft due to its high integration and internal installation c it is sufficient to uninterruptedly power low power electronics such as monitoring sensors along the pipelines in spite of its limited power generation efficiency zhang et al 2017a vortex induced vibration viv is one of the main forms of flow induced vibrations sun et al 2019a when a bluff body is placed in a uniform directional fluid flow the bluff body will alternately produce vortex shedding which in turn causes periodically pulsation on the bluff body for both in line direction and cross flow direction if the bluff body is flexible or elastically supported which is allowed to undergo elastic deformation the pulsating force will result in periodic vibration to the bluff body this regular vibration will in turn change the pattern of the wake vortex this problem of describing the interaction of fluid and structure is called vortex induced vibration viv cicolin and assi 2017 in recent years viv has been widely investigated due to its prevalence in engineering applications such as marine risers with various types bridge piers bridges towering buildings and so on zhu et al 2016 kang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 in terms of different angles the occurrence of viv phenomena has advantages and disadvantages at present the research objectives are divided into two categories suppression of viv to prevent structural damage and enhancement of viv to achieve energy harvesting the resonance phenomenon of vortex induced vibration easily leads to serious instability and fatigue damage of many engineering structures the most common are marine and coastal applications such as bridge piers deep sea flexible structures submarine transport pipelines and cable structures in terms of aerodynamics such as towering buildings chimneys bridges aerial cables heat exchangers and blades of aero engine zheng et al 2019 chen et al 2019 zhu et al 2017a si et al 2019 therefore researchers attach great importance to the viv suppression in order to reduce or even avoid damage to these engineering structures for the suppression of vortex induced vibration the method adopted by most scholars is to change the cross sectional shape of the flow around structure or to attach some additional equipment on the outer surface of the existing structures whose cross sectional shapes are difficult to directly change thereby destroying the boundary layer and changing the near wake flow field as well as disturbing the regular vortex shedding so as to successfully suppress the vortex induced vibration their research methods include experimental research and numerical simulation research cicolin and assi 2017 proposed a novel suppressor called vt and experimentally investigated the viv response of vt as well as other three conventional suppressors their experimental results show that these suppressors all have a suppression effect and the vt suppressor has the most significant suppression effect which suppressed the peak amplitude of vibration down to 40 of that of a bare cylinder huera huarte 2017 experimentally investigated the effectiveness of wire meshes in viv suppression in their experiment in order to analysis the physical mechanism that caused the attenuation of viv a series of square wire meshes with different densities and sizes were attached on the surface of cylinder and compared their viv responses their experimental results indicate that a complete viv suppression with a suppression effect of more than 95 occurs at the reduced velocities up to more than 13 they also stated that most of the meshes generally can attenuate partially viv without increasing drag forces jiménez gonzález and huera huarte 2018 conducted an experiment to study the vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder with pairs of control rods of varying size located in its wake their experimental results show that the viv response is almost completely suppressed up to 90 when the diameter of the control rods is 0 4 times the diameter of the circular cylinder and the lift coefficient generally decreases significantly and the phase difference between transverse force and cylinder displacement alters substantially due to the placement of control rod pairs in the near wake cagney and balabani 2019 experimentally investigated the role of the separation point in viv suppression adopting a series of cylinders with different cross sectional shapes including circular with no fixed separation points equilateral triangles with fixed separation points and elliptical cylinders with adjustable major to minor axis ratios in their experiment the modification of the separation point was easily influenced the viv response and a moderately elliptical cylinder could completely achieve viv suppression jaiman et al 2016 came up with a partitioned iterative and a dynamic subgrid scale scheme to simulate flow induced vibration of freely vibrating structures in a turbulent flow by large eddy simulation solver they designed a new device termed as connected c and numerically investigated the wake stabilization mechanism for the viv suppression their results concluded that the proposed connected c device has a viv suppression performance due to the mechanism of shear layer reattachment law and jaiman 2017 they also introduced a novel staggered groove configuration and numerically investigate the effect of the width and depth of surface spanwise grooves on the viv suppression their results indicated that the staggered groove configuration is effective in viv suppression which has a potential application to deep water marine risers and tall structures in wind environment law and jaiman 2018 wang et al 2019 numerically investigated the effect of height ratio of triangle groove strips tgs on viv suppression of marine riser and they concluded that as the increase of the height ratio of tgs the viv suppression of tgs performs improved firstly but then weakened and the height ratio of 0 04 shows the best viv suppression effect nikoo et al 2018 proposed a structure tuned mass damper tmd system which is modified on the basis of conventional pipe in pipe pip system by connecting springs and dashpots between the inner and outer pipes their numerical results indicated that the optimized pip system can suppress viv noticeably the above mentioned passive control method for boundary layer by altering the surface configuration or installing additional devices around the cylinder can effectively achieve viv suppression however for some structures that are difficult to change their cross sectional shape such as bridges buildings etc other control methods are needed to adopt to achieve viv response therefore some active control methods that re quire the introduction of external energy such as free rotation the introduction of jets and electromagnetic forcing have also attracted researchers attention chen et al 2019 conducted an experiment to study the effect of a self issuing jet which is installed on a bridge deck on viv suppression their experimental results show that the self issuing jet plays an important role in viv suppression the vertical viv is completely suppressed and the torsional viv is reduced by 45 5 zheng et al 2019 experimentally investigated wind induced response and viv resonance mechanism of a mega tall building to provide guidance for wind resistance design of flexible structures wang et al 2016 presented a numerical study to adopt a pair of synthetic jets sj to control the viv of circular cylinder and their results show that the viv response is successfully suppressed by using the sj control zhang et al 2017b numerically investigated the mechanism of lorentz force on viv suppression in a uniform flow their results show that with the application of symmetrical lorentz force the vortex shedding weakens resulting in the viv suppression it is worth mentioning that there are researchers conducting viv studies on marine risers with the goal of simultaneously achieving viv suppression and high energy harvesting they not only installed additional devices with different cross sectional shapes around marine risers to control the separation of the boundary layer but also drove the free rotation of the attached devices to disturb the flow field around marine risers thereby changing the near wake and achieving viv suppression at the same time the free rotation of the attached devices can extract energy from the surrounding fluid like a water turbine therefore the free rotation of the attached device is driven by the extracted energy from the surrounding fluid and no consumption of external energy is required for its rotation and the viv suppression and energy harvesting are simultaneously achieved zhu et al 2016 numerically investigated the viv responses of a circular cylinder attached by a free to rotate dartlike overlay by using the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stroke urans equations and the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model coupled with a fourth order rung kutta method their results show that the studied cylinder attached by a free to rotate dartlike overlay has a limited suppression of viv and its vibration response is enhanced at larger reynolds numbers which benefits to use in power generation equipment for energy harvesting the viv response of a circular cylinder with a free to rotate triangle fairing was also investigated by this group zhu et al 2017b they concluded that the triangle fairing has a positive role in viv suppression at a stable state however the 70 triangular fairing can be used to viv energy harvesting due to its more vigorous vibration zhu and gao 2017 numerically investigated viv response of a riser attached by a free to rotate impeller and their results indicate that the lock in phenomenon shifts to a larger incoming flow rate due to the rotation of impeller viv suppression and high energy harvesting are simultaneously achieved with the reduced velocity larger than 9 85 zhu et al 2018a proposed a new device consisting of an elastically mounted circular cylinder and a free to rotate pentagram impeller for energy harvesting they concluded that the power generating capacity is sensitive to flow velocity and damping ratio and the average power efficiency is about 22 6 they also investigated the viv responses of free to rotate elliptic cylinder at different torsional frictions their results show that the viv response of rotatable cylinder is more vigorous comparing to the non rotatable elliptic cylinder zhu et al 2018b zhu et al 2019 proposed a novel energy harvester via installing bach type turbine on offshore cylindrical structures which can suppress viv response as well as achieve energy harvesting in their investigation the maximum power coefficient reaches 0 34 and the major contribution of energy conversion is from the rotation in addition a small number of scholars have studied the effects of special boundary conditions such as oscillating flow and restricted side wall on the suppression of vortex induced vibration ren et al 2019 experimentally studied the viv suppression effect of a flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes in an oscillatory flow and they concluded that the suppression efficiency is not as ideal in oscillatory flow as that in steady flow li et al 2016b numerically studied wall proximity effects on the vortex induced vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder their results show that the transvers vibration response of near wall cylinder is similar to that of the isolated cylinder which means that the existence of the wall does not significantly influence the cross flow vibration and the vibrating near wall cylinder exhibits larger streamwise oscillation and smaller streamwise vibration frequency as compared to the isolated cylinder chung 2016 numerically investigated the effect of froude number on vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder which is horizontally placed near a free surface at low reynolds number and they concluded that the viv is enhanced near the free surface at a lower froude number while the viv is suppressed near the free surface at a higher froude number another type of application about vortex induced vibration is to achieve energy harvesting through the resonance of viv which is aimed at strengthening viv responses this application technology is called vortex induced vibration for aquatic clean energy vivace zhu et al 2016 which harvests energy from both hydraulic such as ocean river and wind for power generation technology sun et al 2019a li et al 2016a and enhancement of heat transfer sun et al 2019b the experimental and numerical researches on energy harvesting using viv are also being carried out in full swing modir et al 2016 experimentally investigated the effect of mass ratio on viv response of a flexibly mounted circular cylinder their results show that the peak amplitude of oscillation increases with decrease of mass ratio and the range of synchronization increases by reducing the mass ratio with constant mass damping parameters modir and goudarzi 2019 experimentally studied the effect of natural frequency with five different springs by measuring the transverse response of viv about an elastically mounted circular cylinder in a water channel their experimental results show that an adjustable natural frequency system has an optimum energy harvesting in viv based ocean river energy converters orrego et al 2017 experimentally investigated wind energy harvesting by self sustained oscillations of a flexible piezoelectric membrane fixed in an inverted flag and conducted parametric studies to evaluate the influence of geometrical parameters of the flag on the flapping behavior and the resulting energy output their experimental results show that a peak electrical power of 5 0 mw cm3 occurred at a wind velocity of 9 m s and a sustainable power generation of 0 4 mw cm3 even in low wind speed regimes of 3 5 m s and they also concluded that their devices can harvest ambient wind energy to power a temperature sensor without employing a battery for energy storage zhang et al 2017a numerically investigated the viv energy harvesting of two bluff bodies in tandem arrangement with five different cross sections such as triangular prism square prism pentagon prism circular cylinder and cir tria prism in the spacing range of 2 50 diameters they concluded the cir tria prism has a better performance on energy harvesting with the maximum amplitude ratio of 1 17d which leads to maximum energy conversion of 26 5 additionally their simulation results also indicated that the viv response of the upstream cylinder will be suppressed with spacing less than 5 diameters and the motion of the downstream cylinder is largely affected by the upstream cylinder due to the wake effects with spacing less than 35 diameters zhang et al 2018 numerically investigated the best performance for the viv energy harvesting by arranging four staggered cylinders reasonably at in flow spacing varies from 1 2d to 10 0d and transverse spacing ranges from 2 0d to 8 0d their results indicate that the viv response performs the most vigorously with in flow spacing of 2 0d and transverse spacing of 4 0d obtaining the highest converted power ratio of 3 9 naseer et al 2017 proposed a concept of harvesting energy from viv by introducing nonlinear attractive magnetic forces and numerically investigated the influence of magnetic force on the synchronization region and levels of the harvested power the impacts of the spacing distance between two magnets on the natural frequency and damping ratio of the energy harvester in the monostable configuration are studied and their results show that changing the spacing distance lead to a variation of the natural frequency and results in a shift of the lock in region which is significant for low wind speed energy harvesting and according to the available ambient wind speed the spacing distance and load resistance can be adjusted for efficient and broadband energy harvesting from viv chizfahm et al 2018 numerically investigated the dynamic modeling of four configurations of viv of a bladeless wind turbine bwt and their results indicate that the conic bwts exhibit a better power performance at higher wind speeds while the right circular bwts show a better power performance at lower wind speeds franzini and bunzel 2018 numerically studied the viv of a rigid cylinder mounted on elastic supports fitted with piezoelectric harvesters their results show that the simultaneous presence of streamwise and transverse oscillations lead to a significant increase of the maximum energy harvesting efficiency and the energy harvesting efficiency can increase up to 50 for a certain reduced velocity through the research and analysis of the above literatures it can be found that whether the research purpose is the suppression or enhancement for viv the background of these researches is mostly offshore engineering or ambient wind energy harvesting there are very few investigations involve the energy harvesting by enhancing the viv from directional flow of long distance transport pipelines most researchers are studying the viv of existing engineering structures such as marine risers bridges and building whose cross sectional shape and natural frequency are fixed in this case it is only possible to control the separation of the boundary layer and alter the near wake flow field by installing additional devices around existing structures or adopting active control method such as introducing rotation jets and electromagnetic force thereby altering the vortex shedding frequency to achieve the suppression or enhancement of viv however in this paper the proposed self generating device integrated in the long distance transport pipelines involves the design of flow around structure which is flexible or elastically mounted including the design of the cross sectional shape and the natural frequency to cater to the various flow velocity ranges of the pipeline and make it more widely used for energy harvesting of pipelines with various flow velocity ranges in addition due to the different engineering application backgrounds the self generating device proposed in this paper is vertically installed in the pipeline one end of which is fixed and the other end is free this structure is not exactly the same as the structure elastically supported at both ends which is studied by most researchers finally it is worth emphasizing that the self generating device proposed in this paper only supplies low power equipment such as monitoring sensors which are sporadically installed along the pipelines although its energy conversion efficiency is not high it is also sufficient to power such sensors uninterruptedly moreover due to the low power supply demand the size of the self generating device can be designed to be small so it has a small impact on the fluid flow in the long distance transport pipelines and the loss of hydrokinetic energy is minimal in order to match the appropriate flow around structures to obtain a larger viv response and harvest energy more efficiently in wider flow velocity ranges in pipelines a two dimensional 2d numerical investigation is conducted in this paper to study the dimensionless transverse vibration amplitude and frequency of the flexible flow around bluff bodies with different elastic modulus and different mass ratios which lead to different natural frequencies and structural stiffness moreover the transverse amplitude response and frequency of bluff bodies with different cross sectional shapes are also numerically studied the study can provide a certain reference for the design of flow around structures including the recommendation of cross sectional shapes of the flow around bluff bodies and the selection of the range of natural frequency at the studied range of reynolds number 2 computational model and method 2 1 description of the problem the self generating device proposed in this paper is a flow around cylindrical structure from the appearance which can be a flexible cylindrical structure or a rigid cylindrical structure elastically supported at its one end and then a power generation module which can be flexible piezoelectric membrane or combination of electromagnetic and coils is integrated inside the cylindrical structure the processes of energy harvesting and conversion in the directional flow pipelines of the proposed self generating device are as follows the flow around cylindrical structure which is flexible or elastically supported is vertically installed in the pipeline one end of which is fixed on the pipeline and the other end is free and then due to the hydrodynamic force acting on the flow around cylindrical structure it vibrates periodically in a direction perpendicular to the flow direction resulting in the beat of internal flexible piezoelectric membrane or the relative movements between the internal electromagnetic and coils these series of processes complete the harvest and conversion of fluid kinetic energy to vibrational mechanical energy and then electrical energy the schematic diagram of self generating device vertically installed in the pipelines and self generating device with built in power generation module are respectively shown in fig 1 and fig 2 in this paper the numerical investigation is only conducted to harvest energy from fluid kinetic energy and convert into vibrational mechanical energy by the flexible flow around cylindrical structure based on the enhancement of viv and does not involve the energy conversion of the power generation module fig 3 shows the three dimensional 3d physical model of flexible flow around cylindrical structure based on enhancement of viv as we can see the size of the flow around cylindrical structure is sufficiently small compared to the fluid domain so the loss of hydrokinetic energy in the pipeline is minimal in order to enable the proposed self generating device to obtain more energy from the directional fluid the factors that affect the viv response and how to enhance viv are numerically investigated in this paper so as to point the direction for the design of the self generating device used in pipelines since the numerical study of the above mentioned three dimensional physical model is more difficult it requires more computing resources and at the same time it encounters many problems that cannot be solved immediately therefore at present this 3d numerical study is simplified to 2d numerical investigation the viv response with one degree of freedom 1 dof of the 3d flexible flow around cylindrical structure is simplified to its tip viv response with 1 dof the tip of the 3d flexible flow around cylindrical structure is modeled by a mass spring damper system the determination of its vibration parameters for the simulation is as follows firstly determine the geometric parameters of the 3d flow around cylindrical structure including diameter d and height h as well as cross sectional shape so its volume can be calculated then import the geometric model into the modal analysis module in ansys workbench software to calculate its natural frequency of y direction under different mass ratios and different elastic modulus which can be set at the modal analysis module the mass of the 3d flow around cylindrical structure per unit length m can be calculated from its geometric parameters mass ratio m and the density of the fluid ρ so the spring stiffness of the simplified 2d mass spring damper system can be calculated by k m 2πf n 2 it can be known from the above equation that the spring stiffness of the 2d mass spring damper system k is affected by the mass of the flow around cylindrical structure per unit length m and the natural frequency of the 2d mass spring damper system f n because different mass ratio of the flow around structure leads to different mass of the flow around cylindrical structure per unit length and simultaneously affect the natural frequency of the system thereby result in different spring stiffness of the system in addition the elastic modulus 3d flexible flow around cylindrical structure of can be set at the modal analysis module and through modal analysis it can be found that different elastic modulus of the structure leads to different natural frequency when the other parameters are fixed therefore according to formula k m 2πf n 2 the corresponding spring stiffness of the simplified 2d mass spring damper system also changes with the natural frequency fig 4 shows a result of modal analysis under one of the simulation conditions since the 3d flow around cylindrical structures of different heights will cause different natural frequencies when other parameters are kept the same the heights of the 3d flow around cylindrical structures are all maintained at 0 09 m in this paper although the simplified 2d numerical results are not accurately enough to reflect the viv response of the 3d flow around cylindrical structure to some degree it also can reflect the variation trend of the viv response of the flow around cylindrical structure with the mass ratio elastic modulus and cross sectional shape 2 2 simulation setup in order to reduce the number of calculated grids and to avoid calculation errors of dynamic grids a circular computational domain is used in this study as depicted in fig 5 a circular region with a diameter of 40d is defined as the computational domain the upstream boundary and the downstream boundary are respectively 20d away from the center of the cylinder the original point the upstream boundary is imposed with a velocity inlet boundary condition specified as u u and v 0 where u and v are the velocity components in x and y directions respectively and a pressure outlet boundary condition with gauge pressure of 0 pa is assigned in the downstream boundary the symmetry boundary conditions are imposed to the other two boundaries of the circular computational domain additionally the no slip wall condition is assigned on the surface of the circular cylinder as shown in fig 5 the circular cylinder with a diameter d of 0 01 m is elastically mounted the motion of the system is modeled by a mass spring damper system with 1 dof the natural frequency f n and spring stiffness k of the system vary with the elastic modulus e and the mass ratio m 4m ρπd 2 of the flexible bluff bodies the natural frequency of y direction can be obtained by modal analysis of ansys workbench software and the spring stiffness can be calculated by k m 2πf n 2 the simulation parameters are listed in table 1 in order to show the complete influencing regularity of the relevant parameters the studied reynolds numbers re ranges from 2000 to 50000 so as to reflect the whole synchronization region of viv under different influencing factors to capture the vibration response of the system the whole computational domain is divided into two zones an accompany moving zone with a diameter of 7d around the cylinder follows the translational motion of the cylinder the rest of the computational domain around the accompany moving zone is defined as the dynamic zone in which the grids deform and perform any needed adaptation depending on the translational motion of the accompany moving zone in addition three kinds of cross sections are adopted for the viv bluff bodies including the circular cylinder squa cir prism and cir squa prism fig 6 d represents the diameter both in x direction and y direction of the bluff bodies 2 3 governing equations and numerical method for an unsteady two dimensional viscous incompressible flow over a bluff body the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stroke urans equations can describe the flow properties and are expressed as follows zhu et al 2016

paper the fluid flow is numerically simulated by using 2d urans equations accompanied with the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model zhang et al 2017a 2018 which presents a perfect performance in modeling flows with adverse pressure gradients and vortex shedding modes the turbulence model contains the kinetic energy k t and its specific dissipation rate ω transport equations are expressed as follows zhu et al 2016 2017b 2018a 2018b 2019 zhu and gao 2017 4 ρ k t t ρ k t u i x i x j μ μ t σ k k t x j p k β ρ ω k t 5 ρ ω t ρ ω u i x i x j μ μ t σ ω ω x j p ω β ρ ω 2 2 ρ 1 f 1 ω

rate and the rate of the production of turbulent kinetic energy due to the average velocity gradient are respectively expressed by eq 6 and eq 7 p ω is the rate of the production of specific turbulent dissipation rate s ij is the mean rate of deformation components and σ k σ ω β and γ are model coefficients the vibration amplitude of the bluff body is triggered by the fluctuating hydrodynamic forces acting on the system as a mass spring damping system the motion of the bluff body in the y direction is modeled by a second order linear equation the equation of one degree of freedom 1 dof motion can be presented as zhu et al 2016 2017b 2018a 2018b 2019 zhu and gao 2017 10 m y c y k y f l t in which 11 k m 2 π f n 2 12 c 2 ζ m k where f l t is the lift forces ÿ y and y represent the acceleration velocity and displacement associated with the transverse motion simulations are performed by using cfd software fluent in order to realize the dynamic mesh in fluent user defined functions udf are written by using the c programming language to solve the response of the viv system in the udf classical newmark β method is embedded to solve the mass spring damper system zhang et al 2017a chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 newmark β is a method of numerical integration used to solve differential equations which is widely used in numerical evaluation of the dynamic response of structures such as in finite element analysis to model dynamic systems using the extended mean value theorem newmark β method states that the first time derivative can be solved as zhang et al 2017a 2018 13 y t δ t y t 1 γ y t γ y t δ t δ t however due to the acceleration also varies with time in order to obtain the correct displacement the extended mean value theorem must also be extended to the second time derivative which is expressed as 14 y t δ t y t y t δ t 1 2 β y t β y t δ t δ t 2 according to eq 13 and eq 14 ÿ t δt and y t δt can be expressed as 15 y t δ t 1 β δ t 2 y t δ t y t 1 β δ

method are 0 5 and 0 25 respectively in this simulation at each time step the lift forces are firstly obtained by solving the urans equations with the k ω sst turbulence model then the newmark β method is employed to solve the structure motion equations to obtain the next state change according to the current state and output the translational velocity and displacement of the system next the velocity of the system is used to impose the no slip wall condition and the displacement of the system is used to place it as its new position to update the mesh zhang et al 2017a the simple algorithm is used to calculate the coupling between the pressure and velocity fields nikoo et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 2018a 2018b 2019 zhu and gao 2017 the first order implicit scheme in the time domain and the second order upwind scheme in the spatial domain are adopted in simulations due to their stability and veracity zhu and gao 2017 in this paper the time step varies with flow velocity u to ensure the maximum courant number is set to uδt d 0 05 which meets the requirement of courant number being smaller than 1 the convergent criteria for all simulations are set as that residual in the control volume for each parameter is small than 1e 5 2 4 computational mesh the computational mesh used for the simulation of flow past a bluff body is displayed in fig 7 the dynamic zone and accompany moving zone are all tessellated with different sizes of grids in this study the whole circular computational domain generates structured grids all of which are meshed with quadrilateral cells the closer to the bluff body the denser the grid is in order to increase the accuracy in resolving the boundary layer flow the minimum mesh size adjoining the cylinder surface in the radial direction is set to be 0 0003d and the growth factor is 1 13 the size of the first layer is determined by the y plus y of 1 which is expressed as zhu and gao 2017 wang et al 2019 21 y 0 172 δ y d re 0 9 where δy is the height of the first layer mesh for the largest reynolds number of 50000 δy is 0 0003d by calculation in the case of y 1 for other reynolds number y is smaller than 1 in addition the 2d computational grids for all cross sections are generated as shown in fig 8 a suitable mesh is obtained by repeating the computations until a satisfactory independent grid is found the relationship between the dimensionless amplitude response a d and grid number is investigated under the same case as shown in fig 9 taking the working condition of u 1 5 m s and the spring stiffness of the structure with cross sectional shape of circular cylinder k 5212 n m as an example six group of mesh are generated it can be seen from fig 9 that the amplitude responses calculated by the first two sets of relatively sparser mesh and the latter four sets of relatively denser mesh are significantly different and the maximum deviation of amplitude responses is 11 03 which occurs between the second set of mesh the grid number is 16576 and the third set of mesh the grid number is 22464 while the amplitude responses calculated by the latter four sets of relatively denser mesh are very close with a maximum deviation of only 0 4 the results show that the amplitude responses calculated by the latter four sets of relatively denser mesh tend to be stable and consistent however since the first two sets of mesh are relatively sparse the calculated amplitude responses are not accurate enough in order to simultaneously ensure the accuracy of the calculation results and save the calculation resources and time as much as possible the third set of mesh with grid number 22464 can give a good compromise between precision and calculation time and is sufficient for carrying out numerical simulation in present work since the transient cfd method is applied in this paper time step independence validation has been conducted adopting the third set of mesh and the above mentioned modeling parameters the time step independence validation is conducted using different time steps ranging from 1e 3 s step to 5e 5 s step as shown in table 2 it can be seen from table 2 the same frequency response can be obtained with time steps of 1e 4 and 5e 5 and the deviation of corresponding amplitude response is about 1 5 accordingly taking the calculation efficiency into consideration time step of 1e 4 is selected in this paper 2 5 model validation the numerical method used in this study has been validated against the experimental results of 1 dof viv of a bare circular cylinder in uniform channel flow by modir et al 2016 all the parameters in simulations including diameter of circular cylinder d mass ratio m damping ratio ζ spring stiffness of the structure k and natural frequency of the structure f n and re are the same as that model of modir et al 2016 d 0 06 m m 2 26 ζ 0 053 k 570 n m f n 2 03 hz and the range of re is from 20000 to 64000 the corresponding velocity in x direction u 0 47 1 43 m s the comparison of the viv response of the bare cylinder versus re between the numerical results and the experimental data is shown in fig 10 as we can see from the perspective of the entire reynolds number range the numerical results show a similar trend as well as a similar magnitude in the synchronization region the maximum deviation of the amplitude ratio with experiment and simulation is about 15 95 however in the initial branch and desynchronization region there is only a similar trend between the experimental results and the simulated results of the amplitude ratio and there is an obvious gap in the values we analyze that the reasons for the obvious gap between the experimental results and the simulation results in the initial branch and the desynchronization region are mainly reflected in the following three points a the experiment from modir et al 2016 is a three dimensional flow regime however the numerical simulation in this paper is limited to two dimensional research the effect of gravity is ignored in the two dimensional research in addition the velocity distribution in the experiment may not be an ideal uniform flow but in the numerical simulation the inlet velocity is set to a uniform flow along the channel direction and the velocity loss near wall caused by the viscosity of the fluid is also ignored b the specific data of some parameters used in the numerical simulation are not directly given in the experiment from modir et al 2016 including the inlet velocity density and viscosity of water these parameters values are calculated based on the provided data such as reynolds number geometry size of cylinder and mass ratio and may not be exactly the same as their experimental environment c there are certain measurement errors about the mass of system the natural frequency and damping ratio of the system and amplitude results during the experiment from modir et al 2016 but we can t quantify the measurement errors in their experiment due to the lack of error analysis in the literature published by modir et al 2016 these above three viewpoints are the possible reasons that we speculated may cause gap between the experiment results and simulation results in the initial branch and the desynchronization region however we think that experimental results with reynolds number have the same changing tendency as the numerical results especially in the synchronization region which indicates that the numerical results can reflect the relationship between the amplitude ratio and the reynolds number to a certain extent therefore we think that the numerical simulation method used in this paper is feasible and acceptable 3 results and discussion 3 1 vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of circular cylinders with different elastic modulus the vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of circular cylinders with different elastic modulus are investigated with mass ratio of 3 and damping ratio of 0 003 the natural frequencies in y direction of the circular cylinder of d 0 01 m with elastic modulus of 6e6 pa 2e7 pa and 4e7 pa are calculated by modal analysis to be 7 7118 hz 14 08 hz and 19 912 hz respectively fig 11 shows the amplitude ratios a d of circular cylinders versus reynolds number for different elastic modulus cases it can be seen from fig 11 that the difference in elastic modulus causes the natural frequencies of the system to be different so that the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region is different the natural frequency of the system increases as the elastic modulus of material increases as we can see the range of synchronization increases with an increase in elastic modulus and the onset of synchronization is more gradual for systems with higher natural frequency as shown in fig 11 in the case of elastic modulus e 6e6 pa the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region is in the range of 3000 7000 but when the reynolds number is more than 7000 the vibration exhibits de synchronization phenomenon thereby obtaining lower amplitude responses in the case of elastic modulus e 2e7 pa the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 6000 to 14000 then reaches the de synchronization region when reynolds number reaches 15000 in the case of elastic modulus e 4e7 pa the initial reynolds number of the synchronization region is 8000 and the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 8000 to 20000 then reaches the de synchronization region the results show that at the case of smaller elastic modulus it is easy to obtain a larger amplitude in the lower speed region while the amplitude is lower in the higher speed region and the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region is also limited however the higher amplitude exhibits in the higher speed region at the case of a larger elastic modulus and the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region is larger it can be concluded from the results that viv has a strong dependence on the natural frequency and the elastic modulus of material is one of the important factors affecting the natural frequency of the system for different ranges of fluid s flow velocities in the pipeline it is necessary to reasonably select materials with different elastic modulus to make the flow around structures to obtain the desired natural frequencies so as to realize the viv energy harvesting in the pipeline in addition in order to achieve energy harvesting over a wider range of reynolds number it is not recommended to select materials with a smaller elastic modulus fig 12 shows the frequency ratios the ratio of the oscillation frequency to the natural frequency fosc fn versus reynolds number for different elastic modulus cases as can be seen from fig 12 the frequency ratio increases with the increase of reynolds number at the lower reynolds number the frequency ratio is close to 1 in the synchronization region which means the oscillation frequency is close to the natural frequency leading to a larger amplitude response however the frequency ratio almost exceeds 2 which means that the oscillation frequency differs greatly from the natural frequency such as reynolds number is greater than 7000 at case of elastic modulus e 6e6 pa reynolds number is greater than 14000 at case of elastic modulus e 2e7 pa as well as reynolds number is greater than 20000 at case of elastic modulus e 4e7 pa the vibration reaches de synchronization region and the amplitude response drops sharply correspondingly the hydrodynamic forces acting on circular cylinders which result in the vibration responses also need to be displayed and analyzed the amplitude responses of the flow around circular cylinder in the y direction are result of the effect of the lift forces which change periodically since the 1 dof vortex induced vibrations are discussed in this paper the hydrodynamic forces analyzed in this paper only reflect lift forces acting on circular cylinders in the y direction generally the lift force needs to be dimensionless converted into lift coefficient for analysis the lift coefficient is expressed as 22 c l 2 f l ρ u 2 d the lift coefficients acting on circular cylinders with various elastic modulus versus reynolds number are shown in fig 13 these three sets of curves have similar trends it can be seen from fig 13 that a common feature appears in these three sets of lift coefficients curves that is the lift coefficient suddenly becomes very small at a certain reynolds number this is because a phase switch occurs between the curve of lift coefficient with time and the curve of amplitude ratio with time the phase difference switches from 0 to 180 as we can see in the case of elastic modulus e 6e6 pa the phase switch occurs at re 3000 in the case of elastic modulus e 2e7 pa the phase switch occurs at re 6000 in the case of elastic modulus e 4e7 pa the phase switch occurs at re 8000 by comparing figs 11 and 13 the reynolds number at which the phase switch occurs is exactly the initial reynolds number at which the amplitude response reaches the synchronization region which indicates that the starting point of the synchronization region corresponding to the amplitude response is closely related to the phase difference between the curve of lift coefficient with time and the curve of amplitude ratio with time the phase switch is also accompanied by the transition of wake patterns which will be mentioned later after that there will be a slight increase in the lift coefficient at very short reynolds number ranges re 3000 4000 at case of elastic modulus e 6e6 pa re 6000 7000 at case of elastic modulus e 2e7 pa re 8000 10000 at case of elastic modulus e 4e7 pa and then lift coefficient gradually decreases as reynolds number it is worth emphasizing that in the process of lift coefficient increasing briefly and then decreasing re 3000 7000 at case of elastic modulus e 6e6 pa re 6000 14000 at case of elastic modulus e 2e7 pa re 8000 20000 at case of elastic modulus e 4e7 pa which exactly corresponds to the synchronization region of the amplitude response in fig 7 it is accompanied by a transition of wake patterns again which will be mentioned later finally in the desynchronization region where the amplitude response is very small the lift coefficient increases slightly with reynolds number 3 2 vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of circular cylinders with different mass ratios the vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of circular cylinders with different mass ratios are investigated with elastic modulus of 2e7 pa and damping ratio of 0 003 the natural frequencies in y direction of circular cylinder of d 0 01 m with mass ratio of 0 8 1 5 and 3 are calculated by modal analysis to be 27 265 hz 19 912 hz and 14 08 hz respectively fig 14 shows the amplitude ratios a d of circular cylinders versus reynolds number for different mass ratios cases it can be seen from fig 14 that the variation of mass ratios causes the different natural frequencies of the system which results in the different ranges of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region of amplitude responses as we can see the maximum amplitude ratio and the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region all increase with the decrease of mass ratio as illustrated in fig 14 the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 6000 to 14000 under the case of mass ratio of 3 then the de synchronization phenomenon appears at reynolds number of 15000 where a lower amplitude response is obtained and the maximum amplitude ratio is 0 58 in the case of mass ratio of 3 in the case of mass ratio of 1 5 the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 7000 to 24000 and the maximum amplitude ratio reaches 0 63 in the case of mass ratio of 0 8 the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 8000 to 42000 and the maximum amplitude ratio reaches 0 78 the results indicate the strong dependence of viv on natural frequency and the mass ratio is also one of the important factors affecting the natural frequency of system at a lower mass ratio it is easy to obtain a higher amplitude response and it can maintain a considerable amplitude response over a wider range of flow velocity which facilitates energy harvesting in pipelines fig 15 shows the frequency ratios versus reynolds number for different mass ratios cases it can be seen from fig 15 that the frequency ratio increases with the increase of reynolds number at the lower reynolds number as the mass ratio decreases the range of frequency ratio corresponding to the synchronization region becomes wider for example in the case of mass ratio of 0 8 the frequency ratio corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 0 8 to 1 5 fig 16 shows the lift coefficients acting on circular cylinders with various mass ratios versus reynolds number as shown in fig 16 the phenomenon of phase switch also occurs in these cases of different mass ratios but these reynolds numbers at which the phase switch occurs are slightly different under different mass ratios such as in the case of mass ratio of 3 the phase switch occurs at re 6000 in the case of mass ratio of 1 5 the phase switch occurs at re 8000 and in the case of mass ratio of 0 8 the phase switch occurs at re 11000 however by comparing figs 10 and 12 we find that in these cases of mass ratios of 0 8 and 1 5 the reynolds number at which the phase switch occurs does not coincide with the initial reynolds numbers of synchronization region as the mass ratio decreases the phase switch occurs later than the amplitude response reaches the synchronization region after that there will be a slight increase in the lift coefficient at very short reynolds number ranges re 6000 7000 at case of mass ratio of 3 re 8000 13000 at case of mass ratio of 1 5 re 11000 18000 at case of mass ratio of 0 8 then lift coefficient gradually decreases as reynolds number there is a transition of wake patterns during the process where the lift coefficient first increases and then decreases in addition the transition of the wake patterns for viv of circular cylinders also occurs in the process of studying the effects of elastic modulus and mass ratio on the amplitude response three typical wake patterns in this investigation are plotted in fig 17 take the mass ratio of 3 and elastic modulus of 2e7 pa as an example the wake vortex exhibits a single row 2s two vortices with little difference in intensity but opposite directions in each vibration cycle mode at lower reynolds number such as re 3981 where the obtained amplitude response is lower leading to a lower vorticity as shown in fig 17 a when the amplitude response reaches the synchronization region it will be accompanied by a transition of wake patterns that is as the amplitude response becomes larger the wake vortex changes from a single row 2s mode with a lower vorticity to a double row 2s mode as shown in fig 17 b in the synchronization region as mentioned before the lift coefficient first increases and then decreases this phenomenon is also accompanied by another transition of wake patterns that is the wake vortex evolves from a double row 2s mode to a single row 2s mode at which time causes a larger vorticity as shown in fig 17 c the results indicate that there is an important relationship between the wake patterns and amplitude response as well as lift coefficient 3 3 vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of bluff bodies with different cross sections the vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of bluff bodies with different cross sections are investigated with elastic modulus of 2e7 pa mass ratio of 3 and damping ratio of 0 003 the natural frequencies in y direction of bluff bodies of d 0 01 m with cross sectional shapes of circular cylinder squa cir prism and cir squa prism are calculated by modal analysis to be 14 08 hz 15 319 hz and 15 319 hz respectively the amplitude ratios a d of bluff bodies with different cross sections versus reynolds number are shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the amplitude response of bluff body with squa cir cross section increases with the increase of reynolds number and the bluff body with squa cir cross section shows more significant amplitude response after reynolds number is greater than 8000 and its maximum amplitude ratio reaches 1 16 within the range of the studied reynolds number the amplitude ratio of circular cylinder is in the synchronization region and the amplitude ratio fluctuates between 0 5 and 0 6 however the bluff body with cir squa cross section shows a most weak amplitude response under the same working conditions whose maximum amplitude ratio of 0 16 occurs at re 6000 and then decreases with the increase of reynolds number the corresponding frequency ratios for viv of bluff bodies with different cross sections versus reynolds number are shown in fig 19 as shown in fig 19 the frequency ratio of the bluff body with squa cir cross section increases from 0 4 to 0 7 as the reynolds number increases that is to say the bluff body with squa cir cross section in the case of frequency ratio close to 0 7 shows larger amplitude response than that of circular cylinder whose frequency ratio close to 1 indicating that the bluff body with squa cir cross section shows a better amplitude response under the same working conditions which facilitates the viv energy harvesting however the frequency ratio of the bluff body with cir squa cross section increases from 0 96 to 2 13 with the increase of reynolds number that is the oscillation frequency is getting farther away from the natural frequency which is why the amplitude response is getting weaker with the increase of reynolds number additional the frequency ratio reaches 0 96 at case of reynolds number of 6000 which means that the oscillation frequency is almost equal to the natural frequency but the corresponding amplitude response is still much weaker than that of the circular cylinder under the same working condition which indicates that the bluff body with cir squa cross section has a great effect on viv suppression instead of viv energy harvesting the lift coefficients acting on bluff bodies with different cross sections versus reynolds number are shown in fig 20 as shown in fig 20 in the range of the reynolds number studied the lift coefficients acting on circular cylinder and cir squa prism are of the same order of magnitude while the lift coefficients acting on squa cir prism are significantly larger than those on circular cylinder and cir squa prism in addition for cir squa prism during the range of reynolds number studied the phase difference between the curve of lift coefficient with time and the curve of amplitude ratio with time always remains 180 therefore the lift coefficient increases as the reynolds number increases while the corresponding amplitude ratio decreases as the reynolds number increases the wake patterns of bluff bodies with different cross sections at different reynolds number are also compared fig 21 shows the wake patterns of bluff bodies with three different cross sections at case of re 11942 as shown in fig 21 the circular cylinder exhibits a single row larger 2s vortex structure the bluff body with cir squa cross section exhibits a double row 2s vortex structure and the bluff body with squa cir cross section and exhibits a p s a vortex pair and a counter rotating vortex are shed at both sides of the cylinder vortex structure in addition as we can see the separation points of circular cylinder are distributed on both sides of the circular cylinder as shown in fig 21 a the separation points of bluff body with cir squa cross section are at its tail as shown in fig 21 c and the separation points of bluff body with squa cir cross section are in its front end as shown in fig 21 b it is worth emphasizing that from fig 21 there is no reattachment of the shear layer occurs on the bluff body with squa cir cross section otherwise the wake patterns of the bluff body with squa cir cross section should be similar to that of circular cylinder by comparison it can be concluded that the vortex shedding position of the bluff body with squa cir cross section is the most forward while the vortex shedding position of the bluff body with cir squa cross section is the most rearward in addition as we can see from fig 18 although the bluff body with squa cir cross section and the bluff body with cir squa cross section show the same natural frequency their amplitude responses are quite different the results indicate that the influencing factors of amplitude response of bluff bodies with different cross sections are not only limited to the natural frequency of the structure the vortex shedding position determined by the shapes of cross section is also one of the key influencing factors that cannot be ignored 4 conclusions in order to design a self generating device used in the long distance transport pipelines which harvests energy from directional flow of pipelines based on the enhancement of viv and converts it into electrical energy through the energy conversion module to provide uninterrupted power supply for low power monitoring sensors that are sporadically installed along the pipelines the amplitude response and frequency ratio for vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder with different elastic modulus as well as different mass ratios and that of bluff bodies with different cross sections are investigated using 2d urans equations with the k ω sst turbulence model at the reynolds number ranging from 2000 to 50000 in this paper the numerical simulation is based on fluent code in which newmark β method is embedded to solve the mass spring damper oscillator model based upon the simulation results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the elastic modulus of a material affects the amplitude response of the system by changing the natural frequency of the system the range of synchronization increases with an increase in elastic modulus and the onset of synchronization is more gradual for systems with higher natural frequency a higher amplitude occurs in a limited lower reynolds number region at case of smaller elastic modulus on the contrary it is the opposite 2 the maximum amplitude ratio and the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region all increase with the decrease of mass ratio indicating the strong dependence of viv on mass ratio of structure which is also one of the important factors affecting the natural frequency 3 among the studied bluff bodies with three cross sectional shapes the bluff body with squa cir cross section has a better viv performance with the highest amplitude response of 1 16d due to its forward vortex shedding position while the bluff body with cir squa cross section has the weakest viv performance with amplitude response lower than 0 2d due to its rearward vortex shedding position thus indicating that the vortex shedding position caused by the different cross sectional shapes is also an important factor to change the viv response the preliminary research results in this paper can provide a certain reference for the design of the flow around structures including the recommendation of cross sectional shapes of the flow around bluff bodies and the selection of the range of natural frequency to obtain a larger viv response and harvest energy more efficiently in wider flow velocity ranges in pipelines in order to explore more related mechanisms more clearly experimental

21630,in order to obtain a larger viv response and harvest energy more efficiently in wider flow velocity ranges in long distance transport pipelines the effects of the elastic modulus of material mass ratio and cross sectional shapes circular cylinder squa cir prism cir squa prism of flow around structure on the viv performance are numerically investigated in this paper urans equations with k ω sst turbulence model are employed to calculate the two dimensional flow field with reynolds number ranging from 2000 to 50000 and newmark β method is adopted to capture the one degree of freedom motion of the system the numerical results show that the elastic modulus of material and mass ratio are two important factors affecting the natural frequency of the system which is closely related to the vibration response of system the range of synchronization increases with an increase in elastic modulus and the onset of synchronization is more gradual for systems with higher natural frequency and the maximum amplitude ratio and the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region all increase with the decrease of mass ratio moreover the bluff body with squa cir cross section shows highest amplitude response of 1 16d due to its forward vortex shedding position indicating the direction for the design of the cross sectional shapes of bluff body in the pipeline for viv energy harvesting thereby it can be concluded that the natural frequency of system and vortex shedding position caused by the cross sectional shapes are important factors affecting the viv

liquified natural gas over long distances are in long term service throughout the country since the pipelines suffered from corrosion and man made drilling oil stolen and led to frequent oil leakage which not only seriously disturbed the normal oil production and caused huge economics losses but also resulted in environmental pollution as well as caused fire explosion and so on the solution to reduce or avoid the above mentioned problems is to install sensors along the pipeline to achieve pipeline divulging examination and pinpointing and the technical key to achieve the above mentioned solution is to solve the problem of power supply for related sensors installed along the pipelines currently these sensors can be powered by batteries solar panels small scale wind turbines and hydraulic turbines however these power supply methods have their disadvantages such as the batteries need to be replaced frequently due to limited capacity solar power and wind power are subjected to weather conditions and easily stolen due to externally installation hydraulic turbine power generator has short life and high maintenance costs due to the internal moving parts like impellers therefore a new power generation method is urgently needed to meet the long term and uninterrupted power supply demands for these sensors along the pipelines wang et al 2012 sun et al 2019a some scholars have proposed a novel concept of generating electricity converting vibrations caused by wind or water in the environment into electrical energy thereby powering these low power electronics such as sensors li et al 2016a sun et al 2019a this type of vibration caused by wind or water in the environment is often called flow induced vibration based on the principle of flow induced vibration we proposed a self generating device a flow around structure with built in power generation module is vertically installed in the pipeline and a small part of kinetic energy of the fluid is captured by the flow around structure which is then converted into electrical energy by the built in power generation module to power the low power sensors along the pipeline the power generation module can be flexible piezoelectric membrane or combination of electromagnetic and coils orrego et al 2017 naseer et al 2017 franzini and bunzel 2018 the proposed self generating device has the following advantages a maintenance free and long life due to no moving parts b guard against theft due to its high integration and internal installation c it is sufficient to uninterruptedly power low power electronics such as monitoring sensors along the pipelines in spite of its limited power generation efficiency zhang et al 2017a vortex induced vibration viv is one of the main forms of flow induced vibrations sun et al 2019a when a bluff body is placed in a uniform directional fluid flow the bluff body will alternately produce vortex shedding which in turn causes periodically pulsation on the bluff body for both in line direction and cross flow direction if the bluff body is flexible or elastically supported which is allowed to undergo elastic deformation the pulsating force will result in periodic vibration to the bluff body this regular vibration will in turn change the pattern of the wake vortex this problem of describing the interaction of fluid and structure is called vortex induced vibration viv cicolin and assi 2017 in recent years viv has been widely investigated due to its prevalence in engineering applications such as marine risers with various types bridge piers bridges towering buildings and so on zhu et al 2016 kang et al 2017 wang et al 2018 chen et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 in terms of different angles the occurrence of viv phenomena has advantages and disadvantages at present the research objectives are divided into two categories suppression of viv to prevent structural damage and enhancement of viv to achieve energy harvesting the resonance phenomenon of vortex induced vibration easily leads to serious instability and fatigue damage of many engineering structures the most common are marine and coastal applications such as bridge piers deep sea flexible structures submarine transport pipelines and cable structures in terms of aerodynamics such as towering buildings chimneys bridges aerial cables heat exchangers and blades of aero engine zheng et al 2019 chen et al 2019 zhu et al 2017a si et al 2019 therefore researchers attach great importance to the viv suppression in order to reduce or even avoid damage to these engineering structures for the suppression of vortex induced vibration the method adopted by most scholars is to change the cross sectional shape of the flow around structure or to attach some additional equipment on the outer surface of the existing structures whose cross sectional shapes are difficult to directly change thereby destroying the boundary layer and changing the near wake flow field as well as disturbing the regular vortex shedding so as to successfully suppress the vortex induced vibration their research methods include experimental research and numerical simulation research cicolin and assi 2017 proposed a novel suppressor called vt and experimentally investigated the viv response of vt as well as other three conventional suppressors their experimental results show that these suppressors all have a suppression effect and the vt suppressor has the most significant suppression effect which suppressed the peak amplitude of vibration down to 40 of that of a bare cylinder huera huarte 2017 experimentally investigated the effectiveness of wire meshes in viv suppression in their experiment in order to analysis the physical mechanism that caused the attenuation of viv a series of square wire meshes with different densities and sizes were attached on the surface of cylinder and compared their viv responses their experimental results indicate that a complete viv suppression with a suppression effect of more than 95 occurs at the reduced velocities up to more than 13 they also stated that most of the meshes generally can attenuate partially viv without increasing drag forces jiménez gonzález and huera huarte 2018 conducted an experiment to study the vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder with pairs of control rods of varying size located in its wake their experimental results show that the viv response is almost completely suppressed up to 90 when the diameter of the control rods is 0 4 times the diameter of the circular cylinder and the lift coefficient generally decreases significantly and the phase difference between transverse force and cylinder displacement alters substantially due to the placement of control rod pairs in the near wake cagney and balabani 2019 experimentally investigated the role of the separation point in viv suppression adopting a series of cylinders with different cross sectional shapes including circular with no fixed separation points equilateral triangles with fixed separation points and elliptical cylinders with adjustable major to minor axis ratios in their experiment the modification of the separation point was easily influenced the viv response and a moderately elliptical cylinder could completely achieve viv suppression jaiman et al 2016 came up with a partitioned iterative and a dynamic subgrid scale scheme to simulate flow induced vibration of freely vibrating structures in a turbulent flow by large eddy simulation solver they designed a new device termed as connected c and numerically investigated the wake stabilization mechanism for the viv suppression their results concluded that the proposed connected c device has a viv suppression performance due to the mechanism of shear layer reattachment law and jaiman 2017 they also introduced a novel staggered groove configuration and numerically investigate the effect of the width and depth of surface spanwise grooves on the viv suppression their results indicated that the staggered groove configuration is effective in viv suppression which has a potential application to deep water marine risers and tall structures in wind environment law and jaiman 2018 wang et al 2019 numerically investigated the effect of height ratio of triangle groove strips tgs on viv suppression of marine riser and they concluded that as the increase of the height ratio of tgs the viv suppression of tgs performs improved firstly but then weakened and the height ratio of 0 04 shows the best viv suppression effect nikoo et al 2018 proposed a structure tuned mass damper tmd system which is modified on the basis of conventional pipe in pipe pip system by connecting springs and dashpots between the inner and outer pipes their numerical results indicated that the optimized pip system can suppress viv noticeably the above mentioned passive control method for boundary layer by altering the surface configuration or installing additional devices around the cylinder can effectively achieve viv suppression however for some structures that are difficult to change their cross sectional shape such as bridges buildings etc other control methods are needed to adopt to achieve viv response therefore some active control methods that re quire the introduction of external energy such as free rotation the introduction of jets and electromagnetic forcing have also attracted researchers attention chen et al 2019 conducted an experiment to study the effect of a self issuing jet which is installed on a bridge deck on viv suppression their experimental results show that the self issuing jet plays an important role in viv suppression the vertical viv is completely suppressed and the torsional viv is reduced by 45 5 zheng et al 2019 experimentally investigated wind induced response and viv resonance mechanism of a mega tall building to provide guidance for wind resistance design of flexible structures wang et al 2016 presented a numerical study to adopt a pair of synthetic jets sj to control the viv of circular cylinder and their results show that the viv response is successfully suppressed by using the sj control zhang et al 2017b numerically investigated the mechanism of lorentz force on viv suppression in a uniform flow their results show that with the application of symmetrical lorentz force the vortex shedding weakens resulting in the viv suppression it is worth mentioning that there are researchers conducting viv studies on marine risers with the goal of simultaneously achieving viv suppression and high energy harvesting they not only installed additional devices with different cross sectional shapes around marine risers to control the separation of the boundary layer but also drove the free rotation of the attached devices to disturb the flow field around marine risers thereby changing the near wake and achieving viv suppression at the same time the free rotation of the attached devices can extract energy from the surrounding fluid like a water turbine therefore the free rotation of the attached device is driven by the extracted energy from the surrounding fluid and no consumption of external energy is required for its rotation and the viv suppression and energy harvesting are simultaneously achieved zhu et al 2016 numerically investigated the viv responses of a circular cylinder attached by a free to rotate dartlike overlay by using the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stroke urans equations and the k ω shear stress transport sst turbulence model coupled with a fourth order rung kutta method their results show that the studied cylinder attached by a free to rotate dartlike overlay has a limited suppression of viv and its vibration response is enhanced at larger reynolds numbers which benefits to use in power generation equipment for energy harvesting the viv response of a circular cylinder with a free to rotate triangle fairing was also investigated by this group zhu et al 2017b they concluded that the triangle fairing has a positive role in viv suppression at a stable state however the 70 triangular fairing can be used to viv energy harvesting due to its more vigorous vibration zhu and gao 2017 numerically investigated viv response of a riser attached by a free to rotate impeller and their results indicate that the lock in phenomenon shifts to a larger incoming flow rate due to the rotation of impeller viv suppression and high energy harvesting are simultaneously achieved with the reduced velocity larger than 9 85 zhu et al 2018a proposed a new device consisting of an elastically mounted circular cylinder and a free to rotate pentagram impeller for energy harvesting they concluded that the power generating capacity is sensitive to flow velocity and damping ratio and the average power efficiency is about 22 6 they also investigated the viv responses of free to rotate elliptic cylinder at different torsional frictions their results show that the viv response of rotatable cylinder is more vigorous comparing to the non rotatable elliptic cylinder zhu et al 2018b zhu et al 2019 proposed a novel energy harvester via installing bach type turbine on offshore cylindrical structures which can suppress viv response as well as achieve energy harvesting in their investigation the maximum power coefficient reaches 0 34 and the major contribution of energy conversion is from the rotation in addition a small number of scholars have studied the effects of special boundary conditions such as oscillating flow and restricted side wall on the suppression of vortex induced vibration ren et al 2019 experimentally studied the viv suppression effect of a flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes in an oscillatory flow and they concluded that the suppression efficiency is not as ideal in oscillatory flow as that in steady flow li et al 2016b numerically studied wall proximity effects on the vortex induced vibration of an elastically mounted circular cylinder their results show that the transvers vibration response of near wall cylinder is similar to that of the isolated cylinder which means that the existence of the wall does not significantly influence the cross flow vibration and the vibrating near wall cylinder exhibits larger streamwise oscillation and smaller streamwise vibration frequency as compared to the isolated cylinder chung 2016 numerically investigated the effect of froude number on vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder which is horizontally placed near a free surface at low reynolds number and they concluded that the viv is enhanced near the free surface at a lower froude number while the viv is suppressed near the free surface at a higher froude number another type of application about vortex induced vibration is to achieve energy harvesting through the resonance of viv which is aimed at strengthening viv responses this application technology is called vortex induced vibration for aquatic clean energy vivace zhu et al 2016 which harvests energy from both hydraulic such as ocean river and wind for power generation technology sun et al 2019a li et al 2016a and enhancement of heat transfer sun et al 2019b the experimental and numerical researches on energy harvesting using viv are also being carried out in full swing modir et al 2016 experimentally investigated the effect of mass ratio on viv response of a flexibly mounted circular cylinder their results show that the peak amplitude of oscillation increases with decrease of mass ratio and the range of synchronization increases by reducing the mass ratio with constant mass damping parameters modir and goudarzi 2019 experimentally studied the effect of natural frequency with five different springs by measuring the transverse response of viv about an elastically mounted circular cylinder in a water channel their experimental results show that an adjustable natural frequency system has an optimum energy harvesting in viv based ocean river energy converters orrego et al 2017 experimentally investigated wind energy harvesting by self sustained oscillations of a flexible piezoelectric membrane fixed in an inverted flag and conducted parametric studies to evaluate the influence of geometrical parameters of the flag on the flapping behavior and the resulting energy output their experimental results show that a peak electrical power of 5 0 mw cm3 occurred at a wind velocity of 9 m s and a sustainable power generation of 0 4 mw cm3 even in low wind speed regimes of 3 5 m s and they also concluded that their devices can harvest ambient wind energy to power a temperature sensor without employing a battery for energy storage zhang et al 2017a numerically investigated the viv energy harvesting of two bluff bodies in tandem arrangement with five different cross sections such as triangular prism square prism pentagon prism circular cylinder and cir tria prism in the spacing range of 2 50 diameters they concluded the cir tria prism has a better performance on energy harvesting with the maximum amplitude ratio of 1 17d which leads to maximum energy conversion of 26 5 additionally their simulation results also indicated that the viv response of the upstream cylinder will be suppressed with spacing less than 5 diameters and the motion of the downstream cylinder is largely affected by the upstream cylinder due to the wake effects with spacing less than 35 diameters zhang et al 2018 numerically investigated the best performance for the viv energy harvesting by arranging four staggered cylinders reasonably at in flow spacing varies from 1 2d to 10 0d and transverse spacing ranges from 2 0d to 8 0d their results indicate that the viv response performs the most vigorously with in flow spacing of 2 0d and transverse spacing of 4 0d obtaining the highest converted power ratio of 3 9 naseer et al 2017 proposed a concept of harvesting energy from viv by introducing nonlinear attractive magnetic forces and numerically investigated the influence of magnetic force on the synchronization region and levels of the harvested power the impacts of the spacing distance between two magnets on the natural frequency and damping ratio of the energy harvester in the monostable configuration are studied and their results show that changing the spacing distance lead to a variation of the natural frequency and results in a shift of the lock in region which is significant for low wind speed energy harvesting and according to the available ambient wind speed the spacing distance and load resistance can be adjusted for efficient and broadband energy harvesting from viv chizfahm et al 2018 numerically investigated the dynamic modeling of four configurations of viv of a bladeless wind turbine bwt and their results indicate that the conic bwts exhibit a better power performance at higher wind speeds while the right circular bwts show a better power performance at lower wind speeds franzini and bunzel 2018 numerically studied the viv of a rigid cylinder mounted on elastic supports fitted with piezoelectric harvesters their results show that the simultaneous presence of streamwise and transverse oscillations lead to a significant increase of the maximum energy harvesting efficiency and the energy harvesting efficiency can increase up to 50 for a certain reduced velocity through the research and analysis of the above literatures it can be found that whether the research purpose is the suppression or enhancement for viv the background of these researches is mostly offshore engineering or ambient wind energy harvesting there are very few investigations involve the energy harvesting by enhancing the viv from directional flow of long distance transport pipelines most researchers are studying the viv of existing engineering structures such as marine risers bridges and building whose cross sectional shape and natural frequency are fixed in this case it is only possible to control the separation of the boundary layer and alter the near wake flow field by installing additional devices around existing structures or adopting active control method such as introducing rotation jets and electromagnetic force thereby altering the vortex shedding frequency to achieve the suppression or enhancement of viv however in this paper the proposed self generating device integrated in the long distance transport pipelines involves the design of flow around structure which is flexible or elastically mounted including the design of the cross sectional shape and the natural frequency to cater to the various flow velocity ranges of the pipeline and make it more widely used for energy harvesting of pipelines with various flow velocity ranges in addition due to the different engineering application backgrounds the self generating device proposed in this paper is vertically installed in the pipeline one end of which is fixed and the other end is free this structure is not exactly the same as the structure elastically supported at both ends which is studied by most researchers finally it is worth emphasizing that the self generating device proposed in this paper only supplies low power equipment such as monitoring sensors which are sporadically installed along the pipelines although its energy conversion efficiency is not high it is also sufficient to power such sensors uninterruptedly moreover due to the low power supply demand the size of the self generating device can be designed to be small so it has a small impact on the fluid flow in the long distance transport pipelines and the loss of hydrokinetic energy is minimal in order to match the appropriate flow around structures to obtain a larger viv response and harvest energy more efficiently in wider flow velocity ranges in pipelines a two dimensional 2d numerical investigation is conducted in this paper to study the dimensionless transverse vibration amplitude and frequency of the flexible flow around bluff bodies with different elastic modulus and different mass ratios which lead to different natural frequencies and structural stiffness moreover the transverse amplitude response and frequency of bluff bodies with different cross sectional shapes are also numerically studied the study can provide a certain reference for the design of flow around structures including the recommendation of cross sectional shapes of the flow around bluff bodies and the selection of the range of natural frequency at the studied range of reynolds number 2 computational model and method 2 1 description of the problem the self generating device proposed in this paper is a flow around cylindrical structure from the appearance which can be a flexible cylindrical structure or a rigid cylindrical structure elastically supported at its one end and then a power generation module which can be flexible piezoelectric membrane or combination of electromagnetic and coils is integrated inside the cylindrical structure the processes of energy harvesting and conversion in the directional flow pipelines of the proposed self generating device are as follows the flow around cylindrical structure which is flexible or elastically supported is vertically installed in the pipeline one end of which is fixed on the pipeline and the other end is free and then due to the hydrodynamic force acting on the flow around cylindrical structure it vibrates periodically in a direction perpendicular to the flow direction resulting in the beat of internal flexible piezoelectric membrane or the relative movements between the internal electromagnetic and coils these series of processes complete the harvest and conversion of fluid kinetic energy to vibrational mechanical energy and then electrical energy the schematic diagram of self generating device vertically installed in the pipelines and self generating device with built in power generation module are respectively shown in fig 1 and fig 2 in this paper the numerical investigation is only conducted to harvest energy from fluid kinetic energy and convert into vibrational mechanical energy by the flexible flow around cylindrical structure based on the enhancement of viv and does not involve the energy conversion of the power generation module fig 3 shows the three dimensional 3d physical model of flexible flow around cylindrical structure based on enhancement of viv as we can see the size of the flow around cylindrical structure is sufficiently small compared to the fluid domain so the loss of hydrokinetic energy in the pipeline is minimal in order to enable the proposed self generating device to obtain more energy from the directional fluid the factors that affect the viv response and how to enhance viv are numerically investigated in this paper so as to point the direction for the design of the self generating device used in pipelines since the numerical study of the above mentioned three dimensional physical model is more difficult it requires more computing resources and at the same time it encounters many problems that cannot be solved immediately therefore at present this 3d numerical study is simplified to 2d numerical investigation the viv response with one degree of freedom 1 dof of the 3d flexible flow around cylindrical structure is simplified to its tip viv response with 1 dof the tip of the 3d flexible flow around cylindrical structure is modeled by a mass spring damper system the determination of its vibration parameters for the simulation is as follows firstly determine the geometric parameters of the 3d flow around cylindrical structure including diameter d and height h as well as cross sectional shape so its volume can be calculated then import the geometric model into the modal analysis module in ansys workbench software to calculate its natural frequency of y direction under different mass ratios and different elastic modulus which can be set at the modal analysis module the mass of the 3d flow around cylindrical structure per unit length m can be calculated from its geometric parameters mass ratio m and the density of the fluid ρ so the spring stiffness of the simplified 2d mass spring damper system can be calculated by k m 2πf n 2 it can be known from the above equation that the spring stiffness of the 2d mass spring damper system k is affected by the mass of the flow around cylindrical structure per unit length m and the natural frequency of the 2d mass spring damper system f n because different mass ratio of the flow around structure leads to different mass of the flow around cylindrical structure per unit length and simultaneously affect the natural frequency of the system thereby result in different spring stiffness of the system in addition the elastic modulus 3d flexible flow around cylindrical structure of can be set at the modal analysis module and through modal analysis it can be found that different elastic modulus of the structure leads to different natural frequency when the other parameters are fixed therefore according to formula k m 2πf n 2 the corresponding spring stiffness of the simplified 2d mass spring damper system also changes with the natural frequency fig 4 shows a result of modal analysis under one of the simulation conditions since the 3d flow around cylindrical structures of different heights will cause different natural frequencies when other parameters are kept the same the heights of the 3d flow around cylindrical structures are all maintained at 0 09 m in this paper although the simplified 2d numerical results are not accurately enough to reflect the viv response of the 3d flow around cylindrical structure to some degree it also can reflect the variation trend of the viv response of the flow around cylindrical structure with the mass ratio elastic modulus and cross sectional shape 2 2 simulation setup in order to reduce the number of calculated grids and to avoid calculation errors of dynamic grids a circular computational domain is used in this study as depicted in fig 5 a circular region with a diameter of 40d is defined as the computational domain the upstream boundary and the downstream boundary are respectively 20d away from the center of the cylinder the original point the upstream boundary is imposed with a velocity inlet boundary condition specified as u u and v 0 where u and v are the velocity components in x and y directions respectively and a pressure outlet boundary condition with gauge pressure of 0 pa is assigned in the downstream boundary the symmetry boundary conditions are imposed to the other two boundaries of the circular computational domain additionally the no slip wall condition is assigned on the surface of the circular cylinder as shown in fig 5 the circular cylinder with a diameter d of 0 01 m is elastically mounted the motion of the system is modeled by a mass spring damper system with 1 dof the natural frequency f n and spring stiffness k of the system vary with the elastic modulus e and the mass ratio m 4m ρπd 2 of the flexible bluff bodies the natural frequency of y direction can be obtained by modal analysis of ansys workbench software and the spring stiffness can be calculated by k m 2πf n 2 the simulation parameters are listed in table 1 in order to show the complete influencing regularity of the relevant parameters the studied reynolds numbers re ranges from 2000 to 50000 so as to reflect the whole synchronization region of viv under different influencing factors to capture the vibration response of the system the whole computational domain is divided into two zones an accompany moving zone with a diameter of 7d around the cylinder follows the translational motion of the cylinder the rest of the computational domain around the accompany moving zone is defined as the dynamic zone in which the grids deform and perform any needed adaptation depending on the translational motion of the accompany moving zone in addition three kinds of cross sections are adopted for the viv bluff bodies including the circular cylinder squa cir prism and cir squa prism fig 6 d represents the diameter both in x direction and y direction of the bluff bodies 2 3 governing equations and numerical method for an unsteady two dimensional viscous incompressible flow over a bluff body the unsteady reynolds averaged navier stroke urans equations can describe the flow properties and are expressed as follows zhu et al 2016

dissipation rate s ij is the mean rate of deformation components and σ k σ ω β and γ are model coefficients the vibration amplitude of the bluff body is triggered by the fluctuating hydrodynamic forces acting on the system as a mass spring damping system the motion of the bluff body in the y direction is modeled by a second order linear equation the equation of one degree of freedom 1 dof motion can be presented as zhu et al 2016 2017b 2018a 2018b 2019 zhu and gao 2017 10 m y c y k y f l t in which 11 k m 2 π f n 2 12 c 2 ζ m k where f l t is the lift forces ÿ y and y represent the acceleration velocity and displacement associated with the transverse motion simulations are performed by using cfd software fluent in order to realize the dynamic mesh in fluent user defined functions udf are written by using the c programming language to solve the response of the viv system in the udf classical newmark β method is embedded to solve the mass spring damper system zhang et al 2017a chen et al 2018 wang et al 2019 newmark β is a method of numerical integration used to solve differential equations which is widely used in numerical evaluation of the dynamic response of structures such as in finite element analysis to model dynamic systems using the extended mean value theorem newmark β method states that the first time derivative can be solved as zhang et al 2017a 2018 13 y t δ t y t 1 γ y t γ y t δ t δ t however due to the acceleration also varies with time in order to obtain the correct displacement the extended mean value theorem must also be extended to the second time derivative which is expressed as 14 y t δ t y t y t δ t 1 2 β y t β y t δ t δ t 2 according to eq 13 and eq 14 ÿ t δt and y t δt can be expressed as 15 y t δ t 1 β δ t 2 y t δ t y t 1 β δ

method are 0 5 and 0 25 respectively in this simulation at each time step the lift forces are firstly obtained by solving the urans equations with the k ω sst turbulence model then the newmark β method is employed to solve the structure motion equations to obtain the next state change according to the current state and output the translational velocity and displacement of the system next the velocity of the system is used to impose the no slip wall condition and the displacement of the system is used to place it as its new position to update the mesh zhang et al 2017a the simple algorithm is used to calculate the coupling between the pressure and velocity fields nikoo et al 2018 zhu et al 2016 2018a 2018b 2019 zhu and gao 2017 the first order implicit scheme in the time domain and the second order upwind scheme in the spatial domain are adopted in simulations due to their stability and veracity zhu and gao 2017 in this paper the time step varies with flow velocity u to ensure the maximum courant number is set to uδt d 0 05 which meets the requirement of courant number being smaller than 1 the convergent criteria for all simulations are set as that residual in the control volume for each parameter is small than 1e 5 2 4 computational mesh the computational mesh used for the simulation of flow past a bluff body is displayed in fig 7 the dynamic zone and accompany moving zone are all tessellated with different sizes of grids in this study the whole circular computational domain generates structured grids all of which are meshed with quadrilateral cells the closer to the bluff body the denser the grid is in order to increase the accuracy in resolving the boundary layer flow the minimum mesh size adjoining the cylinder surface in the radial direction is set to be 0 0003d and the growth factor is 1 13 the size of the first layer is determined by the y plus y of 1 which is expressed as zhu and gao 2017 wang et al 2019 21 y 0 172 δ y d re 0 9 where δy is the height of the first layer mesh for the largest reynolds number of 50000 δy is 0 0003d by calculation in the case of y 1 for other reynolds number y is smaller than 1 in addition the 2d computational grids for all cross sections are generated as shown in fig 8 a suitable mesh is obtained by repeating the computations until a satisfactory independent grid is found the relationship between the dimensionless amplitude response a d and grid number is investigated under the same case as shown in fig 9 taking the working condition of u 1 5 m s and the spring stiffness of the structure with cross sectional shape of circular cylinder k 5212 n m as an example six group of mesh are generated it can be seen from fig 9 that the amplitude responses calculated by the first two sets of relatively sparser mesh and the latter four sets of relatively denser mesh are significantly different and the maximum deviation of amplitude responses is 11 03 which occurs between the second set of mesh the grid number is 16576 and the third set of mesh the grid number is 22464 while the amplitude responses calculated by the latter four sets of relatively denser mesh are very close with a maximum deviation of only 0 4 the results show that the amplitude responses calculated by the latter four sets of relatively denser mesh tend to be stable and consistent however since the first two sets of mesh are relatively sparse the calculated amplitude responses are not accurate enough in order to simultaneously ensure the accuracy of the calculation results and save the calculation resources and time as much as possible the third set of mesh with grid number 22464 can give a good compromise between precision and calculation time and is sufficient for carrying out numerical simulation in present work since the transient cfd method is applied in this paper time step independence validation has been conducted adopting the third set of mesh and the above mentioned modeling parameters the time step independence validation is conducted using different time steps ranging from 1e 3 s step to 5e 5 s step as shown in table 2 it can be seen from table 2 the same frequency response can be obtained with time steps of 1e 4 and 5e 5 and the deviation of corresponding amplitude response is about 1 5 accordingly taking the calculation efficiency into consideration time step of 1e 4 is selected in this paper 2 5 model validation the numerical method used in this study has been validated against the experimental results of 1 dof viv of a bare circular cylinder in uniform channel flow by modir et al 2016 all the parameters in simulations including diameter of circular cylinder d mass ratio m damping ratio ζ spring stiffness of the structure k and natural frequency of the structure f n and re are the same as that model of modir et al 2016 d 0 06 m m 2 26 ζ 0 053 k 570 n m f n 2 03 hz and the range of re is from 20000 to 64000 the corresponding velocity in x direction u 0 47 1 43 m s the comparison of the viv response of the bare cylinder versus re between the numerical results and the experimental data is shown in fig 10 as we can see from the perspective of the entire reynolds number range the numerical results show a similar trend as well as a similar magnitude in the synchronization region the maximum deviation of the amplitude ratio with experiment and simulation is about 15 95 however in the initial branch and desynchronization region there is only a similar trend between the experimental results and the simulated results of the amplitude ratio and there is an obvious gap in the values we analyze that the reasons for the obvious gap between the experimental results and the simulation results in the initial branch and the desynchronization region are mainly reflected in the following three points a the experiment from modir et al 2016 is a three dimensional flow regime however the numerical simulation in this paper is limited to two dimensional research the effect of gravity is ignored in the two dimensional research in addition the velocity distribution in the experiment may not be an ideal uniform flow but in the numerical simulation the inlet velocity is set to a uniform flow along the channel direction and the velocity loss near wall caused by the viscosity of the fluid is also ignored b the specific data of some parameters used in the numerical simulation are not directly given in the experiment from modir et al 2016 including the inlet velocity density and viscosity of water these parameters values are calculated based on the provided data such as reynolds number geometry size of cylinder and mass ratio and may not be exactly the same as their experimental environment c there are certain measurement errors about the mass of system the natural frequency and damping ratio of the system and amplitude results during the experiment from modir et al 2016 but we can t quantify the measurement errors in their experiment due to the lack of error analysis in the literature published by modir et al 2016 these above three viewpoints are the possible reasons that we speculated may cause gap between the experiment results and simulation results in the initial branch and the desynchronization region however we think that experimental results with reynolds number have the same changing tendency as the numerical results especially in the synchronization region which indicates that the numerical results can reflect the relationship between the amplitude ratio and the reynolds number to a certain extent therefore we think that the numerical simulation method used in this paper is feasible and acceptable 3 results and discussion 3 1 vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of circular cylinders with different elastic modulus the vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of circular cylinders with different elastic modulus are investigated with mass ratio of 3 and damping ratio of 0 003 the natural frequencies in y direction of the circular cylinder of d 0 01 m with elastic modulus of 6e6 pa 2e7 pa and 4e7 pa are calculated by modal analysis to be 7 7118 hz 14 08 hz and 19 912 hz respectively fig 11 shows the amplitude ratios a d of circular cylinders versus reynolds number for different elastic modulus cases it can be seen from fig 11 that the difference in elastic modulus causes the natural frequencies of the system to be different so that the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region is different the natural frequency of the system increases as the elastic modulus of material increases as we can see the range of synchronization increases with an increase in elastic modulus and the onset of synchronization is more gradual for systems with higher natural frequency as shown in fig 11 in the case of elastic modulus e 6e6 pa the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region is in the range of 3000 7000 but when the reynolds number is more than 7000 the vibration exhibits de synchronization phenomenon thereby obtaining lower amplitude responses in the case of elastic modulus e 2e7 pa the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 6000 to 14000 then reaches the de synchronization region when reynolds number reaches 15000 in the case of elastic modulus e 4e7 pa the initial reynolds number of the synchronization region is 8000 and the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 8000 to 20000 then reaches the de synchronization region the results show that at the case of smaller elastic modulus it is easy to obtain a larger amplitude in the lower speed region while the amplitude is lower in the higher speed region and the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region is also limited however the higher amplitude exhibits in the higher speed region at the case of a larger elastic modulus and the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region is larger it can be concluded from the results that viv has a strong dependence on the natural frequency and the elastic modulus of material is one of the important factors affecting the natural frequency of the system for different ranges of fluid s flow velocities in the pipeline it is necessary to reasonably select materials with different elastic modulus to make the flow around structures to obtain the desired natural frequencies so as to realize the viv energy harvesting in the pipeline in addition in order to achieve energy harvesting over a wider range of reynolds number it is not recommended to select materials with a smaller elastic modulus fig 12 shows the frequency ratios the ratio of the oscillation frequency to the natural frequency fosc fn versus reynolds number for different elastic modulus cases as can be seen from fig 12 the frequency ratio increases with the increase of reynolds number at the lower reynolds number the frequency ratio is close to 1 in the synchronization region which means the oscillation frequency is close to the natural frequency leading to a larger amplitude response however the frequency ratio almost exceeds 2 which means that the oscillation frequency differs greatly from the natural frequency such as reynolds number is greater than 7000 at case of elastic modulus e 6e6 pa reynolds number is greater than 14000 at case of elastic modulus e 2e7 pa as well as reynolds number is greater than 20000 at case of elastic modulus e 4e7 pa the vibration reaches de synchronization region and the amplitude response drops sharply correspondingly the hydrodynamic forces acting on circular cylinders which result in the vibration responses also need to be displayed and analyzed the amplitude responses of the flow around circular cylinder in the y direction are result of the effect of the lift forces which change periodically since the 1 dof vortex induced vibrations are discussed in this paper the hydrodynamic forces analyzed in this paper only reflect lift forces acting on circular cylinders in the y direction generally the lift force needs to be dimensionless converted into lift coefficient for analysis the lift coefficient is expressed as 22 c l 2 f l ρ u 2 d the lift coefficients acting on circular cylinders with various elastic modulus versus reynolds number are shown in fig 13 these three sets of curves have similar trends it can be seen from fig 13 that a common feature appears in these three sets of lift coefficients curves that is the lift coefficient suddenly becomes very small at a certain reynolds number this is because a phase switch occurs between the curve of lift coefficient with time and the curve of amplitude ratio with time the phase difference switches from 0 to 180 as we can see in the case of elastic modulus e 6e6 pa the phase switch occurs at re 3000 in the case of elastic modulus e 2e7 pa the phase switch occurs at re 6000 in the case of elastic modulus e 4e7 pa the phase switch occurs at re 8000 by comparing figs 11 and 13 the reynolds number at which the phase switch occurs is exactly the initial reynolds number at which the amplitude response reaches the synchronization region which indicates that the starting point of the synchronization region corresponding to the amplitude response is closely related to the phase difference between the curve of lift coefficient with time and the curve of amplitude ratio with time the phase switch is also accompanied by the transition of wake patterns which will be mentioned later after that there will be a slight increase in the lift coefficient at very short reynolds number ranges re 3000 4000 at case of elastic modulus e 6e6 pa re 6000 7000 at case of elastic modulus e 2e7 pa re 8000 10000 at case of elastic modulus e 4e7 pa and then lift coefficient gradually decreases as reynolds number it is worth emphasizing that in the process of lift coefficient increasing briefly and then decreasing re 3000 7000 at case of elastic modulus e 6e6 pa re 6000 14000 at case of elastic modulus e 2e7 pa re 8000 20000 at case of elastic modulus e 4e7 pa which exactly corresponds to the synchronization region of the amplitude response in fig 7 it is accompanied by a transition of wake patterns again which will be mentioned later finally in the desynchronization region where the amplitude response is very small the lift coefficient increases slightly with reynolds number 3 2 vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of circular cylinders with different mass ratios the vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of circular cylinders with different mass ratios are investigated with elastic modulus of 2e7 pa and damping ratio of 0 003 the natural frequencies in y direction of circular cylinder of d 0 01 m with mass ratio of 0 8 1 5 and 3 are calculated by modal analysis to be 27 265 hz 19 912 hz and 14 08 hz respectively fig 14 shows the amplitude ratios a d of circular cylinders versus reynolds number for different mass ratios cases it can be seen from fig 14 that the variation of mass ratios causes the different natural frequencies of the system which results in the different ranges of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region of amplitude responses as we can see the maximum amplitude ratio and the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region all increase with the decrease of mass ratio as illustrated in fig 14 the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 6000 to 14000 under the case of mass ratio of 3 then the de synchronization phenomenon appears at reynolds number of 15000 where a lower amplitude response is obtained and the maximum amplitude ratio is 0 58 in the case of mass ratio of 3 in the case of mass ratio of 1 5 the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 7000 to 24000 and the maximum amplitude ratio reaches 0 63 in the case of mass ratio of 0 8 the reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 8000 to 42000 and the maximum amplitude ratio reaches 0 78 the results indicate the strong dependence of viv on natural frequency and the mass ratio is also one of the important factors affecting the natural frequency of system at a lower mass ratio it is easy to obtain a higher amplitude response and it can maintain a considerable amplitude response over a wider range of flow velocity which facilitates energy harvesting in pipelines fig 15 shows the frequency ratios versus reynolds number for different mass ratios cases it can be seen from fig 15 that the frequency ratio increases with the increase of reynolds number at the lower reynolds number as the mass ratio decreases the range of frequency ratio corresponding to the synchronization region becomes wider for example in the case of mass ratio of 0 8 the frequency ratio corresponding to the synchronization region ranges from 0 8 to 1 5 fig 16 shows the lift coefficients acting on circular cylinders with various mass ratios versus reynolds number as shown in fig 16 the phenomenon of phase switch also occurs in these cases of different mass ratios but these reynolds numbers at which the phase switch occurs are slightly different under different mass ratios such as in the case of mass ratio of 3 the phase switch occurs at re 6000 in the case of mass ratio of 1 5 the phase switch occurs at re 8000 and in the case of mass ratio of 0 8 the phase switch occurs at re 11000 however by comparing figs 10 and 12 we find that in these cases of mass ratios of 0 8 and 1 5 the reynolds number at which the phase switch occurs does not coincide with the initial reynolds numbers of synchronization region as the mass ratio decreases the phase switch occurs later than the amplitude response reaches the synchronization region after that there will be a slight increase in the lift coefficient at very short reynolds number ranges re 6000 7000 at case of mass ratio of 3 re 8000 13000 at case of mass ratio of 1 5 re 11000 18000 at case of mass ratio of 0 8 then lift coefficient gradually decreases as reynolds number there is a transition of wake patterns during the process where the lift coefficient first increases and then decreases in addition the transition of the wake patterns for viv of circular cylinders also occurs in the process of studying the effects of elastic modulus and mass ratio on the amplitude response three typical wake patterns in this investigation are plotted in fig 17 take the mass ratio of 3 and elastic modulus of 2e7 pa as an example the wake vortex exhibits a single row 2s two vortices with little difference in intensity but opposite directions in each vibration cycle mode at lower reynolds number such as re 3981 where the obtained amplitude response is lower leading to a lower vorticity as shown in fig 17 a when the amplitude response reaches the synchronization region it will be accompanied by a transition of wake patterns that is as the amplitude response becomes larger the wake vortex changes from a single row 2s mode with a lower vorticity to a double row 2s mode as shown in fig 17 b in the synchronization region as mentioned before the lift coefficient first increases and then decreases this phenomenon is also accompanied by another transition of wake patterns that is the wake vortex evolves from a double row 2s mode to a single row 2s mode at which time causes a larger vorticity as shown in fig 17 c the results indicate that there is an important relationship between the wake patterns and amplitude response as well as lift coefficient 3 3 vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of bluff bodies with different cross sections the vibration responses and hydrodynamic forces for viv of bluff bodies with different cross sections are investigated with elastic modulus of 2e7 pa mass ratio of 3 and damping ratio of 0 003 the natural frequencies in y direction of bluff bodies of d 0 01 m with cross sectional shapes of circular cylinder squa cir prism and cir squa prism are calculated by modal analysis to be 14 08 hz 15 319 hz and 15 319 hz respectively the amplitude ratios a d of bluff bodies with different cross sections versus reynolds number are shown in fig 18 it can be seen that the amplitude response of bluff body with squa cir cross section increases with the increase of reynolds number and the bluff body with squa cir cross section shows more significant amplitude response after reynolds number is greater than 8000 and its maximum amplitude ratio reaches 1 16 within the range of the studied reynolds number the amplitude ratio of circular cylinder is in the synchronization region and the amplitude ratio fluctuates between 0 5 and 0 6 however the bluff body with cir squa cross section shows a most weak amplitude response under the same working conditions whose maximum amplitude ratio of 0 16 occurs at re 6000 and then decreases with the increase of reynolds number the corresponding frequency ratios for viv of bluff bodies with different cross sections versus reynolds number are shown in fig 19 as shown in fig 19 the frequency ratio of the bluff body with squa cir cross section increases from 0 4 to 0 7 as the reynolds number increases that is to say the bluff body with squa cir cross section in the case of frequency ratio close to 0 7 shows larger amplitude response than that of circular cylinder whose frequency ratio close to 1 indicating that the bluff body with squa cir cross section shows a better amplitude response under the same working conditions which facilitates the viv energy harvesting however the frequency ratio of the bluff body with cir squa cross section increases from 0 96 to 2 13 with the increase of reynolds number that is the oscillation frequency is getting farther away from the natural frequency which is why the amplitude response is getting weaker with the increase of reynolds number additional the frequency ratio reaches 0 96 at case of reynolds number of 6000 which means that the oscillation frequency is almost equal to the natural frequency but the corresponding amplitude response is still much weaker than that of the circular cylinder under the same working condition which indicates that the bluff body with cir squa cross section has a great effect on viv suppression instead of viv energy harvesting the lift coefficients acting on bluff bodies with different cross sections versus reynolds number are shown in fig 20 as shown in fig 20 in the range of the reynolds number studied the lift coefficients acting on circular cylinder and cir squa prism are of the same order of magnitude while the lift coefficients acting on squa cir prism are significantly larger than those on circular cylinder and cir squa prism in addition for cir squa prism during the range of reynolds number studied the phase difference between the curve of lift coefficient with time and the curve of amplitude ratio with time always remains 180 therefore the lift coefficient increases as the reynolds number increases while the corresponding amplitude ratio decreases as the reynolds number increases the wake patterns of bluff bodies with different cross sections at different reynolds number are also compared fig 21 shows the wake patterns of bluff bodies with three different cross sections at case of re 11942 as shown in fig 21 the circular cylinder exhibits a single row larger 2s vortex structure the bluff body with cir squa cross section exhibits a double row 2s vortex structure and the bluff body with squa cir cross section and exhibits a p s a vortex pair and a counter rotating vortex are shed at both sides of the cylinder vortex structure in addition as we can see the separation points of circular cylinder are distributed on both sides of the circular cylinder as shown in fig 21 a the separation points of bluff body with cir squa cross section are at its tail as shown in fig 21 c and the separation points of bluff body with squa cir cross section are in its front end as shown in fig 21 b it is worth emphasizing that from fig 21 there is no reattachment of the shear layer occurs on the bluff body with squa cir cross section otherwise the wake patterns of the bluff body with squa cir cross section should be similar to that of circular cylinder by comparison it can be concluded that the vortex shedding position of the bluff body with squa cir cross section is the most forward while the vortex shedding position of the bluff body with cir squa cross section is the most rearward in addition as we can see from fig 18 although the bluff body with squa cir cross section and the bluff body with cir squa cross section show the same natural frequency their amplitude responses are quite different the results indicate that the influencing factors of amplitude response of bluff bodies with different cross sections are not only limited to the natural frequency of the structure the vortex shedding position determined by the shapes of cross section is also one of the key influencing factors that cannot be ignored 4 conclusions in order to design a self generating device used in the long distance transport pipelines which harvests energy from directional flow of pipelines based on the enhancement of viv and converts it into electrical energy through the energy conversion module to provide uninterrupted power supply for low power monitoring sensors that are sporadically installed along the pipelines the amplitude response and frequency ratio for vortex induced vibration of a circular cylinder with different elastic modulus as well as different mass ratios and that of bluff bodies with different cross sections are investigated using 2d urans equations with the k ω sst turbulence model at the reynolds number ranging from 2000 to 50000 in this paper the numerical simulation is based on fluent code in which newmark β method is embedded to solve the mass spring damper oscillator model based upon the simulation results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the elastic modulus of a material affects the amplitude response of the system by changing the natural frequency of the system the range of synchronization increases with an increase in elastic modulus and the onset of synchronization is more gradual for systems with higher natural frequency a higher amplitude occurs in a limited lower reynolds number region at case of smaller elastic modulus on the contrary it is the opposite 2 the maximum amplitude ratio and the range of reynolds number corresponding to the synchronization region all increase with the decrease of mass ratio indicating the strong dependence of viv on mass ratio of structure which is also one of the important factors affecting the natural frequency 3 among the studied bluff bodies with three cross sectional shapes the bluff body with squa cir cross section has a better viv performance with the highest amplitude response of 1 16d due to its forward vortex shedding position while the bluff body with cir squa cross section has the weakest viv performance with amplitude response lower than 0 2d due to its rearward vortex shedding position thus indicating that the vortex shedding position caused by the different cross sectional shapes is also an important factor to change the viv response the preliminary research results in this paper can provide a certain reference for the design of the flow around structures including the recommendation of cross sectional shapes of the flow around bluff bodies and the selection of the range of natural frequency to obtain a larger viv response and harvest energy more efficiently in wider flow velocity ranges in pipelines in order to explore more related mechanisms more clearly experimental

21631,in this research two liquid dam break induced mixing process in the presence of different obstacles was modeled using δ sph method water and polyetilenoxid peo were used as two different newtonian fluids the model was validated using laboratory data including single liquid dam break over wet bed and over triangular and rectangular obstacles as well as two liquid dam break then the effect of various parameters such as ambient water depth and gate motion characteristics on mixing pattern and front propagation of water peo interface were investigated the results show the necessity of considering the gate in numerical simulation furthermore a two step formula for gate motion consisting accelerated phase and a uniform velocity phase was used leading to increasing the accuracy of the results finally the flow simulation was performed to evaluate and compare the mixing pattern front propagation of water peo solution interface as well as maximum flow height in the presence of three different obstacles keywords dam break with obstacle two liquid mixing jet formation δ sph model 1 introduction dam break is the result of an instantaneous uncontrollable releasing of a large reservoir which can be considered as a semi infinite volume of water in a short time as a kind of complex rapidly varying unsteady flows it can lead to numerous casualties and damages yang et al 2010 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 duricic et al 2013 issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 it can also generate intense flooding wave leading to rapid geomorphic change erosion and sediment transport in this process the maximum flow depths wave propagation velocity and the flow regime highly depend on the irregular topography of the downstream channel in practice such an irregular topography is caused by debris in river bed such as buildings and bridges in urban areas which act as an obstacle to the flow they may increase the water depth and change the flow pattern the spatial and temporal variations of the water depth and velocity during a dam break event are important parameters in preparation of emergency action plans singh et al 2011 predicting the evolution of free surface water depths and wave arrival times of a dam break is of a great importance to reduce loss of life and flood damages ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 so in recent years great efforts are concentrated on the development of numerical methods for the simulation of this problem immediately after the dam break complicated mixing process occurs where the reservoir water and ambient water interface capturing is very cumbersome during the initial dam break stages wave breaking and turbulence are dominant and the pressure is not hydrostatic also vertical accelerations affect the flow conditions close to the wave front just after dam break ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 during the release time the gate acts as an obstacle to the upstream water and blocks the water from moving forward the moving gate also comes upwards with strong shear force on the gate fluid interface including an interaction between water air and gate which generates jets and splashes onto the main water body lobovsky et al 2014 ye et al 2016 these issues further complicate the dam break flow by now dam break problem as a standard free surface flow test case is the issue of considerable experimental analytical and numerical studies by the hydraulic engineers and researchers apart from a number of experimental studies ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 lobovsky et al 2014 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 simulation of the single liquid dam break problem was performed by numerical methods such as finite volume method fvm erpicum et al 2010 volume of fluid vof ketabdari and saghi 2012 yang et al 2018 khoshkonesh et al 2019 level set

ketabdari 2015 constraint interpolation profile cip hu and sueyoshi 2010 and moving particle semi implicit mps jeong et al 2012 abdelrazek et al 2014 methods single liquid dam break in the presence of an obstacle was also the issue of some important studies soares frazao 2007 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 jeong et al 2012 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2012 kao and chang 2012 wu et al 2013 ozmen cagatay et al 2014 aureli et al 2015 amicarelli et al 2015 issakhov et al 2018 the single phase studies on dam break are classified into two main categories including the dam break over dry bed and dam break over wet bed the process of dam break flow in the presence of a wet bed is more complicated than that of a dry bed as it strongly depends on the interaction between the reservoir and ambient fluids this process associated with free surface deformation as well as the mixing between reservoir and ambient fluids crespo et al 2008 since the single liquid models do not distinguish between the reservoir and ambient fluids they are unable to reproduce the mixing pattern therefore for this case a multi liquid model with the ability to reproduce the dam break evolution as well as the interface between the two fluids is required there are two general numerical frames i e eulerian and lagrangian description for modeling interfacial flows the difficulties in the calculation of interface breaking or merging and surface tension force near the interface makes the numerical modelling of interfacial flows a challenging task in eulerian description and improper methods can cause significant mass loss in order to solve the problems of interfacial flows interface tracking and capturing methods have been utilized in interface tracking methods the interface is tracked using a moving surface mesh and the modelling of the interface deformation is performed by adopting an expensive re meshing procedure interface capturing methods are able to capture strong topological changes with relative ease such as break up and merger of bubbles or droplets the two common interface capturing methods are vof and ls methods in which a scalar indicator function is used to distinguish two liquids in the computational domain gu et al 2019 in the ls method a continuous function which is defined as the signed distance to the interface is used to distinguish the two liquids separated by the interface the resolved velocity field is used to solve the advection equation to obtain the evolution of the interface and a re initialization procedure is performed to ensure that the advected ls function remains a signed distance function the advantage of the ls method is that its function is smooth which in turn simplifies the calculation of the interface curvature since the zero ls may deviate from the real position during the simulation ls method may result in significant mass loss or gain this problem can be reduced by adopting a high resolution scheme in the vof method a discontinuous volume fraction function that refers to the volume fraction occupied by the liquid within each cell is utilized due to the discontinuity of the vof function across the interface calculating the interface curvature is very cumbersome there are two kinds of vof methods for advection of the volume fraction one is the algebraic vof method in which the vof field is transported by a convective term using discretization methods if a high resolution advection scheme is used to approximate the convective term in the vof transport equation interface smearing is evident which reduces the accuracy on the interface another vof method uses the volume fraction and interface normal to define and reconstruct the interface location within a cell to overcome this problem methods such as simple line interface calculation slic piecewise linear interface calculation plic and weighted line interface calculation wlic can be used to reconstruct the interface gu et al 2018 generally in vof method the navier stokes n s equations are solved on a fixed eulerian grid which leads to some problems of numerical diffusion arise from advection terms in the n s equations this becomes more severe in problems with large free surface deformation where the treatment procedures of the surface cells for capturing the sharpness of the surface becomes complicated xu 2016 also a very small computational grid is required to recover the liquid surface using vof method which leads to very high computational cost issakhov et al 2018 in order to overcome the difficulties of vof and ls methods a clsvof has been used which makes advantage of both the mass conservation of vof and the continuous function description of ls in this method initialization and correction are carried out on the whole field of ls function and vof function however they are more complicated and computationally expensive compared to vof and ls methods advantages of ls method are easily calculating the normality and curvature of the interface as well as easily handling topography changes by implementing a higher order advection scheme such as fvm or fdm gu et al 2018 however deterioration in predicted ls solutions were reported due to the numerical dissipation and dispersion also to maintain the ls function as a signed distance function a re initialization procedure is required another disadvantage of this method is gaining or losing a small amount of mass when the zero ls is changed another set of cfd methods are mesh free particle lagrangian methods with great modeling advantage in applications with large interfacial deformations and fragmentations the particle methods employ a set of discrete particles or nodes to represent and record the state and movement of the system in a lagrangian frame and possess the field variables such as velocity and pressure unlike the mesh based methods that have some problems arising from mesh adaptability and connectivity particle methods are able to deal with any kind of boundary and interface deformations and fragmentations shakibaeinia and jin 2011 in meshfree methods the continuum is represented by a set of particles that are free to move based on the material velocity each particle possesses a set of field variable such as mass position velocity and pressure two most common particle methods are sph and mps method although these two methods are similar in some aspects there are two main differences between them the gradient of a function in sph is calculated using the gradient of the weighting function however in mps method it is calculated using algebraic operators with the weight function also the mps is independent of parameters that usually requires appropriate tuning such as artificial viscosity in sph abdelrazek et al 2014 sph is a particle method in which the time history of the material particles can be obtained and the advection and transport of the system can thus be calculated the free surfaces material interfaces and moving boundaries can all be traced naturally in the process of simulation regardless the complicity of the movement of the particles which have been very challenging to many eulerian methods and thus sph is an ideal choice for modeling free surface and interfacial flow problems liu and liu 2010 compared to mesh based methods sph interactions are carried out between a given particle and its moving neighbors these neighboring particles are unknown since they change at each instant one of the main drawbacks of the sph method is its high computational cost when number of particles increases the simulation of real problems requires a high resolution with millions of particles so that it may take several days to simulate a problem with a real time of few seconds by this method in recent years high performance computing techniques are utilized to reduce the computational times of sph the main techniques used to accelerate sph are open multi processing openmp that is the best option to optimize the performance of the multiple cores of the current cpus message passing interface mpi that is the best option to combine the resource of multiple machines connected via network and general purpose computing on graphics processing units gpgpu that involves the study and use of parallel computing ability of a gpu to perform general purpose programs dominguez 2014 gpus are powerful parallel processors designed for graphics rendering and their computing power has been increased much faster than cpus gpus provide a high calculation power with very low cost and without expensive infrastructures however an efficient and full use of the capabilities of the gpus is not straightforward a detailed description of the sph method is presented in the following sections the main focus of this research is to study the mixing pattern for different fluids in two sides of a dam in the presence of different obstacles it is evident from the broad literature as above that although there are considerable investigations on single liquid dam break and its interaction with obstacles there are a few studies on interfacial dam break as a pioneering experimental work janosi et al 2004 performed experimental studies on dam break flow using two different liquids khayyer and gotoh 2010 studied the dam break problem using two different liquids applying mps isph and wcsph methods shakibaeinia and jin 2011 studied the dam break problem on fixed and mobile bed using wcmps method swartenbroekx et al 2013 proposed a two layer finite volume model to study the dam break flows over mobile beds qihua et al 2015 used isph method for studying scouring in sediment bed and movement of sediments due to dam break flow wcsph method was used to model the multi phase problem of scouring resulted by rapid flows fourtakas and rogers 2016 in this paper δ sph model crespo et al 2015 is used to investigate the two liquid mixing process without and with the obstacles the model is implemented in c and cuda and it is designed to launch simulations on a gpu the code was first validated by different test cases including the single liquid dam break over wet bed single liquid dam break over two types of obstacles as well as qualitative comparison with the experimental results of a two liquid dam break then the effect of various parameters such as the ambient water depth and the gate motion parameters on the mixing pattern and front propagation of water peo solution interface are discussed finally the effect of different obstacle shapes on the mixing pattern front propagation of water peo interface and the jet formation of the two liquid flow is investigated 2 the sph method in this section the governing equations and basis of sph numerical method are presented 2 1 sph basis and governing equations smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is a meshfree lagrangian method which was first introduced by lucy 1977 gingold and monaghan 1977 to simulate astrophysical problems this method doesn t need a grid to calculate the spatial derivatives these derivatives are represented by analytical differentiation of interpolation functions monaghan 1992 in sph a continuum is discretized into a set of particles that advect with the fluid velocity in a lagrangian manner holmes et al 2011 based on the physical properties of neighboring particles the discretized n s equations are locally integrated at the location of each particle crespo et al 2015 the next step is to approximate the values of the field functions and their derivatives at any point liu and liu 2003 the weighted contribution of the neighboring particles is calculated according to their distance from the desired particle using a kernel function w and a smoothing length h in which a set of neighboring particles are identified in each time step the new physical quantities are calculated for each particle and they move based on the updated quantities the first and second steps in sph are the integral representation of field functions and the particle approximation respectively in the first step the integration of the multiplication of an arbitrary function and a smoothing kernel w gives the kernel approximation in the form of integral representation of the function liu and liu 2003 the kernel function is designed so that represents a function a x which is identified in x by integral estimation 1 a x a x w x x h d x the performance of the sph model highly depends on the choice of the smoothing function this kernel function should be differentiable be positive in a defined interaction zone has a compact support and monotonically decreases with increasing distance liu and liu 2003 next the particle approximation is performed to represent the entire system by a finite number of particles that carry individual mass and occupy individual space the continuous integral representation can be converted into discretized forms of summation over all the particles inside the compact support domain which is defined by the smoothing length 2 a x a b a x b w x a x b h δ v b where the subscript a points to an individual particle δ v b m b ρ b is the volume of the neighboring particle b and m and ρ denote mass and density respectively so eq 2 is written in the following form 3 a x a b a x b m b ρ b w x a x b h in this research a quintic kernel is used which is expressed as 4 w x h α d 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 0 q 2 where α d 7 4 π h 2 in 2 d q x h is a non dimensional distance between any two given particles where x is the distance between particles a and b and h is the smoothing length which controls the size of the area around particle a where the neighboring particles are considered in this zone the momentum conservation equation is as follows 5 dv dt 1 ρ p g γ where γ refers to dissipative terms and g is the gravity acceleration in the multi liquid formulation the momentum equation is written as follows 6 dv a dt b m b p b p a ρ b ρ a a w ab 1 ρ τ g where p k and ρ k are the pressure and density correspond to particle k and the brackets denote an sph approximation in order to discretize the viscous forces the following formulation is used 7 1 ρ τ a υ a p p 2 v a b m b υ a υ b x a b a w a b ρ b x a b 2 0 001 h 2 v a b where υ app is the apparent kinematic viscosity and 0 01 h 2 is included to keep the denominator nonzero the continuity

b ρ b v ab a w ab in this approach the fluid behaves as a weakly compressible and the equation of state is used for estimation of the fluid pressure the compressibility is adjusted to slow down the speed of sound so that the size of the time step at each moment could be maintained at a reasonable value crespo et al 2015 however such an adjustment limits the speed of sound to be at least ten times faster than the maximum velocity of the fluid maintains the density changes in the range of 1 and does not introduce any major difference from an incompressible approach the equation of state is written as the following form 9 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where γ 7 b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 is the reference density and c 0 c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 is the speed of sound at the reference density 2 2 δ sph δ sph scheme is a variant of wcsph model that introduces a specific diffusive term inside the continuity equation to reduce the high frequency spurious oscillations that generally affect the density pressure fields similar to the standard sph this method preserves the mass and the linear angular momentum molteni and colagrossi 2009 antuono et al 2015 this technique reduces the noise throughout the system of particles by filtering relatively large wave numbers from the density field which solves for the mass conservation of each particle molteni and colagrossi 2009 10 d ρ a dt b m b v ab a w

expanded into the first and second order contributions if the kernel is complete the first order is approximately zero while the second order is related to its diffusive nature antuono et al 2010 at open boundaries that a truncated kernel is present the first order term originates a net contribution if the case represents a very dynamic situation this term contributes with a force that may be too much smaller than the pressure and viscous terms therefore it does not have a significant contribution to degradation of the solution it should be noted that this approach is used for each liquid independently thus the computation of δ s p h term for each liquid does not comprise the other liquid 2 3 time stepping symplectic integration algorithms are time reversible in the absence of friction or viscous effects they also preserve the geometrical properties such as energy time reversal symmetry in the equations of motion this could improve the long term solution behavior in this research a second order symplectic scheme with an accuracy of o δ t 2 is used this scheme has a predictor and a corrector step the momentum ν a density ρ a and position x a are first written in the following form 11 d ν a dt f a 12 d ρ a dt d a 13 dx a dt ν a during the predictor step the acceleration and density are approximated at the middle of the time step 14 x a n 1 2 x a n δ t 2 ν a n ρ a n 1 2 ρ a n δ t 2 d a n where n denotes the time step and t n δ t during the corrector step d ν a n 1 2 dt is used to calculate the modified velocity and the position of the particles at the end of time step they are governed by the following equations 15 ν a n 1 ν a n 1 2 δt 2 f a n 1 2 x a n 1 x a n 1 2 δt 2 ν a n 1 finally the corrected density d ρ a n 1 dt d a n 1 is calculated using the updated ν a n 1 and x a n 1 in the explicit time integration schemes the time step depends on the cfl condition forcing terms and the viscous diffusion term a variable time step δ t is calculated from the following equations based on the above conditions as follows 16 δ t f cfl min δ t f δ t cv δ t f min a h f a δ t cv min a h c s max b h ν ab x ab x ab 2 η 2 where δ t f is based on the force per mass f a and δ t cv combines the viscous and courant time step controls 2 4 boundary conditions in this research the dynamic boundary condition is used the dynamic boundary particles satisfy the same equations as fluid particles however they don t move due to the forces applied to them when the distance between the fluid particle and boundary particles becomes less than 2 h the density of affected particles increases this in turn results in an increase in pressure due to the existence of the pressure term in the momentum equation a repulsive force is exerted on the fluid particles 3 validation of single liquid dam break model validation of the single liquid model was performed in three parts first the numerical results of a single liquid dam break over wet bed were compared with the experimental results following this simple case the single liquid dam break over a trapezoidal and a rectangular obstacle were investigated 3 1 single liquid dam break over wet bed in this section the single liquid dam break experimental work of kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 is used to validate the present numerical results the experimental setup as shown in fig 1 consisted of a rectangular flume with a length of 8 90 m a width of 0 30 m and a height of 0 3 m with a flat bed a gate with a thickness of 4 mm was located 4 65 m apart the left wall the water elevation behind the gate was 0 25 m at rest the ambient water length and depth were 4 25 m and 0 025 m respectively it should be noted that all the dimensions in this figure are in cm the plate removal time was between 0 06 and 0 08 s based on the study of lauber and hager 1998 a non dimensional removal period t t g h 0 smaller than 2 is defined as a sudden removal where g is the gravitational acceleration and h 0 is the reservoir water depth the non dimensional horizontal distance is defined as x x h 0 similar to the numerical study of ye et al 2016 a maximum velocity of 6 0 m s and a removal period of 0 07 s are considered for the simulation one of the key parameters in the computational cost of sph method is the distance between the particles and thus the total number of particles this distance should be chosen such that an appropriate number of particles exist in the depth of the fluid at the end of the downstream shakibaeinia and jin 2011 in order to investigate the effect of the number of particles in this test two different particle distances of 0 8 mm and 0 5 mm were used which result in 2014394 and 5126852 total number of particles respectively as fig 2 shows the δ sph results are generally in a good agreement with the experimental results especially at the initial stages of the dam break which is the main focus of this research however increasing the number of particles led to better agreement between the numerical and experimental results as the gate suddenly opens the water behind the dam rapidly released the water level increases and flood waves reach the probes then for a while the water level remains almost constant when the flood waves hit the right boundary they reflect in the opposite direction and form a reflected wave with highest depth a secondary rapid rise is occurred at different probes then non significant waves are observed on the free surface near the end wall having a small wavelengths and amplitudes because the volume of water is finite and no water enters the tank the water level drops gradually after the peak value in all probes the reflected waves in the probes near the right boundary occur earlier than the other probes the first and second rise in p6 occurs at t 14 345 and t 24 18 respectively for p2 the first and second rise occurs at t 1 and t 47 67 respectively thus the arrival time of flood wave from p2 to p6 is t 13 345 and the arrival time of the reflected wave from p6 to p2 is t 23 5 this shows that with reflection of the flood wave from vertical wall its energy dissipates and velocity of the flow decreases this is due to intense turbulence mixing into flow as the graphs show the maximum discrepancy between the numerical and experimental results occurs at the moment of rapid rises one possible reason for this could be the water splashing at these moments and the fact that the way we remove the gate is different from the way performed in the experimental work 3 2 single liquid dam break over obstacle in this section the numerical results of single phase dam break flow over two different obstacles including the trapezoidal and rectangular obstacles are validated using experimental data these two tests are performed in order to show the ability of the model in dam break simulation over different obstacles such as trapezoidal and rectangular obstacle 3 2 1 single liquid dam break over trapezoidal obstacle the experimental setup in this case ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 which is shown in fig 3 is similar to the previous test in fig 1 however a symmetrical trapezoidal obstacle with the height of 0 075 m and the base length of 1 0 m was located at a distance of 1 53 m apart the gate all the dimensions in this figure are in cm in order to simulate this problem a particle distance of 0 5 mm was used a qualitative comparison between the flow frames obtained by the experimental and numerical study of ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 with the present model is made in fig 4 as this figure shows the results obtained by the present model are closer to the experimental data especially when t 3 54 s the comparison between the free surface profiles of δ sph and the experiment is shown in fig 5 the flow depths h and horizontal distances x are non dimensionalized by the initial water depth h 0 and t t g h 0 is the non dimensional removal period it can be seen that the δ sph results are in good agreement with the experimental data which demonstrates the appropriate accuracy of the δ sph method in predicting the behavior of the dam break flow over obstacles it can be seen that there is a difference between the waveforms of numerical and experimental results at t 20 67 while the reflection of the flood wave from the obstacle results in a spilling type wave breaking in the experiment a breaking wave is formed in the δ sph results 3 2 2 single liquid dam break over rectangular obstacle this numerical test was performed to show the performance of δ sph model in representing the initial stages of the interaction of dam break flow with a vertical obstacle the experimental setup koshizuka et al 1995 which is shown in fig 6 consisted of a water column with the height of 2l and width of l and a bottom mounted rectangular obstacle which is located at the middle of the tank in order to evaluate the performance of the model in simulating dam break flow over rectangular obstacle the δ sph results are compared with experimental koshizuka et al 1995 and the two phase water air volume of fluid model issakhov et al 2018 as fig 7 shows there is a good agreement between the results of the present δ sph experimental and vof results at t 0 2 s when the flow reached the obstacle a wave was formed and the water column bounced in the opposite wall direction similar to vof result at t 0 3 s before the wave hit the right wall the elongated water jet formed a crescent shape in which the top of the water is inclined back to the center of the channel however both numerical results didn t represent the strong water splashes from the top of the water column which is visible in experimental results after t 0 4 s the water reaches the right wall and due to the gravity force started to fall down at t 0 5 s a bifurcation of the flow was observed in the experiment and vof results however the δ sph model was unable to properly represent this phenomenon 4 two liquid dam break flow in this section in order to demonstrate the ability of the numerical model to accurately simulate two liquid dam break flow the results of the δ sph method are compared with the experimental results of janosi et al 2004 the experimental set up is shown in fig 8 it consisted of a water tank separated from the downstream section by a gate the water depth behind the gate was 0 15 m the downstream channel contained peo solution with a concentration of 42 wppm viscosity 0 935 10 6 m 2 s a density close to that of fresh water and the depth of 0 015 m the gate opened with a constant velocity of 1 5 m s from the above total time of simulation was 0 5 s this time duration is selected based on the available experimental results in which the mixing process in initial steps of the dam break is considered as the focus of this paper is to simulate the initial stages of dam break where there is no reflected flow from the right wall only part of the whole channel 9 93 m is simulated this considerably saves the computational cost the total length of the simulated channel is 2 5 m and the length of the reservoir water column in 0 38 m which is exactly the same as in the experiment the height of the channel is 0 3 m to reach to a constant velocity for gate motion in practice the gate have an accelerating motion at least in a short portion of the time at the start of its movement ye et al 2016 derived an empirical gate motion formula using the experimental data of hu and sueyoshi 2010 and applied it in numerical study of the dam break flow based on their study the vertical displacement of the gate can be approximately divided into two periods 1 acceleration period and 2 uniform motion period which is expressed as 17 y t 1 2 a 0 t 2 t t 0 y t 1 2 a 0 t 0 2 v 0 t t 0 t t 0 in which y is the vertical position of the gate t is the time v 0 is the velocity of the uniform motion t 0 stands for the duration of the acceleration period and a 0 v 0 t 0 denotes the acceleration of the gate in the acceleration period ye et al 2016 set the maximum removal velocity v 0 equal to v gate 1 5 m s as the benchmark test in their numerical study the acceleration duration was set as t 0 0 01 s 4 1 validation of the two liquid numerical model considering the effect of particle distances in order to validate the two liquid numerical model the results of the model with different interparticle distances were compared with the experimental data of janosi et al 2004 to select the appropriate distance between the particles for use in simulations the mixing patterns obtained using three different interparticle distances these includes 0 0008 m 0 0003 m and 0 00028 m interparticle distances leading to 147750 1008162 and 1159496 total number of particles respectively the required run times were 11 158 and 221 min respectively to simulate each model with a real time of 0 5 s on a system with intel core i7 7800 3 5 ghz cpu an installed memory ram of 64 0 gb and a nvidia geforce gtx 1060 6 gb gpu with computing capability of 6 1 the results of the mixing patterns are presented in fig 9 as this figure shows the best agreement was obtained using the particle distances of 0 3 mm and 0 28 mm the case b in which the particle distance was 0 8 mm has failed to properly represent the formation of the negative wave at t 0 131 s and t 0 192 s at these times cases c and d represent more accurate mixing pattern than case b due to the fact that the computational cost and the time of the simulation increases by increasing the total number of particles the particle distance of 0 3 mm is selected for the rest of the simulations fig 9 c d shows that the main features such as the formation of mushroom like jet and wave breaking as discussed by ye et al 2016 are well reproduced by the δ sph technique although the projection of breaking wave front in sph result is more than that of the experimental one it is evident from these figures that the shape and size of the breaking wave and the mixing process is nearly the same as the experimental results the existence of a very small discrepancy between results may be due to the extra dimension in the experiments and the gate roughness which was ignored in the numerical model wave breaking leads to enhancing the turbulent mixing around the propagating front face as discussed by janosi et al 2004 the kinetic energy is enough to build up a second third and sometimes a fourth breaking event until a smooth propagating bore like perturbation form in our experiment at t 0 327 s this breaking wave hits the ambient water and forms a secondary wave the height of this secondary wave increases with time until it collapses by the loss of energy the numerical model predicted the height of this secondary wave at t 0 392 s and t 0 457 s more than that of the experimental results the velocity fields are depicted in fig 10 where the velocity magnitudes are in m s here we focus on the zone where the two liquids interact with each other based on the pervious discussions and as this figure shows a negative wave was formed at the very initial stages of the collision of two liquids at these times the minimum velocity occurs at the tip of the negative wave as the time passes by the type of the wave changed from negative to a progressing wave and the maximum velocity generally occurs at the front of the progressing wave in dam break flood waves turbulence is usually generated through either bottom friction or wave breaking here over time the flow becomes more turbulent and the maximum velocity is concentrated near the breaking zone 4 2 validation of the two liquid numerical δ sph models in this section a comparison is made between the results of the δ sph and the standard wcsph schemes to show the efficiency of the former method fig 11 shows the mixing patterns of two liquids in different times for two models and experimental one janosi et al 2004 as can be seen in this figure the use of δ sph scheme leads to a better agreement with the experimental result also as it is evident in this figure from t 0 261 s there is a bore in the middle of the fluid domain in the experimental snapshots the δ sph model could successfully represent this bore while the standard wcsph model failed to reproduce it fig 12 shows that the front propagation of water peo solution interface obtained by δ sph scheme is slightly smaller than standard wcsph scheme 4 3 effect of ambient water depth on two liquid dam break flow in the wet bed dam break experiment by opening the gate the ambient water is dragged up by the reservoir water at this time the still ambient water resists to the drag and thus the wave front is broken and a jet is formed in downstream according to the previous studies stansby et al 1998 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 wave breaking is delayed with increasing the depth ratio therefore maximum turbulence and air entrainment were formed for the minimum water depth ratio in order to investigate the effects of the water depth ratio on the mixing pattern and front propagation of the water peo interface three different initial ambient water depths h 1 3 5 8 a n d 7 c m were simulated and the results are presented for two different time instances of t 1 0 3 s and t 2 0 6 s different combinations of ambient water depth and time instances are summarized in table 1 in fig 13 the δ sph results are analysed against the experimental results of janosi et al 2004 the wcsph result of jian et al 2015 and the vof results of ye and zhao 2017 at t 0 3 s the δ sph and vof results demonstrate a better agreement with the experimental data than wcsph results however for the positive wave front both sph results show more projected wave front than the experimental one this figure clearly shows that at t 0 6 s the δ sph result has the best agreement with the experimental data a comparison between the mixing patterns for different ambient water depths at different time instances is depicted in fig 14 as this figure shows increasing the ambient water depth alternates the mixing pattern and the breaking type of the flood wave as changed from the plunging to the spilling one it is due to the fact that as the water depth decreases the gradient of hydrostatic pressure between the reservoir water and the ambient water increases resulting in faster wave propagation this figure also confirms the conclusion of the previous studies stansby et al 1998 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 concerning about the forward wave breaking delay as the water depth increases however the backward breaking occurs approximately at the same time for these cases the effect of the water depth ratio on the front propagation of the water peo solution interface is shown in fig 15 it is evident from this figure that increasing the water depth ratio results to slower wave front propagation it is due to the effect of resistance in water column of larger depth 4 4 effects of the gate parameters on two liquid dam break flow in this section different parameters such as the presence of the gate gate thickness upward gate velocity and its type of motion are investigated 4 4 1 effect of the presence of the gate recent dam break studies such as ye et al 2016 revealed that the gate has a significant effect on the water collapse process and cannot be neglected in dam break studies analytical studies have used the idea of sudden removal of the gate which is not possible in practice in these studies a system to remove the gate in an extremely short time was designed to approximate the sudden removal in this way the effect of the moving gate can be ignored however in most numerical studies the gate motion is seldom considered and the entire water column has been subjected to sudden collapse as soon as the calculations begin in reality during the release time the forward movement of the water is somehow prevented by the gate also the gate moves upward with the strong shear force applied to the gate and fluid interface including an interaction between water air and gate causing jets and splashes onto the main body of water ye et al 2016 fig 16 demonstrates the mixing patterns in dam break evolution in different time steps with and without gate as this figure shows considering the presence of the gate has a significant effect on the mixing pattern results by removing the gate the whole reservoir water suddenly collapses once the simulation begins it leads to an oblique movement of the water peo solution interface towards the downstream the reverse flow does not form in the absence of a gate restriction and a jet flow is formed towards the downstream and breaks by inserting the gate the friction between the gate and water causes an upward movement of the water near the gate and the interaction between the gate and the two bodies of water can lead to complex free surface motions also the formation of a reverse flow at the crest a time difference in formation and breaking process and creation of various patterns such as mushroom like jets are observed however the snapshots at t 0 392 s and t 0 457 shows that as the time passes by the mixing patterns obtained with and without gate become resemble hence the effect of the gate is more important at the very initial stages of the dam break a bore is also presented in both cases that its height increases by removing the gate fig 17 shows the effect of the gate restriction on the front propagation of water peo solution interface as it is evident removing the gate led to faster propagation of the interface 4 4 2 effect of gate thickness in this section the mixing pattern and front propagation of water peo interface obtained by four different values of gate thickness are compared to show the effect of this parameter as fig 18 shows increasing the gate thickness resulted in more violent free surface at t 0 131 s where splash is observed at the top of the jet flow by increasing the gate thickness the gap between the reservoir water and the ambient water peo solution increases the thicker the gate the more time required for the reservoir and ambient fluids collision this leads to higher velocities for each liquid hence the velocity of the jet flow will be larger and less time is required for jet formation and breaking phenomenon these conclusions are in line with the findings of ye and zhao 2017 on the effects of gate thickness on the mixing pattern fig 19 presents the front propagation of water peo interface with different gate thicknesses versus t it is evident from this figure that increasing the gate thickness does not have a significant effect on the front propagation of water peo solution interface 4 4 3 effect of the velocity of the gate mixing patterns at different instances for different gate removal velocities are presented in fig 20 it is evident in this figure that as the gate velocity increases the speed of the wave formation and propagation increases and the water peo solution interface becomes more oriented to the downstream direction while as the gate velocity decreases more ambient water comes up towards the upstream direction associated with more inverse flow for the gate removal velocities of v0 3 0 and 5 0 m s where the removal duration is much less than the criterion of a sudden removal the mixing patterns are similar to those of without gates for cases a and b a reverse flow occurs while for cases c and d there is a positive wave at t 0 131 s as it can be seen from fig 21 the front propagation of the water peo interface is almost similar for cases a c a comparison between figs 20 and 21 shows that the gate velocity has a significant effect on the mixing pattern while its effect on the front propagation of the water peo solution interface is negligible 4 4 4 effect of the gate motion type as mentioned previously ye et al 2016 derived a two step formula for the gate motion in this section the effect of the gate motion using proposed formula is assessed the maximum removal velocity v 0 v gate 1 5 m s as the benchmark test was considered by ye et al 2016 in their numerical study the acceleration duration was set as t 0 0 01 s fig 22 shows the mixing patterns for two different gate motions as it is evident in this figure the type of the gate motion has a significant effect on the mixing patterns at different times in initial stages of simulation process the accelerated motion is more consistent with the experiment fig 23 presents the interface front propagation for different types of motion it can be seen in this figure that the front propagation of the water peo solution interface obtained from both types of motion are almost identical 5 two liquid dam break flow in the presence of different obstacles as mentioned earlier in the introduction the dam break flow is usually propagated over a complex domain topography which further complicates the flow pattern the uneven topography of the downstream channel has a significant effect in determining the maximum flow depth flood wave propagation velocity and the flow regime it also causes a negative wave in upstream direction and can increase the flow depth and change the flow patterns ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 in this section the interaction of two liquid dam break flow with different obstacles including semi circular rectangular and triangular shapes is presented 5 1 two liquid dam break flow in the presence of semi circular obstacle this profile is an idealized example for water or oil pipelines different test conditions for this type of obstacle sc1 sc4 are summarized in table 2 fig 24 shows the mixing patterns in the presence of different semicircular obstacles as fig 24 shows the presence and the dimensions of the obstacle does not have a significant effect on the mixing pattern until the flow reaches the obstacle the mixing pattern in this case is similar to the classic two liquid dam break as the time passes by the mixture strikes the semicircle obstacle and passes over it from this time on the mixing pattern of sc1 and sc3 cases was different which shows the effect of the dimension of the obstacle increasing the radius of the obstacle increases the flow depth behind and on the obstacle while a separation phenomenon occurred in both cases in case sc1 the lower part of the breaking wave hit the obstacle though the tongue of the wave didn t experience the presence of the obstacle and hit the second liquid just after the obstacle in case sc3 where the radius of the semi circle is doubled both the lower part and the tongue of the breaking wave hit the obstacle the flow slipped on the obstacle and a long jet was formed that eventually collapsed with the loss of energy a comparison between the sc1 and sc2 shows that increasing the thickness of the ambient water changes the mixing pattern delays the breaking process and therefore eliminates the separation on the barrier in our case the existing difference between sc3 and sc4 shows the effect of the gate velocity on the mixing pattern the figure shows that increasing the gate velocity speeds up the flow until the collision with the obstacle occurs after the collision the horizontal distance of the jet slightly decreases for the case with higher gate velocity fig 25 shows velocity fields for cases sc3 and sc4 in different instances the velocity magnitudes in m s this figure shows that the maximum fluid velocity belongs to the front of the water peo solution interface in the case of the positive wave the maximum velocity occurs at the tongue of the breaking wave however similar to classic two liquid dam break in the case of negative wave the minimum velocity belongs to the tip of the negative wave as it was expected a zone with the minimum velocity is formed just before the obstacle fig 26 shows the front propagation of the water peo solution interface with different ambient water depths sc1 and sc2 where increasing the ambient water depth leads to a decrease in front propagation fig 27 shows the effect of gate velocity on front propagation of the water peo solution interface in the presence of a semi circular obstacle a comparison between fig 27 a and b indicates that as the obstacle radius increases the effect of the gate velocity on the front propagation of the water peo solution interface is more considerable fig 28 shows that increasing the radius of the semi circular water peo solution obstacle causes a slight increase on the front propagation of the water peo solution interface furthermore as fig 24 shows increasing the obstacle radius leads to an increase in jet height 5 2 two liquid dam break flow in the presence of rectangular obstacle rectangular obstacle is a common shape in hydraulic engineering and marine hydrodynamics cofferdams and bridge piers are among the applications of this profile different test conditions for this type of obstacle are summarized in table 3 as fig 29 shows the separation occurs for all the rectangular obstacles comparison of mixing patterns in the presence of r2 and r3 shows that the width of the rectangular obstacle had no significant effect on the maximum jet height and the maximum front propagation of the interface as well as the mixing pattern except at t 0 392 and t 0 457 s when a branch of the mixture hits the obstacle this figure also shows that for lower obstacle where the breaking wave did not hit the structure jet formation and the bifurcation of the flow was not observed in that case the flow depth is lower the more water passed the obstacle and more violent condition at the downstream of the obstacle was observed fig 30 shows the velocity fields for different test conditions in the presence of the rectangular obstacle the velocity magnitudes in m s similar to semi circular obstacle a zone with the minimum flow velocity is formed behind the obstacle for the positive wave the maximum velocity belongs to the jet front a comparison between fig 30 a and b reveals that for the identical gate removal velocity the velocity field is completely changes by changing the height of the obstacle again the maximum flow velocity belongs to the wave front it also shows that doubling the gate removal velocity results in a slight increase in the flow velocity field a comparison between figs 31 and 32 shows that increasing the height of the obstacle amplifies the effect of the gate velocity on the front propagation a comparison between figs 32 and 33 shows that changing the obstacle length does not have a significant effect on the front propagation fig 34 shows that for the identical gate removal velocity increasing the height of the obstacle decreases the front propagation of water peo interface 5 3 two liquid dam break flow in the presence of triangular obstacle triangular obstacle is an idealized representation of obstacles with steep slopes different test conditions for triangle obstacle are summarized in table 4 the width of the triangular base of obstacle is set to 0 1 m for all cases fig 35 shows that similar to semi circular and rectangular obstacles the breaking wave in t2 which is less elevated does not hit the structure and the mixture passes the obstacle and breaks shortly after it whereas the breaking in t1 and t3 occurs on the structure leading to an upward jet and bifurcation this figure also shows that similar to rectangular and semi circular obstacles the maximum flow depth increases by increasing the height of the obstacle fig 36 shows the velocity fields for different test conditions velocity magnitudes in m s it is evident from this figure that similar to previous cases the maximum flow velocity belongs to the wave front while a zone with minimum velocity is formed just behind the obstacle comparison of figs 37 and 38 shows that changing the height of the triangular obstacle has little effect on the maximum wave propagation comparison of figs 39 and 40 shows that increasing the velocity of the gate result in a little amplification on the effect of the obstacle height on front propagation of water peo interface 5 4 discussions on the maximum values of horizontal and vertical water interface in this section a comparison is made between the maximum values of horizontal and vertical propagation of water peo solution interface between different cases the following results can be drawn from figs 41 and 42 one of the most important factors affecting the jet height is the obstacle shape the results revealed that the sharper the edges of the obstacle the higher the jet or flow height generally the maximum jet height belongs to rectangular triangular and semi circular obstacle respectively the effect of the ambient water depth was only investigated for semi circular obstacle the comparison of the front propagation of the water peo solution interface between the semi circular obstacles shows that similar to the no obstacle case by increasing the ambient water depth the front propagation of the water peo solution interface decreases this is evident by comparing results of front propagation of the water peo solution interface sc2 and sc5 cases with other semi circular obstacle the gate removal velocity has a direct relationship with the front propagation of water peo solution interface in the presence of the semi circular obstacle but it doesn t have a considerable effect on the maximum jet height with the same ambient water depth the maximum jet height for semicircular obstacle is affected by the radius of this obstacle it means that the higher the obstacle the higher jet height is formed this conclusion is drawn by comparing the maximum jet heights for the pairs of sc1 and sc6 lower obstacles with sc3 and sc4 higher obstacles for the rectangular obstacles the maximum jet height depends greatly on the height of the obstacle while it does not depend on the width of the rectangle this conclusion is drawn by comparing the maximum jet heights for r2 r3 r5 and r6 higher obstacles with r1 and r4 lower obstacles fig 41 reveals that the maximum front propagation of the water peo solution interface in the presence of a rectangular obstacle have a direct relationship with the gate removal velocity this is despite the fact that the removal velocity doesn t have a considerable effect on the maximum jet height for the triangular section increasing the height results to an increase in the maximum jet height while it doesn t have a considerable effect on the front propagation 6 conclusion in this paper the δ sph approach was used to investigate the mixing pattern and front propagation of water peo solution interface over wet bed and in the presence of different obstacles in order to validate the results the model was first applied to the single liquid problems including the dam break over wet bed and on the barrier the model was then applied to a two liquid dam break problem comparison of the results with the experimental data confirmed the validity and accuracy of the model in the light of most important results the following conclusions can be drawn the results of the mixing patterns of the water peo solution interface in the absence of any gate were dramatically different from the gate presence case as well as the experimental results therefore the numerical studies should consider the effect of the gate movement considering the gate motion type shows that using the two step accelerated motion resulted in better agreement with the experimental mixing pattern than the constant velocity compared to the standard wcsph method the use of δ sph formulation resulted in a smoother mixing pattern leading to better agreement with the experimental mixing pattern increasing the ambient water depth resulted in a change in wave breaking type from plunging to spilling breaker it also led to a decrease in front propagation of the water peo solution interface as the gate speed increases the formation and the slope of the water peo solution interface get closer towards downstream the model was then used to simulate the two liquid dam break flow interaction with different obstacles the following results were evident from the simulations the presence of the obstacle does not have a significant effect on the mixing pattern until the flow reaches the obstacle in this case the mixing pattern is similar to the classic two liquid dam break the presence of the obstacle increases the effect of the gate velocity on the front propagation of the water peo solution interface in the case of the semi circular obstacle the separation phenomenon started from the upper part of the obstacle increasing the height of the obstacle causes that both the lower part and the tongue of the breaking wave hit the obstacle the flow slips on the obstacle and a long jet is formed that eventually collapses with the loss of energy it also increases the flow depth and decreases the front propagation of the water peo solution interface the width of the rectangular obstacle has minor effect on the maximum jet height and the maximum front propagation of the interface as well as the mixing pattern except at t 0 392 and t 0 457 s when a branch of the mixture hits the obstacle while decreasing the height of the obstacle reduces the jet height and prevents the bifurcation of the flow it results in lower maximum flow depths more water passing the obstacle and more violent condition at the downstream of the obstacle in all of obstacles the minimum flow velocity was observed in a zone just behind the obstacle the maximum velocity belongs to the jet front and especially the tongue of the breaking wave the most important factor affecting the maximum jet height in the presence of an obstacle is the obstacle shape and the sharper edges cause higher jets increasing the ambient water depth results in decreasing the front propagation of

21631,in this research two liquid dam break induced mixing process in the presence of different obstacles was modeled using δ sph method water and polyetilenoxid peo were used as two different newtonian fluids the model was validated using laboratory data including single liquid dam break over wet bed and over triangular and rectangular obstacles as well as two liquid dam break then the effect of various parameters such as ambient water depth and gate motion characteristics on mixing pattern and front propagation of water peo interface were investigated the results show the necessity of considering the gate in numerical simulation furthermore a two step formula for gate motion consisting accelerated phase and a uniform velocity phase was used leading to increasing the accuracy of the results finally the flow simulation was performed to evaluate and compare the mixing pattern front propagation of water peo solution interface as well as maximum flow height in the presence of three different obstacles keywords dam break with obstacle two liquid mixing jet formation δ sph model 1 introduction dam break is the result of an instantaneous uncontrollable releasing of a large reservoir which can be considered as a semi infinite volume of water in a short time as a kind of complex rapidly varying unsteady flows it can lead to numerous casualties and damages yang et al 2010 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 duricic et al 2013 issakhov and imanberdiyeva 2019 it can also generate intense flooding wave leading to rapid geomorphic change erosion and sediment transport in this process the maximum flow depths wave propagation velocity and the flow regime highly depend on the irregular topography of the downstream channel in practice such an irregular topography is caused by debris in river bed such as buildings and bridges in urban areas which act as an obstacle to the flow they may increase the water depth and change the flow pattern the spatial and temporal variations of the water depth and velocity during a dam break event are important parameters in preparation of emergency action plans singh et al 2011 predicting the evolution of free surface water depths and wave arrival times of a dam break is of a great importance to reduce loss of life and flood damages ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 so in recent years great efforts are concentrated on the development of numerical methods for the simulation of this problem immediately after the dam break complicated mixing process occurs where the reservoir water and ambient water interface capturing is very cumbersome during the initial dam break stages wave breaking and turbulence are dominant and the pressure is not hydrostatic also vertical accelerations affect the flow conditions close to the wave front just after dam break ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 during the release time the gate acts as an obstacle to the upstream water and blocks the water from moving forward the moving gate also comes upwards with strong shear force on the gate fluid interface including an interaction between water air and gate which generates jets and splashes onto the main water body lobovsky et al 2014 ye et al 2016 these issues further complicate the dam break flow by now dam break problem as a standard free surface flow test case is the issue of considerable experimental analytical and numerical studies by the hydraulic engineers and researchers apart from a number of experimental studies ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 lobovsky et al 2014 kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 simulation of the single liquid

dam break over wet bed the process of dam break flow in the presence of a wet bed is more complicated than that of a dry bed as it strongly depends on the interaction between the reservoir and ambient fluids this process associated with free surface deformation as well as the mixing between reservoir and ambient fluids crespo et al 2008 since the single liquid models do not distinguish between the reservoir and ambient fluids they are unable to reproduce the mixing pattern therefore for this case a multi liquid model with the ability to reproduce the dam break evolution as well as the interface between the two fluids is required there are two general numerical frames i e eulerian and lagrangian description for modeling interfacial flows the difficulties in the calculation of interface breaking or merging and surface tension force near the interface makes the numerical modelling of interfacial flows a challenging task in eulerian description and improper methods can cause significant mass loss in order to solve the problems of interfacial flows interface tracking and capturing methods have been utilized in interface tracking methods the interface is tracked using a moving surface mesh and the modelling of the interface deformation is performed by adopting an expensive re meshing procedure interface capturing methods are able to capture strong topological changes with relative ease such as break up and merger of bubbles or droplets the two common interface capturing methods are vof and ls methods in which a scalar indicator function is used to distinguish two liquids in the computational domain gu et al 2019 in the ls method a continuous function which is defined as the signed distance to the interface is used to distinguish the two liquids separated by the interface the resolved velocity field is used to solve the advection equation to obtain the evolution of the interface and a re initialization procedure is performed to ensure that the advected ls function remains a signed distance function the advantage of the ls method is that its function is smooth which in turn simplifies the calculation of the interface curvature since the zero ls may deviate from the real position during the simulation ls method may result in significant mass loss or gain this problem can be reduced by adopting a high resolution scheme in the vof method a discontinuous volume fraction function that refers to the volume fraction occupied by the liquid within each cell is utilized due to the discontinuity of the vof function across the interface calculating the interface curvature is very cumbersome there are two kinds of vof methods for advection of the volume fraction one is the algebraic vof method in which the vof field is transported by a convective term using discretization methods if a high resolution advection scheme is used to approximate the convective term in the vof transport equation interface smearing is evident which reduces the accuracy on the interface another vof method uses the volume fraction and interface normal to define and reconstruct the interface location within a cell to overcome this problem methods such as simple line interface calculation slic piecewise linear interface calculation plic and weighted line interface calculation wlic can be used to reconstruct the interface gu et al 2018 generally in vof method the navier stokes n s equations are solved on a fixed eulerian grid which leads to some problems of numerical diffusion arise from advection terms in the n s equations this becomes more severe in problems with large free surface deformation where the treatment procedures of the surface cells for capturing the sharpness of the surface becomes complicated xu 2016 also a very small computational grid is required to recover the liquid surface using vof method which leads to very high computational cost issakhov et al 2018 in order to overcome the difficulties of vof and ls methods a clsvof has been used which makes advantage of both the mass conservation of vof and the continuous function description of ls in this method initialization and correction are carried out on the whole field of ls function and vof function however they are more complicated and computationally expensive compared to vof and ls methods advantages of ls method are easily calculating the normality and curvature of the interface as well as easily handling topography changes by implementing a higher order advection scheme such as fvm or fdm gu et al 2018 however deterioration in predicted ls solutions were reported due to the numerical dissipation and dispersion also to maintain the ls function as a signed distance function a re initialization procedure is required another disadvantage of this method is gaining or losing a small amount of mass when the zero ls is changed another set of cfd methods are mesh free particle lagrangian methods with great modeling advantage in applications with large interfacial deformations and fragmentations the particle methods employ a set of discrete particles or nodes to represent and record the state and movement of the system in a lagrangian frame and possess the field variables such as velocity and pressure unlike the mesh based methods that have some problems arising from mesh adaptability and connectivity particle methods are able to deal with any kind of boundary and interface deformations and fragmentations shakibaeinia and jin 2011 in meshfree methods the continuum is represented by a set of particles that are free to move based on the material velocity each particle possesses a set of field variable such as mass position velocity and pressure two most common particle methods are sph and mps method although these two methods are similar in some aspects there are two main differences between them the gradient of a function in sph is calculated using the gradient of the weighting function however in mps method it is calculated using algebraic operators with the weight function also the mps is independent of parameters that usually requires appropriate tuning such as artificial viscosity in sph abdelrazek et al 2014 sph is a particle method in which the time history of the material particles can be obtained and the advection and transport of the system can thus be calculated the free surfaces material interfaces and moving boundaries can all be traced naturally in the process of simulation regardless the complicity of the movement of the particles which have been very challenging to many eulerian methods and thus sph is an ideal choice for modeling free surface and interfacial flow problems liu and liu 2010 compared to mesh based methods sph interactions are carried out between a given particle and its moving neighbors these neighboring particles are unknown since they change at each instant one of the main drawbacks of the sph method is its high computational cost when number of particles increases the simulation of real problems requires a high resolution with millions of particles so that it may take several days to simulate a problem with a real time of few seconds by this method in recent years high performance computing techniques are utilized to reduce the computational times of sph the main techniques used to accelerate sph are open multi processing openmp that is the best option to optimize the performance of the multiple cores of the current cpus message passing interface mpi that is the best option to combine the resource of multiple machines connected via network and general purpose computing on graphics processing units gpgpu that involves the study and use of parallel computing ability of a gpu to perform general purpose programs dominguez 2014 gpus are powerful parallel processors designed for graphics rendering and their computing power has been increased much faster than cpus gpus provide a high calculation power with very low cost and without expensive infrastructures however an efficient and full use of the capabilities of the gpus is not straightforward a detailed description of the sph method is presented in the following sections the main focus of this research is to study the mixing pattern for different fluids in two sides of a dam in the presence of different obstacles it is evident from the broad literature as above that although there are considerable investigations on single liquid dam break and its interaction with obstacles there are a few studies on interfacial dam break as a pioneering experimental work janosi et al 2004 performed experimental studies on dam break flow using two different liquids khayyer and gotoh 2010 studied the dam break problem using two different liquids applying mps isph and wcsph methods shakibaeinia and jin 2011 studied the dam break problem on fixed and mobile bed using wcmps method swartenbroekx et al 2013 proposed a two layer finite volume model to study the dam break flows over mobile beds qihua et al 2015 used isph method for studying scouring in sediment bed and movement of sediments due to dam break flow wcsph method was used to model the multi phase problem of scouring resulted by rapid flows fourtakas and rogers 2016 in this paper δ sph model crespo et al 2015 is used to investigate the two liquid mixing process without and with the obstacles the model is implemented in c and cuda and it is designed to launch simulations on a gpu the code was first validated by different test cases including the single liquid dam break over wet bed single liquid dam break over two types of obstacles as well as qualitative comparison with the experimental results of a two liquid dam break then the effect of various parameters such as the ambient water depth and the gate motion parameters on the mixing pattern and front propagation of water peo solution interface are discussed finally the effect of different obstacle shapes on the mixing pattern front propagation of water peo interface and the jet formation of the two liquid flow is investigated 2 the sph method in this section the governing equations and basis of sph numerical method are presented 2 1 sph basis and governing equations smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph is a meshfree lagrangian method which was first introduced by lucy 1977 gingold and monaghan 1977 to simulate astrophysical problems this method doesn t need a grid to calculate the spatial derivatives these derivatives are represented by analytical differentiation of interpolation functions monaghan 1992 in sph a continuum is discretized into a set of particles that advect with the fluid velocity in a lagrangian manner holmes et al 2011 based on the physical properties of neighboring particles the discretized n s equations are locally integrated at the location of each particle crespo et al 2015 the next step is to approximate the values of the field functions and their derivatives at any point liu and liu 2003 the weighted contribution of the neighboring particles is calculated according to their distance from the desired particle using a kernel function w and a smoothing length h in which a set of neighboring particles are identified in each time step the new physical quantities are calculated for each particle and they move based on the updated quantities the first and second steps in sph are the integral representation of field functions and the particle approximation respectively in the first step the integration of the multiplication of an arbitrary function and a smoothing kernel w gives the kernel approximation in the form of integral representation of the function liu and liu 2003 the kernel function is designed so that represents a function a x which is identified in x by integral estimation 1 a x a x w x x h d x the performance of the sph model highly depends on the choice of the smoothing function this kernel function should be differentiable be positive in a defined interaction zone has a compact support and monotonically decreases with increasing distance liu and liu 2003 next the particle approximation is performed to represent the entire system by a finite number of particles that carry individual mass and occupy individual space the continuous integral representation can be converted into discretized forms of summation over all the particles inside the compact support domain which is defined by the smoothing length 2 a x a b a x b w x a x b h δ v b where the subscript a points to an individual particle δ v b m b ρ b is the volume of the neighboring particle b and m and ρ denote mass and density respectively so eq 2 is written in the following form 3 a x a b a x b m b ρ b w x a x b h in this research a quintic kernel is used which is expressed as 4 w x h α d 1 q 2 4 2 q 1 0 q 2 where α d 7 4 π h 2 in 2 d q x h is a non dimensional distance between any two given particles where x is the distance between particles a and b and h is the smoothing length which controls the size of the area around particle a where the neighboring particles are considered in this zone the momentum conservation equation is as follows 5 dv dt 1 ρ p g γ where γ refers to dissipative terms and g is the gravity acceleration in the multi liquid formulation the momentum equation is written as follows 6 dv a dt b m b p b p a ρ b ρ a a w ab 1 ρ τ g where p k and ρ k are the pressure and density correspond to particle k and the brackets denote an sph approximation in order to discretize the viscous forces the following formulation is used 7 1 ρ τ a υ a p p 2 v a b m b υ a υ b x a b a w a b ρ b x a b 2 0 001 h 2 v a b where υ app is the apparent kinematic viscosity and 0 01 h 2 is included to keep the denominator nonzero the continuity equation in its multi liquid form is written as eq 8 in which the terms of the density ratios of the interpolating and neighboring particles allowing different densities to be used 8 d ρ a dt ρ a b m b ρ b v ab a w ab in this approach the fluid behaves as a weakly compressible and the equation of state is used for estimation of the fluid pressure the compressibility is adjusted to slow down the speed of sound so that the size of the time step at each moment could be maintained at a reasonable value crespo et al 2015 however such an adjustment limits the speed of sound to be at least ten times faster than the maximum velocity of the fluid maintains the density changes in the range of 1 and does not introduce any major difference from an incompressible approach the equation of state is written as the following form 9 p b ρ ρ 0 γ 1 where γ 7 b c 0 2 ρ 0 γ ρ 0 1000 kg m 3 is the reference density and c 0 c ρ 0 p ρ ρ 0 is the speed of sound at the reference density 2 2 δ sph δ sph scheme is a variant of wcsph model that introduces a specific diffusive term inside the continuity equation to reduce the high frequency spurious oscillations that generally affect the density pressure fields similar to the standard sph this method preserves the mass and the linear angular momentum molteni and colagrossi 2009 antuono et al 2015 this technique reduces the noise throughout the system of particles by filtering relatively large wave numbers from the density field which solves for the mass conservation of each particle molteni and colagrossi 2009 10 d ρ a dt b m b v ab a w

expanded into the first and second order contributions if the kernel is complete the first order is approximately zero while the second order is related to its diffusive nature antuono et al 2010 at open boundaries that a truncated kernel is present the first order term originates a net contribution if the case represents a very dynamic situation this term contributes with a force that may be too much smaller than the pressure and viscous terms therefore it does not have a significant contribution to degradation of the solution it should be noted that this approach is used for each liquid independently thus the computation of δ s p h term for each liquid does not comprise the other liquid 2 3 time stepping symplectic integration algorithms are time reversible in the absence of friction or viscous effects they also preserve the geometrical properties such as energy time reversal symmetry in the equations of motion this could improve the long term solution behavior in this research a second order symplectic scheme with an accuracy of o δ t 2 is used this scheme has a predictor and a corrector step the momentum ν a density ρ a and position x a are first written in the following form 11 d ν a dt f a 12 d ρ a dt d a 13 dx a dt ν a during the predictor step the acceleration and density are approximated at the middle of the time step 14 x a n 1 2 x a n δ t 2 ν a n ρ a n 1 2 ρ a n δ t 2 d a n where n denotes the time step and t n δ t during the corrector step d ν a n 1 2 dt is used to calculate the modified velocity and the position of the particles at the end of time step they are governed by the following equations 15 ν a n 1 ν a n 1 2 δt 2 f a n 1 2 x a n 1 x a n 1 2 δt 2 ν a n 1 finally the corrected density d ρ a n 1 dt d a n 1 is calculated using the updated ν a n 1 and x a n 1 in the explicit time integration schemes the time step depends on the cfl condition forcing terms and the viscous diffusion term a variable time step δ t is calculated from the following equations based on the above conditions as follows 16 δ t f cfl min δ t f δ t cv δ t f min a h f a δ t cv min a h c s max b h ν ab x ab x ab 2 η 2 where δ t f is based on the force per mass f a and δ t cv combines the viscous and courant time step controls 2 4 boundary conditions in this research the dynamic boundary condition is used the dynamic boundary particles satisfy the same equations as fluid particles however they don t move due to the forces applied to them when the distance between the fluid particle and boundary particles becomes less than 2 h the density of affected particles increases this in turn results in an increase in pressure due to the existence of the pressure term in the momentum equation a repulsive force is exerted on the fluid particles 3 validation of single liquid dam break model validation of the single liquid model was performed in three parts first the numerical results of a single liquid dam break over wet bed were compared with the experimental results following this simple case the single liquid dam break over a trapezoidal and a rectangular obstacle were investigated 3 1 single liquid dam break over wet bed in this section the single liquid dam break experimental work of kocaman and ozmen cagatay 2015 is used to validate the present numerical results the experimental setup as shown in fig 1 consisted of a rectangular flume with a length of 8 90 m a width of 0 30 m and a height of 0 3 m with a flat bed a gate with a thickness of 4 mm was located 4 65 m apart the left wall the water elevation behind the gate was 0 25 m at rest the ambient water length and depth were 4 25 m and 0 025 m respectively it should be noted that all the dimensions in this figure are in cm the plate removal time was between 0 06 and 0 08 s based on the study of lauber and hager 1998 a non dimensional removal period t t g h 0 smaller than 2 is defined as a sudden removal where g is the gravitational acceleration and h 0 is the reservoir water depth the non dimensional horizontal distance is defined as x x h 0 similar to the numerical study of ye et al 2016 a maximum velocity of 6 0 m s and a removal period of 0 07 s are considered for the simulation one of the key parameters in the computational cost of sph method is the distance between the particles and thus the total number of particles this distance should be chosen such that an appropriate number of particles exist in the depth of the fluid at the end of the downstream shakibaeinia and jin 2011 in order to investigate the effect of the number of particles in this test two different particle distances of 0 8 mm and 0 5 mm were used which result in 2014394 and 5126852 total number of particles respectively as fig 2 shows the δ sph results are generally in a good agreement with the experimental results especially at the initial stages of the dam break which is the main focus of this research however increasing the number of particles led to better agreement between the numerical and experimental results as the gate suddenly opens the water behind the dam rapidly released the water level increases and flood waves reach the probes then for a while the water level remains almost constant when the flood waves hit the right boundary they reflect in the opposite direction and form a reflected wave with highest depth a secondary rapid rise is occurred at different probes then non significant waves are observed on the free surface near the end wall having a small wavelengths and amplitudes because the volume of water is finite and no water enters the tank the water level drops gradually after the peak value in all probes the reflected waves in the probes near the right boundary occur earlier than the other probes the first and second rise in p6 occurs at t 14 345 and t 24 18 respectively for p2 the first and second rise occurs at t 1 and t 47 67 respectively thus the arrival time of flood wave from p2 to p6 is t 13 345 and the arrival time of the reflected wave from p6 to p2 is t 23 5 this shows that with reflection of the flood wave from vertical wall its energy dissipates and velocity of the flow decreases this is due to intense turbulence mixing into flow as the graphs show the maximum discrepancy between the numerical and experimental results occurs at the moment of rapid rises one possible reason for this could be the water splashing at these moments and the fact that the way we remove the gate is different from the way performed in the experimental work 3 2 single liquid dam break over obstacle in this section the numerical results of single phase dam break flow over two different obstacles including the trapezoidal and rectangular obstacles are validated using experimental data these two tests are performed in order to show the ability of the model in dam break simulation over different obstacles such as trapezoidal and rectangular obstacle 3 2 1 single liquid dam break over trapezoidal obstacle the experimental setup in this case ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 which is shown in fig 3 is similar to the previous test in fig 1 however a symmetrical trapezoidal obstacle with the height of 0 075 m and the base length of 1 0 m was located at a distance of 1 53 m apart the gate all the dimensions in this figure are in cm in order to simulate this problem a particle distance of 0 5 mm was used a qualitative comparison between the flow frames obtained by the experimental and numerical study of ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 with the present model is made in fig 4 as this figure shows the results obtained by the present model are closer to the experimental data especially when t 3 54 s the comparison between the free surface profiles of δ sph and the experiment is shown in fig 5 the flow depths h and horizontal distances x are non dimensionalized by the initial water depth h 0 and t t g h 0 is the non dimensional removal period it can be seen that the δ sph results are in good agreement with the experimental data which demonstrates the appropriate accuracy of the δ sph method in predicting the behavior of the dam break flow over obstacles it can be seen that there is a difference between the waveforms of numerical and experimental results at t 20 67 while the reflection of the flood wave from the obstacle results in a spilling type wave breaking in the experiment a breaking wave is formed in the δ sph results 3 2 2 single liquid dam break over rectangular obstacle this numerical test was performed to show the performance of δ sph model in representing the initial stages of the interaction of dam break flow with a vertical obstacle the experimental setup koshizuka et al 1995 which is shown in fig 6 consisted of a water column with the height of 2l and width of l and a bottom mounted rectangular obstacle which is located at the middle of the tank in order to evaluate the performance of the model in simulating dam break flow over rectangular obstacle the δ sph results are compared with experimental koshizuka et al 1995 and the two phase water air volume of fluid model issakhov et al 2018 as fig 7 shows there is a good agreement between the results of the present δ sph experimental and vof results at t 0 2 s when the flow reached the obstacle a wave was formed and the water column bounced in the opposite wall direction similar to vof result at t 0 3 s before the wave hit the right wall the elongated water jet formed a crescent shape in which the top of the water is inclined back to the center of the channel however both numerical results didn t represent the strong water splashes from the top of the water column which is visible in experimental results after t 0 4 s the water reaches the right wall and due to the gravity force started to fall down at t 0 5 s a bifurcation of the flow was observed in the experiment and vof results however the δ sph model was unable to properly represent this phenomenon 4 two liquid dam break flow in this section in order to demonstrate the ability of the numerical model to accurately simulate two liquid dam break flow the results of the δ sph method are compared with the experimental results of janosi et al 2004 the experimental set up is shown in fig 8 it consisted of a water tank separated from the downstream section by a gate the water depth behind the gate was 0 15 m the downstream channel contained peo solution with a concentration of 42 wppm viscosity 0 935 10 6 m 2 s a density close to that of fresh water and the depth of 0 015 m the gate opened with a constant velocity of 1 5 m s from the above total time of simulation was 0 5 s this time duration is selected based on the available experimental results in which the mixing process in initial steps of the dam break is considered as the focus of this paper is to simulate the initial stages of dam break where there is no reflected flow from the right wall only part of the whole channel 9 93 m is simulated this considerably saves the computational cost the total length of the simulated channel is 2 5 m and the length of the reservoir water column in 0 38 m which is exactly the same as in the experiment the height of the channel is 0 3 m to reach to a constant velocity for gate motion in practice the gate have an accelerating motion at least in a short portion of the time at the start of its movement ye et al 2016 derived an empirical gate motion formula using the experimental data of hu and sueyoshi 2010 and applied it in numerical study of the dam break flow based on their study the vertical displacement of the gate can be approximately divided into two periods 1 acceleration period and 2 uniform motion period which is expressed as 17 y t 1 2 a 0 t 2 t t 0 y t 1 2 a 0 t 0 2 v 0 t t 0 t t 0 in which y is the vertical position of the gate t is the time v 0 is the velocity of the uniform motion t 0 stands for the duration of the acceleration period and a 0 v 0 t 0 denotes the acceleration of the gate in the acceleration period ye et al 2016 set the maximum removal velocity v 0 equal to v gate 1 5 m s as the benchmark test in their numerical study the acceleration duration was set as t 0 0 01 s 4 1 validation of the two liquid numerical model considering the effect of particle distances in order to validate the two liquid numerical model the results of the model with different interparticle distances were compared with the experimental data of janosi et al 2004 to select the appropriate distance between the particles for use in simulations the mixing patterns obtained using three different interparticle distances these includes 0 0008 m 0 0003 m and 0 00028 m interparticle distances leading to 147750 1008162 and 1159496 total number of particles respectively the required run times were 11 158 and 221 min respectively to simulate each model with a real time of 0 5 s on a system with intel core i7 7800 3 5 ghz cpu an installed memory ram of 64 0 gb and a nvidia geforce gtx 1060 6 gb gpu with computing capability of 6 1 the results of the mixing patterns are presented in fig 9 as this figure shows the best agreement was obtained using the particle distances of 0 3 mm and 0 28 mm the case b in which the particle distance was 0 8 mm has failed to properly represent the formation of the negative wave at t 0 131 s and t 0 192 s at these times cases c and d represent more accurate mixing pattern than case b due to the fact that the computational cost and the time of the simulation increases by increasing the total number of particles the particle distance of 0 3 mm is selected for the rest of the simulations fig 9 c d shows that the main features such as the formation of mushroom like jet and wave breaking as discussed by ye et al 2016 are well reproduced by the δ sph technique although the projection of breaking wave front in sph result is more than that of the experimental one it is evident from these figures that the shape and size of the breaking wave and the mixing process is nearly the same as the experimental results the existence of a very small discrepancy between results may be due to the extra dimension in the experiments and the gate roughness which was ignored in the numerical model wave breaking leads to enhancing the turbulent mixing around the propagating front face as discussed by janosi et al 2004 the kinetic energy is enough to build up a second third and sometimes a fourth breaking event until a smooth propagating bore like perturbation form in our experiment at t 0 327 s this breaking wave hits the ambient water and forms a secondary wave the height of this secondary wave increases with time until it collapses by the loss of energy the numerical model predicted the height of this secondary wave at t 0 392 s and t 0 457 s more than that of the experimental results the velocity fields are depicted in fig 10 where the velocity magnitudes are in m s here we focus on the zone where the two liquids interact with each other based on the pervious discussions and as this figure shows a negative wave was formed at the very initial stages of the collision of two liquids at these times the minimum velocity occurs at the tip of the negative wave as the time passes by the type of the wave changed from negative to a progressing wave and the maximum velocity generally occurs at the front of the progressing wave in dam break flood waves turbulence is usually generated through either bottom friction or wave breaking here over time the flow becomes more turbulent and the maximum velocity is concentrated near the breaking zone 4 2 validation of the two liquid numerical δ sph models in this section a comparison is made between the results of the δ sph and the standard wcsph schemes to show the efficiency of the former method fig 11 shows the mixing patterns of two liquids in different times for two models and experimental one janosi et al 2004 as can be seen in this figure the use of δ sph scheme leads to a better agreement with the experimental result also as it is evident in this figure from t 0 261 s there is a bore in the middle of the fluid domain in the experimental snapshots the δ sph model could successfully represent this bore while the standard wcsph model failed to reproduce it fig 12 shows that the front propagation of water peo solution interface obtained by δ sph scheme is slightly smaller than standard wcsph scheme 4 3 effect of ambient water depth on two liquid dam break flow in the wet bed dam break experiment by opening the gate the ambient water is dragged up by the reservoir water at this time the still ambient water resists to the drag and thus the wave front is broken and a jet is formed in downstream according to the previous studies stansby et al 1998 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 wave breaking is delayed with increasing the depth ratio therefore maximum turbulence and air entrainment were formed for the minimum water depth ratio in order to investigate the effects of the water depth ratio on the mixing pattern and front propagation of the water peo interface three different initial ambient water depths h 1 3 5 8 a n d 7 c m were simulated and the results are presented for two different time instances of t 1 0 3 s and t 2 0 6 s different combinations of ambient water depth and time instances are summarized in table 1 in fig 13 the δ sph results are analysed against the experimental results of janosi et al 2004 the wcsph result of jian et al 2015 and the vof results of ye and zhao 2017 at t 0 3 s the δ sph and vof results demonstrate a better agreement with the experimental data than wcsph results however for the positive wave front both sph results show more projected wave front than the experimental one this figure clearly shows that at t 0 6 s the δ sph result has the best agreement with the experimental data a comparison between the mixing patterns for different ambient water depths at different time instances is depicted in fig 14 as this figure shows increasing the ambient water depth alternates the mixing pattern and the breaking type of the flood wave as changed from the plunging to the spilling one it is due to the fact that as the water depth decreases the gradient of hydrostatic pressure between the reservoir water and the ambient water increases resulting in faster wave propagation this figure also confirms the conclusion of the previous studies stansby et al 1998 ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2010 concerning about the forward wave breaking delay as the water depth increases however the backward breaking occurs approximately at the same time for these cases the effect of the water depth ratio on the front propagation of the water peo solution interface is shown in fig 15 it is evident from this figure that increasing the water depth ratio results to slower wave front propagation it is due to the effect of resistance in water column of larger depth 4 4 effects of the gate parameters on two liquid dam break flow in this section different parameters such as the presence of the gate gate thickness upward gate velocity and its type of motion are investigated 4 4 1 effect of the presence of the gate recent dam break studies such as ye et al 2016 revealed that the gate has a significant effect on the water collapse process and cannot be neglected in dam break studies analytical studies have used the idea of sudden removal of the gate which is not possible in practice in these studies a system to remove the gate in an extremely short time was designed to approximate the sudden removal in this way the effect of the moving gate can be ignored however in most numerical studies the gate motion is seldom considered and the entire water column has been subjected to sudden collapse as soon as the calculations begin in reality during the release time the forward movement of the water is somehow prevented by the gate also the gate moves upward with the strong shear force applied to the gate and fluid interface including an interaction between water air and gate causing jets and splashes onto the main body of water ye et al 2016 fig 16 demonstrates the mixing patterns in dam break evolution in different time steps with and without gate as this figure shows considering the presence of the gate has a significant effect on the mixing pattern results by removing the gate the whole reservoir water suddenly collapses once the simulation begins it leads to an oblique movement of the water peo solution interface towards the downstream the reverse flow does not form in the absence of a gate restriction and a jet flow is formed towards the downstream and breaks by inserting the gate the friction between the gate and water causes an upward movement of the water near the gate and the interaction between the gate and the two bodies of water can lead to complex free surface motions also the formation of a reverse flow at the crest a time difference in formation and breaking process and creation of various patterns such as mushroom like jets are observed however the snapshots at t 0 392 s and t 0 457 shows that as the time passes by the mixing patterns obtained with and without gate become resemble hence the effect of the gate is more important at the very initial stages of the dam break a bore is also presented in both cases that its height increases by removing the gate fig 17 shows the effect of the gate restriction on the front propagation of water peo solution interface as it is evident removing the gate led to faster propagation of the interface 4 4 2 effect of gate thickness in this section the mixing pattern and front propagation of water peo interface obtained by four different values of gate thickness are compared to show the effect of this parameter as fig 18 shows increasing the gate thickness resulted in more violent free surface at t 0 131 s where splash is observed at the top of the jet flow by increasing the gate thickness the gap between the reservoir water and the ambient water peo solution increases the thicker the gate the more time required for the reservoir and ambient fluids collision this leads to higher velocities for each liquid hence the velocity of the jet flow will be larger and less time is required for jet formation and breaking phenomenon these conclusions are in line with the findings of ye and zhao 2017 on the effects of gate thickness on the mixing pattern fig 19 presents the front propagation of water peo interface with different gate thicknesses versus t it is evident from this figure that increasing the gate thickness does not have a significant effect on the front propagation of water peo solution interface 4 4 3 effect of the velocity of the gate mixing patterns at different instances for different gate removal velocities are presented in fig 20 it is evident in this figure that as the gate velocity increases the speed of the wave formation and propagation increases and the water peo solution interface becomes more oriented to the downstream direction while as the gate velocity decreases more ambient water comes up towards the upstream direction associated with more inverse flow for the gate removal velocities of v0 3 0 and 5 0 m s where the removal duration is much less than the criterion of a sudden removal the mixing patterns are similar to those of without gates for cases a and b a reverse flow occurs while for cases c and d there is a positive wave at t 0 131 s as it can be seen from fig 21 the front propagation of the water peo interface is almost similar for cases a c a comparison between figs 20 and 21 shows that the gate velocity has a significant effect on the mixing pattern while its effect on the front propagation of the water peo solution interface is negligible 4 4 4 effect of the gate motion type as mentioned previously ye et al 2016 derived a two step formula for the gate motion in this section the effect of the gate motion using proposed formula is assessed the maximum removal velocity v 0 v gate 1 5 m s as the benchmark test was considered by ye et al 2016 in their numerical study the acceleration duration was set as t 0 0 01 s fig 22 shows the mixing patterns for two different gate motions as it is evident in this figure the type of the gate motion has a significant effect on the mixing patterns at different times in initial stages of simulation process the accelerated motion is more consistent with the experiment fig 23 presents the interface front propagation for different types of motion it can be seen in this figure that the front propagation of the water peo solution interface obtained from both types of motion are almost identical 5 two liquid dam break flow in the presence of different obstacles as mentioned earlier in the introduction the dam break flow is usually propagated over a complex domain topography which further complicates the flow pattern the uneven topography of the downstream channel has a significant effect in determining the maximum flow depth flood wave propagation velocity and the flow regime it also causes a negative wave in upstream direction and can increase the flow depth and change the flow patterns ozmen cagatay and kocaman 2011 in this section the interaction of two liquid dam break flow with different obstacles including semi circular rectangular and triangular shapes is presented 5 1 two liquid dam break flow in the presence of semi circular obstacle this profile is an idealized example for water or oil pipelines different test conditions for this type of obstacle sc1 sc4 are summarized in table 2 fig 24 shows the mixing patterns in the presence of different semicircular obstacles as fig 24 shows the presence and the dimensions of the obstacle does not have a significant effect on the mixing pattern until the flow reaches the obstacle the mixing pattern in this case is similar to the classic two liquid dam break as the time passes by the mixture strikes the semicircle obstacle and passes over it from this time on the mixing pattern of sc1 and sc3 cases was different which shows the effect of the dimension of the obstacle increasing the radius of the obstacle increases the flow depth behind and on the obstacle while a separation phenomenon occurred in both cases in case sc1 the lower part of the breaking wave hit the obstacle though the tongue of the wave didn t experience the presence of the obstacle and hit the second liquid just after the obstacle in case sc3 where the radius of the semi circle is doubled both the lower part and the tongue of the breaking wave hit the obstacle the flow slipped on the obstacle and a long jet was formed that eventually collapsed with the loss of energy a comparison between the sc1 and sc2 shows that increasing the thickness of the ambient water changes the mixing pattern delays the breaking process and therefore eliminates the separation on the barrier in our case the existing difference between sc3 and sc4 shows the effect of the gate velocity on the mixing pattern the figure shows that increasing the gate velocity speeds up the flow until the collision with the obstacle occurs after the collision the horizontal distance of the jet slightly decreases for the case with higher gate velocity fig 25 shows velocity fields for cases sc3 and sc4 in different instances the velocity magnitudes in m s this figure shows that the maximum fluid velocity belongs to the front of the water peo solution interface in the case of the positive wave the maximum velocity occurs at the tongue of the breaking wave however similar to classic two liquid dam break in the case of negative wave the minimum velocity belongs to the tip of the negative wave as it was expected a zone with the minimum velocity is formed just before the obstacle fig 26 shows the front propagation of the water peo solution interface with different ambient water depths sc1 and sc2 where increasing the ambient water depth leads to a decrease in front propagation fig 27 shows the effect of gate velocity on front propagation of the water peo solution interface in the presence of a semi circular obstacle a comparison between fig 27 a and b indicates that as the obstacle radius increases the effect of the gate velocity on the front propagation of the water peo solution interface is more considerable fig 28 shows that increasing the radius of the semi circular water peo solution obstacle causes a slight increase on the front propagation of the water peo solution interface furthermore as fig 24 shows increasing the obstacle radius leads to an increase in jet height 5 2 two liquid dam break flow in the presence of rectangular obstacle rectangular obstacle is a common shape in hydraulic engineering and marine hydrodynamics cofferdams and bridge piers are among the applications of this profile different test conditions for this type of obstacle are summarized in table 3 as fig 29 shows the separation occurs for all the rectangular obstacles comparison of mixing patterns in the presence of r2 and r3 shows that the width of the rectangular obstacle had no significant effect on the maximum jet height and the maximum front propagation of the interface as well as the mixing pattern except at t 0 392 and t 0 457 s when a branch of the mixture hits the obstacle this figure also shows that for lower obstacle where the breaking wave did not hit the structure jet formation and the bifurcation of the flow was not observed in that case the flow depth is lower the more water passed the obstacle and more violent condition at the downstream of the obstacle was observed fig 30 shows the velocity fields for different test conditions in the presence of the rectangular obstacle the velocity magnitudes in m s similar to semi circular obstacle a zone with the minimum flow velocity is formed behind the obstacle for the positive wave the maximum velocity belongs to the jet front a comparison between fig 30 a and b reveals that for the identical gate removal velocity the velocity field is completely changes by changing the height of the obstacle again the maximum flow velocity belongs to the wave front it also shows that doubling the gate removal velocity results in a slight increase in the flow velocity field a comparison between figs 31 and 32 shows that increasing the height of the obstacle amplifies the effect of the gate velocity on the front propagation a comparison between figs 32 and 33 shows that changing the obstacle length does not have a significant effect on the front propagation fig 34 shows that for the identical gate removal velocity increasing the height of the obstacle decreases the front propagation of water peo interface 5 3 two liquid dam break flow in the presence of triangular obstacle triangular obstacle is an idealized representation of obstacles with steep slopes different test conditions for triangle obstacle are summarized in table 4 the width of the triangular base of obstacle is set to 0 1 m for all cases fig 35 shows that similar to semi circular and rectangular obstacles the breaking wave in t2 which is less elevated does not hit the structure and the mixture passes the obstacle and breaks shortly after it whereas the breaking in t1 and t3 occurs on the structure leading to an upward jet and bifurcation this figure also shows that similar to rectangular and semi circular obstacles the maximum flow depth increases by increasing the height of the obstacle fig 36 shows the velocity fields for different test conditions velocity magnitudes in m s it is evident from this figure that similar to previous cases the maximum flow velocity belongs to the wave front while a zone with minimum velocity is formed just behind the obstacle comparison of figs 37 and 38 shows that changing the height of the triangular obstacle has little effect on the maximum wave propagation comparison of figs 39 and 40 shows that increasing the velocity of the gate result in a little amplification on the effect of the obstacle height on front propagation of water peo interface 5 4 discussions on the maximum values of horizontal and vertical water interface in this section a comparison is made between the maximum values of horizontal and vertical propagation of water peo solution interface between different cases the following results can be drawn from figs 41 and 42 one of the most important factors affecting the jet height is the obstacle shape the results revealed that the sharper the edges of the obstacle the higher the jet or flow height generally the maximum jet height belongs to rectangular triangular and semi circular obstacle respectively the effect of the ambient water depth was only investigated for semi circular obstacle the comparison of the front propagation of the water peo solution interface between the semi circular obstacles shows that similar to the no obstacle case by increasing the ambient water depth the front propagation of the water peo solution interface decreases this is evident by comparing results of front propagation of the water peo solution interface sc2 and sc5 cases with other semi circular obstacle the gate removal velocity has a direct relationship with the front propagation of water peo solution interface in the presence of the semi circular obstacle but it doesn t have a considerable effect on the maximum jet height with the same ambient water depth the maximum jet height for semicircular obstacle is affected by the radius of this obstacle it means that the higher the obstacle the higher jet height is formed this conclusion is drawn by comparing the maximum jet heights for the pairs of sc1 and sc6 lower obstacles with sc3 and sc4 higher obstacles for the rectangular obstacles the maximum jet height depends greatly on the height of the obstacle while it does not depend on the width of the rectangle this conclusion is drawn by comparing the maximum jet heights for r2 r3 r5 and r6 higher obstacles with r1 and r4 lower obstacles fig 41 reveals that the maximum front propagation of the water peo solution interface in the presence of a rectangular obstacle have a direct relationship with the gate removal velocity this is despite the fact that the removal velocity doesn t have a considerable effect on the maximum jet height for the triangular section increasing the height results to an increase in the maximum jet height while it doesn t have a considerable effect on the front propagation 6 conclusion in this paper the δ sph approach was used to investigate the mixing pattern and front propagation of water peo solution interface over wet bed and in the presence of different obstacles in order to validate the results the model was first applied to the single liquid problems including the dam break over wet bed and on the barrier the model was then applied to a two liquid dam break problem comparison of the results with the experimental data confirmed the validity and accuracy of the model in the light of most important results the following conclusions can be drawn the results of the mixing patterns of the water peo solution interface in the absence of any gate were dramatically different from the gate presence case as well as the experimental results therefore the numerical studies should consider the effect of the gate movement considering the gate motion type shows that using the two step accelerated motion resulted in better agreement with the experimental mixing pattern than the constant velocity compared to the standard wcsph method the use of δ sph formulation resulted in a smoother mixing pattern leading to better agreement with the experimental mixing pattern increasing the ambient water depth resulted in a change in wave breaking type from plunging to spilling breaker it also led to a decrease in front propagation of the water peo solution interface as the gate speed increases the formation and the slope of the water peo solution interface get closer towards downstream the model was then used to simulate the two liquid dam break flow interaction with different obstacles the following results were evident from the simulations the presence of the obstacle does not have a significant effect on the mixing pattern until the flow reaches the obstacle in this case the mixing pattern is similar to the classic two liquid dam break the presence of the obstacle increases the effect of the gate velocity on the front propagation of the water peo solution interface in the case of the semi circular obstacle the separation phenomenon started from the upper part of the obstacle increasing the height of the obstacle causes that both the lower part and the tongue of the breaking wave hit the obstacle the flow slips on the obstacle and a long jet is formed that eventually collapses with the loss of energy it also increases the flow depth and decreases the front propagation of the water peo solution interface the width of the rectangular obstacle has minor effect on the maximum jet height and the maximum front propagation of the interface as well as the mixing pattern except at t 0 392 and t 0 457 s when a branch of the mixture hits the obstacle while decreasing the height of the obstacle reduces the jet height and prevents the bifurcation of the flow it results in lower maximum flow depths more water passing the obstacle and more violent condition at the downstream of the obstacle in all of obstacles the minimum flow velocity was observed in a zone just behind the obstacle the maximum velocity belongs to the jet front and especially the tongue of the breaking wave the most important factor affecting the maximum jet height in the presence of an obstacle is the obstacle shape and the sharper edges cause higher jets increasing the ambient water depth results in decreasing the front propagation of

21632,the modification of the bubble nuclei population by the presence of a finite span hydrofoil is modeled numerically using an eulerian lagrangian approach the unsteady liquid flow field is simulated using navier stokes equations while the bubbles initiating from nuclei in the free stream and emitted from boundaries are tracked using a lagrangian approach the effects of including gas diffusion wall nucleation and bubble breakup on nuclei distribution downstream of hydrofoil are studied the inclusion of gas diffusion is found to significantly increase the size of the bubbles downstream also inclusion of boundary nucleation is found to significantly increase the total number of large bubbles collected in the wake as compared to accounting for free nuclei alone bubble breakup modeled using instability analysis and experimental observations is seen to result in a significant increase in the number of small and mid size bubbles at the expense of the large size bubbles keywords bubbly flow gas diffusion bubble breakup cavitation eulerian lagrangian approach 1 introduction the generation and entrainment of bubbles from a surface ship is of interest to marine applications besides the commonly known air entrainment sources due to free surface and hull interactions such as breaking and spilling waves at the bow and stern and boundary layer entrainment along the hull another potential source is bubble production by highly loaded devices such as propellers or other appendages with lifting surfaces photographic evidence has shown that a relatively large amount of bubbles is generated downstream of a lifting surface even in the absence of visible upstream bubbles the presence of bubbles can be attributed to the fundamental observation that any water contains microscopic sub visual bubble nuclei that act as seeds for many phenomena in mechanical and chemical engineering such as cavitation boiling gas transfer chemical reactions etc these nuclei can be very small microscopic bubbles franklin 1992 particles with gas filled crevices or entrapped gaseous micro or nano bubbles at the rigid boundaries mørch 2009 yount et al 1984 upon encountering low pressure conditions these nuclei grow and oscillate causing cumulative transfer of non condensable gas into the bubbles therefore it is essential that the analysis of bubble distributions and dynamics considers both nuclei sources i e suspended nuclei in water and boundary nucleation hsiao and chahine 2012 developed a discrete singularity model dsm to track a large distribution of bubbles in the flow field of a propeller obtained with a rans solver dsm computed each bubble motion and volume evolution along its trajectory in the propeller flow field a gas diffusion model solving the gas transport equation based on a thin boundary layer assumption plesset and zwick 1952 was incorporated in dsm to study the effects of non condensable gas transfer on the bubble dynamics this study explained the observation of a bubbly field behind a propeller while no visible bubbles were present upstream of the propeller and concluded that explosive bubble growth and violent collapse are an essential catalyst to enable significant net influx of initially dissolved gas into the bubble a more recent study hsiao et al 2017a has extended the previous results to the unsteady flow field of a finite span hydrofoil an eulerian lagrangian approach was introduced solving the unsteady liquid flow in an eulerian frame and providing the flow field at each time step to the lagrangian solver for tracking all the discrete bubbles no feed back of the bubble distribution to the liquid flow was considered in another implementation of the two phase flow model the eulerian and lagrangian approaches could be solved simultaneously and exchange information at each time step hsiao et al 2017b to result in a full two way coupling to enable tracking of a very large number of bubbles simultaneously the hsiao et al 2017a study used a finite difference scheme to solve the gas transport equation instead of the thin boundary layer approximation the boundary integral solution becomes less efficient with the increase in bubble numbers since it requires integration over the whole history of each bubble dynamics to compute the amount of gas inside the bubble this study not only revealed the importance of accounting for the instantaneous flow field on the dispersed bubbly flow but also demonstrated the effect of bubble breakup on the bubble size distribution downstream of the hydrofoil however bubble breakup was performed in a heuristic way with no theoretical or empirical basis for the parameters the current study is to further investigate the effects of gas diffusion and bubble breakup on the bubble size distribution in the wake for a cavitation bubbly flow over a foil at a relatively high cavitation number prior to the formation of sheet cavitation such a cavitating flow involves both the dynamics of bubbles just moving past the lifting surface and also highly dynamic cavitating bubbles that grow very significantly and then collapse violently as they pass the foil the current study also attempts to develop a better bubble breakup model by including an analytical model based on stability analysis of the bubble shape and a statistical model based on experimental observations the break up based on the stability analysis addresses mostly breakup due to bubble collapse while the second empirical model includes also shear effects the study also considers the effects of wall nucleation on the results 2 numerical approach the eulerian lagrangian two phase flow framework employed in this study has been extensively applied and documented in our previous studies these include modeling of tip vortex cavitation inception on a propeller hsiao and chahine 2004 2008 investigations of the effects of a propeller flow on bubble size distribution in water hsiao and chahine 2012 bubble entrainment in plunging jets hsiao et al 2013 wave propagation in bubbly media and bubble cloud collapse studies ma et al 2018 2015a b raju et al 2011 and modeling sheet to cloud cavitation hsiao et al 2017b etc the most complete procedure is based on the following statements 1 the dynamics and motion of the individual bubbles in the flow field are controlled by the two phase medium local properties and gradients 2 these local properties of the mixture void fractions and local densities are determined by the instantaneous distribution of bubble sizes and positions 3 the mixture flow field has an evolving density distribution which is space and time dependent and which satisfies mass and momentum conservation this general two phase flow framework allows both two way and one way coupling between the continuum based model and the discrete bubbles model for the examples shown in the present study only the one way coupling approach is used the eulerian and lagrangian solvers are run simultaneously in the lagrangian computations the motion and dynamic equations of the bubbles are solved at each time step accounting for bubble surface averaged pressures pressure gradients and velocities computed by the navier stokes liquid only flow solver the feedback from the bubbles to the flow field is turned off the interest being for low void fraction incoming flows and for dispersed bubbly flow type cavitation on the foil 2 1 eulerian continuum mixture model the two phase flow continuum is described using the navier stokes equations code 3dynafs vis which solves the continuity and momentum equations 1 ρ m t ρ m u 0 2 ρ m d u d t p μ m 2 u where the subscript m represents the mixture properties u is the mixture velocity and p is the pressure the mixture density ρ m and the mixture viscosity μ m can be expressed as functions of the gas volume fraction α through 3 ρ m 1 α ρ l α ρ g μ m 1 α μ l α μ g where the subscript l represents the liquid and the subscript g represents the gas in the present study very low incoming void fractions less than 10 5 are considered the same applies to the wake region only in the cavitation region over the foil the void fraction peak a certain spots at about 5 as a result for most of the cases presented here no feed back between the bubbles and the eulerian solver was taken into account and the liquid only unsteady solution was used at each time step to progress the solution density and viscosity were assumed constant and equal to the liquid density and viscosity we will illustrate for one case the effect of neglecting the local changes in the sound speed on the bubble dynamics the system of equations 1 and 2 is solved by an artificial compressibility method chorin 1967 in which a derivative of the pressure using the pseudo time τ multiplied by the inverse of an artificial compressibility factor β is added to the continuity equation which becomes when the density is invariant 4 1 β p τ u 0 as a consequence a hyperbolic system of equations is formed and can be solved using a time marching scheme the solution is iterated in the pseudo time until convergence to obtain a time dependent solution a newton iterative procedure is performed at each physical time step in order to satisfy the continuity equation 2 2 lagrangian discrete bubble model the lagrangian discrete bubble model 3dynafs dsm uses singularities to model the bubbles hsiao et al 2003 chahine 2008 this model has been shown to produce accurate results when compared to full 3d two way interaction computations hsiao and chahine 2004 the source term representing bubble volume oscillations uses a surface averaged approach to account for turbulent structures and non uniform flow field around the bubble flow field quantities which are important to the bubble dynamics and motion equations i e pressure velocity and pressure gradients are all obtained from the eulerian solution and averaged along the bubble surface a modified version of the keller herring equation keller and kolodner 1956 is used to describe the bubble dynamics and accounts for slip velocity between the bubble and the liquid this is written as 5 1 r c m r r 3 2 1 r 3 c m r u s 2 4 1 ρ m 1 r c m r c m d d t p v p g p e n c 2 γ r 4 μ m r r where r and r 0 are the bubble radii at times t and 0 p v is the liquid vapor pressure and u enc and p enc are respectively the averages of the liquid velocities and pressures over the bubble surface the slip velocity u s is the difference between u enc and the bubble translation velocity u b i e u s u enc u b in absence of gas diffusion the gas pressure p g is obtained from a polytropic compression law p g p g o r 0 r 3 k where p g o is the initial gas pressure and k is compression law gas constant when gas diffusion is included as is the case here the gas pressure is obtained from the solution of the gas diffusion equation and energy balance as described below c m is the local sound speed in the mixture in the low void fraction cases shown in this paper c m is just the sound speed in the liquid c l the effect of this assumption on the solution is illustrated below for one test condition the bubble trajectory is obtained from a balance of the forces on the bubble resulting from the unsteady viscous flow field and the product of the bubble acceleration and the accelerated mass mainly the bubble liquid added mass the motion equation can be written 6 d u b d t ρ l ρ g 3 8 r c d u s u s 1 2 d u e n c d t d u b d t 3 r 2 r u s p ρ l ρ b ρ l ρ l g 3 c l 4 π ν r u s ω ω where u s is the slip velocity between the local liquid velocity u e n c and the bubble velocity u b u s u e n c u b c d is the drag coefficient and c l is the lift coefficient c d is given by an empirical equation such as from haberman and morton 1953 7 c d 24 r e b 1 0 197 r e b 0 63 2 6 10 4 r e b 1 38 with the bubble reynolds number defined as 8 r e b 2 ρ r u e n c u b μ the first right hand side term is a drag force the second and third terms account for the added mass the fourth term accounts for the presence of a pressure gradient while the fifth term accounts for gravity and the sixth term is a lift force saffman 1965 with ω being the vorticity vector we used c l 6 44 for the lift coefficient all terms obtained from the liquid solution are averaged terms over the bubble surface 3 dispersed bubbly flow simulations 3 1 unsteady single phase flow we consider the unsteady flow field over a naca0015 finite span rectangular hydrofoil with a round tip and an aspect ratio based on semi span of 2 see fig 1 and fig 2 the selected computational domain has all far field boundaries located six chord lengths away from the foil and is discretized using an h h type grid a total of 1 5 million grids 151 101 101 is used for the base grid 81 61 grid points are used to discretize the foil surface the first grid above the hydrofoil surface is at y 1 in order to properly describe the boundary layer in addition to this base grid two other levels of grid resolution using 12 million and 0 2 million grid points for double and half grid resolutions were used to examine grid sensitivity we consider an incoming uniform flow at an angle of attack relative to the foil of 8 at a reynolds number r e 1 5 106 corresponding to a chord length c l 0 15 m and a liquid velocity free stream velocity u 10 m s freestream velocities and pressures are specified in the upstream inflow boundary and in the far field side boundaries and a first order extrapolation for all variables is used at the outflow boundary a symmetry boundary condition is applied at the foil root section and no slip and zero normal pressure gradient conditions are imposed on the foil surface to study grid resolution effects we consider first reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solutions obtained with the k ε turbulence model and the three grid resolutions described earlier i e 41 31 81 61 and 161 121 shown in fig 1 non dimensional pressure contours p p p ρ u 2 where p is the freestream pressure obtained on the suction side of the finite span hydrofoil from all three grid resolutions are shown in fig 2 it is seen that in all three cases the converged steady state solutions are very similar on most of the hydrofoil surface except in the tip vortex region a quantitative comparison of the non dimensional pressure on both pressure and suction sides versus the non dimensional x coordinate at the root section of the hydrofoil is shown in fig 3 here again it is clear that refining the grid resolution does not modify or improve much the solution we can see that the rans has filtered out the unsteady turbulent structures and the converged flow appears as a steady flow without the local fluctuations which are very important for the dynamics of the bubble in the investigated flow therefore we consider another approach which does not use any model to describe the subgrid turbulence as in rans the navier stokes equations are directly solved without including a turbulence model in order to capture unsteady flows separation and vortex shedding vorticity filtering in this case is only through the grid size i e vortex structures smaller than the grid size cannot be captured this approach is similar to implicit les in which turbulence scales smaller than the grid size are automatically filtered out in this model numerical dissipation is considered sufficient to mimic the action due to the subgrid stresses fureby 2007 bensow and liefvendahl 2008 we have found that with this approach the flow separation and unsteady vortex shedding can be captured reasonably well and are predicted much better than when using a turbulence model fig 4 illustrates for the liquid only flow the unsteady flow separation with vortex shedding for the three grid densities considered when the computations have reached limit cycle oscillations the figure shows the non dimensional pressure contours and the iso pressure surface p 0 5 at successive times in the limit cycle it is seen that as the grid resolution is increased smaller pressure fluctuations scales are captured to compare the effects of grid resolution on the mean flow time averaged solutions are derived from the unsteady simulations for the non dimensional time t t u c l 10 fig 5 shows a comparison of the non dimensional pressures along the foil suction and pressure sides for the three grid resolution the rans solution is also shown it is seen that both the fine grid and the base grid capture the mean flow pressure as well as the rans solution with the k ε turbulence model while the coarse grid significantly under predicts the pressure on the suction side this provides confidence to use the base grid resolution for most of the bubbly flow computations presented below 3 2 dispersed bubbly flow to study the effect of the foil on the nuclei distribution 9 104 free field bubble nuclei are released in the naca0015 turbulent flow field 5 104 nuclei are of radius 20 μm 3 104 of radius 40 μm and 1 104 of radius 60 μm the nuclei are released from a preset release domain upstream of the foil the domain height in the z direction is selected to be 0 02 m in order to cover the window of opportunity though which nuclei need to pass in order to encounter the low pressure on the hydrofoil surface and the tip region the domain width in the y direction 0 32 m is specified to cover the full span of the hydrofoil the release domain has a length of 1 5 m in the streamwise direction such that enough nuclei can be supplied to conduct the unsteady simulations for 0 15 s the selected bubble number and release domain volume result in an upstream void fraction of 10 6 corresponding to a nuclei concentration per cm3 of 5 2 bubbles of 20 μm radius 3 2 bubbles of 40 μm radius and 1 0 bubbles of 60 μm radius fig 6 shows the bubble distribution in the foil flow field due to dynamic effects when gas diffusion is not included for a cavitation number σ 1 0 where the cavitation number is defined as 9 σ p p v 0 5 ρ u 2 we can observe that the nuclei grow to large sizes in the low pressure region on the suction side of the foil near the leading edge and in the tip vortex region however in absence of gas diffusion and bubble breakup the bubbles return to their original sizes once the field pressure returns to the upstream pressure level and no significant effect on the bubble size distribution can be observed typically the radius of a bubble as it traverses over the naca0015 can be illustrated in fig 7 when the bubble is in the window of opportunity and its trajectory takes it close to the foil through the low pressure region on the suction side it grows explosively until its path again brings it back into a higher pressure region at which time it will collapse and then eventually rebound after breaking up into smaller bubbles this is not shown in the figure to the contrary if the bubble trajectory keep it away from the low pressure region near the foil surface it will only grow slightly and then return less dramatically to its original size 4 effects of gas diffusion 4 1 gas diffusion model to study the effect of gas mass transfer in and out of the bubbles on the dispersed bubbly flow a gas diffusion model is used mass exchange results from the fact that in the presence of a concentration gradient gas dissolved in the liquid will diffuse from high concentration regions to low concentration regions the transport equation for the gas concentration c x t is given by 10 d c d t d g 2 c where d g is the gas molar diffusivity the value of d g depends on the liquid and gas and also on the liquid ambient temperature and pressure here we use d g 2 10 9 m2 s for air and water at 237 k and 0 1 mpa at a bubble interface the dissolved gas concentration c s is connected to the gas pressure inside the bubble p g through henry s law 11 c c s at r r with c s p g h where h is the henry constant this condition at the bubble interface is very important and actually drives the gas diffusion dynamics the other initial and boundary conditions for gas diffusion are 12 c c for t t 0 c c for r where c is the dissolved gas concentration far away from the bubble surface the gas transfer rate n g at the bubble liquid interface is directly proportional to the product of the interface area and the normal concentration gradient at the interface 13 n g d g s c n d s to obtain the gas pressure inside the bubble taking into account gas diffusion we consider the instantaneous energy and mass balance of the bubble content both components of the bubble content vapor and gas are assumed to be ideal gases and to follow the ideal gas law 14 p g v b n g r u t b p v v b n v r u t b where v b is the volume of bubble n v and n g are the number of moles of vapor and gas within the bubble respectively r u is the universal gas constant and t b is the absolute temperature of the gas and vapor mixture one consequence of this assumption is that the ratio of the mole numbers n g n v in the bubble is directly proportional to the ratio of the partial pressures p g p v due to the relatively short vaporization time compared to bubble dynamics and gas diffusion characteristic times the vapor is considered to instantaneously flow in and out of the bubble and p v is assumed equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure of the liquid at the bubble wall temperature considering the contents of the bubble and applying the first thermodynamics law one can write the energy balance for the control volume bounded by the bubble surface as 15 d u d w i v g n i h i d t where du is the change in internal energy dw is the work done on the control volume and h i is the specific enthalpy of constituent i the various terms in eq 15 can be expanded as 16 d u i v g c v i d n i t b d w p v p g d v b h i i v g c p i t l where c v and c p are the specific heat at constant volume and pressure

distribution over the lifting surface are then considered for water saturated with gas i e with a dissolved gas concentration of 0 66 mol m3 for a temperature of 237 k and an ambient pressure of 0 1 mpa fig 8 shows the resulting bubble distribution detailed analysis of the results shows a similar behavior of the bubbles to that in the absence of gas diffusion during the growth phase however significant differences are observed in the wake region after the bubbles start collapsing and rebounding as shown later with the gas diffusion included the bubbles fill up with gas and grow much larger than in the absence of gas diffusion this ends up making the fine vortices in the wake visible due to the bubbles collecting in the core of these vortices by observing the behavior of individual bubbles we are able to demonstrate the effects of gas diffusion on the bubble dynamics better fig 9 shows a typical scenario for a small free nucleus of initial radius r 0 50 μm as the nucleus encounters a low pressure region downstream of the leading edge it can either grow moderately and then oscillate or depending on the cavitation number it can undergo explosive growth and violent collapse the figure shows that at the higher cavitation number σ 1 2 the bubble grows to a maximum bubble radius of 0 65 mm and then reduces size as the pressure along the hydrofoil recovers in this case the bubble returns to a size of 70 μm downstream of the foil which is not much larger than its initial size the figure also shows the number of gas moles inside the bubble does not increase much at the lower cavitation number of 1 0 the bubble grows explosively to a much larger size and the number of moles of gas n g inside the bubble increases significantly over time becoming an order of magnitude larger than the initial value as a result after collapse and several oscillations the bubble ends up with a much larger radius 180 μm than the original 50 μm radius due to a net increase of the amount of gas in the bubble to illustrate quantitatively the effects of the foil presence and of gas diffusion on the bubbles as they pass over the finite span hydrofoil we sum the volume of all bubbles in a thin slice interrogation volume as shown in fig 10 the interrogation volume includes the full span δy 0 32 m a height of δz 0 02m and a thickness δx 0 01m in the chord direction fig 11 shows a comparison of the total bubble volume versus the streamwise distance between ignoring and including gas diffusion the strong effect of the gas diffusion can be seen downstream of the cavitation region between x 0 02 m and x 0 08 m the bubble volume increases dramatically by almost six orders of magnitude due to explosive bubble growth on the foil suction side in this region the effects of gas diffusion are not visible this is followed by bubble collapse and successive rebounds and oscillations for x 0 08 m in this region the total bubble volume with gas diffusion is seen to become two orders of magnitude larger than that in the absence of gas diffusion this difference in the total bubble volume is less visible between x 0 14 m and x 0 25 m because the volume of bubbles in the region is dominated by cavitation in the tip vortex to study the effect of gas diffusion on the results the bubble size distribution bsd is compared downstream in the wake region at the location x 0 4m the bubble number density is obtained in a slice volume of dimensions 0 01 m 0 32 m 0 05 m at x 0 4m after averaging the solutions for 0 04 s fig 12 compares the bubble size distribution at x 0 4m with and without gas diffusion it is seen that while in absence of gas diffusion the bubbles sizes return to the initial radii of 20 μm 40 μm and 60 μm with gas diffusion the foil significantly modifies the bubble size distribution downstream to a wide range between 20 μm and 300 μm 5 effects of boundary nucleation boundary nucleation is easily observed in conditions where gas diffusion e g beer or champagne glass and or boiling are dominant bubbles grow out of various fixed sites this phenomenon has been studied extensively in the past harvey 1944 suggested that gas pockets trapped in hydrophobic conical cracks and crevices of solid surfaces act as cavitation nuclei more recently mørch 2009 investigated this effect in more depth and suggested that a skin model similar to that proposed by yount et al 1984 for dispersed nuclei can also be used to describe the wall gas bubbles because solid surfaces submerged in a liquid tend to absorb amphiphilic molecules molecules having a polar water soluble group attached to a nonpolar water insoluble hydrocarbon chain and capture nanoscopic air pockets one can expect that clusters of such molecules form weak spots which are the source for bubble nucleation from the solid surface when low pressure conditions are achieved briggs 2004 for instance found that scrupulous cleaning was decisive for obtaining a high tensile strength of water and that contamination of interfaces is a primary factor in cavitation atchley and prosperetti 1989 identified unstable motion of the liquid solid gas contact line in the crevice and unstable growth of the nucleus volume due to loss of mechanical stability force balance specifically they related the threshold pressure to crevice aperture surface tension and gas concentration etc a boundary nucleation model based on existing experimental observations and theoretical studies was introduced by hsiao et al 2017b to model the initiation and dynamics of sheet cavities on foils in the nucleation model nuclei are released from the rigid boundaries when the pressure at the center of a discretized cell drops below a threshold pressure e g the vapor pressure n nuclei are then released from the cell in the flow field during the time interval δt 22 n n s f n δ t δ a where n s is the number density of nucleation sites per unit area f n is the nuclei release rate and δ a is the cell surface area hsiao et al 2017b applied this boundary nucleation model to simulate sheet to cloud cavitation and found it to recover very well experimentally measured berntsen et al 2001 time averaged cavity lengths and oscillation frequencies for a wide range of conditions we consider this model here to investigate the effects boundary nucleation has on the bubble distribution downstream of the foil fig 13 shows the resulting bubble distribution for two numerical simulations one with only boundary nucleation considered and the second with both field nuclei and boundary nucleation present the boundary nucleation considered here has a nucleation rate of 0 8 khz and a number density of nucleation sites of 10 per cm2 and results in a wall nucleation concentration of about 8 nuclei per cm3 assuming that the bubbles near the boundary are convected at the free stream velocity u 10 m s the field nuclei were introduced to the flow field with the same distribution as described in the previous section the figure shows that when considering only the boundary nucleation tip vortex cavitation does not develop because there are few nuclei that feed into the tip vortex the pressure at the hydrofoil surface near the tip region does not drop below the threshold to produce these nuclei the tip vortex cavitation is controlled by the free nuclei coming from a restricted volume upstream of the hydrofoil dubbed the window of opportunity hsiao and chahine 2005 otherwise the surface nuclei alone are able to reproduce a very similar cavitation pattern as when both sources of nuclei are considered fig 14 compares the total bubble volume versus the streamwise distance from the leading edge it is seen that the bubble volume obtained from both free nuclei and boundary nucleation is higher than when including only the free nuclei this is clear everywhere except between x 0 14 m and x 0 25 m where the total bubble volume is composed of the bubbles captured in the tip vortex also the figure shows that outside of the tip vortex region including the surface nucleation alone produces results closer to the full picture where both sources are included finally in the wake region the number of larger sized bubbles obtained from both nuclei sources is much higher than that obtained from the free nuclei only as seen in fig 15 6 effects of bubble breakup in the absence of a precise model for bubble breakup due to pressure gradients and shear flow near boundaries hsiao et al 2017a investigated the effects of the breakup using a heuristic model with the following characteristics a threshold for the breakup the timing of the breakup the number of resulting daughter bubbles the sizes of the daughter bubbles and the locations of the daughter bubbles although inclusion of this heuristic bubble breakup model resulted qualitatively in better correspondence with observations and made the fine vortices in the wake more visible due to collected bubbles the parameters used in the simulations were not based on solid grounds we attempt here to improve this breakup model here we evaluate two models one dubbed analytical model is based on stability analysis of the bubble shape and the second one dubbed empirical model is based on observations of bubble breakup in a cavitating venturi in general bubble breakup results from two mechanisms i e inertial bubble collapse and bubble stretching and shearing the analytical model considers only instabilities due to bubble collapse while the empirical model based on the observations in a venturi includes consideration of both mechanisms 6 1 model based on bubble stability analysis the stability of the bubble shape to non spherical disturbances has been studied analytically for a long time using perturbation analysis e g birkhoff 1954 plesset and mitchell 1956 for instance the non spherical bubble shape can be described as a linear superposition of spherical harmonics 23 r t r 0 a n y n 0 where y n 0 is a spherical harmonic of degree n and a n is perturbation amplitude which is a function of time the stability of the nonspherical interface is compromised when the amplitude of the perturbations grows significantly for small order perturbations a n r 0 plesset and mitchell 1956 derived the following equations for a n t after substituting r t into the rayleigh plesset equation using eq 23 24 a n 3 r r a n a a n 0 a n 1 n 1 n 2 γ ρ l r 3 n 1 r r eq 24 expresses a damped harmonic free oscillation system which becomes most unstable when ṙ 0 and r 0 brennen 1995 instabilities lead to a rapid growth of non spherical distortions and disintegration of the bubble the growth rate of the distortion is proportional to a and the harmonic mode which leads to the maximum value of a is when da dn 0 i e 25 d a d n 3 n 2 4 n γ 1 0 with 26 γ ρ l r 2 γ r eq 25 has a positive real root only when γ 0 and its value is given by 27 n 1 3 7 3 γ 1 2 2 note that γ is time dependent and reaches a maximum at the beginning of a bubble rebound fig 16 shows the time history of a bubble radius and of the corresponding parameter γ for a typical cavitation bubble traveling about the hydrofoil surface it can be seen that the value of γ reaches a local maximum at each bubble radius oscillation close to the time when the bubble radius reaches a local minimum therefore we impose in the simulations as breakup criterion that a bubble breakup will occurs at the time of rebound provided that the bubble radius oscillations are strong enough as expressed r max r 0 ς in the examples shown below we used ς 5 brennen 1995 estimated that the final number of daughter bubbles after many breakups has a cubic power dependence on the mode number n in the simulations below the breakup model is applied to each bubble at each rebound including to daughter bubbles we therefore will use the mode number i e the integer n as the number of daughter bubbles at each breakup after breakup each daughter bubble is also tracked individually and the same model parameters are imposed if the breakup criterion is satisfied again we also assume that all daughter bubbles have the same size and thus have a well defined radius r d conserving the original bubble volume 28 r d n 1 3 r with this we can determine all that is needed to enable a bubble breakup into n daughter bubbles and randomly distribute all these daughter bubbles within the confines of the parent bubble fig 17 shows the resulting bubble distribution when the bubble breakup model is applied in the case where only free nuclei are considered in the simulation by comparing to fig 8 reproduced as fig 17 a for ease of comparison we can see significant differences in the wake region where breakup occurs at rebounds downstream of the primary bubble growth and collapse region the visual appearance of the bubbles now is much closer to that seen experimentally russell et al 2016 direct comparison with the russell results are not possible because the experimentally used foil was different naca63a015 and the angle of attack was only 3 5 also the upstream nuclei distributions were different as well as the cavitation number however we have conducted simulations in chahine et al 2020 comparing with the russell experimental results fig 18 shows one such comparisons comparison of the total bubble volume versus the streamwise location is shown in fig 19 as expected the figure does not show a major influence of breakup on the total bubbles volume because as stated earlier the simulations imposed bubble volume conservation at breakup however the bubble size distribution in the wake region is significantly different between the two cases as can be seen in fig 20 accounting for bubble breakup significantly alters the bubble size distribution at x 0 4 m including the breakup results in a significant increase in the number of small and mid size bubbles and a reduction in the number of large size bubbles this leads to a dominant bubble size of about 100 μm in the wake region 6 2 breakup model based on experimental observations another way to determine the characteristic parameters to use in the numerical model or breakup is through experimental observations of cavitation bubble dynamics behavior to enable such close up observations of bubbles breakup in a cavitating field we have setup a closed flow loop with a venturi as the test section a sketch of the flow loop is shown in fig 21 vacuum can be applied to the supply reservoir to control the pressure of the loop and specifically at the venturi exit the selected venturi has a throat with a constant diameter section 13 7 mm long the venturi shape was selected to generate a local pressure field similar to that encountered by a bubble near the leading edge of the hydrofoil by adjusting either the flow velocity or the reservoir pressure we are able to control the cavitation number and select it to be slightly below the cavitation inception number such that traveling cavitation bubbles can be observed in the throat area of the venturi fig 22 shows a time sequence of images from high speed movies for traveling bubbles at a velocity at the throat of 14 5 m s when the back pressure measured at the end of the divergent section of the venturi is 1 08 atm such condition results in a cavitation number of 1 02 based on the throat velocity and the pressure measured in the venturi outlet section from this image sequence we can measure the bubble size evolution and count the number of visible daughter bubbles after breakup from several sets of high speed videos taken under different flow velocities we were able to observe a reasonable number of isolated cavitation bubbles growing to a range of different maximum radii and correlate this to the number of daughter bubbles after breakup as shown in fig 23 with this set of analyzed data we are able to establish a preliminary correlation between the number of visible bubbles after breakup and the maximum radius the bubble reached in the throat r max 29 n 2 2 7 r max r c where r c is the observed critical maximum bubble size below which bubble break does not occur and where the bubble radii are expressed in millimeters concerning the breakup implementation we select again that the bubble breakup occurs at the time of bubble rebound and we randomly distribute the daughter bubbles within the confines of the parent bubble using eq 29 for the number of daughter bubbles with uniform breakup size and r c as the breakup threshold we apply this breakup model to the flow over the naca0015 described above and predict the bubble size distribution downstream of the hydrofoil considering again only free nuclei the resulting dispersed bubbly flow over the finite span hydrofoil is shown in fig 24 although the wake obtained with this empirical breakup model looks similar to that shown in fig 17 the total number of bubbles and the predominant bubble sizes are quite different as illustrated in fig 25 the analytical breakup model results in a larger number of bubble as compared to the empirical breakup model and thus results in a bubble population with much smaller bubbles in the wake region 6 3 effect of upstream nuclei size distribution to investigate the effect of the initial nuclei size distribution the downstream bubble size distribution obtained from the upstream polydisperse bubble size distribution used so far in this paper is compared to the results obtained from two monodisperse distributions i e 20 μm and 60 μm all three upstream distribution having the same void fraction the three input upstream distributions are illustrated in fig 26 fig 27 compares the total bubble volume along the streamwise direction resulting from the three distributions it is seen that for the same initial void fraction the total bubble volume observed downstream here at x 0 4m is larger when a higher number of smaller nuclei is used this is because a larger number of small nuclei succeeds in drawing a larger amount of dissolved gas from the water due to rectified gas diffusion while the nuclei grow and travel along the foil this statement is true only when the concerned nuclei are larger than the critical size required to grow explosively when encountering the minimum pressure on the hydrofoil surface for σ 1 0 and α 8 all the nuclei considered in this study are all larger than the correspondent critical size which is 3 μm assuming the minimum pressure on the hydrofoil surface is the critical pressure chahine and shen 1986 fig 28 compares the resulting nuclei size distributions at x 0 4 m it is seen that the uniform 20 μm case results in a much higher number of bubbles in the downstream wake region due to a larger number of breakups while the uniform 60 μm case has the least number of downstream bubbles 7 importance of neglected effects as stated earlier all case studies presented in this paper have assumed that the void fraction is low enough to neglect in the simulations the effects of the variations of the two phase medium density viscosity and sound speed in this section we examine how restrictive this assumption is and evaluate how much this assumption affects the results for all cases shown above the void fraction is most everywhere in the flow domain of the order of 10 5 however on the suction side of the foil where the bubbles reach their maximum size the void fraction in some patches can reach 5 this is illustrated in fig 29 a which shows an instantaneous color contour of the void fraction computed within a moving interrogation volume of dimensions δx 0 01m δy 0 01m and δz 0 02m fig 29 b shows along y 0 01m four plots of the variations of the void fraction along x the two dashed lines are instantaneous manifestations of α x while the solid red line shows a time averaged curve of the same this can be represented quite well with the gaussian function 30 α 0 05 exp x 0 035 2 2 10 4 which is represented by the solid blue curve therefore to study the effect of a local void fraction increase in the region 0 01m x 0 07m on the behavior of the solution without having to rerun full two way interaction simulations we consider here the effect of imposing in the region 0 01m x 0 07 m the void fraction gaussian distribution represented in eqn 30 this spatial variation of the void fraction is then used to compute the variations of the density and viscosity versus x according to eqn 3 and we derive the sound speed according to brennen 1995 using 31 c m p ρ l 1 α 1 α 2 1 k α 1 α p ρ l c l 2 1 1 2 to conduct the analysis we consider separately and then combined the effects on the bubble dynamics of varying first the fluid properties density and viscosity and then the sound speed fig 30 shows the effects of each on the bubble radius time history r t for a typical cavitation bubble of initial radius 20 μm traveling along the hydrofoil surface the figure illustrates the fact that variable density viscosity and sound speed all affect r t but not significantly the variable sound speed seems to have the stronger influence and results in increased the damping of the bubble radius oscillations this results in smaller values of the bubble wall acceleration and therefore in smaller values of the breakup parameter γ defined in eqn 26 and shown in fig 31 this reduction in the values of γ is expected to result in a less breakups and a lower number of daughter bubbles and therefore ultimately in bubbles of a larger size in the wake this can actually be seen in fig 32 where the bubbles sizes in the wake end up larger in both cases where the liquid property and the sound speed were made functions of x the figure all shows the combined effects of changing all three properties viscosity density and sound speed which results in further increase in the resulting bubble sizes we should note however that these changes are really minimal when compared with the changes we have seen in the previous section when gas diffusion was included or when the breakup model was modified this gives credence to simplifying the model and considering only one way coupling for such computations 8 conclusions an eulerian lagrangian model was used to study the effects of the presence of a finite span rectangular naca0015 foil on the distribution of bubbles in the downstream flow gas diffusion into and out of the bubbles was included and was shown to have a major effect on the resulting bubble size distribution bubble sizes become larger than the original upstream sizes due to a net influx of dissolved gas into the bubbles during their dynamics along the foil taking into account boundary nucleation is also seen to affect significantly the bubble size distribution downstream with very fine bubbles collecting in the vortices in the foil wake thus visualizing these vortices bubble breakup was also seen to significantly affect the results a bubble breakup model based on bubble shape stability analysis was developed and applied to the study of the effect of bubble breakup on the bubble size distribution in the wake region though being neglected in the current study it will be interesting to also include the effect of coalescence of the daughter bubbles in future studies a bubble breakup model was also established based on empirical experimental observations in a venturi flow both breakup models were applied to simulate the bubbly flow over the naca0015 foil the comparison showed that the analytical breakup model resulted in a larger number of bubble breakups and a larger number of fine bubbles in the wake region as compared to the empirical breakup model the incoming upstream nuclei distribution has a strong effect on the resulting bubble distribution in the foil wake for the same initial void fraction water containing more small nuclei larger than the critical bubble size required for explosive growth sees a larger number of nuclei which grow explosively and draw in dissolved gas due to gas diffusion this results in a larger number of bubbles in the downstream wake credit authorship contribution statement chao

21632,the modification of the bubble nuclei population by the presence of a finite span hydrofoil is modeled numerically using an eulerian lagrangian approach the unsteady liquid flow field is simulated using navier stokes equations while the bubbles initiating from nuclei in the free stream and emitted from boundaries are tracked using a lagrangian approach the effects of including gas diffusion wall nucleation and bubble breakup on nuclei distribution downstream of hydrofoil are studied the inclusion of gas diffusion is found to significantly increase the size of the bubbles downstream also inclusion of boundary nucleation is found to significantly increase the total number of large bubbles collected in the wake as compared to accounting for free nuclei alone bubble breakup modeled using instability analysis and experimental observations is seen to result in a significant increase in the number of small and mid size bubbles at the expense of the large size bubbles keywords bubbly flow gas diffusion bubble breakup cavitation eulerian lagrangian approach 1 introduction the generation and entrainment of bubbles from a surface ship is of interest to marine applications besides the commonly known air entrainment sources due to free surface and hull interactions such as breaking and spilling waves at the bow and stern and boundary layer entrainment along the hull another potential source is bubble production by highly loaded devices such as propellers or other appendages with lifting surfaces photographic evidence has shown that a relatively large amount of bubbles is generated downstream of a lifting surface even in the absence of visible upstream bubbles the presence of bubbles can be attributed to the fundamental observation that any water contains microscopic sub visual bubble nuclei that act as seeds for many phenomena in mechanical and chemical engineering such as cavitation boiling gas transfer chemical reactions etc these nuclei can be very small microscopic bubbles franklin 1992 particles with gas filled crevices or entrapped gaseous micro or nano bubbles at the rigid boundaries mørch 2009 yount et al 1984 upon encountering low pressure conditions these nuclei grow and oscillate causing cumulative transfer of non condensable gas into the bubbles therefore it is essential that the analysis of bubble distributions and dynamics considers both nuclei sources i e suspended nuclei in water and boundary nucleation hsiao and chahine 2012 developed a discrete singularity model dsm to track a large distribution of bubbles in the flow field of a propeller obtained with a rans solver dsm computed each bubble motion and volume evolution along its trajectory in the propeller flow field a gas diffusion model solving the gas transport equation based on a thin boundary layer assumption plesset and zwick 1952 was incorporated in dsm to study the effects of non condensable gas transfer on the bubble dynamics this study explained the observation of a bubbly field behind a propeller while no visible bubbles were present upstream of the propeller and concluded that explosive bubble growth and violent collapse are an essential catalyst to enable significant net influx of initially dissolved gas into the bubble a more recent study hsiao et al 2017a has extended the previous results to the unsteady flow field of a finite span hydrofoil an eulerian lagrangian approach was introduced solving the unsteady liquid flow in an eulerian frame and providing the flow field at each time step to the lagrangian solver for tracking all the discrete bubbles no feed back of the bubble distribution to the liquid flow was considered in another implementation of the two phase flow model the eulerian and lagrangian approaches could be solved simultaneously and exchange information at each time step hsiao et al 2017b to result in a full two way coupling to enable tracking of a very large number of bubbles simultaneously the hsiao et al 2017a study used a finite difference scheme to solve the gas transport equation instead of the thin boundary layer approximation the boundary integral solution becomes less efficient with the increase in bubble numbers since it requires integration over the whole history of each bubble dynamics to compute the amount of gas inside the bubble this study not only revealed the importance of accounting for the instantaneous flow field on the dispersed bubbly flow but also demonstrated the effect of bubble breakup on the bubble size distribution downstream of the hydrofoil however bubble breakup was performed in a heuristic way with no theoretical or empirical basis for the parameters the current study is to further investigate the effects of gas diffusion and bubble breakup on the bubble size distribution in the wake for a cavitation bubbly flow over a foil at a relatively high cavitation number prior to the formation of sheet cavitation such a cavitating flow involves both the dynamics of bubbles just moving past the lifting surface and also highly dynamic cavitating bubbles that grow very significantly and then collapse violently as they pass the foil the current study also attempts to develop a better bubble breakup model by including an analytical model based on stability analysis of the bubble shape and a statistical model based on experimental observations the break up based on the stability analysis addresses mostly breakup due to bubble collapse while the second empirical model includes also shear effects the study also considers the effects of wall nucleation on the results 2 numerical approach the eulerian lagrangian two phase flow framework employed in this study has been extensively applied and documented in our previous studies these include modeling of tip vortex cavitation inception on a propeller hsiao and chahine 2004 2008 investigations of the effects of a propeller flow on bubble size distribution in water hsiao and chahine 2012 bubble entrainment in plunging jets hsiao et al 2013 wave propagation in bubbly media and bubble cloud collapse studies ma et al 2018 2015a b raju et al 2011 and modeling sheet to cloud cavitation hsiao et al 2017b etc the most complete procedure is based on the following statements 1 the dynamics and motion of the individual bubbles in the flow field are controlled by the two phase medium local properties and gradients 2 these local properties of the mixture void fractions and local densities are determined by the instantaneous distribution of bubble sizes and positions 3 the mixture flow field has an evolving density distribution which is space and time dependent and which satisfies mass and momentum conservation this general two phase flow framework allows both two way and one way coupling between the continuum based model and the discrete bubbles model for the examples shown in the present study only the one way coupling approach is used the eulerian and lagrangian solvers are run simultaneously in the lagrangian computations the motion and dynamic equations of the bubbles are solved at each time step accounting for bubble surface averaged pressures pressure gradients and velocities computed by the navier stokes liquid only flow solver the feedback from the bubbles to the flow field is turned off the interest being for low void fraction incoming flows and for dispersed bubbly flow type cavitation on the foil 2 1 eulerian continuum mixture model the two phase flow continuum is described using the navier stokes equations code 3dynafs vis which solves the continuity and momentum equations 1 ρ m t ρ m u 0 2 ρ m d u d t p μ m 2 u where the subscript m represents the mixture properties u is the mixture velocity and p is the pressure the mixture density ρ m and the mixture viscosity μ m can be expressed as functions of the gas volume fraction α through 3 ρ m 1 α ρ l α ρ g μ m 1 α μ l α μ g where the subscript l represents the liquid and the subscript g represents the gas in the present study very low incoming void fractions less than 10 5 are considered the same applies to the wake region only in the cavitation region over the foil the void fraction peak a certain spots at about 5 as a result for most of the cases presented here no feed back between the bubbles and the eulerian solver was taken into account and the liquid only unsteady solution was used at each time step to progress the solution density and viscosity were assumed constant and equal to the liquid density and viscosity we will illustrate for one case the effect of neglecting the local changes in the sound speed on the bubble dynamics the system of equations 1 and 2 is solved by an artificial compressibility method chorin 1967 in which a derivative of the pressure using the pseudo time τ multiplied by the inverse of an artificial compressibility factor β is added to the continuity equation which becomes when the density is invariant 4 1 β p τ u 0 as a consequence a hyperbolic system of equations is formed and can be solved using a time marching scheme the solution is iterated in the pseudo time until convergence to obtain a time dependent solution a newton iterative procedure is performed at each physical time step in order to satisfy the continuity equation 2 2 lagrangian discrete bubble model the lagrangian discrete bubble model 3dynafs dsm uses singularities to model the bubbles hsiao et al 2003 chahine 2008 this model has been shown to produce accurate results when compared to full 3d two way interaction computations hsiao and chahine 2004 the source term representing bubble volume oscillations uses a surface averaged approach to account for turbulent structures and non uniform flow field around the bubble flow field quantities which are important to the bubble dynamics and motion equations i e pressure velocity and pressure gradients are all obtained from the eulerian solution and averaged along the bubble surface a modified version of the keller herring equation keller and kolodner 1956 is used to describe the bubble dynamics and accounts for slip velocity between the bubble and the liquid this is written as 5 1 r c m r r 3 2 1 r 3 c m r u s 2 4 1 ρ m 1 r c m r c m d d t p v p g p e n c 2 γ r 4 μ m r r where r and r 0 are the bubble radii at times t and 0 p v is the liquid vapor pressure and u enc and p enc are respectively the averages of the liquid velocities and pressures over the bubble surface the slip velocity u s is the difference between u enc and the bubble translation velocity u b i e u s u enc u b in absence of gas diffusion the gas pressure p g is obtained from a polytropic compression law p g p g o r 0 r 3 k where p g o is the initial gas pressure and k is compression law gas constant when gas diffusion is included as is the case here the gas pressure is obtained from the solution of the gas diffusion equation and energy balance as described below c m is the local sound speed in the mixture in the low void fraction cases shown in this paper c m is just the sound speed in the liquid c l the effect of this assumption on the solution is illustrated below for one test condition the bubble trajectory is obtained from a balance of the forces on the bubble resulting from the unsteady viscous flow field and the product of the bubble acceleration and the accelerated mass mainly the

drag force the second and third terms account for the added mass the fourth term accounts for the presence of a pressure gradient while the fifth term accounts for gravity and the sixth term is a lift force saffman 1965 with ω being the vorticity vector we used c l 6 44 for the lift coefficient all terms obtained from the liquid solution are averaged terms over the bubble surface 3 dispersed bubbly flow simulations 3 1 unsteady single phase flow we consider the unsteady flow field over a naca0015 finite span rectangular hydrofoil with a round tip and an aspect ratio based on semi span of 2 see fig 1 and fig 2 the selected computational domain has all far field boundaries located six chord lengths away from the foil and is discretized using an h h type grid a total of 1 5 million grids 151 101 101 is used for the base grid 81 61 grid points are used to discretize the foil surface the first grid above the hydrofoil surface is at y 1 in order to properly describe the boundary layer in addition to this base grid two other levels of grid resolution using 12 million and 0 2 million grid points for double and half grid resolutions were used to examine grid sensitivity we consider an incoming uniform flow at an angle of attack relative to the foil of 8 at a reynolds number r e 1 5 106 corresponding to a chord length c l 0 15 m and a liquid velocity free stream velocity u 10 m s freestream velocities and pressures are specified in the upstream inflow boundary and in the far field side boundaries and a first order extrapolation for all variables is used at the outflow boundary a symmetry boundary condition is applied at the foil root section and no slip and zero normal pressure gradient conditions are imposed on the foil surface to study grid resolution effects we consider first reynolds averaged navier stokes rans solutions obtained with the k ε turbulence model and the three grid resolutions described earlier i e 41 31 81 61 and 161 121 shown in fig 1 non dimensional pressure contours p p p ρ u 2 where p is the freestream pressure obtained on the suction side of the finite span hydrofoil from all three grid resolutions are shown in fig 2 it is seen that in all three cases the converged steady state solutions are very similar on most of the hydrofoil surface except in the tip vortex region a quantitative comparison of the non dimensional pressure on both pressure and suction sides versus the non dimensional x coordinate at the root section of the hydrofoil is shown in fig 3 here again it is clear that refining the grid resolution does not modify or improve much the solution we can see that the rans has filtered out the unsteady turbulent structures and the converged flow appears as a steady flow without the local fluctuations which are very important for the dynamics of the bubble in the investigated flow therefore we consider another approach which does not use any model to describe the subgrid turbulence as in rans the navier stokes equations are directly solved without including a turbulence model in order to capture unsteady flows separation and vortex shedding vorticity filtering in this case is only through the grid size i e vortex structures smaller than the grid size cannot be captured this approach is similar to implicit les in which turbulence scales smaller than the grid size are automatically filtered out in this model numerical dissipation is considered sufficient to mimic the action due to the subgrid stresses fureby 2007 bensow and liefvendahl 2008 we have found that with this approach the flow separation and unsteady vortex shedding can be captured reasonably well and are predicted much better than when using a turbulence model fig 4 illustrates for the liquid only flow the unsteady flow separation with vortex shedding for the three grid densities considered when the computations have reached limit cycle oscillations the figure shows the non dimensional pressure contours and the iso pressure surface p 0 5 at successive times in the limit cycle it is seen that as the grid resolution is increased smaller pressure fluctuations scales are captured to compare the effects of grid resolution on the mean flow time averaged solutions are derived from the unsteady simulations for the non dimensional time t t u c l 10 fig 5 shows a comparison of the non dimensional pressures along the foil suction and pressure sides for the three grid resolution the rans solution is also shown it is seen that both the fine grid and the base grid capture the mean flow pressure as well as the rans solution with the k ε turbulence model while the coarse grid significantly under predicts the pressure on the suction side this provides confidence to use the base grid resolution for most of the bubbly flow computations presented below 3 2 dispersed bubbly flow to study the effect of the foil on the nuclei distribution 9 104 free field bubble nuclei are released in the naca0015 turbulent flow field 5 104 nuclei are of radius 20 μm 3 104 of radius 40 μm and 1 104 of radius 60 μm the nuclei are released from a preset release domain upstream of the foil the domain height in the z direction is selected to be 0 02 m in order to cover the window of opportunity though which nuclei need to pass in order to encounter the low pressure on the hydrofoil surface and the tip region the domain width in the y direction 0 32 m is specified to cover the full span of the hydrofoil the release domain has a length of 1 5 m in the streamwise direction such that enough nuclei can be supplied to conduct the unsteady simulations for 0 15 s the selected bubble number and release domain volume result in an upstream void fraction of 10 6 corresponding to a nuclei concentration per cm3 of 5 2 bubbles of 20 μm radius 3 2 bubbles of 40 μm radius and 1 0 bubbles of 60 μm radius fig 6 shows the bubble distribution in the foil flow field due to dynamic effects when gas diffusion is not included for a cavitation number σ 1 0 where the cavitation number is defined as 9 σ p p v 0 5 ρ u 2 we can observe that the nuclei grow to large sizes in the low pressure region on the suction side of the foil near the leading edge and in the tip vortex region however in absence of gas diffusion and bubble breakup the bubbles return to their original sizes once the field pressure returns to the upstream pressure level and no significant effect on the bubble size distribution can be observed typically the radius of a bubble as it traverses over the naca0015 can be illustrated in fig 7 when the bubble is in the window of opportunity and its trajectory takes it close to the foil through the low pressure region on the suction side it grows explosively until its path again brings it back into a higher pressure region at which time it will collapse and then eventually rebound after breaking up into smaller bubbles this is not shown in the figure to the contrary if the bubble trajectory keep it away from the low pressure region near the foil surface it will only grow slightly and then return less dramatically to its original size 4 effects of gas diffusion 4 1 gas diffusion model to study the effect of gas mass transfer in and out of the bubbles on the dispersed bubbly flow a gas diffusion model is used mass exchange results from the fact that in the presence of a concentration gradient gas dissolved in the liquid will diffuse from high concentration regions to low concentration regions the transport equation for the gas concentration c x t is given by 10 d c d t d g 2 c where d g is the gas molar diffusivity the value of d g depends on the liquid and gas and also on the liquid ambient temperature and pressure here we use d g 2 10 9 m2 s for air and water at 237 k and 0 1 mpa at a bubble interface the dissolved gas concentration c s is connected to the gas pressure inside the bubble p g through henry s law 11 c c s at r r with c s p g h where h is the henry constant this condition at the bubble interface is very important and actually drives the gas diffusion dynamics the other initial and boundary conditions for gas diffusion are 12 c c for t t 0 c c for r where c is the dissolved gas concentration far away from the bubble surface the gas transfer rate n g at the bubble liquid interface is directly proportional to the product of the interface area and the normal concentration gradient at the interface 13 n g d g s c n d s to obtain the gas pressure inside the bubble taking into account gas diffusion we consider the instantaneous energy and mass balance of the bubble content both components of the bubble content vapor and gas are assumed to be ideal gases and to follow the ideal gas law 14 p g v b n g r u t b p v v b n v r u t b where v b is the volume of bubble n v and n g are the number of moles of vapor and gas within the bubble respectively r u is the universal gas constant and t b is the absolute temperature of the gas and vapor mixture one consequence of this assumption is that the ratio of the mole numbers n g n v in the bubble is directly proportional to the ratio of the partial pressures p g p v due to the relatively short vaporization time compared to bubble dynamics and gas diffusion characteristic times the vapor is considered to instantaneously flow in and out of the bubble and p v is assumed equal to the equilibrium vapor pressure of the liquid at the bubble wall temperature considering the contents of the bubble and applying the first thermodynamics law one can write the energy balance for the control volume bounded by the bubble surface as 15 d u d w i v g n i h i d t where du is the change in internal energy dw is the work done on the control volume and h i is the specific enthalpy of constituent i the various terms in eq 15 can be expanded as 16 d u i v g c v i d n i t b d w p v p g d v b h i i v g c p i t l where c v and c p are the specific heat at constant volume and pressure respectively and t l is the liquid temperature combining eqs 15 and 16 and using superscripts t b and t l for c v and c p to indicate whether the specific heats are evaluated at the corresponding bubble or liquid temperature we obtain 17 c v v t b p v v b r u c v g t b p g v b p g v b r u p v p g v b c p v t l t l p v p g n g c p v t l t l p v p g p g 2 n g n g c p g t l t l 0 using the

g integration of eq 19 provides the instantaneous gas pressure to be used in eq 5 and eq 11 the specific heats c p g t b and c p v t l are assumed to vary only with temperature and their values are obtained using the correlation of van wylen and sonntag 1986 with θ t 100 t is in ok 20 c p t a b θ p d θ q e θ r r u where c p t used for both non condensable gas c p g t b and vapor c p v t l depends on the temperature inside the bubble t b or the liquid t l the constants a b d e p q and r used in eq 20 are listed in table 1 for water vapor and non condensable gas oxygen and nitrogen in this study the non condensable gas is assumed to be air which is treated as a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen the temperature of the liquid t l is assumed to be constant and equal to 20 c but the temperature inside the gas bubble t g is determined by 21 t g p g n g 0 r 3 p g 0 n g r 0 3 t l 4 2 effects of gas diffusion on the bubble size distribution gas diffusion effects on the bubble distribution over the lifting surface are then considered for water saturated with gas i e with a dissolved gas concentration of 0 66 mol m3 for a temperature of 237 k and an ambient pressure of 0 1 mpa fig 8 shows the resulting bubble distribution detailed analysis of the results shows a similar behavior of the bubbles to that in the absence of gas diffusion during the growth phase however significant differences are observed in the wake region after the bubbles start collapsing and rebounding as shown later with the gas diffusion included the bubbles fill up with gas and grow much larger than in the absence of gas diffusion this ends up making the fine vortices in the wake visible due to the bubbles collecting in the core of these vortices by observing the behavior of individual bubbles we are able to demonstrate the effects of gas diffusion on the bubble dynamics better fig 9 shows a typical scenario for a small free nucleus of initial radius r 0 50 μm as the nucleus encounters a low pressure region downstream of the leading edge it can either grow moderately and then oscillate or depending on the cavitation number it can undergo explosive growth and violent collapse the figure shows that at the higher cavitation number σ 1 2 the bubble grows to a maximum bubble radius of 0 65 mm and then reduces size as the pressure along the hydrofoil recovers in this case the bubble returns to a size of 70 μm downstream of the foil which is not much larger than its initial size the figure also shows the number of gas moles inside the bubble does not increase much at the lower cavitation number of 1 0 the bubble grows explosively to a much larger size and the number of moles of gas n g inside the bubble increases significantly over time becoming an order of magnitude larger than the initial value as a result after collapse and several oscillations the bubble ends up with a much larger radius 180 μm than the original 50 μm radius due to a net increase of the amount of gas in the bubble to illustrate quantitatively the effects of the foil presence and of gas diffusion on the bubbles as they pass over the finite span hydrofoil we sum the volume of all bubbles in a thin slice interrogation volume as shown in fig 10 the interrogation volume includes the full span δy 0 32 m a height of δz 0 02m and a thickness δx 0 01m in the chord direction fig 11 shows a comparison of the total bubble volume versus the streamwise distance between ignoring and including gas diffusion the strong effect of the gas diffusion can be seen downstream of the cavitation region between x 0 02 m and x 0 08 m the bubble volume increases dramatically by almost six orders of magnitude due to explosive bubble growth on the foil suction side in this region the effects of gas diffusion are not visible this is followed by bubble collapse and successive rebounds and oscillations for x 0 08 m in this region the total bubble volume with gas diffusion is seen to become two orders of magnitude larger than that in the absence of gas diffusion this difference in the total bubble volume is less visible between x 0 14 m and x 0 25 m because the volume of bubbles in the region is dominated by cavitation in the tip vortex to study the effect of gas diffusion on the results the bubble size distribution bsd is compared downstream in the wake region at the location x 0 4m the bubble number density is obtained in a slice volume of dimensions 0 01 m 0 32 m 0 05 m at x 0 4m after averaging the solutions for 0 04 s fig 12 compares the bubble size distribution at x 0 4m with and without gas diffusion it is seen that while in absence of gas diffusion the bubbles sizes return to the initial radii of 20 μm 40 μm and 60 μm with gas diffusion the foil significantly modifies the bubble size distribution downstream to a wide range between 20 μm and 300 μm 5 effects of boundary nucleation boundary nucleation is easily observed in conditions where gas diffusion e g beer or champagne glass and or boiling are dominant bubbles grow out of various fixed sites this phenomenon has been studied extensively in the past harvey 1944 suggested that gas pockets trapped in hydrophobic conical cracks and crevices of solid surfaces act as cavitation nuclei more recently mørch 2009 investigated this effect in more depth and suggested that a skin model similar to that proposed by yount et al 1984 for dispersed nuclei can also be used to describe the wall gas bubbles because solid surfaces submerged in a liquid tend to absorb amphiphilic molecules molecules having a polar water soluble group attached to a nonpolar water insoluble hydrocarbon chain and capture nanoscopic air pockets one can expect that clusters of such molecules form weak spots which are the source for bubble nucleation from the solid surface when low pressure conditions are achieved briggs 2004 for instance found that scrupulous cleaning was decisive for obtaining a high tensile strength of water and that contamination of interfaces is a primary factor in cavitation atchley and prosperetti 1989 identified unstable motion of the liquid solid gas contact line in the crevice and unstable growth of the nucleus volume due to loss of mechanical stability force balance specifically they related the threshold pressure to crevice aperture surface tension and gas concentration etc a boundary nucleation model based on existing experimental observations and theoretical studies was introduced by hsiao et al 2017b to model the initiation and dynamics of sheet cavities on foils in the nucleation model nuclei are released from the rigid boundaries when the pressure at the center of a discretized cell drops below a threshold pressure e g the vapor pressure n nuclei are then released from the cell in the flow field during the time interval δt 22 n n s f n δ t δ a where n s is the number density of nucleation sites per unit area f n is the nuclei release rate and δ a is the cell surface area hsiao et al 2017b applied this boundary nucleation model to simulate sheet to cloud cavitation and found it to recover very well experimentally measured berntsen et al 2001 time averaged cavity lengths and oscillation frequencies for a wide range of conditions we consider this model here to investigate the effects boundary nucleation has on the bubble distribution downstream of the foil fig 13 shows the resulting bubble distribution for two numerical simulations one with only boundary nucleation considered and the second with both field nuclei and boundary nucleation present the boundary nucleation considered here has a nucleation rate of 0 8 khz and a number density of nucleation sites of 10 per cm2 and results in a wall nucleation concentration of about 8 nuclei per cm3 assuming that the bubbles near the boundary are convected at the free stream velocity u 10 m s the field nuclei were introduced to the flow field with the same distribution as described in the previous section the figure shows that when considering only the boundary nucleation tip vortex cavitation does not develop because there are few nuclei that feed into the tip vortex the pressure at the hydrofoil surface near the tip region does not drop below the threshold to produce these nuclei the tip vortex cavitation is controlled by the free nuclei coming from a restricted volume upstream of the hydrofoil dubbed the window of opportunity hsiao and chahine 2005 otherwise the surface nuclei alone are able to reproduce a very similar cavitation pattern as when both sources of nuclei are considered fig 14 compares the total bubble volume versus the streamwise distance from the leading edge it is seen that the bubble volume obtained from both free nuclei and boundary nucleation is higher than when including only the free nuclei this is clear everywhere except between x 0 14 m and x 0 25 m where the total bubble volume is composed of the bubbles captured in the tip vortex also the figure shows that outside of the tip vortex region including the surface nucleation alone produces results closer to the full picture where both sources are included finally in the wake region the number of larger sized bubbles obtained from both nuclei sources is much higher than that obtained from the free nuclei only as seen in fig 15 6 effects of bubble breakup in the absence of a precise model for bubble breakup due to pressure gradients and shear flow near boundaries hsiao et al 2017a investigated the effects of the breakup using a heuristic model with the following characteristics a threshold for the breakup the timing of the breakup the number of resulting daughter bubbles the sizes of the daughter bubbles and the locations of the daughter bubbles although inclusion of this heuristic bubble breakup model resulted qualitatively in better correspondence with observations and made the fine vortices in the wake more visible due to collected bubbles the parameters used in the simulations were not based on solid grounds we attempt here to improve this breakup model here we evaluate two models one dubbed analytical model is based on stability analysis of the bubble shape and the second one dubbed empirical model is based on observations of bubble breakup in a cavitating venturi in general bubble breakup results from two mechanisms i e inertial bubble collapse and bubble stretching and shearing the analytical model considers only instabilities due to bubble collapse while the empirical model based on the observations in a venturi includes consideration of both mechanisms 6 1 model based on bubble stability analysis the stability of the bubble shape to non spherical disturbances has been studied analytically for a long time using perturbation analysis e g birkhoff 1954 plesset and mitchell 1956 for instance the non spherical bubble shape can be described as a linear superposition of spherical harmonics 23 r t r 0 a n y n 0 where y n 0 is a spherical harmonic of degree n and a n is perturbation amplitude which is a function of time the stability of the nonspherical interface is compromised when the amplitude of the perturbations grows significantly for small order perturbations a n r 0 plesset and mitchell 1956 derived the following equations for a n t after substituting r t into the rayleigh plesset equation using eq 23 24 a n 3 r r a n a a n 0 a n 1 n 1 n 2 γ ρ l r 3 n 1 r r eq 24 expresses a damped harmonic free oscillation system which becomes most unstable when ṙ 0 and r 0 brennen 1995 instabilities lead to a rapid growth of non spherical distortions and disintegration of the bubble the growth rate of the distortion is proportional to a and the harmonic mode which leads to the maximum value of a is when da dn 0 i e 25 d a d n 3 n 2 4 n γ 1 0 with 26 γ ρ l r 2 γ r eq 25 has a positive real root only when γ 0 and its value is given by 27 n 1 3 7 3 γ 1 2 2 note that γ is time dependent and reaches a maximum at the beginning of a bubble rebound fig 16 shows the time history of a bubble radius and of the corresponding parameter γ for a typical cavitation bubble traveling about the hydrofoil surface it can be seen that the value of γ reaches a local maximum at each bubble radius oscillation close to the time when the bubble radius reaches a local minimum therefore we impose in the simulations as breakup criterion that a bubble breakup will occurs at the time of rebound provided that the bubble radius oscillations are strong enough as expressed r max r 0 ς in the examples shown below we used ς 5 brennen 1995 estimated that the final number of daughter bubbles after many breakups has a cubic power dependence on the mode number n in the simulations below the breakup model is applied to each bubble at each rebound including to daughter bubbles we therefore will use the mode number i e the integer n as the number of daughter bubbles at each breakup after breakup each daughter bubble is also tracked individually and the same model parameters are imposed if the breakup criterion is satisfied again we also assume that all daughter bubbles have the same size and thus have a well defined radius r d conserving the original bubble volume 28 r d n 1 3 r with this we can determine all that is needed to enable a bubble breakup into n daughter bubbles and randomly distribute all these daughter bubbles within the confines of the parent bubble fig 17 shows the resulting bubble distribution when the bubble breakup model is applied in the case where only free nuclei are considered in the simulation by comparing to fig 8 reproduced as fig 17 a for ease of comparison we can see significant differences in the wake region where breakup occurs at rebounds downstream of the primary bubble growth and collapse region the visual appearance of the bubbles now is much closer to that seen experimentally russell et al 2016 direct comparison with the russell results are not possible because the experimentally used foil was different naca63a015 and the angle of attack was only 3 5 also the upstream nuclei distributions were different as well as the cavitation number however we have conducted simulations in chahine et al 2020 comparing with the russell experimental results fig 18 shows one such comparisons comparison of the total bubble volume versus the streamwise location is shown in fig 19 as expected the figure does not show a major influence of breakup on the total bubbles volume because as stated earlier the simulations imposed bubble volume conservation at breakup however the bubble size distribution in the wake region is significantly different between the two cases as can be seen in fig 20 accounting for bubble breakup significantly alters the bubble size distribution at x 0 4 m including the breakup results in a significant increase in the number of small and mid size bubbles and a reduction in the number of large size bubbles this leads to a dominant bubble size of about 100 μm in the wake region 6 2 breakup model based on experimental observations another way to determine the characteristic parameters to use in the numerical model or breakup is through experimental observations of cavitation bubble dynamics behavior to enable such close up observations of bubbles breakup in a cavitating field we have setup a closed flow loop with a venturi as the test section a sketch of the flow loop is shown in fig 21 vacuum can be applied to the supply reservoir to control the pressure of the loop and specifically at the venturi exit the selected venturi has a throat with a constant diameter section 13 7 mm long the venturi shape was selected to generate a local pressure field similar to that encountered by a bubble near the leading edge of the hydrofoil by adjusting either the flow velocity or the reservoir pressure we are able to control the cavitation number and select it to be slightly below the cavitation inception number such that traveling cavitation bubbles can be observed in the throat area of the venturi fig 22 shows a time sequence of images from high speed movies for traveling bubbles at a velocity at the throat of 14 5 m s when the back pressure measured at the end of the divergent section of the venturi is 1 08 atm such condition results in a cavitation number of 1 02 based on the throat velocity and the pressure measured in the venturi outlet section from this image sequence we can measure the bubble size evolution and count the number of visible daughter bubbles after breakup from several sets of high speed videos taken under different flow velocities we were able to observe a reasonable number of isolated cavitation bubbles growing to a range of different maximum radii and correlate this to the number of daughter bubbles after breakup as shown in fig 23 with this set of analyzed data we are able to establish a preliminary correlation between the number of visible bubbles after breakup and the maximum radius the bubble reached in the throat r max 29 n 2 2 7 r max r c where r c is the observed critical maximum bubble size below which bubble break does not occur and where the bubble radii are expressed in millimeters concerning the breakup implementation we select again that the bubble breakup occurs at the time of bubble rebound and we randomly distribute the daughter bubbles within the confines of the parent bubble using eq 29 for the number of daughter bubbles with uniform breakup size and r c as the breakup threshold we apply this breakup model to the flow over the naca0015 described above and predict the bubble size distribution downstream of the hydrofoil considering again only free nuclei the resulting dispersed bubbly flow over the finite span hydrofoil is shown in fig 24 although the wake obtained with this empirical breakup model looks similar to that shown in fig 17 the total number of bubbles and the predominant bubble sizes are quite different as illustrated in fig 25 the analytical breakup model results in a larger number of bubble as compared to the empirical breakup model and thus results in a bubble population with much smaller bubbles in the wake region 6 3 effect of upstream nuclei size distribution to investigate the effect of the initial nuclei size distribution the downstream bubble size distribution obtained from the upstream polydisperse bubble size distribution used so far in this paper is compared to the results obtained from two monodisperse distributions i e 20 μm and 60 μm all three upstream distribution having the same void fraction the three input upstream distributions are illustrated in fig 26 fig 27 compares the total bubble volume along the streamwise direction resulting from the three distributions it is seen that for the same initial void fraction the total bubble volume observed downstream here at x 0 4m is larger when a higher number of smaller nuclei is used this is because a larger number of small nuclei succeeds in drawing a larger amount of dissolved gas from the water due to rectified gas diffusion while the nuclei grow and travel along the foil this statement is true only when the concerned nuclei are larger than the critical size required to grow explosively when encountering the minimum pressure on the hydrofoil surface for σ 1 0 and α 8 all the nuclei considered in this study are all larger than the correspondent critical size which is 3 μm assuming the minimum pressure on the hydrofoil surface is the critical pressure chahine and shen 1986 fig 28 compares the resulting nuclei size distributions at x 0 4 m it is seen that the uniform 20 μm case results in a much higher number of bubbles in the downstream wake region due to a larger number of breakups while the uniform 60 μm case has the least number of downstream bubbles 7 importance of neglected effects as stated earlier all case studies presented in this paper have assumed that the void fraction is low enough to neglect in the simulations the effects of the variations of the two phase medium density viscosity and sound speed in this section we examine how restrictive this assumption is and evaluate how much this assumption affects the results for all cases shown above the void fraction is most everywhere in the flow domain of the order of 10 5 however on the suction side of the foil where the bubbles reach their maximum size the void fraction in some patches can reach 5 this is illustrated in fig 29 a which shows an instantaneous color contour of the void fraction computed within a moving interrogation volume of dimensions δx 0 01m δy 0 01m and δz 0 02m fig 29 b shows along y 0 01m four plots of the variations of the void fraction along x the two dashed lines are instantaneous manifestations of α x while the solid red line shows a time averaged curve of the same this can be represented quite well with the gaussian function 30 α 0 05 exp x 0 035 2 2 10 4 which is represented by the solid blue curve therefore to study the effect of a local void fraction increase in the region 0 01m x 0 07m on the behavior of the solution without having to rerun full two way interaction simulations we consider here the effect of imposing in the region 0 01m x 0 07 m the void fraction gaussian distribution represented in eqn 30 this spatial variation of the void fraction is then used to compute the variations of the density and viscosity versus x according to eqn 3 and we derive the sound speed according to brennen 1995 using 31 c m p ρ l 1 α 1 α 2 1 k α 1 α p ρ l c l 2 1 1 2 to conduct the analysis we consider separately and then combined the effects on the bubble dynamics of varying first the fluid properties density and viscosity and then the sound speed fig 30 shows the effects of each on the bubble radius time history r t for a typical cavitation bubble of initial radius 20 μm traveling along the hydrofoil surface the figure illustrates the fact that variable density viscosity and sound speed all affect r t but not significantly the variable sound speed seems to have the stronger influence and results in increased the damping of the bubble radius oscillations this results in smaller values of the bubble wall acceleration and therefore in smaller values of the breakup parameter γ defined in eqn 26 and shown in fig 31 this reduction in the values of γ is expected to result in a less breakups and a lower number of daughter bubbles and therefore ultimately in bubbles of a larger size in the wake this can actually be seen in fig 32 where the bubbles sizes in the wake end up larger in both cases where the liquid property and the sound speed were made functions of x the figure all shows the combined effects of changing all three properties viscosity density and sound speed which results in further increase in the resulting bubble sizes we should note however that these changes are really minimal when compared with the changes we have seen in the previous section when gas diffusion was included or when the breakup model was modified this gives credence to simplifying the model and considering only one way coupling for such computations 8 conclusions an eulerian lagrangian model was used to study the effects of the presence of a finite span rectangular naca0015 foil on the distribution of bubbles in the downstream flow gas diffusion into and out of the bubbles was included and was shown to have a major effect on the resulting bubble size distribution bubble sizes become larger than the original upstream sizes due to a net influx of dissolved gas into the bubbles during their dynamics along the foil taking into account boundary nucleation is also seen to affect significantly the bubble size distribution downstream with very fine bubbles collecting in the vortices in the foil wake thus visualizing these vortices bubble breakup was also seen to significantly affect the results a bubble breakup model based on bubble shape stability analysis was developed and applied to the study of the effect of bubble breakup on the bubble size distribution in the wake region though being neglected in the current study it will be interesting to also include the effect of coalescence of the daughter bubbles in future studies a bubble breakup model was also established based on empirical experimental observations in a venturi flow both breakup models were applied to simulate the bubbly flow over the naca0015 foil the comparison showed that the analytical breakup model resulted in a larger number of bubble breakups and a larger number of fine bubbles in the wake region as compared to the empirical breakup model the incoming upstream nuclei distribution has a strong effect on the resulting bubble distribution in the foil wake for the same initial void fraction water containing more small nuclei larger than the critical bubble size required for explosive growth sees a larger number of nuclei which grow explosively and draw in dissolved gas due to gas diffusion this results in a larger number of bubbles in the downstream wake credit authorship contribution statement chao

21633,coastal vegetations play crucial ecosystem functions including coastal protection considerable attention has been focused on the effects of vegetation and wave conditions on wave dissipation induced by vegetation wdv whereas the effects of tidal current are often ignored a series of physical experiments were performed to explore the effects of following current direction in the same direction as waves and opposing currents on wdv inside the rigid emergent vegetation canopy the experimental results indicate that following currents can either enhance or suppress wdv depending on the ratio between the current velocity magnitude and the maximum horizontal wave orbital velocity while opposing currents may enhance wdv more in addition to better understand small scale mechanisms responsible for wdv a quasi three dimensional 3 d numerical model using periodic boundary conditions was employed to extend the physical experiments to provide velocity profiles and force evolutions along the canopy a direct force measurement approach was applied to quantify drag coefficients under both pure wave and combined wave and current conditions finally considering the coupling effect of wave and current generic relations between drag coefficients and re kc were provided with relatively high correlation which are useful for future studies with respect to interaction among wave current and vegetation keywords rigid vegetation wave plus current wave dissipation direct force measurement approach drag coefficient 1 introduction with increasing storminess in recent years coastal vegetation systems such as salt marshes e g anderson and smith 2014 seagrasses e g luhar et al 2017 and mangroves e g maza et al 2019 have been found to significantly attenuate wave energy and reduce coastline erosion caused by seawater thereby providing effective protection to coastal habitats which is expected to be of great importance in the future in particular the mangrove system effectively attenuated wave energy from a 2004 indian ocean tsunami saving several villages huang et al 2011 and the main trunk and prop roots under tidal hydrodynamic loadings within mangrove systems can be regarded as fairly rigid on account of a large young s modulus of around 15 gpa maza et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 therefore mangrove systems were usually simplified to rigid cylinders to conduct research by ignoring their complex root systems huang et al 2011 maza et al 2015 ozeren et al 2014 tanino and nepf 2008 yao et al 2018 based on this simplification the rigid emergent array cylinders were employed to explore the interaction between mangroves and waves in this study to date considerable research has focused on wave energy dissipation induced by vegetation wdv under pure current conditions fonseca and cahalan 1992 bouma et al 2005 or pure wave conditions kobayashi et al 1993 mendez et al 1999 maza et al 2013 separately factors affecting wdv include vegetation characteristics i e stem diameter density stiffness pattern and distribution pattern and wave characteristics such as regular or irregular incident wave height and wave period möller 2006 bradley and houser 2009 yang et al 2012 jadhav et al 2013 koftis et al 2013 in fact coastal vegetation is usually affected by tidal currents or wave induced currents that flow in conjunction with wind or swell waves hu et al 2014 losada et al 2016 however the possible effects of co existing currents on wdv are yet to be fully understood because of its complexity which is of great importance to understand the hydrodynamic sedimentation and exchange processes in a coastal vegetation system to the best of our knowledge a limited number of previous studies on wdv with respect to following currents current direction in the same direction as wave propagation hu et al 2014 li and yan 2007 paul et al 2012 were conducted and inconsistent conclusions were drawn about whether the currents increase or decrease wdv li and yan 2007 found that following currents always increase wdv by contrast paul et al 2012 pointed out that following currents can significantly reduce the wave damping capacity of the tested vegetation model this inconsistency was explained partially by hu et al 2014 by investigating the effect of the velocity ratio α defined as the ratio between the imposed following current velocity u c magnitude and the maximum horizontal wave orbital velocity u w hu et al 2014 pointed out that the tested α was in the range of 1 5 and 3 5 in li and yan 2007 while it was less than 0 5 in paul et al 2012 thus a series of systematic tests over a wide range of α were carried by hu et al 2014 which showed that the effects of the following currents on wdv depend on α instead of the u c magnitude alone and the range of α based on whether following currents enhance or suppress wdv was provided it is important to note that the abovementioned studies only analyzed the effects of the following currents on wdv and the opposing current propagating in the opposing direction of waves effect was not taken into account recently losada et al 2016 conducted a laboratory test with respect to real flexible vegetation interaction with both following and opposing currents and they found that the following currents tend to reduce wdv within a limited α range of 0 5 1 4 while the opposing currents increase wdv however with respect to rigid vegetation the effects of opposing currents on wdv are not well understood within a wider α range it is well accepted that wdv is mainly caused by the work done by the drag force f d acting on the vegetation a bulk drag coefficient c d was introduced to account for uncertainties in f d induced by the vegetation dalrymple et al 1984 mendez and losada 2004 suzuki et al 2012 determining c d values is crucial for the accurate prediction of wdv however the c d parameterization for a natural vegetation canopy is still challenging since it may be affected by a number of factors typically c d is determined by means of physical experiments either by using a calibration or direct force measurement approach hu et al 2014 as a conventional method the calibration approach determines c d by calibrating its value using wdv models to fit the wave height attenuation along the canopy mendez et al 1999 augustin et al 2009 nevertheless this calibration approach cannot be applied in studying the interaction between vegetation and combined wave and current flows because the influence of co existing current on wdv is not considered in previous wdv models dalrymple et al 1984 recently this limitation has been relaxed by losada et al 2016 who proposed a new analytical model based on energy conservation to study the wave damping induced by flexible vegetation under combined waves and current conditions note that the calibration approach assumes that the measured wave energy dissipation is entirely caused by vegetation drag other dissipative processes such as wave breaking turbulence and surface friction of vegetation and tank walls have not been explicitly considered but concentrated in the vegetation drag which may cause c d to be overestimated hu et al 2014 chen et al 2018 compared to the calibration approach the direct force measurement approach hu et al 2014 is a newer approach that based on the original morison equation rather than wdv models and it requires synchronized impact velocity and force data to derive c d by quantifying the work done by f d in a wave period since the morison equation is available in both pure wave and combined wave and current flows this approach can be adopted to derive c d under both flow conditions once the c d value was determined using the calibration or direct force measurement approach as mentioned previously its intrinsic relationship was examined for pure wave conditions with a series of dimensionless parameters such as the reynolds number re and the keulegan carpenter number kc mendez and losada 2004 nepf 2011 jadhav et al 2013 henry et al 2015 note that when flow conditions are converted from pure waves to combined waves and current flows the c d values are expected to vary accordingly however the effects of the tidal current have not been fully considered in the description of c d relations it is only until recently that new relationships in terms of c d re and c d kc are extended to combined wave and following current conditions in hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 respectively however the c d characteristics under combined wave and opposing current conditions have not yet been clarified therefore the main objective of this paper aims at a comprehensive analysis in terms of the effect mechanism of following and opposing currents on wdv compared to interaction with rigid emergent vegetation under pure wave conditions therefore as a first step a series of flume experiments with rigid array emergent cylinders were conducted to explore the effects of following and opposing currents on wdv with a wide range of the velocity ratio α experimental results are analyzed and discussed in terms of wave and current parameters such as incident wave height wave period current velocity and current direction subsequently based on flow 3d 10 0 software a quasi three dimensional 3 d cfd numerical model using periodic boundary conditions was conducted to extend the physical experiments to better understand the flow structures inside the vegetation canopy velocity profiles and forces exerted on individual cylinders were provided in detail the direct force measurement approach was applied to quantify drag coefficients under both pure wave and combined wave and current flows finally the generic relations between drag coefficients and re kc for the combined wave and current flows were provided considering the current effect the manuscript is organized as follows the experimental setup and tests are described in section 2 and section 3 is devoted to presenting and discussing the wave attenuation results obtained for different physical tests section 4 shows the numerical simulations including the model description and validation numerical results and discussion finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 experimental setup to investigate the wave attenuation by rigid emergent vegetation under combined wave and current conditions a series of physical experiments were performed in a wave flume of the hydraulic lab at ocean university of china the wave flume is 30 0 m long 1 0 m wide and 1 2 m deep schematized in fig 1 a a digital piston type wave generator is placed on the left side of the flume to generate the desired regular wave trains on the opposite end of the flume a 5 m long wave absorber made of porous material is used to minimize unwanted reflected waves a circular pipe system was used to generate the current flow in the flume rather than using the upstream and downstream water tanks and it consists of a water tank a water pipe a pump and a valve under the wave flume as well as the flow entrance and exit the desired following and opposing currents can be achieved by adjusting the flow entrance and exit it should be mentioned that although the current flow varies rapidly in the vicinity of flow entrance and exit a relatively uniform and steady current flow field can be developed within the working area far from the flow entrance and exit without the wave and vegetation effect this steady current flow field has been well generated in yin et al 2019 for studying the interaction between pneumatic breakwater with combined wave and current actions and many studies e g hu et al 2014 lou et al 2018 have also successfully used such a current generation technique to explore the interaction between vegetation and combined wave and current flows during the experiments in this study the waves started to be generated after the relatively steady current was achieved within the working area the mimic vegetation model was designed considering a mature mangrove rhizophora forest with a main trunk diameter equal to 0 20 m alongi 2008 the capabilities of the experimental facilities and the required wave parameters were taken into account and a geometric similarity scale of 1 10 was used for the experiments to reproduce the processes arising in the prototype the mimic vegetation model was built by fixing polyvinyl chloride pvc cylinders in holes drilled in the pvc plate bottom fig 1 b it should be noted that the pvc cylinder had a density of 1 40 103 kg m3 and a young s modulus of 3 14 3 92 gpa although the pvc cylinder had a different modulus of elasticity compared with the live mangrove tree 15gpa reported in zhang et al 2015 this pvc material was chosen to be rigid enough to avoid deformations under wave action in the lab maza et al 2019 yao et al 2018 the height of the cylinders was 0 70 m and their diameter was 0 02 m the vegetation model was 1 0 m 1 0 m length width and the pvc cylinders were distributed uniformly with a space of 0 05 m following a tandem pattern with a density of 399 cylinders m2 fig 1 c the beginning of the vegetation model is set as the origin in fig 1 a which is located at 14 5 m from the wave generator froude similarity was considered when determining the hydrodynamic wave conditions following real wave conditions reported in mangrove environments by previous studies e g bao 2011 brinkman 2006 a range of wave heights and periods were chosen in the following experiments before the start of each experiment the flume was filled with fresh tap water for a still water depth h of 0 40 m the wave generator generated regular waves with periods t ranging from 1 0 to 1 8 s 3 16 5 69 s at the prototype scale with an interval of 0 2 s and wave heights h i ranging from 0 06 to 0 12 m 0 6 1 2 m at the prototype scale with an interval of 0 02 m the following and opposing current velocities u c vary from 0 3 to 0 3 m s 0 95 to 0 95 m s at the prototype scale with an interval of 0 1 m s the negative sign denotes that the current direction is opposite to the wave propagation direction similar to the current flow conditions performed in the physical experiments concerning open channel flow interaction with mangrove model by zhang et al 2015 and maza et al 2017 a scenario summary for the physical experiments and numerical simulations is presented in table 1 note that control runs without vegetation were also performed for the same wave parameters as used with vegetation theses control runs allow analyzing the wave reflection and friction produced by the flume bottom and sidewalls and all runs were completed three times to ensure they were repeatable and accurate representations of the conditions being tested furthermore the feasibility of wave parameters was first checked by the geometric and mechanical properties of the vegetation model based on the vegetation parameter reported in noarayanan et al 2012 the natural frequency of the pvc cylinder was estimated to be around 7 35 s 1 which was not the same order of magnitude with the test wave periods 0 56 1 0 s 1 therefore no resonance phenomenon will occur when the wave passes through the vegetation model and in fact this phenomenon was also observed during the experiments the imposed current velocity was measured and calibrated by a down looking acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with a sampling frequency of 30 hz installed at half of the still water depth and 3 0 m away from the seaward edge of the vegetation model as suggested by hu et al 2014 this measured horizontal velocity at mid water depth roughly equals to the depth average velocity inside the vegetation canopy i e the acting velocity on vegetation chen et al 2018 yao et al 2018 in addition eight capacitance type wave gauges referred to as wg1 to wg8 were installed along the flume to measure the time histories of the free surface elevations at a sampling rate of 50 hz to evaluate the wave height attenuation static calibration of the wave gauges was performed before each test to ensure their accuracy within 0 1 mm to study the vegetation induced wave attenuation wg3 to wg7 wave gauges were installed inside the canopy zone with the adjacent distance of 0 25 m starting at the seaward edge of the vegetation model note that wg1 and wg2 wave gauges are installed in front of the vegetation model to separate the incident and reflected waves and wg8 installed 0 5 m away from leeward edge of the vegetation model was used to measure the transmission wave height it needs to mention that the distance between wg1 and wg2 was adjusted according to the incident wavelength for each test to quantify the influences of the reflected waves from the flume a wave reflection analysis was performed based on the two probe method goda and suzuki 1976 during the control tests without the vegetation effect using energy consideration and the fast fourier transform technique the incident and reflected wave heights h i and h r respectively are estimated from the composite wave heights measured at wg1 and wg2 wave gauges and the reflection coefficients k r were calculated based on k r h r h i as a result such a coefficient fell within the range 0 10 0 15 for all test wave conditions in this study this indicated that despite the presence of a wave absorber at the end of the flume the impact from wave reflection cannot be neglected hence to eliminate the influence of wave reflection on wdv only the time window unaffected by reflected waves was used in the data analysis this was defined as the period between full wave development and the return of the first reflected wave to wg7 waves were considered to be fully developed when the water surface elevation reached 95 of the incident wave amplitude and at least five small waves had passed based on linear wave theory the return time was estimated within the range of about 19 24 s for the test wave periods t 1 0 1 8 s therefore regular waves were generated for 30 s during each experiment to ensure that enough fully developed waves were be entirely unaffected by reflection from the flume end and were used to analyze wdv inside the canopy each experiment was repeated three times and the differences in wave height among them were generally less than 3 the final experimental data in this study are based on the mean values of the three runs 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 velocity and wave height data analysis considering the doppler effect the horizontal flow velocity under combined wave and current conditions chen et al 2018 based on linear wave theory is given by 1 u u c g h k 2 σ cw cosh k z h cosh k h cos k x σ t where u is combined horizontal flow velocity under combined wave and current conditions u c is the imposed unidirectional current velocity g is the gravitational acceleration σ cw is the angular frequency associated with combined waves and currents σ cw σ u c k σ is the angular frequency under pure wave conditions k is the wave number the subscript cw indicates the case of combined waves and currents therefore in order to quantitatively compare the relative magnitudes of current flow velocity and wave velocity to determine which effect is predominant as suggested by hu et al 2014 the velocity ratio was defined as α u c u w in which u w is the maximum wave orbital velocity which was depth averaged based on linear wave theory in this study 2 u w 1 h h 0 g h k 2 σ cw cosh k z h cosh k h d z it is well known that wave attenuation along the canopy can be evaluated by a wdv model eq 3 derived from the conservation of energy equation dalrymple et al 1984 the energy loss of waves propagating through vegetation attributed to the work done acting on the vegetation 3 k v h h 0 1 1 β x where k v is the damping coefficient h is the wave height within the canopy and h 0 is the initial wave height at the seaward edge of the canopy x is the longitudinal distance along the canopy β is the damping factor that can be obtained by fitting eq 3 when the spatial wave height data within the canopy are available to exclude the possible influence of flume bottom and sidewall friction on wdv augustin et al 2009 hu et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 the wave height reduction was measured within the region of x 0 1 0 m during the control tests without considering the vegetation effect the results showed that the damping factor β was generally less than 0 004 for all control tests mainly because that the test canopy zone is quite short only 1 0 m long as a result the influence of flume bottom and sidewall friction on wdv was negligible without causing major deviations in this study note that the wave decay model eq 3 has also been successfully adopted in numerous previous studies e g mendez and losada 2004 anderson and smith 2014 ozeren et al 2014 hu et al 2014 wu and cox 2015 chen et al 2018 mattis et al 2019 to calibrate k v by fitting experimental data under pure wave conditions the same wave decay function was also available for combined wave and current conditions hu et al 2014 losada et al 2016 chen et al 2018 eq 3 shows that the damping factor β is of significance to describe the wave height attenuation characteristics inside the canopy indicating that a larger β illustrates a better wdv performance induced by vegetation hereafter the subscript pw denotes pure wave conditions i e β pw represents the damping factor under the pure wave condition and β cw corresponds to the combined wave and current condition in this section the effects of several factors e g incident wave height h i wave period t and current velocity u c on the wdv under both the pure wave and combined wave and current conditions were discussed in detail based on experimental results 3 2 wdv under pure wave conditions fig 2 shows the effect of incident wave height on the wave dissipation by vegetation under pure wave conditions for t 1 2 s and 1 6 s the beginning of the vegetation zone is set as the origin as shown in fig 1 a the curves fitted to the relative wave heights based on eq 3 using a nonlinear least squares method are also included in the figures it is found that the k v data for t 1 6 s obeys the wave decay formulation based on eq 3 more than that for t 1 2 s however all fitted curves share a similar wave attenuation pattern for various wave heights the attenuation rate of k v increases with an increase in h i a larger h i results in higher β pw values as expected which indicates that vegetation exhibits better wave dissipation under larger h i conditions the effect of wave period on wdv is presented in fig 3 two different wave heights h i 0 06 m and 0 10 m are considered as examples here it is found that the k v data for h i 0 10 m obeys the wave decay formulation based on eq 3 more than it does for h i 0 06 m overall they show a similar wave attenuation decay for various t where the damping factor β pw decreases with increasing t i e the vegetation performs a better wave dissipation under smaller t conditions note that β pw varies a little as t increases to 1 6 s or 1 8 s indicating that the wave attenuation characteristics of vegetation are no longer sensitive to the variation of the wave period for relatively larger t conditions 3 3 wdv under combined wave and current conditions fig 4 shows the effects of the current velocity u c on the vegetation induced wave attenuation under wave current and wave current conditions the expression wave current means that the imposed current is in the same direction as the wave propagation direction and wave current indicates that the current direction is opposite to the wave direction the wave conditions with h i 0 1 m t 1 2 s and t 1 8 s are considered as examples the effect of currents on wdv can be identified by comparing k v with various imposed current velocities u c for wave current conditions with a smaller period t 1 2 s the β cw values are always larger than the β pw values for the pure wave condition and β cw increases with an increasing u c in contrast for t 1 8 s the β cw value 0 38 of u c 0 1 m s is smaller than β pw value 0 407 u c 0 m s and the β cw values further increase when u c rises from 0 2 m s to 0 3 m s this suggests that the presence of the following currents do not always promote wdv and a smaller following current may suppress wdv to some extent which is consistent with the results reported by hu et al 2014 and paul et al 2012 for rigid canopy and seagrasses respectively this confirms that the effect of the following currents on wdv can be either promoting or suppressing depending on the velocity ratio α as will be discussed in fig 5 in detail for wave current conditions the results for t 1 2 s and 1 8 s show the same general trend although some differences are observed the β cw values are always larger than β pw values which indicates that the opposing current can generally promote wave attenuation in addition as the magnitude of u c increases from 0 m s to 0 3 m s the β cw values gradually increase from 0 801 to 2 633 and 0 514 to 1 436 for t 1 2 s and 1 8 s respectively and this leads to a higher wdv compared to fig 4 a with fig 4 b when the magnitude of the following currents is equal to that of opposing currents the β cw values of opposing currents are much larger than those of the following ones which indicates that the opposing currents are more effective for wdv than following currents to some extent moreover this effect is more significant for smaller t scenarios which is similar to the effects of the wave period on wdv under pure wave conditions shown in fig 3 it can thus be concluded that the presence of currents either following or opposing waves modifies the resulting damping for pure wave to further evaluate the effects of the current flow on wdv the ratio of wave damping factor β between the pure wave and combined wave and current conditions is defined as r β β cw β pw thus if r β 1 it means that the wdv is strengthened with the presence of currents if r β 1 wdv is weakened because of the current effect fig 5 shows the relationship between the r β and the velocity ratio α it can be seen that as α increases the r β values for both wave current and wave current conditions follow the exponential growth trend and the growth rate for wave current conditions is much greater than wave current conditions the point where the growth trend is separated appears around α 1 in particular when α 2 43 r β increases to 44 for wave current conditions while r β is only 4 5 for wave current conditions which confirms that the opposing current is more beneficial to wdv also for both wave current and wave current conditions r β shows a general increasing trend with an increase in the u c magnitude 0 1 to 0 3 m s the above is consistent with the results as shown in fig 4 on the other hand note that the r2 value of the fitting curve for the wave current conditions is 0 90 which shows a better correlation than that for the wave current ones r2 0 67 indicating that r β has a stronger dependency on the velocity ratio α for the wave current conditions note that the line r β 1 is plotted in the figure as a reference to discuss the effects of the current on wdv the data in the α 0 3 2 0 range is partially enlarged as an inset illustration shown in fig 5 it is interesting to be observed that for wave current conditions in the range of α 0 37 to 1 54 the r β values of a few data points are less than 1 corresponding to the smaller u c scenarios 0 1 m s 0 2 m s this implies that within this range of α the presence of the following currents may decrease the wdv in contrast the r β values of other data are larger than 1 especially for larger u c scenarios 0 3 m s and this indicates that the presence of larger following currents can increases the wdv therefore the following currents can either enhance or suppress wdv depending on α which is consistent with the conclusions reported by hu et al 2014 who concluded that for smaller values of α 0 65 α 1 25 depending on the test following currents may suppress wdv in contrast a different pattern occurs for wave current conditions it can be seen that all r β values are greater than 1 indicating that opposing currents will always enhance wdv however when α is smaller i e u c 0 1 m s the contribution of opposing currents to wdv is rather limited to some extent as a summary the opposing currents always play a supportive role in enhancing wdv while the following currents may enhance or suppress within α of 0 37 to 1 54 on the other hand the opposing currents exhibit better performance than the following currents for enhancing wdv when α is larger i e the effect of current velocity is dominant 4 numerical simulations the experimental results have allowed the analysis of the effects of different variables on wdv in terms of rigid emergent vegetation under combined wave and current conditions further information about the velocity profiles and force evolutions along the canopy is gained by complementing physical experiments with a set of numerical simulations to provide high spatial resolution information and time series of variables not measured in the physical model numerical tests are conducted considering identical experimental conditions to reproduce the wave attenuation processes induced by vegetation 4 1 numerical model description the mathematical models based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approximation provide a reasonable way to study hydrodynamic behavior for engineering purposes because of the satisfying computation costs and simple assumptions garcia et al 2004 as a simple turbulent model no major adjustments to constants or functions are required the re normalisation group rng k ε model can successfully predict complex flow phenomena yakhot et al 1992 as a consequence in this study the rans equations coupled with the rng k ε model were used to simulate wave and current motions as well as turbulence the volume of fluid vof technique was adopted to track water surface hirt and nichols 1981 the aforementioned models were executed using flow 3d 10 0 software the boundary conditions of the computational domain were defined as follows the velocity inlet boundary was used at the wave generation boundary to achieve the desired regular wave and current flows the sponge layer damping method was applied at the outflow boundary to minimize the wave reflection where the vertical velocities were gradually and artificially reduced by multiplying an absorption function in the sponge layer region zhang et al 2014 to improve computing efficiency the periodic boundary conditions were considered at the side boundaries of the numerical flume which can eliminate the undesired effects of wall boundaries effectively at the top side of the flume the pressure was specified as atmospheric pressure the no slip wall boundaries were applied both on the flume bottom and the cylinder surfaces the turbulence properties were estimated from law of the wall boundary condition finite difference approximations were employed to discretize governing equations the first order upwind scheme was adopted to solve the continuity and momentum equations the pressure solution was calculated iteratively by the generalized minimum residual method gmres saad and schultz 1986 a default pressure solver in flow 3d 10 0 software due to its higher degree of accuracy and convergence characteristics to obtain accurate simulation results with computational stability the initial time step was chosen as small as 0 01 s and it can be adjusted automatically at each iteration to satisfy the convective limits and diffusion conditions 4 2 mesh sensitivity analysis as mentioned before the periodic boundary conditions were considered at the side boundaries of the numerical flume so that a small computational domain can represent an infinite computing domain the required cell number was reduced to significantly improve the computing efficiency as a result only three rows of cylinders were considered in the computational domain to reproduce the configuration in the physical experiment the numerical domain 25 0 m long 0 15 m wide and 0 70 m deep was partitioned using structural meshes by flow 3d 10 0 software it is well known that mesh size plays a significant role in the computational cost and accuracy and its determination deserves a mesh sensitivity analysis with regard to the computational domain near the wave surface and cylinder zone they were refined to better catch the wave surface as well as to obtain the wave force on cylinders with higher accuracy to reach a balance between the computational cost and result accuracy a mesh sensitivity analysis with respect to the cylinder zone was conducted using three meshes mesh 1 to mesh 3 mesh 1 corresponds to a coarser mesh with a uniform mesh δx 0 01 m δy 0 01 m δz 0 01 m in x y z direction respectively and the mesh resolutions of mesh 2 and mesh 3 are δx 0 005 m δy 0 005 m δz 0 01 m and δx 0 005 m δy 0 005 m δz 0 005 m respectively fig 6 shows the computational wave elevation histories at wg6 location using mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 under the pure wave condition h i 0 10 m t 1 4 s without vegetation it was found that all the relative deviations were less than 12 for mesh 1 and mesh 2 and 5 8 for mesh 2 and mesh 3 respectively this indicates that mesh 2 shows a good agreement with mesh 3 and it can be considered that the mesh size of mesh 2 is relatively independent of the computational results as a result mesh 2 was chosen for the following computation after considering the balance between the numerical accuracy and computational speed 4 3 numerical model validation 4 3 1 wave surface elevations to validate the mathematical model a comparison of simulated and experimental wave surface elevations η are presented with without vegetation under the combined wave and current conditions in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively fig 7 shows a comparison of the simulated and experimental η at the wg6 location for the h i 0 1 m t 1 4 s and u c 0 2 m s scenarios without vegetation the wave pattern induced by the combined wave and current interaction obviously differs from that of the pure wave condition as shown in fig 6 after interacting with the following current fig 7 a the wavelength increases because of the doppler shift the effect of currents on intrinsic wave frequency wolf and prandle 1999 besides the wave height becomes smaller because of the wave action conservation when waves travel with following currents consequently the wave steepness decreases due to the longer wavelength and smaller wave height which is in line with the conclusion reported by umeyama 2010 and zhang et al 2014 in general fig 7 a shows that there is a good agreement between numerical results and experimental data although a small time lag around 0 13 s between them exists at the first wave peak location this discrepancy may due to the fact that the first experimental wave has not yet been fully developed resulting in a greater asymmetry in contrast the opposing current shows a different pattern in fig 7 b that the wave height increases are induced by the opposing current which leads to an increasing wave steepness in general the numerical results agreed well with the experimental data and the maximum deviations between them were less than 5 3 which indicates that the present numerical model is able to simulate the combined wave and current behavior with acceptable accuracy the numerical model was further validated by considering the vegetation effect for wave current scenario fig 8 shows a comparison of the simulated and experimental η at the wg6 location for h i 0 08 m t 1 2 s and u c 0 2 m s in general the numerical wave profile agrees well with the experimental data it can be observed that due to the influence of vegetation the waves present a certain nonlinear effect and the significant discrepancy occurs at the wave peak however the maximum deviations between the numerical and experimental data were less than 12 overall the present numerical model is able to simulate the wave height evolution when combined wave and current flows pass through the vegetation with satisfactory accuracy 4 3 2 velocity field and force exerted on cylinders laboratory tests performed by hu et al 2014 were used to test the present numerical model as they measured velocity and acting force data simultaneously within the canopy under wave current conditions the experiment in hu et al 2014 was conducted in a wave flume with a mimicked vegetation canopy 6 m long by 0 8 m wide placed in the middle of the wave flume see fig 1 in hu et al 2014 the vegetation mimics were modeled using stiff wooden cylinders with a diameter of 0 01 m and a height of 0 36 m the built vegetation canopy was constructed with a uniform staggered configuration and three cylinder densities n 62 139 and 556 stems m2 the tested water depths h were set as 0 25 m and 0 50 m respectively resulting into two relatively small submergence ratio h h v 1 and 1 39 h v is the height of cylinder submerged in water body chen et al 2018 the impact force f data on 4 individual cylinders and the in phase horizontal velocity u data within the mimic canopies were measured by 4 force transducers and 4 emfs electromagnetic flow manufacture meters respectively a series of regular waves with steady following current conditions were performed refer to hu et al 2014 for details among these test conditions the submerged canopy n 556 stems m2 and the wave case wave1216 h i 0 12 m and t 1 6 s with following current u c 0 05 and 0 15 m s were selected as the test parameters used for validation with the present numerical model in this simulation the periodic boundary conditions were also considered at the side boundaries of the numerical flume to reproduce the vegetation configuration in the physical experiment the computational domain was defined as 10 0 0 06 0 70 m in the x y and z directions respectively a mesh sensitivity analysis was carried out first two sets of mesh resolution were used δx δy δz 0 005 m and 0 0025 m and no virtual differences were found between the simulated results using these two meshes thus the mesh with δx δy δz 0 005 m with a total of 2 373 000 cells was used in numerical simulations after considering the computational accuracy and cost the time step was chosen as 0 01 s this mesh takes 13 h to run 10 s of actual time to model the wave propagation through the cylinder field by using a 10 processor pc fig 9 shows the comparisons between numerical and experimental data about the time varying velocity u and force f at x 4 5 m location the beginning of the vegetation model is set as the origin within the canopy in the numerical post processing forces exerted on the cylinders are obtained considering pressure and viscous components as 4 f 0 h η p μ e f f u x d a where p is the total pressure field μ eff is the effective kinematic viscosity which includes the laminar and the turbulent contribution to shear stresses and da the differential area along the cylinder it can be found from fig 9 a that u exhibits an oscillating trend within one wave period and a larger u c can shift the overall u further towards the positive direction in general there is a satisfactory agreement between the numerical results and experimental data for all scenarios in contrast fig 9 b shows that the magnitudes of f with different u c vary according to that of u it can be seen that a time lag between the numerical and experimental data exits around 0 12 s for u c 0 15 m s scenario which may lead to the largest discrepancies between the two near wave crest and wave trough i e the magnitudes of f are underestimated by about 11 near the wave crest and overestimated by about 18 near the wave trough both the intrinsic error of the physical tests and the numerical error in the numerical simulation may lead to this discrepancy however the overall varying trends for u c 0 15 m s scenario are well predicted based on this numerical model moreover a good agreement between the numerical results and experimental data for u c 0 and 0 05 m s scenarios was observed consequently both figs 8 and 9 show that the numerical model can well predict the wave surface elevations velocity and vegetation induced force information when waves interact with the vegetation under combined wave and current flows therefore based on this numerical model the velocity profiles and force evolutions within the canopy under combined wave and current conditions will be explored in more detail and the drag coefficient will be discussed using the direct force measurement approach based on the numerical velocity and force data 4 4 numerical results and discussion 4 4 1 direct force measurement approach under both pure wave and combined wave and current conditions the horizontal component of the wave induced total force on an individual cylinder can be expressed by morison equation morison et al 1950 5 f f d f m 1 2 ρ c d h v b v u u π 4 ρ c m h v b v 2 u t where f is the total horizontal force on an individual cylinder f d and f m are the drag force and inertia force respectively ρ 1000 kg m3 is the density of water b v is the diameter of cylinder and u is the horizontal cross sectional average flow velocity can be obtained by the numerical post processing utilities based on flow 3d 10 0 software in this study c d is the drag coefficient and c m is the inertia coefficient the contribution of f d is expected to exceed the contribution of f m with respect to wdv because f m acts out of phase with the velocity dalrymple et al 1984 kobayashi et al 1993 mendez and losada 2004 as a consequence the work done by f m in a wave period is roughly equal to zero and is typically neglected mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 and this was also available under both pure wave and combined wave and current conditions hu et al 2014 chen et al 2018 yao et al 2018 under these conditions a period averaged c d can be derived from the following equation hu et al 2014 6 c d 2 π ω π ω f d u d t π ω π ω ρ h v b v u 2 u d t 2 π ω π ω f u d t π ω π ω ρ h v b v u 2 u d t compared with the internal characteristics of the canopy the vegetation induced force on both ends of the canopy is relatively large refer to 4 4 3 section because they are directly exposed to the wave and current flows due to the lack of sheltering effect maza et al 2015 in order to obtain the bulk drag characteristics of the entire canopy the space averaged period averaged c d can be derived based on eq 6 by averaging the period averaged c d from the four locations x 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 6 m and 0 8 m for simplicity the space averaged period averaged c d is termed as c d in the following investigation the similar method has also been satisfactorily adopted in hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 for vegetated flows under wave current conditions as mentioned in the introduction section previous studies pointed out that drag coefficient was closely related to either re u m b v ν or kc u m t b v respectively where u m is the characteristic velocity acting on the vegetation and ν 10 6 m2 s is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid when the velocity measurements are unavailable u m is usually estimated based on the linear wave theory which is defined as the maximum horizontal velocity at the seaward edge of the canopy top kobayashi et al 1993 mendez et al 1999 koftis et al 2013 maza et al 2013 anderson and smith 2014 ozeren et al 2014 wu and cox 2015 mattis et al 2019 for physical experiments with the smaller submergence ratio hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 assumed the velocity measured at mid water depth as the depth average velocity and regarded the space averaged maximum horizontal velocity as the characteristic velocity a similar characteristic velocity to calculate re and kc numbers was employed in this study in which the spatially averaged maximum u termed as u max was obtained by averaging the maximum u from four locations x 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 6 m and 0 8 m to replace u m in re and kc calculations and a similar usage concerning the maximum horizontal velocity has also been adopted in henry et al 2015 for wave flows 4 4 2 velocity profiles inside the canopy fig 10 shows the vertical profiles of peak horizontal velocities u max and u min in the positive and negative directions in a wave period respectively along the water depth at x 0 5 m location the scenarios with h i 0 08 m t 1 2 s under pure wave and wave current conditions u c 0 2 m s are tested to explore the effects of vegetation on the velocity profiles inside the vegetation canopy it was found that the velocities variation along the water depth is generally relatively small for all scenarios except near the flume bottom wall fig 10 a shows that both the magnitudes of u max and u min decrease significantly due to the presence of vegetation which reveals that the effect of the vegetation induced wave dissipation for wave current condition the values of u max and u min are always positive throughout the water depth as shown in fig 10 b and the u max values especially for the wave surface are reduced due to the presence of the canopy however the u min values increase below the wave surface compared with fig 10 b and c shows a contrary pattern for the wave current condition with the general negative values of u max and u min and this is due to the opposing current effect fig 10 b and c also illustrate that for wave current conditions the symmetrical distributions of the vertical profiles of u max and u min roughly occur and the straight line of u u c can be regarded as the corresponding symmetry axis furthermore the cross sectional average velocity u at the x 0 6 m location is obtained to discuss the effect of the various currents on the velocity pattern fig 11 shows the time varying u for h i 0 10 m and t 1 4 s under both pure wave conditions and wave current conditions the results show that for wave current conditions a larger u c can shift the u profiles further towards the positive direction i e the overall u values increase as u c increases and the expansion of u is roughly equal to the increase of u c based on eq 1 which is consistent with the conclusions reported by hu et al 2014 moreover when u c increases from 0 to 0 2 m s within the range of α 1 in which u w 0 216 m s for h i 0 10 m and t 1 4 s scenario here a slight phase difference occurs between the oscillating u profiles this may be explained by the doppler shift i e the effect of a steady current on intrinsic wave frequency wolf and prandle 1999 however a larger time lag ca 0 084 s occurs between u c 0 2 m s and u c 0 3 m s this is because that when u c is larger than u w i e α 1 the current flow velocity intends to be dominant comparing to the wave velocity consequently the wave inside the canopy exhibits nonlinear behavior the asymmetry of the wave profiles causes the asymmetry of u profiles and a certain degree of water transport occurs leading to this time lag as a result this confirms that the velocity ratio α plays a significant role in modifying u profiles in contrast the wave current conditions present an opposite trend to wave current conditions with u c magnitude increases from 0 to 0 2 m s within the range of α 1 the u profiles further shift towards the negative direction accompanied by a rather weak time lag due to the doppler shift as u c magnitude increases up to 0 3 m s α 1 the water transport in the negative direction causes a negative time lag on the other hand it is interesting to note that the u max magnitudes exists at the trough location under wave current conditions and the u max magnitudes increase evenly as u c magnitude increases from 0 to 0 2 m s however when u c magnitude increases from 0 2 to 0 3 m s the u max magnitude increases a little that is the u max magnitude for u c 0 3 m s is comparable to that for u c 0 2 m s in particular a small oscillating amplitude of the u profile appears for u c 0 3 m s which causes a very small wave height this reveals that the larger opposing current leads to a significant promotion in wdv and a predominant effect on wave propagation 4 4 3 force induced by canopy fig 12 shows the temporal variation of the total horizontal force f on a single cylinder at x 0 6 m location for h i 0 10 m and t 1 4 s with various u c according to eq 5 it can be expected that f varies periodically with the time varying u within one wave period as a result the influence of u c on f is consistent with the influence of u c on u as a result the f magnitudes with different u c according to that of u consistent with the trends reported in hu et al 2014 however compared fig 12 with fig 11 it can be observed that there is a certain time lag between f and u this is due to the presence of f m with an increase in the u c magnitude for wave current conditions a more asymmetric f occurs and f profile further shifts towards the positive direction resulting in total positive f values when u c 0 3 m s in contrast a relatively symmetric f profile with total negative values occurs for u c 0 3 m s in which the current flow velocity is dominant comparing to the wave velocity note that the maximum magnitude of horizontal force f max for u c 0 3 m s is comparable to that for u c 0 2 m s consistent with the u max magnitudes for u c 0 2 and 0 3 m s in fig 11 it needs to mention that the direction of f max is associated with the direction of the current flow this means that the f max direction is positive under following current condition and the f max direction is negative under opposing current condition fig 13 shows the effect of the incident wave height h i on the maximum magnitude of horizontal force f max evolution along the canopy for t 1 4 s and u c 0 2 m s the results show that a larger h i leads to a larger f max along the canopy under wave current conditions for wave current conditions f max shows a similar trend for various h i i e a maximum f max occurs at the seaward edge of the canopy since the cylinder at this location the first cylinder is directly exposed to the combined wave and following current flows the superposition of wave velocity and following current velocity results in a particularly large f max this effect plays an important role in the survival of the vegetation directly exposed to waves located at the seaward region of the canopy maza et al 2015 note that f max decreases rapidly from x 0 to 0 2 m and then gradually decreases and eventually reaches stable until it reaches the leeward edge of the canopy similar to that observed for the testing prototype rhizophora mangrove forests reported by ismail et al 2012 this feature is due to that the alignment configuration generating clearly preference flow channels because of the uniform spacing between the cylinders and the cylinders except for the first ones are not directly exposed to wave induced flow the downstream cylinders are sheltered by the upstream ones as a result the values of f max vary little along the canopy moreover note that a larger h i causes f max to drop faster in the range of x 0 to 0 2 m in contrast the wave current conditions exhibit a different pattern it needs to mention that the direction of f max keeps negative when u c 0 2 m s compared with fig 13 a it is found that there is no particularly large f max at the seaward edge of the canopy in fig 13 b this is because that the water particle velocity is suppressed by the superposition of wave velocity and opposing current velocity resulting in a relatively smaller f max besides f max shows a slightly decreasing pattern along the canopy due to the sheltering effect induced by the upstream cylinders the most significant difference is that a maximum f max magnitude occurs at the leeward side of the canopy because the cylinder at this location the last cylinder is directly exposed to the opposing current flows taking the propagation direction of opposing current as a reference the cylinder located at x 0 8 m are sheltered by the cylinder at x 1 0 m the local velocity at x 0 8 m is reduced as a result leading to maximum f max at the leeward side of the canopy fig 14 shows the effect of the wave period t on the maximum horizontal force f max evolution along the canopy for h i 0 1 m and u c 0 2 m s it is found that all curves are roughly close to each other for various t especially for wave current conditions indicating that f max is not sensitive to the variation of t under wave current conditions consistent with conclusions obtained from pure wave conditions in fig 3 the velocity field effected by the combined wave and current flows based on linear wave theory can explain this according to eq 1 as t increases from 1 2 to 1 8 s for a given h i the corresponding u max only increases from 0 405 to 0 428 m s with a slight amplification of 5 77 therefore based on eq 5 the f max variation is rather limited within the range of t from 1 2 to 1 8 s for a given h i fig 15 shows the effect of the current velocity u c on the maximum horizontal force f max evolution along the canopy for h i 0 1 m and t 1 4 s as mentioned in fig 12 the direction of f max is associated with the direction of the current flow the solid line for u c 0 m s in fig 15 a represents the f max in the negative direction under the pure wave condition and the dotted line for u c 0 m s in fig 15 b is the f max in the negative direction in general f max values for the following currents are higher than those for opposing currents to a great extent which is consistent with the tendency shown in fig 12 in addition it is found that the effect of u c on f max is similar to that of h i on f max as shown in fig 13 the largest difference exists for wave current conditions the f max magnitude increases with u c magnitude increases from 0 to 0 3 m s and the larger u c magnitude the greater the increase of f max magnitude this effect relates to the survival of the vegetation directly exposed to opposing current flows at the leeward region of the canopy in addition since the f max magnitude for u c 0 2 m s is comparable to that for u c 0 3 m s as shown in fig 12 the difference of f max is large between u c 0 1 and u c 0 2 m s while it is smaller between u c 0 2 and u c 0 3 m s this is mainly due to the suppression of waves when the opposing current is stronger as explained in fig 11 4 4 4 drag coefficient quantification based on direct force measurement approach fig 16 shows the relationship between the space averaged period averaged drag coefficient c d and current velocity u c the scenarios with t 1 2 s are considered as examples to discuss the effect of h i in fig 16 a and the scenarios with h i 0 08 m are considered as examples to discuss the effect of t in fig 16 b respectively the results show that regardless of the type of conditions wave current or wave current c d decreases with increasing u c magnitude and the relationship between c d and u c is roughly symmetrical about u c 0 m s axis indicating that the u c magnitude plays a significant role in estimating c d while the u c direction has little influence on it in addition there are still some differences between fig 16 a and b fig 16 a shows that the scenarios with the largest h i have the smallest c d under pure wave conditions u c 0 m s however under wave current conditions especially for u c 0 1 0 2 m s a higher h i leads to a larger c d this is because that for given t and u c as h i increases both f and u will increase by an order of magnitude of 0 1 i e u 2 will increase by an order of 0 01 as a result based on eq 6 c d increases with the increase of h i for a given u c under wave current conditions in contrast fig 16 b shows a different pattern that is a larger t always leads to smaller c d values the reason for this is that for given h i and u c the f changes are insensitive as t increases from 1 2 to 1 8 s as shown in fig 14 while u increases slightly therefore a larger t leads to a smaller c d based on eq 6 in addition as u c magnitude increases the effects of h i and t on c d become weaker mainly due to that the current flows begin to be dominant over waves when current velocity is stronger to further quantify the influences of u c on c d the drag coefficient ratio r c d is defined as r c d c d cw c d pw where c d cw and c d pw represent the c d values under combined wave current and pure wave conditions respectively fig 17 shows the relationship between r c d and α under wave current conditions further it can be observed that r c d decreases gradually as α increases indicating that c d decreases with the increase of u c magnitude under the same wave parameters which is consistent with the tendency as shown in fig 16 in addition with increasing α in the α 2 0 region and r c d tends to be a stable value this can be explained by fig 16 that as u c increases the decreasing trend of c d tends to be gentle furthermore the fitted curves for wave current wave current and wave current conditions are also included in fig 17 and all correlation coefficients r2 are not smaller than 0 96 which shows that r c d have a very strong dependency on α it is interesting to note that when α is less than about 1 the r c d values for wave current scenarios blue dotted line are larger than those for wave current scenarios red dotted line this is because that the wave current scenarios have larger c d values than wave current scenarios when α is smaller for example the c d values for u c 0 1 m s in fig 16 a can confirm this well in contrast an opposite tendency appears when α is approximately larger than 1 the reason for this is that the c d values of wave current scenarios are larger than these of wave current scenarios 4 4 5 c d re and c d kc relations a large number of previous studies have reported that the drag coefficient c d has generally been expressed as functions of re and kc and the most common expressions are written as c d δ κ re γ and c d m kc n henry et al 2015 chen et al 2018 based on the forms of the empirical formula all space averaged period averaged c d c d values for pure wave wave current and wave current conditions are plotted against re and kc in fig 18 the results show that the r2 values of the c d re and c d kc relations for pure wave conditions are obviously higher than those for wave current conditions moreover the c d values for pure wave conditions are larger than those for wave current conditions and the fitted c d data for wave current conditions are higher than those for wave current conditions to some extent indicating that the current accompanying wave can significantly reduce c d values in comparison to the pure waves and the opposing current leads to a largest declining amplitude of c d under wave current conditions compared with the pure wave and wave current conditions this can be explained by the relationship between r c d and α as shown in fig 17 that is as α increases the r c d displays a greater reduction rate under wave current conditions consequently c d values under wave current conditions decrease at a faster rate in addition although the data points are scattered to some extent it is clear that c d decreases generally with increasing both re and kc which is consistent with the conclusions in the literature mendez and losada 2004 augustin et al 2009 ozeren et al 2014 henry et al 2015 chen et al 2018 following the same structure of the formula forms above both c d re and c d kc relations were fitted by using all data of pure wave and wave current scenarios as follows 7 c d 0 31 6718 re with r 2 0 66 2000 re 10000 8 c d 12 89 kc 0 70 with r 2 0 58 6 kc 44 fig 19 shows that the typical decreasing pattern of fitting c d still holds with the increasing re or kc number under both pure wave and wave current conditions note that the re and kc numbers for wave current scenarios are larger than those for pure wave scenarios this is because for wave current scenarios the characteristic velocity u max values are superimposed by the current u c in the calculations of re and kc numbers consequently the higher re and kc numbers lead to lower c d values in the wave current scenarios to compare with the new proposed c d re and c d kc empirical formulas eqs 7 and 8 the existing drag coefficient formulas from the literature hu et al 2014 chen et al 2018 for wave current flows are included in fig 19 it should be mentioned that the two of them share the same set of experimental data note that the range of re of this study 2000 re 10000 is wider than that of hu et al 2014 300 re 4700 while the range of kc of this study 6 kc 44 is narrower than that of chen et al 2018 4 kc 115 the different diameters of the test vegetation mimics and different wave as well as current flow conditions used in the two experiments could account for these discrepancies in re and kc although they all share a similar trend i e with increasing re or kc c d gradually decreases and approaches asymptotic values the c d kc relation in this study shows a better consistency with chen et al 2018 especially for the wave current scenarios in addition the c d values for pure wave conditions in this study are more scatter and larger than those of hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 this may be explained by the fact that tests by hu et al 2014 include several submerged scenarios that leads to a lower wdv and a smaller c d as a result as a summary fig 19 demonstrates that whether the drag coefficient is c d or bulk c d vegetation is rigid or flexible wave is regular or irregular all relations have an overall similar trend which reveals the intrinsic law between the drag coefficient and re or kc number however the correlation coefficients of the new proposed empirical formulas eqs 7 and 8 are not satisfactory enough and the r2 values are as small as 0 66 and 0 58 for c d re and c d kc relations respectively for the sake of intuition fig 20 a shows the comparison of the numerical c d and the predicted c d values calculated by eqs 7 and 8 the y x lines are plotted for reference in the figures to represent the perfect agreement between them obviously the three clusters of scatter c d data are observed to correspond to pure wave wave current and wave current scenarios as expected respectively and the data points scatter sparsely there is no doubt that this is due to the current effects thus the current effect should be considered to describe the c d re and c d kc relations as mentioned in fig 17 r c d have a very strong dependency on the velocity ratio α the better relations between c d and re or kc by considering α are fitted as follows 9 c d 2 02 3000 re 0 7 exp 1 47 α 0 3 with r 2 0 76 10 c d 5 80 k c 0 27 0 7 exp 1 47 α 0 3 with r 2 0 94 fig 20 b presents the comparisons of predicted c d based on eqs 9 and 10 with the numerical c d the modified relationships have less scatter and a large proportion of the relative deviations are smaller than 20 note that the r2 values increase from 0 66 to 0 76 for c d re relations and from 0 58 to 0 94 for c d kc relations respectively consequently by considering the combined effects of the wave and current the newer c d kc empirical formulas can obtain better satisfactory predictions for wave attenuation by emergent rigid vegetation under the combined wave and current conditions indeed a practical and commonly used method to obtain c d is by calibrating wdv models eq 3 against measured wave height decay i e the calibration approach mentioned in introduction section the corresponding c d re and c d kc relations are more practical to predict c d in practical application since the re and kc numbers are usually defined by using u m as the characteristic velocity which can be measured in front of the canopy or approximated from the incident wave properties based on the linear wave theory kobayashi et al 1993 mendez et al 1999 koftis et al 2013 ozeren et al 2014 however this characteristic velocity is not representative of the hydrodynamic conditions inside a canopy as it is apparent that wave height decreases along vegetation canopy and wave velocity decreases accordingly especially when the wdv is high hu et al 2014 in contrast the direct force measurement approach in this study adopted the numerical in phase force and velocity data to obtain c d and the related re and kc numbers were calculated by using the measured in canopy velocity i e spatially averaged maximum u u max as the characteristic velocity in fact u max directly interacts with canopy mimics which is more representative for the hydrodynamic conditions inside a canopy unfortunately with the current instrumentation the direct force measurement approach is only applicable in lab conditions as it requires synchronized force and velocity data with high accuracy which are not feasible to obtain in field condition for practical applications it needs to be emphasized that the direct force measurement approach enables us to obtain the c d under combined wave and current flows which is not possible with the calibration method to our knowledge the c d of mimic vegetation canopies under wave plus opposing current flows has not been assessed previously additionally by introducing the velocity ratio α to consider the combined effects of the wave and current new empirical relations between c d and re or kc were proposed as an extension of the results reported by hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 which are expected to be useful in understanding wdv and predicting it in numerical modeling studies under combined wave and current flows for example in detailed spectral wave models or phase resolving models re and kc within a canopy can be easily accessed hu et al 2014 and the value of c d can be a reasonable first estimate based on these empirical relations subsequently 5 conclusions to explore the effects of following and opposing currents on the wdv a series of physical experiments with respect to the interaction between rigid emergent cylinders and combined wave and current flows were conducted for pure wave conditions the vegetation performs a better wave dissipation under larger wave height and smaller wave period conditions for wave current conditions the following currents can either enhance or suppress wdv which depends on the velocity ratio α between the current velocity and the maximum horizontal wave orbital velocity for wave plus following current wdv is suppressed when α is small within the range of 0 37 1 54 when α is sufficiently high wdv can be strengthened because of interaction between wave and current however opposing currents can always enhance wdv these findings suggested that the flooding tide during storm events could be a critical scenario for coastal protection schemes that utilizes coastal wetlands to attenuate wave energy in addition to better understand the small scale mechanisms responsible for wdv a quasi 3 d numerical model with periodic boundary conditions based on rans model was developed to extend the physical experiments to provide the velocity profiles and force evolutions along the canopy in detail the results indicate that velocity magnitudes decrease significantly due to the presence of the vegetation and a larger following and opposing current that can shift the velocity profiles further towards the positive and negative direction respectively the horizontal force varies correspondingly with the time varying horizontal velocity when α is larger than 1 there will be a significant time lag between the velocity and force profiles of combined wave and current conditions and pure wave conditions the larger opposing current leads to a significant promotion in wdv and a predominant effect on wave propagation in addition the evolution patterns in terms of the maximum horizontal force f max along the canopy were explored with different incident wave heights h i wave periods t and current velocity u c in detail it was found that the larger h i and u c the larger f max however f max is not sensitive to the variation of t besides the maximum f max vales take place at the seaward and leeward edges of the canopy under wave current and wave current conditions respectively within the canopy f max present a slightly declining trend in the direction of wave propagation the direct force measurement approach was applied to quantify drag coefficients in both pure wave and combined wave and current flows finally as an extension to the c d re and c d kc relations for wave plus following current condition in hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 the newer generic empirical relations between drag coefficients and re kc numbers for combined wave and current flows were provided considering both the following and opposing current effects results of the present study shall be immensely helpful in estimating the drag coefficients under combined wave and current flow scenarios where the velocity data inside the canopy is known which will be useful in understanding the real wdv with respect to interaction among wave current and vegetation credit

21633,coastal vegetations play crucial ecosystem functions including coastal protection considerable attention has been focused on the effects of vegetation and wave conditions on wave dissipation induced by vegetation wdv whereas the effects of tidal current are often ignored a series of physical experiments were performed to explore the effects of following current direction in the same direction as waves and opposing currents on wdv inside the rigid emergent vegetation canopy the experimental results indicate that following currents can either enhance or suppress wdv depending on the ratio between the current velocity magnitude and the maximum horizontal wave orbital velocity while opposing currents may enhance wdv more in addition to better understand small scale mechanisms responsible for wdv a quasi three dimensional 3 d numerical model using periodic boundary conditions was employed to extend the physical experiments to provide velocity profiles and force evolutions along the canopy a direct force measurement approach was applied to quantify drag coefficients under both pure wave and combined wave and current conditions finally considering the coupling effect of wave and current generic relations between drag coefficients and re kc were provided with relatively high correlation which are useful for future studies with respect to interaction among wave current and vegetation keywords rigid vegetation wave plus current wave dissipation direct force measurement approach drag coefficient 1 introduction with increasing storminess in recent years coastal vegetation systems such as salt marshes e g anderson and smith 2014 seagrasses e g luhar et al 2017 and mangroves e g maza et al 2019 have been found to significantly attenuate wave energy and reduce coastline erosion caused by seawater thereby providing effective protection to coastal habitats which is expected to be of great importance in the future in particular the mangrove system effectively attenuated wave energy from a 2004 indian ocean tsunami saving several villages huang et al 2011 and the main trunk and prop roots under tidal hydrodynamic loadings within mangrove systems can be regarded as fairly rigid on account of a large young s modulus of around 15 gpa maza et al 2019 zhang et al 2015 therefore mangrove systems were usually simplified to rigid cylinders to conduct research by ignoring their complex root systems huang et al 2011 maza et al 2015 ozeren et al 2014 tanino and nepf 2008 yao et al 2018 based on this simplification the rigid emergent array cylinders were employed to explore the interaction between mangroves and waves in this study to date considerable research has focused on wave energy dissipation induced by vegetation wdv under pure current conditions fonseca and cahalan 1992 bouma et al 2005 or pure wave conditions kobayashi et al 1993 mendez et al 1999 maza et al 2013 separately factors affecting wdv include vegetation characteristics i e stem diameter density stiffness pattern and distribution pattern and wave characteristics such as regular or irregular incident wave height and wave period möller 2006 bradley and houser 2009 yang et al 2012 jadhav et al 2013 koftis et al 2013 in fact coastal vegetation is usually affected by tidal currents or wave induced currents that flow in conjunction with wind or swell waves hu et al 2014 losada et al 2016 however the possible effects of co existing currents on wdv are yet to be fully understood because of its complexity which is of great importance to understand the hydrodynamic sedimentation and exchange processes in a coastal vegetation system to the best of our knowledge a limited number of previous studies on wdv with respect to following currents current direction in the same direction as wave propagation hu et al 2014 li and yan 2007 paul et al 2012 were conducted and inconsistent conclusions were drawn about whether the currents increase or decrease wdv li and yan 2007 found that following currents always increase wdv by contrast paul et al 2012 pointed out that following currents can significantly reduce the wave damping capacity of the tested vegetation model this inconsistency was explained partially by hu et al 2014 by investigating the effect of the velocity ratio α defined as the ratio between the imposed following current velocity u c magnitude and the maximum horizontal wave orbital velocity u w hu et al 2014 pointed out that the tested α was in the range of 1 5 and 3 5 in li and yan 2007 while it was less than 0 5 in paul et al 2012 thus a series of systematic tests over a wide range of α were carried by hu et al 2014 which showed that the effects of the following currents on wdv depend on α instead of the u c magnitude alone and the range of α based on whether following currents enhance or suppress wdv was provided it is important to note that the abovementioned studies only analyzed the effects of the following currents on wdv and the opposing current propagating in the opposing direction of waves effect was not taken into account recently losada et al 2016 conducted a laboratory test with respect to real flexible vegetation interaction with both following and opposing currents and they found that the following currents tend to reduce wdv within a limited α range of 0 5 1 4 while the opposing currents increase wdv however with respect to rigid vegetation the effects of opposing currents on wdv are not well understood within a wider α range it is well accepted that wdv is mainly caused by the work done by the drag force f d acting on the vegetation a bulk drag coefficient c d was introduced to account for uncertainties in f d induced by the vegetation dalrymple et al 1984 mendez and losada 2004 suzuki et al 2012 determining c d values is crucial for the accurate prediction of wdv however the c d parameterization for a natural vegetation canopy is still challenging since it may be affected by a number of factors typically c d is determined by means of physical experiments either by using a calibration or direct force measurement approach hu et al 2014 as a conventional method the calibration approach determines c d by calibrating its value using wdv models to fit the wave height attenuation along the canopy mendez et al 1999 augustin et al 2009 nevertheless this calibration approach cannot be applied in studying the interaction between vegetation and combined wave and current flows because the influence of co existing current on wdv is not considered in previous wdv models dalrymple et al 1984 recently this limitation has been relaxed by losada et al 2016 who proposed a new analytical model based on energy conservation to study the wave damping induced by flexible vegetation under combined waves and current conditions note that the calibration approach assumes that the measured wave energy dissipation is entirely caused by vegetation drag other dissipative processes such as wave breaking turbulence and surface friction of vegetation and tank walls have not been explicitly considered but concentrated in the vegetation drag which may cause c d to be overestimated hu et al 2014 chen et al 2018 compared to the calibration approach the direct force measurement approach hu et al 2014 is a newer approach that based on the original morison equation rather than wdv models and it requires synchronized impact velocity and force data to derive c d by quantifying the work done by f d in a wave period since the morison equation is available in both pure wave and combined wave and current flows this approach can be adopted to derive c d under both flow conditions once the c d value was determined using the calibration or direct force measurement approach as mentioned previously its intrinsic relationship was examined for pure wave conditions with a series of dimensionless parameters such as the reynolds number re and the keulegan carpenter number kc mendez and losada 2004 nepf 2011 jadhav et al 2013 henry et al 2015 note that when flow conditions are converted from pure waves to combined waves and current flows the c d values are expected to vary accordingly however the effects of the tidal current have not been fully considered in the description of c d relations it is only until recently that new relationships in terms of c d re and c d kc are extended to combined wave and following current conditions in hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 respectively however the c d characteristics under combined wave and opposing current conditions have not yet been clarified therefore the main objective of this paper aims at a comprehensive analysis in terms of the effect mechanism of following and opposing currents on wdv compared to interaction with rigid emergent vegetation under pure wave conditions therefore as a first step a series of flume experiments with rigid array emergent cylinders were conducted to explore the effects of following and opposing currents on wdv with a wide range of the velocity ratio α experimental results are analyzed and discussed in terms of wave and current parameters such as incident wave height wave period current velocity and current direction subsequently based on flow 3d 10 0 software a quasi three dimensional 3 d cfd numerical model using periodic boundary conditions was conducted to extend the physical experiments to better understand the flow structures inside the vegetation canopy velocity profiles and forces exerted on individual cylinders were provided in detail the direct force measurement approach was applied to quantify drag coefficients under both pure wave and combined wave and current flows finally the generic relations between drag coefficients and re kc for the combined wave and current flows were provided considering the current effect the manuscript is organized as follows the experimental setup and tests are described in section 2 and section 3 is devoted to presenting and discussing the wave attenuation results obtained for different physical tests section 4 shows the numerical simulations including the model description and validation numerical results and discussion finally the conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 experimental setup to investigate the wave attenuation by rigid emergent vegetation under combined wave and current conditions a series of physical experiments were performed in a wave flume of the hydraulic lab at ocean university of china the wave flume is 30 0 m long 1 0 m wide and 1 2 m deep schematized in fig 1 a a digital piston type wave generator is placed on the left side of the flume to generate the desired regular wave trains on the opposite end of the flume a 5 m long wave absorber made of porous material is used to minimize unwanted reflected waves a circular pipe system was used to generate the current flow in the flume rather than using the upstream and downstream water tanks and it consists of a water tank a water pipe a pump and a valve under the wave flume as well as the flow entrance and exit the desired following and opposing currents can be achieved by adjusting the flow entrance and exit it should be mentioned that although the current flow varies rapidly in the vicinity of flow entrance and exit a relatively uniform and steady current flow field can be developed within the working area far from the flow entrance and exit without the wave and vegetation effect this steady current flow field has been well generated in yin et al 2019 for studying the interaction between pneumatic breakwater with combined wave and current actions and many studies e g hu et al 2014 lou et al 2018 have also successfully used such a current generation technique to explore the interaction between vegetation and combined wave and current flows during the experiments in this study the waves started to be generated after the relatively steady current was achieved within the working area the mimic vegetation model was designed considering a mature mangrove rhizophora forest with a main trunk diameter equal to 0 20 m alongi 2008 the capabilities of the experimental facilities and the required wave parameters were taken into account and a geometric similarity scale of 1 10 was used for the experiments to reproduce the processes arising in the prototype the mimic vegetation model was built by fixing polyvinyl chloride pvc cylinders in holes drilled in the pvc plate bottom fig 1 b it should be noted that the pvc cylinder had a density of 1 40 103 kg m3 and a young s modulus of 3 14 3 92 gpa although the pvc cylinder had a different modulus of elasticity compared with the live mangrove tree 15gpa reported in zhang et al 2015 this pvc material was chosen to be rigid enough to avoid deformations under wave action in the lab maza et al 2019 yao et al 2018 the height of the cylinders was 0 70 m and their diameter was 0 02 m the vegetation model was 1 0 m 1 0 m length width and the pvc cylinders were distributed uniformly with a space of 0 05 m following a tandem pattern with a density of 399 cylinders m2 fig 1 c the beginning of the vegetation model is set as the origin in fig 1 a which is located at 14 5 m from the wave generator froude similarity was considered when determining the hydrodynamic wave conditions following real wave conditions reported in mangrove environments by previous studies e g bao 2011 brinkman 2006 a range of wave heights and periods were chosen in the following experiments before the start of each experiment the flume was filled with fresh tap water for a still water depth h of 0 40 m the wave generator generated regular waves with periods t ranging from 1 0 to 1 8 s 3 16 5 69 s at the prototype scale with an interval of 0 2 s and wave heights h i ranging from 0 06 to 0 12 m 0 6 1 2 m at the prototype scale with an interval of 0 02 m the following and opposing current velocities u c vary from 0 3 to 0 3 m s 0 95 to 0 95 m s at the prototype scale with an interval of 0 1 m s the negative sign denotes that the current direction is opposite to the wave propagation direction similar to the current flow conditions performed in the physical experiments concerning open channel flow interaction with mangrove model by zhang et al 2015 and maza et al 2017 a scenario summary for the physical experiments and numerical simulations is presented in table 1 note that control runs without vegetation were also performed for the same wave parameters as used with vegetation theses control runs allow analyzing the wave reflection and friction produced by the flume bottom and sidewalls and all runs were completed three times to ensure they were repeatable and accurate representations of the conditions being tested furthermore the feasibility of wave parameters was first checked by the geometric and mechanical properties of the vegetation model based on the vegetation parameter reported in noarayanan et al 2012 the natural frequency of the pvc cylinder was estimated to be around 7 35 s 1 which was not the same order of magnitude with the test wave periods 0 56 1 0 s 1 therefore no resonance phenomenon will occur when the wave passes through the vegetation model and in fact this phenomenon was also observed during the experiments the imposed current velocity was measured and calibrated by a down looking acoustic doppler velocimeter adv with a sampling frequency of 30 hz installed at half of the still water depth and 3 0 m away from the seaward edge of the vegetation model as suggested by hu et al 2014 this measured horizontal velocity at mid water depth roughly equals to the depth average velocity inside the vegetation canopy i e the acting velocity on vegetation chen et al 2018 yao et al 2018 in addition eight capacitance type wave gauges referred to as wg1 to wg8 were installed along the flume to measure the time histories of the free surface elevations at a sampling rate of 50 hz to evaluate the wave height attenuation static calibration of the wave gauges was performed before each test to ensure their accuracy within 0 1 mm to study the vegetation induced wave attenuation wg3 to wg7 wave gauges were installed inside the canopy zone with the adjacent distance of 0 25 m starting at the seaward edge of the vegetation model note that wg1 and wg2 wave gauges are installed in front of the vegetation model to separate the incident and reflected waves and wg8 installed 0 5 m away from leeward edge of the vegetation model was used to measure the transmission wave height it needs to mention that the distance between wg1 and wg2 was adjusted according to the incident wavelength for each test to quantify the influences of the reflected waves from the flume a wave reflection analysis was performed based on the two probe method goda and suzuki 1976 during the control tests without the vegetation effect using energy consideration and the fast fourier transform technique the incident and reflected wave heights h i and h r respectively are estimated from the composite wave heights measured at wg1 and wg2 wave gauges and the reflection coefficients k r were calculated based on k r h r h i as a result such a coefficient fell within the range 0 10 0 15 for all test wave conditions in this study this indicated that despite the presence of a wave absorber at the end of the flume the impact from wave reflection cannot be neglected hence to eliminate the influence of wave reflection on wdv only the time window unaffected by reflected waves was used in the data analysis this was defined as the period between full wave development and the return of the first reflected wave to wg7 waves were considered to be fully developed when the water surface elevation reached 95 of the incident wave amplitude and at least five small waves had passed based on linear wave theory the return time was estimated within the range of about 19 24 s for the test wave periods t 1 0 1 8 s therefore regular waves were generated for 30 s during each experiment to ensure that enough fully developed waves were be entirely unaffected by reflection from the flume end and were used to analyze wdv inside the canopy each experiment was repeated three times and the differences in wave height among them were generally less than 3 the final experimental data in this study are based on the mean values of the three runs 3 experimental results and discussion 3 1 velocity and wave height data analysis considering the doppler effect the horizontal flow velocity under combined wave and current conditions chen et al 2018 based on linear wave theory is given by 1 u u c g h k 2 σ cw cosh k z h cosh k h cos k x σ t where u is combined horizontal flow velocity under combined wave and current conditions u c is the imposed unidirectional current velocity g is the gravitational acceleration σ cw is the angular frequency associated with combined waves and currents σ cw σ u c k σ is the angular frequency under pure wave conditions k is the wave number the subscript cw indicates the case of combined waves and currents therefore in order to quantitatively compare the relative magnitudes of current flow velocity and wave velocity to determine which effect is predominant as suggested by hu et al 2014 the velocity ratio was defined as α u c u w in which u w is the maximum wave orbital velocity which was depth averaged based on linear wave theory in this study 2 u w 1 h h 0 g h k 2 σ cw cosh k z h cosh k h d z it is well known that wave attenuation along the canopy can be evaluated by a wdv model eq 3 derived from the conservation of energy equation dalrymple et al 1984 the energy loss of waves propagating through vegetation attributed to the work done acting on the vegetation 3 k v h h 0 1 1 β x where k v is the damping coefficient h is the wave height within the canopy and h 0 is the initial wave height at the seaward edge of the canopy x is the longitudinal distance along the canopy β is the damping factor that can be obtained by fitting eq 3 when the spatial wave height data within the canopy are available to exclude the possible influence of flume bottom and sidewall friction on wdv augustin et al 2009 hu et al 2014 ozeren et al 2014 the wave height reduction was measured within the region of x 0 1 0 m during the control tests without considering the vegetation effect the results showed that the damping factor β was generally less than 0 004 for all control tests mainly because that the test canopy zone is quite short only 1 0 m long as a result the influence of flume bottom and sidewall friction on wdv was negligible without causing major deviations in this study note that the wave decay model eq 3 has also been successfully adopted in numerous previous studies e g mendez and losada 2004 anderson and smith 2014 ozeren et al 2014 hu et al 2014 wu and cox 2015 chen et al 2018 mattis et al 2019 to calibrate k v by fitting experimental data under pure wave conditions the same wave decay function was also available for combined wave and current conditions hu et al 2014 losada et al 2016 chen et al 2018 eq 3 shows that the damping factor β is of significance to describe the wave height attenuation characteristics inside the canopy indicating that a larger β illustrates a better wdv performance induced by vegetation hereafter the subscript pw denotes pure wave conditions i e β pw represents the damping factor under the pure wave condition and β cw corresponds to the combined wave and current condition in this section the effects of several factors e g incident wave height h i wave period t and current velocity u c on the wdv under both the pure wave and combined wave and current conditions were discussed in detail based on experimental results 3 2 wdv under pure wave conditions fig 2 shows the effect of incident wave height on the wave dissipation by vegetation under pure wave conditions for t 1 2 s and 1 6 s the beginning of the vegetation zone is set as the origin as shown in fig 1 a the curves fitted to the relative wave heights based on eq 3 using a nonlinear least squares method are also included in the figures it is found that the k v data for t 1 6 s obeys the wave decay formulation based on eq 3 more than that for t 1 2 s however all fitted curves share a similar wave attenuation pattern for various wave heights the attenuation rate of k v increases with an increase in h i a larger h i results in higher β pw values as expected which indicates that vegetation exhibits better wave dissipation under larger h i conditions the effect of wave period on wdv is presented in fig 3 two different wave heights h i 0 06 m and 0 10 m are considered as examples here it is found that the k v data for h i 0 10 m obeys the wave decay formulation based on eq 3 more than it does for h i 0 06 m overall they show a similar wave attenuation decay for various t where the damping factor β pw decreases with increasing t i e the vegetation performs a better wave dissipation under smaller t conditions note that β pw varies a little as t increases to 1 6 s or 1 8 s indicating that the wave attenuation characteristics of vegetation are no longer sensitive to the variation of the wave period for relatively larger t conditions 3 3 wdv under combined wave and current conditions fig 4 shows the effects of the current velocity u c on the vegetation induced wave attenuation under wave current and wave current conditions the expression wave current means that the imposed current is in the same direction as the wave propagation direction and wave current indicates that the current direction is opposite to the wave direction the wave conditions with h i 0 1 m t 1 2 s and t 1 8 s are considered as examples the effect of currents on wdv can be identified by comparing k v with various imposed current velocities u c for wave current conditions with a smaller period t 1 2 s the β cw values are always larger than the β pw values for the pure wave condition and β cw increases with an increasing u c in contrast for t 1 8 s the β cw value 0 38 of u c 0 1 m s is smaller than β pw value 0 407 u c 0 m s and the β cw values further increase when u c rises from 0 2 m s to 0 3 m s this suggests that the presence of the following currents do not always promote wdv and a smaller following current may suppress wdv to some extent which is consistent with the results reported by hu et al 2014 and paul et al 2012 for rigid canopy and seagrasses respectively this confirms that the effect of the following currents on wdv can be either promoting or suppressing depending on the velocity ratio α as will be discussed in fig 5 in detail for wave current conditions the results for t 1 2 s and 1 8 s show the same general trend although some differences are observed the β cw values are always larger than β pw values which indicates that the opposing current can generally promote wave attenuation in addition as the magnitude of u c increases from 0 m s to 0 3 m s the β cw values gradually increase from 0 801 to 2 633 and 0 514 to 1 436 for t 1 2 s and 1 8 s respectively and this leads to a higher wdv compared to fig 4 a with fig 4 b when the magnitude of the following currents is equal to that of opposing currents the β cw values of opposing currents are much larger than those of the following ones which indicates that the opposing currents are more effective for wdv than following currents to some extent moreover this effect is more significant for smaller t scenarios which is similar to the effects of the wave period on wdv under pure wave conditions shown in fig 3 it can thus be concluded that the presence of currents either following or opposing waves modifies the resulting damping for pure wave to further evaluate the effects of the current flow on wdv the ratio of wave damping factor β between the pure wave and combined wave and current conditions is defined as r β β cw β pw thus if r β 1 it means that the wdv is strengthened with the presence of currents if r β 1 wdv is weakened because of the current effect fig 5 shows the relationship between the r β and the velocity ratio α it can be seen that as α increases the r β values for both wave current and wave current conditions follow the exponential growth trend and the growth rate for wave current conditions is much greater than wave current conditions the point where the growth trend is separated appears around α 1 in particular when α 2 43 r β increases to 44 for wave current conditions while r β is only 4 5 for wave current conditions which confirms that the opposing current is more beneficial to wdv also for both wave current and wave current conditions r β shows a general increasing trend with an increase in the u c magnitude 0 1 to 0 3 m s the above is consistent with the results as shown in fig 4 on the other hand note that the r2 value of the fitting curve for the wave current conditions is 0 90 which shows a better correlation than that for the wave current ones r2 0 67 indicating that r β has a stronger dependency on the velocity ratio α for the wave current conditions note that the line r β 1 is plotted in the figure as a reference to discuss the effects of the current on wdv the data in the α 0 3 2 0 range is partially enlarged as an inset illustration shown in fig 5 it is interesting to be observed that for wave current conditions in the range of α 0 37 to 1 54 the r β values of a few data points are less than 1 corresponding to the smaller u c scenarios 0 1 m s 0 2 m s this implies that within this range of α the presence of the following currents may decrease the wdv in contrast the r β values of other data are larger than 1 especially for larger u c scenarios 0 3 m s and this indicates that the presence of larger following currents can increases the wdv therefore the following currents can either enhance or suppress wdv depending on α which is consistent with the conclusions reported by hu et al 2014 who concluded that for smaller values of α 0 65 α 1 25 depending on the test following currents may suppress wdv in contrast a different pattern occurs for wave current conditions it can be seen that all r β values are greater than 1 indicating that opposing currents will always enhance wdv however when α is smaller i e u c 0 1 m s the contribution of opposing currents to wdv is rather limited to some extent as a summary the opposing currents always play a supportive role in enhancing wdv while the following currents may enhance or suppress within α of 0 37 to 1 54 on the other hand the opposing currents exhibit better performance than the following currents for enhancing wdv when α is larger i e the effect of current velocity is dominant 4 numerical simulations the experimental results have allowed the analysis of the effects of different variables on wdv in terms of rigid emergent vegetation under combined wave and current conditions further information about the velocity profiles and force evolutions along the canopy is gained by complementing physical experiments with a set of numerical simulations to provide high spatial resolution information and time series of variables not measured in the physical model numerical tests are conducted considering identical experimental conditions to reproduce the wave attenuation processes induced by vegetation 4 1 numerical model description the mathematical models based on the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans approximation provide a reasonable way to study hydrodynamic behavior for engineering purposes because of the satisfying computation costs and simple assumptions garcia et al 2004 as a simple turbulent model no major adjustments to constants or functions are required the re normalisation group rng k ε model can successfully predict complex flow phenomena yakhot et al 1992 as a consequence in this study the rans equations coupled with the rng k ε model were used to simulate wave and current motions as well as turbulence the volume of fluid vof technique was adopted to track water surface hirt and nichols 1981 the aforementioned models were executed using flow 3d 10 0 software the boundary conditions of the computational domain were defined as follows the velocity inlet boundary was used at the wave generation boundary to achieve the desired regular wave and current flows the sponge layer damping method was applied at the outflow boundary to minimize the wave reflection where the vertical velocities were gradually and artificially reduced by multiplying an absorption function in the sponge layer region zhang et al 2014 to improve computing efficiency the periodic boundary conditions were considered at the side boundaries of the numerical flume which can eliminate the undesired effects of wall boundaries effectively at the top side of the flume the pressure was specified as atmospheric pressure the no slip wall boundaries were applied both on the flume bottom and the cylinder surfaces the turbulence properties were estimated from law of the wall boundary condition finite difference approximations were employed to discretize governing equations the first order upwind scheme was adopted to solve the continuity and momentum equations the pressure solution was calculated iteratively by the generalized minimum residual method gmres saad and schultz 1986 a default pressure solver in flow 3d 10 0 software due to its higher degree of accuracy and convergence characteristics to obtain accurate simulation results with computational stability the initial time step was chosen as small as 0 01 s and it can be adjusted automatically at each iteration to satisfy the convective limits and diffusion conditions 4 2 mesh sensitivity analysis as mentioned before the periodic boundary conditions were considered at the side boundaries of the numerical flume so that a small computational domain can represent an infinite computing domain the required cell number was reduced to significantly improve the computing efficiency as a result only three rows of cylinders were considered in the computational domain to reproduce the configuration in the physical experiment the numerical domain 25 0 m long 0 15 m wide and 0 70 m deep was partitioned using structural meshes by flow 3d 10 0 software it is well known that mesh size plays a significant role in the computational cost and accuracy and its determination deserves a mesh sensitivity analysis with regard to the computational domain near the wave surface and cylinder zone they were refined to better catch the wave surface as well as to obtain the wave force on cylinders with higher accuracy to reach a balance between the computational cost and result accuracy a mesh sensitivity analysis with respect to the cylinder zone was conducted using three meshes mesh 1 to mesh 3 mesh 1 corresponds to a coarser mesh with a uniform mesh δx 0 01 m δy 0 01 m δz 0 01 m in x y z direction respectively and the mesh resolutions of mesh 2 and mesh 3 are δx 0 005 m δy 0 005 m δz 0 01 m and δx 0 005 m δy 0 005 m δz 0 005 m respectively fig 6 shows the computational wave elevation histories at wg6 location using mesh 1 mesh 2 and mesh 3 under the pure wave condition h i 0 10 m t 1 4 s without vegetation it was found that all the relative deviations were less than 12 for mesh 1 and mesh 2 and 5 8 for mesh 2 and mesh 3 respectively this indicates that mesh 2 shows a good agreement with mesh 3 and it can be considered that the mesh size of mesh 2 is relatively independent of the computational results as a result mesh 2 was chosen for the following computation after considering the balance between the numerical accuracy and computational speed 4 3 numerical model validation 4 3 1 wave surface elevations to validate the mathematical model a comparison of simulated and experimental wave surface elevations η are presented with without vegetation under the combined wave and current conditions in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively fig 7 shows a comparison of the simulated and experimental η at the wg6 location for the h i 0 1 m t 1 4 s and u c 0 2 m s scenarios without vegetation the wave pattern induced by the combined wave and current interaction obviously differs from that of the pure wave condition as shown in fig 6 after interacting with the following current fig 7 a the wavelength increases because of the doppler shift the effect of currents on intrinsic wave frequency wolf and prandle 1999 besides the wave height becomes smaller because of the wave action conservation when waves travel with following currents consequently the wave steepness decreases due to the longer wavelength and smaller wave height which is in line with the conclusion reported by umeyama 2010 and zhang et al 2014 in general fig 7 a shows that there is a good agreement between numerical results and experimental data although a small time lag around 0 13 s between them exists at the first wave peak location this discrepancy may due to the fact that the first experimental wave has not yet been fully developed resulting in a greater asymmetry in contrast the opposing current shows a different pattern in fig 7 b that the wave height increases are induced by the opposing current which leads to an increasing wave steepness in general the numerical results agreed well with the experimental data and the maximum deviations between them were less than 5 3 which indicates that the present numerical model is able to simulate the combined wave and current behavior with acceptable accuracy the numerical model was further validated by considering the vegetation effect for wave current scenario fig 8 shows a comparison of the simulated and experimental η at the wg6 location for h i 0 08 m t 1 2 s and u c 0 2 m s in general the numerical wave profile agrees well with the experimental data it can be observed that due to the influence of vegetation the waves present a certain nonlinear effect and the significant discrepancy occurs at the wave peak however the maximum deviations between the numerical and experimental data were less than 12 overall the present numerical model is able to simulate the wave height evolution when combined wave and current flows pass through the vegetation with satisfactory accuracy 4 3 2 velocity field and force exerted on cylinders laboratory tests performed by hu et al 2014 were used to test the present numerical model as they measured velocity and acting force data simultaneously within the canopy under wave current conditions the experiment in hu et al 2014 was conducted in a wave flume with a mimicked vegetation canopy 6 m long by 0 8 m wide placed in the middle of the wave flume see fig 1 in hu et al 2014 the vegetation mimics were modeled using stiff wooden cylinders with a diameter of 0 01 m and a height of 0 36 m the built vegetation canopy was constructed with a uniform staggered configuration and three cylinder densities n 62 139 and 556 stems m2 the tested water depths h were set as 0 25 m and 0 50 m respectively resulting into two relatively small submergence ratio h h v 1 and 1 39 h v is the height of cylinder submerged in water body chen et al 2018 the impact force f data on 4 individual cylinders and the in phase horizontal velocity u data within the mimic canopies were measured by 4 force transducers and 4 emfs electromagnetic flow manufacture meters respectively a series of regular waves with steady following current conditions were performed refer to hu et al 2014 for details among these test conditions the submerged canopy n 556 stems m2 and the wave case wave1216 h i 0 12 m and t 1 6 s with following current u c 0 05 and 0 15 m s were selected as the test parameters used for validation with the present numerical model in this simulation the periodic boundary conditions were also considered at the side boundaries of the numerical flume to reproduce the vegetation configuration in the physical experiment the computational domain was defined as 10 0 0 06 0 70 m in the x y and z directions respectively a mesh sensitivity analysis was carried out first two sets of mesh resolution were used δx δy δz 0 005 m and 0 0025 m and no virtual differences were found between the simulated results using these two meshes thus the mesh with δx δy δz 0 005 m with a total of 2 373 000 cells was used in numerical simulations after considering the computational accuracy and cost the time step was chosen as 0 01 s this mesh takes 13 h to run 10 s of actual time to model the wave propagation through the cylinder field by using a 10 processor pc fig 9 shows the comparisons between numerical and experimental data about the time varying velocity u and force f at x 4 5 m location the beginning of the vegetation model is set as the origin within the canopy in the numerical post processing forces exerted on the cylinders are obtained considering pressure and viscous components as 4 f 0 h η p μ e f f u x d a where p is the total pressure field μ eff is the effective kinematic viscosity which includes the laminar and the turbulent contribution to shear stresses and da the differential area along the cylinder it can be found from fig 9 a that u exhibits an oscillating trend within one wave period and a larger u c can shift the overall u further towards the positive direction in general there is a satisfactory agreement between the numerical results and experimental data for all scenarios in contrast fig 9 b shows that the magnitudes of f with different u c vary according to that of u it can be seen that a time lag between the numerical and experimental data exits around 0 12 s for u c 0 15 m s scenario which may lead to the largest discrepancies between the two near wave crest and wave trough i e the magnitudes of f are underestimated by about 11 near the wave crest and overestimated by about 18 near the wave trough both the intrinsic error of the physical tests and the numerical error in the numerical simulation may lead to this discrepancy however the overall varying trends for u c 0 15 m s scenario are well predicted based on this numerical model moreover a good agreement between the numerical results and experimental data for u c 0 and 0 05 m s scenarios was observed consequently both figs 8 and 9 show that the numerical model can well predict the wave surface elevations velocity and vegetation induced force information when waves interact with the vegetation under combined wave and current flows therefore based on this numerical model the velocity profiles and force evolutions within the canopy under combined wave and current conditions will be explored in more detail and the drag coefficient will be discussed using the direct force measurement approach based on the numerical velocity and force data 4 4 numerical results and discussion 4 4 1 direct force measurement approach under both pure wave and combined wave and current conditions the horizontal component of the wave induced total force on an individual cylinder can be expressed by morison equation morison et al 1950 5 f f d f m 1 2 ρ c d h v b v u u π 4 ρ c m h v b v 2 u t where f is the total horizontal force on an individual cylinder f d and f m are the drag force and inertia force respectively ρ 1000 kg m3 is the density of water b v is the diameter of cylinder and u is the horizontal cross sectional average flow velocity can be obtained by the numerical post processing utilities based on flow 3d 10 0 software in this study c d is the drag coefficient and c m is the inertia coefficient the contribution of f d is expected to exceed the contribution of f m with respect to wdv because f m acts out of phase with the velocity dalrymple et al 1984 kobayashi et al 1993 mendez and losada 2004 as a consequence the work done by f m in a wave period is roughly equal to zero and is typically neglected mendez and losada 2004 ozeren et al 2014 and this was also available under both pure wave and combined wave and current conditions hu et al 2014 chen et al 2018 yao et al 2018 under these conditions a period averaged c d can be derived from the following equation hu et al 2014 6 c d 2 π ω π ω f d u d t π ω π ω ρ h v b v u 2 u d t 2 π ω π ω f u d t π ω π ω ρ h v b v u 2 u d t compared with the internal characteristics of the canopy the vegetation induced force on both ends of the canopy is relatively large refer to 4 4 3 section because they are directly exposed to the wave and current flows due to the lack of sheltering effect maza et al 2015 in order to obtain the bulk drag characteristics of the entire canopy the space averaged period averaged c d can be derived based on eq 6 by averaging the period averaged c d from the four locations x 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 6 m and 0 8 m for simplicity the space averaged period averaged c d is termed as c d in the following investigation the similar method has also been satisfactorily adopted in hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 for vegetated flows under wave current conditions as mentioned in the introduction section previous studies pointed out that drag coefficient was closely related to either re u m b v ν or kc u m t b v respectively where u m is the characteristic velocity acting on the vegetation and ν 10 6 m2 s is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid when the velocity measurements are unavailable u m is usually estimated based on the linear wave theory which is defined as the maximum horizontal velocity at the seaward edge of the canopy top kobayashi et al 1993 mendez et al 1999 koftis et al 2013 maza et al 2013 anderson and smith 2014 ozeren et al 2014 wu and cox 2015 mattis et al 2019 for physical experiments with the smaller submergence ratio hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 assumed the velocity measured at mid water depth as the depth average velocity and regarded the space averaged maximum horizontal velocity as the characteristic velocity a similar characteristic velocity to calculate re and kc numbers was employed in this study in which the spatially averaged maximum u termed as u max was obtained by averaging the maximum u from four locations x 0 2 m 0 4 m 0 6 m and 0 8 m to replace u m in re and kc calculations and a similar usage concerning the maximum horizontal velocity has also been adopted in henry et al 2015 for wave flows 4 4 2 velocity profiles inside the canopy fig 10 shows the vertical profiles of peak horizontal velocities u max and u min in the positive and negative directions in a wave period respectively along the water depth at x 0 5 m location the scenarios with h i 0 08 m t 1 2 s under pure wave and wave current conditions u c 0 2 m s are tested to explore the effects of vegetation on the velocity profiles inside the vegetation canopy it was found that the velocities variation along the water depth is generally relatively small for all scenarios except near the flume bottom wall fig 10 a shows that both the magnitudes of u max and u min decrease significantly due to the presence of vegetation which reveals that the effect of the vegetation induced wave dissipation for wave current condition the values of u max and u min are always positive throughout the water depth as shown in fig 10 b and the u max values especially for the wave surface are reduced due to the presence of the canopy however the u min values increase below the wave surface compared with fig 10 b and c shows a contrary pattern for the wave current condition with the general negative values of u max and u min and this is due to the opposing current effect fig 10 b and c also illustrate that for wave current conditions the symmetrical distributions of the vertical profiles of u max and u min roughly occur and the straight line of u u c can be regarded as the corresponding symmetry axis furthermore the cross sectional average velocity u at the x 0 6 m location is obtained to discuss the effect of the various currents on the velocity pattern fig 11 shows the time varying u for h i 0 10 m and t 1 4 s under both pure wave conditions and wave current conditions the results show that for wave current conditions a larger u c can shift the u profiles further towards the positive direction i e the overall u values increase as u c increases and the expansion of u is roughly equal to the increase of u c based on eq 1 which is consistent with the conclusions reported by hu et al 2014 moreover when u c increases from 0 to 0 2 m s within the range of α 1 in which u w 0 216 m s for h i 0 10 m and t 1 4 s scenario here a slight phase difference occurs between the oscillating u profiles this may be explained by the doppler shift i e the effect of a steady current on intrinsic wave frequency wolf and prandle 1999 however a larger time lag ca 0 084 s occurs between u c 0 2 m s and u c 0 3 m s this is because that when u c is larger than u w i e α 1 the current flow velocity intends to be dominant comparing to the wave velocity consequently the wave inside the canopy exhibits nonlinear behavior the asymmetry of the wave profiles causes the asymmetry of u profiles and a certain degree of water transport occurs leading to this time lag as a result this confirms that the velocity ratio α plays a significant role in modifying u profiles in contrast the wave current conditions present an opposite trend to wave current conditions with u c magnitude increases from 0 to 0 2 m s within the range of α 1 the u profiles further shift towards the negative direction accompanied by a rather weak time lag due to the doppler shift as u c magnitude increases up to 0 3 m s α 1 the water transport in the negative direction causes a negative time lag on the other hand it is interesting to note that the u max magnitudes exists at the trough location under wave current conditions and the u max magnitudes increase evenly as u c magnitude increases from 0 to 0 2 m s however when u c magnitude increases from 0 2 to 0 3 m s the u max magnitude increases a little that is the u max magnitude for u c 0 3 m s is comparable to that for u c 0 2 m s in particular a small oscillating amplitude of the u profile appears for u c 0 3 m s which causes a very small wave height this reveals that the larger opposing current leads to a significant promotion in wdv and a predominant effect on wave propagation 4 4 3 force induced by canopy fig 12 shows the temporal variation of the total horizontal force f on a single cylinder at x 0 6 m location for h i 0 10 m and t 1 4 s with various u c according to eq 5 it can be expected that f varies periodically with the time varying u within one wave period as a result the influence of u c on f is consistent with the influence of u c on u as a result the f magnitudes with different u c according to that of u consistent with the trends reported in hu et al 2014 however compared fig 12 with fig 11 it can be observed that there is a certain time lag between f and u this is due to the presence of f m with an increase in the u c magnitude for wave current conditions a more asymmetric f occurs and f profile further shifts towards the positive direction resulting in total positive f values when u c 0 3 m s in contrast a relatively symmetric f profile with total negative values occurs for u c 0 3 m s in which the current flow velocity is dominant comparing to the wave velocity note that the maximum magnitude of horizontal force f max for u c 0 3 m s is comparable to that for u c 0 2 m s consistent with the u max magnitudes for u c 0 2 and 0 3 m s in fig 11 it needs to mention that the direction of f max is associated with the direction of the current flow this means that the f max direction is positive under following current condition and the f max direction is negative under opposing current condition fig 13 shows the effect of the incident wave height h i on the maximum magnitude of horizontal force f max evolution along the canopy for t 1 4 s and u c 0 2 m s the results show that a larger h i leads to a larger f max along the canopy under wave current conditions for wave current conditions f max shows a similar trend for various h i i e a maximum f max occurs at the seaward edge of the canopy since the cylinder at this location the first cylinder is directly exposed to the combined wave and following current flows the superposition of wave velocity and following current velocity results in a particularly large f max this effect plays an important role in the survival of the vegetation directly exposed to waves located at the seaward region of the canopy maza et al 2015 note that f max decreases rapidly from x 0 to 0 2 m and then gradually decreases and eventually reaches stable until it reaches the leeward edge of the canopy similar to that observed for the testing prototype rhizophora mangrove forests reported by ismail et al 2012 this feature is due to that the alignment configuration generating clearly preference flow channels because of the uniform spacing between the cylinders and the cylinders except for the first ones are not directly exposed to wave induced flow the downstream cylinders are sheltered by the upstream ones as a result the values of f max vary little along the canopy moreover note that a larger h i causes f max to drop faster in the range of x 0 to 0 2 m in contrast the wave current conditions exhibit a different pattern it needs to mention that the direction of f max keeps negative when u c 0 2 m s compared with fig 13 a it is found that there is no particularly large f max at the seaward edge of the canopy in fig 13 b this is because that the water particle velocity is suppressed by the superposition of wave velocity and opposing current velocity resulting in a relatively smaller f max besides f max shows a slightly decreasing pattern along the canopy due to the sheltering effect induced by the upstream cylinders the most significant difference is that a maximum f max magnitude occurs at the leeward side of the canopy because the cylinder at this location the last cylinder is directly exposed to the opposing current flows taking the propagation direction of opposing current as a reference the cylinder located at x 0 8 m are sheltered by the cylinder at x 1 0 m the local velocity at x 0 8 m is reduced as a result leading to maximum f max at the leeward side of the canopy fig 14 shows the effect of the wave period t on the maximum horizontal force f max evolution along the canopy for h i 0 1 m and u c 0 2 m s it is found that all curves are roughly close to each other for various t especially for wave current conditions indicating that f max is not sensitive to the variation of t under wave current conditions consistent with conclusions obtained from pure wave conditions in fig 3 the velocity field effected by the combined wave and current flows based on linear wave theory can explain this according to eq 1 as t increases from 1 2 to 1 8 s for a given h i the corresponding u max only increases from 0 405 to 0 428 m s with a slight amplification of 5 77 therefore based on eq 5 the f max variation is rather limited within the range of t from 1 2 to 1 8 s for a given h i fig 15 shows the effect of the current velocity u c on the maximum horizontal force f max evolution along the canopy for h i 0 1 m and t 1 4 s as mentioned in fig 12 the direction of f max is associated with the direction of the current flow the solid line for u c 0 m s in fig 15 a represents the f max in the negative direction under the pure wave condition and the dotted line for u c 0 m s in fig 15 b is the f max in the negative direction in general f max values for the following currents are higher than those for opposing currents to a great extent which is consistent with the tendency shown in fig 12 in addition it is found that the effect of u c on f max is similar to that of h i on f max as shown in fig 13 the largest difference exists for wave current conditions the f max magnitude increases with u c magnitude increases from 0 to 0 3 m s and the larger u c magnitude the greater the increase of f max magnitude this effect relates to the survival of the vegetation directly exposed to opposing current flows at the leeward region of the canopy in addition since the f max magnitude for u c 0 2 m s is comparable to that for u c 0 3 m s as shown in fig 12 the difference of f max is large between u c 0 1 and u c 0 2 m s while it is smaller between u c 0 2 and u c 0 3 m s this is mainly due to the suppression of waves when the opposing current is stronger as explained in fig 11 4 4 4 drag coefficient quantification based on direct force measurement approach fig 16 shows the relationship between the space averaged period averaged drag coefficient c d and current velocity u c the scenarios with t 1 2 s are considered as examples to discuss the effect of h i in fig 16 a and the scenarios with h i 0 08 m are considered as examples to discuss the effect of t in fig 16 b respectively the results show that regardless of the type of conditions wave current or wave current c d decreases with increasing u c magnitude and the relationship between c d and u c is roughly symmetrical about u c 0 m s axis indicating that the u c magnitude plays a significant role in estimating c d while the u c direction has little influence on it in addition there are still some differences between fig 16 a and b fig 16 a shows that the scenarios with the largest h i have the smallest c d under pure wave conditions u c 0 m s however under wave current conditions especially for u c 0 1 0 2 m s a higher h i leads to a larger c d this is because that for given t and u c as h i increases both f and u will increase by an order of magnitude of 0 1 i e u 2 will increase by an order of 0 01 as a result based on eq 6 c d increases with the increase of h i for a given u c under wave current conditions in contrast fig 16 b shows a different pattern that is a larger t always leads to smaller c d values the reason for this is that for given h i and u c the f changes are insensitive as t increases from 1 2 to 1 8 s as shown in fig 14 while u increases slightly therefore a larger t leads to a smaller c d based on eq 6 in addition as u c magnitude increases the effects of h i and t on c d become weaker mainly due to that the current flows begin to be dominant over waves when current velocity is stronger to further quantify the influences of u c on c d the drag coefficient ratio r c d is defined as r c d c d cw c d pw where c d cw and c d pw represent the c d values under combined wave current and pure wave conditions respectively fig 17 shows the relationship between r c d and α under wave current conditions further it can be observed that r c d decreases gradually as α increases indicating that c d decreases with the increase of u c magnitude under the same wave parameters which is consistent with the tendency as shown in fig 16 in addition with increasing α in the α 2 0 region and r c d tends to be a stable value this can be explained by fig 16 that as u c increases the decreasing trend of c d tends to be gentle furthermore the fitted curves for wave current wave current and wave current conditions are also included in fig 17 and all correlation coefficients r2 are not smaller than 0 96 which shows that r c d have a very strong dependency on α it is interesting to note that when α is less than about 1 the r c d values for wave current scenarios blue dotted line are larger than those for wave current scenarios red dotted line this is because that the wave current scenarios have larger c d values than wave current scenarios when α is smaller for example the c d values for u c 0 1 m s in fig 16 a can confirm this well in contrast an opposite tendency appears when α is approximately larger than 1 the reason for this is that the c d values of wave current scenarios are larger than these of wave current scenarios 4 4 5 c d re and c d kc relations a large number of previous studies have reported that the drag coefficient c d has generally been expressed as functions of re and kc and the most common expressions are written as c d δ κ re γ and c d m kc n henry et al 2015 chen et al 2018 based on the forms of the empirical formula all space averaged period averaged c d c d values for pure wave wave current and wave current conditions are plotted against re and kc in fig 18 the results show that the r2 values of the c d re and c d kc relations for pure wave conditions are obviously higher than those for wave current conditions moreover the c d values for pure wave conditions are larger than those for wave current conditions and the fitted c d data for wave current conditions are higher than those for wave current conditions to some extent indicating that the current accompanying wave can significantly reduce c d values in comparison to the pure waves and the opposing current leads to a largest declining amplitude of c d under wave current conditions compared with the pure wave and wave current conditions this can be explained by the relationship between r c d and α as shown in fig 17 that is as α increases the r c d displays a greater reduction rate under wave current conditions consequently c d values under wave current conditions decrease at a faster rate in addition although the data points are scattered to some extent it is clear that c d decreases generally with increasing both re and kc which is consistent with the conclusions in the literature mendez and losada 2004 augustin et al 2009 ozeren et al 2014 henry et al 2015 chen et al 2018 following the same structure of the formula forms above both c d re and c d kc relations were fitted by using all data of pure wave and wave current scenarios as follows 7 c d 0 31 6718 re with r 2 0 66 2000 re 10000 8 c d 12 89 kc 0 70 with r 2 0 58 6 kc 44 fig 19 shows that the typical decreasing pattern of fitting c d still holds with the increasing re or kc number under both pure wave and wave current conditions note that the re and kc numbers for wave current scenarios are larger than those for pure wave scenarios this is because for wave current scenarios the characteristic velocity u max values are superimposed by the current u c in the calculations of re and kc numbers consequently the higher re and kc numbers lead to lower c d values in the wave current scenarios to compare with the new proposed c d re and c d kc empirical formulas eqs 7 and 8 the existing drag coefficient formulas from the literature hu et al 2014 chen et al 2018 for wave current flows are included in fig 19 it should be mentioned that the two of them share the same set of experimental data note that the range of re of this study 2000 re 10000 is wider than that of hu et al 2014 300 re 4700 while the range of kc of this study 6 kc 44 is narrower than that of chen et al 2018 4 kc 115 the different diameters of the test vegetation mimics and different wave as well as current flow conditions used in the two experiments could account for these discrepancies in re and kc although they all share a similar trend i e with increasing re or kc c d gradually decreases and approaches asymptotic values the c d kc relation in this study shows a better consistency with chen et al 2018 especially for the wave current scenarios in addition the c d values for pure wave conditions in this study are more scatter and larger than those of hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 this may be explained by the fact that tests by hu et al 2014 include several submerged scenarios that leads to a lower wdv and a smaller c d as a result as a summary fig 19 demonstrates that whether the drag coefficient is c d or bulk c d vegetation is rigid or flexible wave is regular or irregular all relations have an overall similar trend which reveals the intrinsic law between the drag coefficient and re or kc number however the correlation coefficients of the new proposed empirical formulas eqs 7 and 8 are not satisfactory enough and the r2 values are as small as 0 66 and 0 58 for c d re and c d kc relations respectively for the sake of intuition fig 20 a shows the comparison of the numerical c d and the predicted c d values calculated by eqs 7 and 8 the y x lines are plotted for reference in the figures to represent the perfect agreement between them obviously the three clusters of scatter c d data are observed to correspond to pure wave wave current and wave current scenarios as expected respectively and the data points scatter sparsely there is no doubt that this is due to the current effects thus the current effect should be considered to describe the c d re and c d kc relations as mentioned in fig 17 r c d have a very strong dependency on the velocity ratio α the better relations between c d and re or kc by considering α are fitted as follows 9 c d 2 02 3000 re 0 7 exp 1 47 α 0 3 with r 2 0 76 10 c d 5 80 k c 0 27 0 7 exp 1 47 α 0 3 with r 2 0 94 fig 20 b presents the comparisons of predicted c d based on eqs 9 and 10 with the numerical c d the modified relationships have less scatter and a large proportion of the relative deviations are smaller than 20 note that the r2 values increase from 0 66 to 0 76 for c d re relations and from 0 58 to 0 94 for c d kc relations respectively consequently by considering the combined effects of the wave and current the newer c d kc empirical formulas can obtain better satisfactory predictions for wave attenuation by emergent rigid vegetation under the combined wave and current conditions indeed a practical and commonly used method to obtain c d is by calibrating wdv models eq 3 against measured wave height decay i e the calibration approach mentioned in introduction section the corresponding c d re and c d kc relations are more practical to predict c d in practical application since the re and kc numbers are usually defined by using u m as the characteristic velocity which can be measured in front of the canopy or approximated from the incident wave properties based on the linear wave theory kobayashi et al 1993 mendez et al 1999 koftis et al 2013 ozeren et al 2014 however this characteristic velocity is not representative of the hydrodynamic conditions inside a canopy as it is apparent that wave height decreases along vegetation canopy and wave velocity decreases accordingly especially when the wdv is high hu et al 2014 in contrast the direct force measurement approach in this study adopted the numerical in phase force and velocity data to obtain c d and the related re and kc numbers were calculated by using the measured in canopy velocity i e spatially averaged maximum u u max as the characteristic velocity in fact u max directly interacts with canopy mimics which is more representative for the hydrodynamic conditions inside a canopy unfortunately with the current instrumentation the direct force measurement approach is only applicable in lab conditions as it requires synchronized force and velocity data with high accuracy which are not feasible to obtain in field condition for practical applications it needs to be emphasized that the direct force measurement approach enables us to obtain the c d under combined wave and current flows which is not possible with the calibration method to our knowledge the c d of mimic vegetation canopies under wave plus opposing current flows has not been assessed previously additionally by introducing the velocity ratio α to consider the combined effects of the wave and current new empirical relations between c d and re or kc were proposed as an extension of the results reported by hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 which are expected to be useful in understanding wdv and predicting it in numerical modeling studies under combined wave and current flows for example in detailed spectral wave models or phase resolving models re and kc within a canopy can be easily accessed hu et al 2014 and the value of c d can be a reasonable first estimate based on these empirical relations subsequently 5 conclusions to explore the effects of following and opposing currents on the wdv a series of physical experiments with respect to the interaction between rigid emergent cylinders and combined wave and current flows were conducted for pure wave conditions the vegetation performs a better wave dissipation under larger wave height and smaller wave period conditions for wave current conditions the following currents can either enhance or suppress wdv which depends on the velocity ratio α between the current velocity and the maximum horizontal wave orbital velocity for wave plus following current wdv is suppressed when α is small within the range of 0 37 1 54 when α is sufficiently high wdv can be strengthened because of interaction between wave and current however opposing currents can always enhance wdv these findings suggested that the flooding tide during storm events could be a critical scenario for coastal protection schemes that utilizes coastal wetlands to attenuate wave energy in addition to better understand the small scale mechanisms responsible for wdv a quasi 3 d numerical model with periodic boundary conditions based on rans model was developed to extend the physical experiments to provide the velocity profiles and force evolutions along the canopy in detail the results indicate that velocity magnitudes decrease significantly due to the presence of the vegetation and a larger following and opposing current that can shift the velocity profiles further towards the positive and negative direction respectively the horizontal force varies correspondingly with the time varying horizontal velocity when α is larger than 1 there will be a significant time lag between the velocity and force profiles of combined wave and current conditions and pure wave conditions the larger opposing current leads to a significant promotion in wdv and a predominant effect on wave propagation in addition the evolution patterns in terms of the maximum horizontal force f max along the canopy were explored with different incident wave heights h i wave periods t and current velocity u c in detail it was found that the larger h i and u c the larger f max however f max is not sensitive to the variation of t besides the maximum f max vales take place at the seaward and leeward edges of the canopy under wave current and wave current conditions respectively within the canopy f max present a slightly declining trend in the direction of wave propagation the direct force measurement approach was applied to quantify drag coefficients in both pure wave and combined wave and current flows finally as an extension to the c d re and c d kc relations for wave plus following current condition in hu et al 2014 and chen et al 2018 the newer generic empirical relations between drag coefficients and re kc numbers for combined wave and current flows were provided considering both the following and opposing current effects results of the present study shall be immensely helpful in estimating the drag coefficients under combined wave and current flow scenarios where the velocity data inside the canopy is known which will be useful in understanding the real wdv with respect to interaction among wave current and vegetation credit

21634,fin stabilizers have been widely used to reduce the roll motion of ships at medium high velocities however the anti rolling efficiency of the traditional fin declines rapidly as the speed of the ship decreases to enable more efficient use of fin stabilizers across the whole speed range dynamics of fins at zero low velocity were derived then the proposed model was verified by experiment and the numerical results were compared with those of previous studies to obtain a balance between the performance of the hydrofoil profile at zero low and medium high speed we determined desirable ranges for various hydrofoil profile parameters including sweep angle aspect ratio and relative position of the shaft for non retractable fins finally tests were conducted using forced ship roll motion to

most of the latest research on traditional fin stabilizers has focused on introducing new control strategies elgohary and awad 2018 fuat et al 2014 hinostroza et al 2015 and utilizing lift feedback to improve control sun et al 2018 previous research has improved the anti rolling effects of fin stabilizers at medium high speed however the lift of traditional fins is approximately proportional to the square of the ship speed fossen 2011 perez and blanke 2012 as a result traditional fin stabilizers are reported to have poor damping effects at low ship speeds and may even be ineffective at zero velocity most surveying vessels and engineering ships must frequently sail at low speeds to fulfil various tasks without a stabilization device low speeds can lead to large roll motion kianejad et al 2018 metin and omer 2018 therefore reducing roll motion at low speed is crucial for marine vessels anti roll tanks have been widely used for this purpose and work well across the entire speed range of ships reza and alistair 2005 the passive u tank which is the most widely used anti roll tank can reduce ship roll by more than 50 moaleji and greig 2007 alujevic et al 2019 whereas the anti rolling effect of traditional fin stabilizers can reach 90 at medium high speed sun et al 2018 therefore the fin stabilizer would be a superior stabilization device if the damping effects at zero low velocity were similar to those of the anti roll tank new technology has been proposed to enable the use of fin stabilizers at zero velocity or at anchor and was first used by the maritime research institute netherlands marin in wageningen dalligna 1999 2002 van wieringen 2002 in 2006 a zero speed fin stabilizer www kongsberg com maritime products was shown to be effective in sea trials of a large yacht my amevi harbin engineering university in china began to investigate the application of fin stabilizers at zero velocity in 2003 jin et al 2007 liang et al 2018 song et al 2015 wang et al 2009 and obtained satisfactory results from ship model tests liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 today the main maritime companies around the world such as rolls royce naiad skf and quantum have launched their own zero speed or at anchor fin stabilizers however most companies have only published zero speed and medium high velocity test results on their websites without mention of their fins operating under more complicated low speed conditions since most traditional fin stabilizers work at speeds between 6 kn and the maximal ship speed for the purposes of our work low speed is defined as ranging from 0 kn to 6 kn the present study aimed to optimize fin stabilizer performance at low velocity the anti rolling effect of the fin stabilizer mainly depends on two factors the stabilizing force generated by the fins which is determined by the fin profile and the control system which regulates the fin kawazoe et al 1994 in this paper we propose a force model and hydrofoil profile of the fin the rest of this paper is organized as follows a numerical model of the fin at low velocity is presented in section 2 optimization of the hydrofoil profile is described in section 3 the results of forced roll tests with an optimized stabilizer are presented and discussed in section 4 finally the main conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 numerical modeling of the fin at low velocity a numerical model of the fin stabilizer at low velocity is first required in order to design the hydrofoil profile and control strategy 2 1 anti roll principles under different speeds when fluid flows across the fin surface at medium high speed the traditional fin will generate a lift as shown in fig 1 the amplitude of lift can be expressed as 1 f f h 1 2 ρ a u 2 c l α where ρ and a are the fluid density and the fin area respectively u represents the vessel velocity and c l α is the lift coefficient of the fin a fixed non zero angle of attack and flow speed provide a certain amount of lift however if the fin has a fixed angle this mechanism will no longer produce sufficient force to efficiently stabilize the ship when sailing at zero low speed fossen 2011 in contrast to the lift based mechanism the drag based mechanism inspired by the fast start manoevers used by fish and swimming ducks can generate far greater forces by flapping the fin rapidly at zero low speed fish 2004 jacob et al 2018 read et al 2003 when the left to right movement is transformed into an up and down movement as shown in fig 2 the force produced by quick flapping of the active fin can be used to stabilize the ship when sailing at zero low velocity compared to the lift based mechanism the drag based mechanism is more complicated especially when the vessel is sailing at low speed under low speed conditions it is difficult to derive an accurate hydrodynamic force model that describes the relationship between the force magnitude phase and the angle of attack of the fin a simplified approximation of the model that meets the requirements of fin engineering design applications would be more practical several researchers have identified three important components involved in generating the hydrodynamic force of the fin when the ship is at zero speed form drag added mass force and vortex force jin et al 2007 wang et al 2009 however form drag and added mass force are derived from the vortex force and makes it difficult to separate the vorticity force from the composite hydrodynamic force both in the theoretical analysis of real fluids and under experimental conditions cabrera and ruina 2006 buren et al 2018 therefore only two factors of integrated force i e form drag and added mass force are used in subsequent calculations 2 2 form drag of the fin the total resistance of the fin is mainly comprised of pressure resistance friction resistance and induced resistance of wake shedding lin et al 1999 when the fin rapidly flaps around its shaft and moves with the ship a boundary layer forms on the fin surface due to viscous friction gong et al 2019 since the flow speed relative to the fin surface changes some fluid or water particles accelerate while others decelerate thus the boundary layer undergoes a pressure gradient as a result flow inside the boundary layer acted upon by a resultant force if the resultant force exceeds a threshold value the flow can be reversed leading to separation of the boundary layer due to this separation a force much larger than viscous drag is induced by the pressure difference buren et al 2018 in fact there is an outside chordwise distribution in the central region of the two chordside vorticity cores accompanying the tailing edge vortex and chord side vortex the chordwise flow over the backside of the fin enlarges the trailing edge vortex kim and gharib 2011 the fin profile determines the separation and the vortex size as shown in fig 3 therefore the resistance amplitude is mainly influenced by the external shape of the fin the force generated by this pressure difference is called the form drag a fin with a parallelogram shape as shown in fig 4 can be used to conduct the force modeling advantages of the parallelogram fin will be discussed in section 3 if we place the parallelogram fin in the coordinate system i e xoy the root chord coincides with the horizontal x axis and the fin shaft coincides with the vertical y axis the fin rotates around the y axis at an angular velocity of α ω and moves forward along the x axis at a speed of u the drag force on an infinitesimal area d x d y on the fin surface can be defined as 2 d f f d 1 2 c d ρ v v d x d y where v ω x u sin α is the instantaneous speed of infinitesimal area d x d y and c d is the drag coefficient at the posterior part of the fin shaft the total form drag can be expressed as 3 f f d 1 1 2 c d ρ 0 e 0 4 d c 2 y tan α ls ω x u sin α ω x u sin α d x d y at the anterior part of the fin shaft the total form drag can be given as 4 f f d 2 1 2 c d ρ 0 e c 2 y tan α ls 0 ω x u sin α ω x u sin α d x d y since the form drag will have opposite signs on the two opposing sides of the fin shaft the total form drag can be defined as 5 f f d f f d 1 f f d 2 2 3 added mass force of the fin when a fin is rotated and translated a portion of the fluid is carried by and moves with the fin moreover the variation of angular speed and linear speed will change the velocity of the fluid around the fin the servosystem must not only accelerate or decelerate the fin but also the fluid surrounding the fin from the perspective of the servosystem an added moment must be overcome due to the additional mass of the fin when the concept of the additional mass is extended the added force f f m on the fin must be overcome two different theoretical methods can be used to analyze and calculate the added mass force the first method is based on potential flow theory corkery et al 2019 fernandez feria 2019 however it is difficult to obtain an analytical formula for an irregular fin profile when this method is used the second method is based on newton s second law of motion lin et al 1999 grift et al 2019 and can easily be used to obtain a numerical equation from the perspective of simplifying the hydrodynamic force model the second method is easier and more desirable from a traditional viewpoint the added mass force f f m can be described as follows 6 f f m m h v where m h is the added mass and v is acceleration however according to the experimental results of grift et al 2019 and the results of computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations of chao et al 2019 when the speed v changes from zero at a constant acceleration the added mass force is not constant in fact the added mass force increases with increasing speed i e v v t and arrives at the maximum value at the end of the acceleration process to simplify the analysis variation of f f m can be regarded as the change in added mass m h thus f f m is governed by two factors one is proportional to v and the other is related to v t then a more accurate version of added mass force f f m can be obtained as 7 f f m d m h d t v t t s 1 m h v where t s 1 is a small starting delay time of about 0 07 s grift et al 2019 and is negligible compared to the roll period of the ship the added mass m h of the fin can be inferred from yu 1945 8 m h ρ 0 788 e 2 4 d 2 e 2 4 d 2 0 0619 e 4 d t c 1 2 where t c is the fin thickness the corresponding acceleration force will not completely vanish when the fin stops accelerating because the past process produces a wake vortex in the flow the force will decrease from the maximum value of f f m to zero following a trend similar to the function 1 x 2 later on only form drag will exist considering the model of roll motion of the ship as a second order inertia function with a long period the effect of the force on rolling from the immediate disappearance to the gradual change in a short time is not distinguishable to simplify the modeling process the fast transient process after the acceleration can be neglected at the posterior part of the fin shaft the added mass force can be regarded as acting at the midpoint of the chord length 9 f f m 1 d m h d t 2 4 d c 2 e tan α ls 4 ω t m h 2 4 d c 2 e tan α ls 4 ω ω 0 at the anterior part of the fin shaft the added mass force is defined as 10 f f m 2 d m h d t 2 c 2 e tan α l s 4 ω t m h 2 c 2 e tan α l s 4 ω ω 0 considering the same function of the additional mass force on the two sides of the fin shaft the total force is expressed as 11 f f m f f m 1 f f m 2 2 4 stabilization force model and verification although the lift force component is very small the lift mechanism is also effective when the ship sails at low speed the stabilization force f f l of the ship is the vertical component of the total hydrodynamic force acting on the fin thus it can be obtained as 12 f f l f f d f f m cos α 0 5 ρ a u 2 c l α integrating f f l in eq 12 could lead to a very complex formula therefore the equation must be simplified since fins are arranged symmetrically on the port and starboard sides and move in opposite directions the line speed u sin α simultaneously applies an inverse action to the left and the right fins and the ship speed u changes slowly thus eq 12 can be rewritten as 13 f f l 1 2 c d ρ e ω ω 4 d c 2 3 c 2 3 3 e tan α ls 4 d c 2 2 c 2 2 2 e 2 tan α ls 2 4 d 2 c 2 3 e 3 tan α ls 3 6 cos α 2 d d m h d t ω t m h ω cos α 0 5 ρ a u 2 c l α given the sweep angle of the heading side α ls 0 and the ship velocity u 0 eq 13 is transformed into a hydrodynamic model of a rectanglar fin at zero speed then this model can be compared with the model of wang 2009 2010 as shown in fig 5 a 4 d 2 84 m e 1 60 m and c 2 0 57 m compared with the model of wang 2010 and the result calculated by fluent using eq 13 all the results are in good agreement ye 2015 proposed a low speed model with a constant ship velocity u 0 2 kn by fitting the results calculated using fluent here we also set u 0 2 kn in eq 13 and compared our model with that of ye as shown in fig 5b 4 d 2 83 m e 1 42 m and c 2 0 71 m in fig 5 the y axis presents the hydrodynamic force instead of the stabilization force since only the total hydrodynamic force is reported in the works of wang 2010 and ye 2015 it can be seen from fig 5 that the stabilization force model proposed here is effective and feasible to further validate eq 13 an experimental device was adopted as shown in fig 6 in the experiment a torque motor with an absolute encoder was driven by an elmo digital driver and a six component balance was used to measure the forces and moments acting on the fin the force and moment values were transferred to a personal computer pc via three advantech adam 3016 amplifiers only three moment components are needed to obtain the hydrodynamic force data of the fin the moment about the x axis is proportional to the normal force of the fin the moment about the y axis is proportional to the tangential force produced by the fin and the moment about the z axis is the torque required to drive the fin the parallelogram fin was used in the experiments it can be seen from fig 7 that differences between the results of the tank tests and the proposed force model are small therefore it can be concluded that the proposed model provides sufficient accuracy for engineering applications 3 hydrofoil profile optimization the force on the fin is related not only to the movement parameters but also to the fin profile parameters since the fin is used at both zero low velocity and at medium high velocity hydrodynamic force requirements must be met for the whole range of velocities and under different working modes to use the fin stabilizer at zero low speed and medium high speed the fin shape was optimized by combining the theoretical analysis with experimental data the stabilization force is sufficient at medium high velocity but insufficient at zero low velocity under most conditions therefore the model was optimized for a high lift to drag ratio at medium high speed and high stabilization force at zero low speed the fins used in the optimization are illustrated in fig 8 3 1 selection of basic hydrofoil profile the cross sectional shapes of the basic hydrofoil a non retractable fin stabilizer used as the fin were the naca fin and fishtail fin as well as the rectangular trapezoidal and parallelogram fins as shown in fig 9 the rectangular fin is widely used in theoretical studies owing to its simple structure however the rectangle was first excluded since a previous experimental study showed that the sweep angle of the leading edge is beneficial to lift lentink et al 2007 fig 10 depicts the experimental results of the naca sectional shape at different leading edge sweep angles α ls α ls 0 for the rectanglar fin at high speed there were no significant differences in lift to drag ratio with different α ls values however the lift coefficient increased when a hydrofoil with a characteristic α ls 0 was used moreover similar results were obtained in experiments using the fishtail fin at zero low speed the rectanglar fin is not ideal the maximum stabilization force of the parallelogram fin with a leading edge sweep angle of 12 increased by 35 26 compared to the rectanglar fin as shown in fig 11 in fig 11 the position of the fin shaft relative to the root chord is constant and the ratio is 1 5 at zero low velocity the tail vortex of the trapezoidal fin leaves the ship hull because the angle between the tail edge of the fin and the aft hull is more than 90 in contrast the tail vortex of the parallelogram fin moves toward the hull similar to the weis fogh mechanism the clap and fling mechanism discovered by weis fogh is used by some insects as part of their wing beat which generates greater lift than the lift calculated using steady state aerodynamics thereby increasing the stabilization force cooter and baker 1977 zhang et al 2002 ye 2015 calculated the effectiveness of the hull using fluent and suggested that the force can be increased by about 28 at 0 2 kn furthermore four fins with the same plane shape but different cross sectional shapes were tested and the results are illustrated in fig 12 fish t0018 and fish t0021 are fishtail fins with relative thicknesses of 18 and 21 respectively compared with the naca fin the maximum lift coefficient increased by about 25 71 at the rarely used fin angle of 30 whereas the lift to drag ratio increased by 90 79 at the frequently used fin angle of 10 it is clear that naca fins are a good choice when a non retractable fin with a small aspect ratio is required therefore in order to operate the fin stabilizer across the whole range of speeds the best fin and cross sectional shape are the parallelogram and naca respectively 3 2 optimization of fin shaft position at zero low speed the rear part of the fin shaft generates a stabilization force however the front part of the fin shaft reduces that stabilization force according to eq 13 thus moving the fin shaft towards the leading edge increases the instantaneous linear velocity of the tail part for the same angular speed consequently shifting the relative position of the fin shaft towards the leading edge is an effective way to increase the stabilization force when the ship is sailing at zero low velocity however at medium high speeds the chordwise hydrodynamic center is located at about 1 4 of the chord length the relative chordwise position of the center of pressure the ratio of the distance from the center of pressure to the forward edge to the average chord length can be approximated by the following formula lowry and polhamus 1957 wang 1998 14 c p c 0 25 c m c l α cos a c d h α sin a where c p c is the relative position of the hydrodynamic center of pressure c d h α is the drag coefficient at medium high velocity c m m ρ u 2 a 4 d 2 is the moment coefficient of the fin m is the driving moment eq 14 can be verified using experimental data for the naca fin presented in table 1 jin et al 2015 in order to reduce power consumption of the servosystem most fin shafts of traditional fins are designed to be located at about 1 4 chord length fig 13 shows the percentage increase of the stabilization force p f at zero speed and the percentage increase of the drive torque p t at a cruise speed of 18 kn for a fin angle of 10 relative to the normal fin when the relative position of the fin shaft changes from 1 4 to 1 7 chord length it can be seen from fig 13 that the slope of p t is greater than the slope of p f which indicates that moving the fin shaft closer to the leading edge will quickly increase power consumption at high speed when the power consumption of the servosystem and the mechanical strength of the fin are both taken into account a relative position of the fin shaft of between 1 5 to 1 6 chord length is recommended 3 3 optimization of the sweep angle from eq 13 it can be inferred that when the relative position of the fin shaft is consistently set as the average chord length the stabilization force does not change significantly as the sweep angle changes if the relative position of the fin shaft is set as the root chord which is equivalent to moving the position of the fin shaft towards the leading edge both the speed of the aft part of the fin and the stabilization force will increase arastehfar et al 2019 measured the average thrust of the fin at different sweep angles 0 10 20 30 and 40 and concluded that although sweep angles of 10 and 20 will slightly affect the fin thrust the effect is not remarkable lentink et al 2007 conducted wind tunnel experiments to investigate the impact of varying the sweep angle from 5 to 50 their results confirmed that a small sweep angle offers superior performance at low speed whereas a large sweep angle is more favorable at high speed in fact the low speed of the airfoil is equivalent to the medium high speed of the hydrofoil indicating that a sweep angle of less than 20 performs better similar conclusions can be obtained from our experimental results as shown in fig 10 thus based on the above analyses and fig 8 a sweep angle between 10 and 20 is recommended 3 4 optimization of aspect ratio at zero low velocities when the relative position of the fin shaft and the fin area are fixed reducing the aspect ratio will increase the speed of the tail part effectively increasing the stabilization force nonetheless at medium high speeds a decrease in the aspect ratio reduces the lift coefficient and increases the non linearity of the lift coefficient makoto et al 2016 mizoguchi and itoh 2013 shields and mohseni 2013 furthermore decreasing the aspect ratio will lead to a larger fin angle under the same wave disturbance resulting in a larger flow and higher power requirements of the hydrodynamic servosystem which in turn aggravates mechanical wear thus the aspect ratio of the non retractable fin should lie within the range of 0 7 1 0 for conventional applications the shape of the ship s hull and the desired anti rolling effects are the main factors considered in the design of the aspect ratio and fin area to simplify the selection of a suitable aspect ratio we assume that 100 of lift generated by the fins can be used to stabilize the ship the anti rolling requirement can be transformed into the forced roll requirement that is the roll indices that cause ship roll via active rotation of the fins when the ship sails in calm seas when the fins work in the forced roll mode fossen 2011 the rolling equation can be expressed as 15 i x δ i x φ 2 n u φ d h φ k c where φ is the roll angle of the ship i x δ i x represents the inertia moment of the roll 2 n u is the damping coefficient caused by the roll motion of the vessel d denotes the displacement weight of the vessel and h is the metacentric height using the laplace transform eq 15 can be transformed into 16 φ s 2 f f g z i x δ i x s 2 2 ω ϕ n u s ω ϕ 2 where ω φ d h i x δ i x is the harmonic roll frequency of the ship n u n u ω φ i x δ i x represents the dimensionless damping coefficient and g z is the moment arm at zero low speed we obtain 17 φ s 2 f f l g z i x δ i x s 2 2 ω ϕ n u s ω ϕ 2 where f f l is the stabilization force at zero low speed calculated from eq 13 at medium high velocities we obtain 18 φ s 2 f f h g z i x δ i x s 2 2 ω ϕ n u s ω ϕ 2 where f f h is the stabilization force at medium high speed calculated from eq 1 the forced roll angles in different work modes are affected by the fin area and its aspect ratio when the maximum forced roll angle fin area and ship speed are constant φ s in eq 18 is affected by c l α in eq 1 the relationship between lift coefficient c l α and aspect ratio c l α can be described as lowry and polhamus 1957 wang 1998 19 c l α a 0 α λ cos α l s λ 2 cos 4 α l s 4 57 3 a 0 π c d c λ α 57 3 2 assuming the required maximum roll angle is 13 and the ship sails at 18 0 kn which is the typical cruising speed of a warship the variation of fin area with aspect ratio is illustrated in fig 14 when the maximum forced roll angle fin area and ship speed are constant φ s in eq 17 is affected by force f f l in eq 13 and f f l will increase with decreasing aspect ratio assuming the maximum required roll angle is 7 and the ship sails at 0 0 kn the variation of fin area with aspect ratio is also shown in fig 14 to meet the required forced roll angle the two curves intersect at an aspect ratio of about 0 56 taking into account the different technical requirements of ships an aspect ratio in the range of 0 4 0 6 is recommended 3 5 example optimization of hydrofoil profile values of the above parameters must be defined according to the specific requirements of the ship taking a 1000 ton patrol ship as an example for which the forced roll angle of the ship is provided in the technical specifications the following conditions were defined 1 the amplitude of the fin angle is 42 in the resonant period of movement and the roll angle of the ship is not smaller than 7 when the ship is moored or floating unpowered 2 the amplitude of the fin angle is 18 in the period of harmonic roll motion and the roll angle of the ship is not less than 13 when the ship sails at a speed of 18 kn to meet the above requirements minimizing the fin area and driving moment are taken as the optimization objectives the objective function can be expressed as 20 g a m m s t φ m 7 u 0 0 kn φ m 13 u 18 0 kn where m m is the maximum moment in one rotation period and φ m is the maximum forced roll angle the real coded genetic algorithm ga was introduced to optimize the objective function g as an efficient and simple optimization algorithm the ga has been widely used in many fields shah and singh 2019 song et al 2019 by overcoming the hamming cliff problem the real coded ga achieves high accuracy when solving the objective function to simplify the optimization process the sweep angle α ls was fixed at 13 according to our previous experience and the variable p o a r f λ was optimized the calculation process is as follows step 1 initialize the population size popsize maximum optimization number maxgens cross probability proxover mutation probability promutation lower bound of p o aclobound and upper bound of p o acupbound the initial population popu is randomly generated within the upper and lower bounds let the loop variable k be zero step 2 calculate the fitness of the chromosome and record the best individual bestj step 3 generate a new population popu through the selection crossover and mutation operations step 4 determine whether the termination condition is satisfied if it is satisfied exit the loop and go to step 5 otherwise go back to step 2 step 5 output the optimal value of p o and bestj the optimized fin is illustrated in fig 15 and table 2 the fin area is 4 9 m2 the aspect ratio is 0 5 and the relative position of the fin shaft is 0 20 chord length 4 forced roll test using an actual ship 4 1 test description the optimal hydrofoil profile in fig 15 was installed in a 1000 ton patrol ship testing of the sailing vessel under forced roll was performed in the east sea of china photographs the experimental scene are shown in fig 16 to accurately measure the roll motion of the ship the central control unit ccu of the fin stabilizer was arranged on the fore and aft centerline two independent inertial measurement units imu were installed in the ccu ellipse made by sbg systems france and orientus made by advanced navigation australia roll angle roll angular velocity and angular acceleration were sent from each imu to a pc 104 embedded computer every 20 ms via an rs 232 interface for serial communication then the pc 104 computer used the roll information to calculate instructions for controlling the fin angle when the fin stabilizer was working in the anti roll mode the roll information was then sent from the embedded computer to a pc based data acquisition system via the can bus when the forced roll test was performed at a ship speed of 0 0 kn the ship floated near the dock and there were almost no waves when the forced roll test was performed at a ship speed of 3 0 kn and 18 0 kn the wave height was about 0 3 0 4 m in the experimental sea area which is less than the sea state code 2 and met the required experimental condition 4 2 experimental data results of the tests performed at a ship speed of 0 0 kn 3 0 kn and 18 0 kn are presented in fig 17 it can be seen from fig 17 that the optimal fin meets the technical requirement specifications the forced roll angle was more than 8 at zero speed roll angles were higher than 9 and 14 at a ship speed of 3 0 kn and 18 0 kn respectively as part of the all speed fin stabilizer study initial testing of the real ship was performed on a sister ship the old patrol ship is only equipped a conventional trapezoidal naca 0015 fin as shown in fig 18 therefore a simple update was performed in order to use the traditional fin stabilizer at zero low speed the modifications included an update of the control software and increasing the electrical limiting angle mechanical limiting angle and working angle basic parameters of the two fin stabilizers are listed in table 2 after the old fin had been updated the results of the forced roll test performed on the sister patrol ship to verify the optimization procedure described in section 3 are listed in table 3 considering the difference in fin area the fourth column of table 3 represents the virtual roll data obtained by enlarging the fin area 3 6 m2 of the old patrol ship to the fin area 4 9 m2 of the new patrol ship equipped with the optimization fin the maximum working angle of the traditional fins installed on the old patrol ship is 32 0 so there is no roll angle of 42 0 and 37 5 compared with the virtual fins on the old patrol ship the forced roll capacity of the optimized fin on the new patrol ship increased 47 7 at zero speed and 29 5 at a ship speed of 3 0 kn however due to the reduced aspect ratio the forced roll angle is reduced by 6 6 at 18 0 kn the forced roll angle of the old patrol ship at zero speed is shown in fig 19 based on the test results it can be concluded that the proposed method for optimizing the hydrofoil profile is effective 5 conclusions this paper presented a numerical model of the fin stabilization force at zero low velocity for the analysis a parallelogram fin was installed in real ship and numerical formulae were used to model the components of hydrodynamic force the proposed force equation was verified by experiment using the flat fin of a parallelogram hydrofoil the mechanism for generating the stabilization force will vary at different speeds and the discrepancies among the various force generating mechanisms lead to different requirements for the hydrofoil profile therefore the main parameters of the hydrofoil profile change under different mechanisms in order to optimize these competing parameters a range of profile parameters including fin shaft position sweep angle and aspect ratio were investigated furthermore an actual sailing test was performed in calm seas to verify the stabilization moment generated by the optimized fin based on the test results it can be concluded that the optimized fin meets the requirements of the fin stabilizer across a range of speeds moreover the proposed stabilization force model offers a suitable degree of accuracy to meet requirements for the design of engineering applications in future work we will conduct actual ship tests to reduce the roll motion to further verify the model of the stabilization force generated by fins at zero low speed and to analyze the effects of the

21634,fin stabilizers have been widely used to reduce the roll motion of ships at medium high velocities however the anti rolling efficiency of the traditional fin declines rapidly as the speed of the ship decreases to enable more efficient use of fin stabilizers across the whole speed range dynamics of fins at zero low velocity were derived then the proposed model was verified by experiment and the numerical results were compared with those of previous studies to obtain a balance between the performance of the hydrofoil profile at zero low and medium high speed we determined desirable ranges for various hydrofoil profile parameters including sweep angle aspect ratio and relative position of the shaft for non retractable fins finally tests were conducted using forced ship roll motion to

from the ocean and atmosphere while sailing in the ocean disturbances typically result in severe shaking especially those due to adverse weather conditions strong shaking can destabilize the ship and cause discomfort to the crew and passengers roll motion is one of the most critical of all six modes of motion kobylinski and kastner 2003 thus stabilizing equipment and control systems have been designed to dampen roll motion of marine craft the fin stabilizer is the most effective device for vessels sailing at medium high velocity crossland 2000 perez and goodwin 2008 perez and blanke 2012 most of the latest research on traditional fin stabilizers has focused on introducing new control strategies elgohary and awad 2018 fuat et al 2014 hinostroza et al 2015 and utilizing lift feedback to improve control sun et al 2018 previous research has improved the anti rolling effects of fin stabilizers at medium high speed however the lift of traditional fins is approximately proportional to the square of the ship speed fossen 2011 perez and blanke 2012 as a result traditional fin stabilizers are reported to have poor damping effects at low ship speeds and may even be ineffective at zero velocity most surveying vessels and engineering ships must frequently sail at low speeds to fulfil various tasks without a stabilization device low speeds can lead to large roll motion kianejad et al 2018 metin and omer 2018 therefore reducing roll motion at low speed is crucial for marine vessels anti roll tanks have been widely used for this purpose and work well across the entire speed range of ships reza and alistair 2005 the passive u tank which is the most widely used anti roll tank can reduce ship roll by more than 50 moaleji and greig 2007 alujevic et al 2019 whereas the anti rolling effect of traditional fin stabilizers can reach 90 at medium high speed sun et al 2018 therefore the fin stabilizer would be a superior stabilization device if the damping effects at zero low velocity were similar to those of the anti roll tank new technology has been proposed to enable the use of fin stabilizers at zero velocity or at anchor and was first used by the maritime research institute netherlands marin in wageningen dalligna 1999 2002 van wieringen 2002 in 2006 a zero speed fin stabilizer www kongsberg com maritime products was shown to be effective in sea trials of a large yacht my amevi harbin engineering university in china began to investigate the application of fin stabilizers at zero velocity in 2003 jin et al 2007 liang et al 2018 song et al 2015 wang et al 2009 and obtained satisfactory results from ship model tests liang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 today the main maritime companies around the world such as rolls royce naiad skf and quantum have launched their own zero speed or at anchor fin stabilizers however most companies have only published zero speed and medium high velocity test results on their websites without mention of their fins operating under more complicated low speed conditions since most traditional fin stabilizers work at speeds between 6 kn and the maximal ship speed for the purposes of our work low speed is defined as ranging from 0 kn to 6 kn the present study aimed to optimize fin stabilizer performance at low velocity the anti rolling effect of the fin stabilizer mainly depends on two factors the stabilizing force generated by the fins which is determined by the fin profile and the control system which regulates the fin kawazoe et al 1994 in this paper we propose a force model and hydrofoil profile of the fin the rest of this paper is organized as follows a numerical model of the fin at low velocity is presented in section 2 optimization of the hydrofoil profile is described in section 3 the results of forced roll tests with an optimized stabilizer are presented and discussed in section 4 finally the main conclusions are summarized in section 5 2 numerical modeling of the fin at low velocity a numerical model of the fin stabilizer at low velocity is first required in order to design the hydrofoil profile and control strategy 2 1 anti roll principles under different speeds when fluid flows across the fin surface at medium high speed the traditional fin will generate a lift as shown in fig 1 the amplitude of lift can be expressed as 1 f f h 1 2 ρ a u 2 c l α where ρ and a are the fluid density and the fin area respectively u represents the vessel velocity and c l α is the lift coefficient of the fin a fixed non zero angle of attack and flow speed provide a certain amount of lift however if the fin has a fixed angle this mechanism will no longer produce sufficient force to efficiently stabilize the ship when sailing at zero low speed fossen 2011 in contrast to the lift based mechanism the drag based mechanism inspired by the fast start manoevers used by fish and swimming ducks can generate far greater forces by flapping the fin rapidly at zero low speed fish 2004 jacob et al 2018 read et al 2003 when the left to right movement is transformed into an up and down movement as shown in fig 2 the force produced by quick flapping of the active fin can be used to stabilize the ship when sailing at zero low velocity compared to the lift based mechanism the drag based mechanism is more complicated especially when the vessel is sailing at low speed under low speed conditions it is difficult to derive an accurate hydrodynamic force model that describes the relationship between the force magnitude phase and the angle of attack of the fin a simplified approximation of the model that meets the requirements of fin engineering design applications would be more practical several researchers have identified three important components involved in generating the hydrodynamic force of the fin when the ship is at zero speed form drag added mass force and vortex force jin et al 2007 wang et al 2009 however form drag and added mass force are derived from the vortex force and makes it difficult to separate the vorticity force from the composite hydrodynamic force both in the theoretical analysis of real fluids and under experimental conditions cabrera and ruina 2006 buren et al 2018 therefore only two factors of integrated force i e form drag and added mass force are used in subsequent calculations 2 2 form drag of the fin the total resistance of the fin is mainly comprised of pressure resistance friction resistance and induced resistance of wake shedding lin et al 1999 when the fin rapidly flaps around its shaft and moves with the ship a boundary layer forms on the fin surface due to viscous friction gong et al 2019 since the flow speed relative to the fin surface changes some fluid or water particles accelerate while others decelerate thus the boundary layer undergoes a pressure gradient as a result flow inside the boundary layer acted upon by a resultant force if the resultant force exceeds a threshold value the flow can be reversed leading to separation of the boundary layer due to this separation a force much larger than viscous drag is induced by the pressure difference buren et al 2018 in fact there is an outside chordwise distribution in the central region of the two chordside vorticity cores accompanying the tailing edge vortex and chord side vortex the chordwise flow over the backside of the fin enlarges the trailing edge vortex kim and gharib 2011 the fin profile determines the separation and the vortex size as shown in fig 3 therefore the resistance amplitude is mainly influenced by the external shape of the fin the force generated by this pressure difference is called the form drag a fin with a parallelogram shape as shown in fig 4 can be used to conduct the force modeling advantages of the parallelogram fin will be discussed in section 3 if we place the parallelogram fin in the coordinate system i e xoy the root chord coincides with the horizontal x axis and the fin shaft coincides with the vertical y axis the fin rotates around the y axis at an angular velocity of α ω and moves forward along the x axis at a speed of u the drag force on an infinitesimal area d x d y on the fin surface can be defined as 2 d f f d 1 2 c d ρ v v d x d y where v ω x u sin α is the instantaneous speed of infinitesimal area d x d y and c d is the drag coefficient at the posterior part of the fin shaft the total form drag can be expressed as 3 f f d 1 1 2 c d ρ 0 e 0 4 d c 2 y tan α ls ω x u sin α ω x u sin α d x d y at the anterior part of the fin shaft the total form drag can be given as 4 f f d 2 1 2 c d ρ 0 e c 2 y tan α ls 0 ω x u sin α ω x u sin α d x d y since the form drag will have opposite signs on the two opposing sides of the fin shaft the total form drag can be defined as 5 f f d f f d 1 f f d 2 2 3 added mass force of the fin when a fin is rotated and translated a portion of the fluid is carried by and moves with the fin moreover the variation of angular speed and linear speed will change the velocity of the fluid around the fin the servosystem must not only accelerate or decelerate the fin but also the fluid surrounding the fin from the perspective of the servosystem an added moment must be overcome due to the additional mass of the fin when the concept of the additional mass is extended the added force f f m on the fin must be overcome two different theoretical methods can be used to analyze and calculate the added mass force the first method is based on potential flow theory corkery et al 2019 fernandez feria 2019 however it is difficult to obtain an analytical formula for an irregular fin profile when this method is used the second method is based on newton s second law of motion lin et al 1999 grift et al 2019 and can easily be used to obtain a numerical equation from the perspective of simplifying the hydrodynamic force model the second method is easier and more desirable from a traditional viewpoint the added mass force f f m can be described as follows 6 f f m m h v where m h is the added mass and v is acceleration however according to the experimental results of grift et al 2019 and the results of computational fluid dynamics cfd simulations of chao et al 2019 when the speed v changes from zero at a constant acceleration the added mass force is not constant in fact the added mass force increases with increasing speed i e v v t and arrives at the maximum value at the end of the acceleration process to simplify the analysis variation of f f m can be regarded as the change in added mass m h thus f f m is governed by two factors one is proportional to v and the other is related to v t then a more accurate version of added mass force f f m can be obtained as 7 f f m d m h d t v t t s 1 m h v where t s 1 is a small starting delay time of about 0 07 s grift et al 2019 and is negligible compared to the roll period of the ship the added mass m h of the fin can be inferred from yu 1945 8 m h ρ 0 788 e 2 4 d 2 e 2 4 d 2 0 0619 e 4 d t c 1 2 where t c is the fin thickness the corresponding acceleration force will not completely vanish when the fin stops accelerating because the past process produces a wake vortex in the flow the force will decrease from the maximum value of f f m to zero following a trend similar to the function 1 x 2 later on only form drag will exist considering the model of roll motion of the ship as a second order inertia function with a long period the effect of the force on rolling from the immediate disappearance to the gradual change in a short time is not distinguishable to simplify the modeling process the fast transient process after the acceleration can be neglected at the posterior part of the fin shaft the added mass force can be regarded as acting at the midpoint of the chord length 9 f f m 1 d m h d t 2 4 d c 2 e tan α ls 4 ω t m h 2 4 d c 2 e tan α ls 4 ω ω 0 at the anterior part of the fin shaft the added mass force is defined as 10 f f m 2 d m h d t 2 c 2 e tan α l s 4 ω t m h 2 c 2 e tan α l s 4 ω ω 0 considering the same function of the additional mass force on the two sides of the fin shaft the total force is expressed as 11 f f m f f m 1 f f m 2 2 4 stabilization force model and verification although the lift force component is very small the lift mechanism is also effective when the ship sails at low speed the stabilization force f f l of the ship is the vertical component of the total hydrodynamic force acting on the fin thus it can be obtained as 12 f f l f f d f f m cos α 0 5 ρ a u 2 c l α integrating f f l in eq 12 could lead to a very complex formula therefore the equation must be simplified since fins are arranged symmetrically on the port and starboard sides and move in opposite directions the line speed u sin α simultaneously applies an inverse action to the left and the right fins and the ship speed u changes slowly thus eq 12 can be rewritten as 13 f f l 1 2 c d ρ e ω ω 4 d c 2 3 c 2 3 3 e tan α ls 4 d c 2 2 c 2 2 2 e 2 tan α ls 2 4 d 2 c 2 3 e 3 tan α ls 3 6 cos α 2 d d m h d t ω t m h ω cos α 0 5 ρ a u 2 c l α given the sweep angle of the heading side α ls 0 and the ship velocity u 0 eq 13 is transformed into a hydrodynamic model of a rectanglar fin at zero speed then this model can be compared with the model of wang 2009 2010 as shown in fig 5 a 4 d 2 84 m e 1 60 m and c 2 0 57 m compared with the model of wang 2010 and the result calculated by fluent using eq 13 all the results are in good agreement ye 2015 proposed a low speed model with a constant ship velocity u 0 2 kn by fitting the results calculated using fluent here we also set u 0 2 kn in eq 13 and compared our model with that of ye as shown in fig 5b 4 d 2 83 m e 1 42 m and c 2 0 71 m in fig 5 the y axis presents the hydrodynamic force instead of the stabilization force since only the total hydrodynamic force is reported in the works of wang 2010 and ye 2015 it can be seen from fig 5 that the stabilization force model proposed here is effective and feasible to further validate eq 13 an experimental device was adopted as shown in fig 6 in the experiment a torque motor with an absolute encoder was driven by an elmo digital driver and a six component balance was used to measure the forces and moments acting on the fin the force and moment values were transferred to a personal computer pc via three advantech adam 3016 amplifiers only three moment components are needed to obtain the hydrodynamic force data of the fin the moment about the x axis is proportional to the normal force of the fin the moment about the y axis is proportional to the tangential force produced by the fin and the moment about the z axis is the torque required to drive the fin the parallelogram fin was used in the experiments it can be seen from fig 7 that differences between the results of the tank tests and the proposed force model are small therefore it can be concluded that the proposed model provides sufficient accuracy for engineering applications 3 hydrofoil profile optimization the force on the fin is related not only to the movement parameters but also to the fin profile parameters since the fin is used at both zero low velocity and at medium high velocity hydrodynamic force requirements must be met for the whole range of velocities and under different working modes to use the fin stabilizer at zero low speed and medium high speed the fin shape was optimized by combining the theoretical analysis with experimental data the stabilization force is sufficient at medium high velocity but insufficient at zero low velocity under most conditions therefore the model was optimized for a high lift to drag ratio at medium high speed and high stabilization force at zero low speed the fins used in the optimization are illustrated in fig 8 3 1 selection of basic hydrofoil profile the cross sectional shapes of the basic hydrofoil a non retractable fin stabilizer used as the fin were the naca fin and fishtail fin as well as the rectangular trapezoidal and parallelogram fins as shown in fig 9 the rectangular fin is widely used in theoretical studies owing to its simple structure however the rectangle was first excluded since a previous experimental study showed that the sweep angle of the leading edge is beneficial to lift lentink et al 2007 fig 10 depicts the experimental results of the naca sectional shape at different leading edge sweep angles α ls α ls 0 for the rectanglar fin at high speed there were no significant differences in lift to drag ratio with different α ls values however the lift coefficient increased when a hydrofoil with a characteristic α ls 0 was used moreover similar results were obtained in experiments using the fishtail fin at zero low speed the rectanglar fin is not ideal the maximum stabilization force of the parallelogram fin with a leading edge sweep angle of 12 increased by 35 26 compared to the rectanglar fin as shown in fig 11 in fig 11 the position of the fin shaft relative to the root chord is constant and the ratio is 1 5 at zero low velocity the tail vortex of the trapezoidal fin leaves the ship hull because the angle between the tail edge of the fin and the aft hull is more than 90 in contrast the tail vortex of the parallelogram fin moves toward the hull similar to the weis fogh mechanism the clap and fling mechanism discovered by weis fogh is used by some insects as part of their wing beat which generates greater lift than the lift calculated using steady state aerodynamics thereby increasing the stabilization force cooter and baker 1977 zhang et al 2002 ye 2015 calculated the effectiveness of the hull using fluent and suggested that the force can be increased by about 28 at 0 2 kn furthermore four fins with the same plane shape but different cross sectional shapes were tested and the results are illustrated in fig 12 fish t0018 and fish t0021 are fishtail fins with relative thicknesses of 18 and 21 respectively compared with the naca fin the maximum lift coefficient increased by about 25 71 at the rarely used fin angle of 30 whereas the lift to drag ratio increased by 90 79 at the frequently used fin angle of 10 it is clear that naca fins are a good choice when a non retractable fin with a small aspect ratio is required therefore in order to operate the fin stabilizer across the whole range of speeds the best fin and cross sectional shape are the parallelogram and naca respectively 3 2 optimization of fin shaft position at zero low speed the rear part of the fin shaft generates a stabilization force however the front part of the fin shaft reduces that stabilization force according to eq 13 thus moving the fin shaft towards the leading edge increases the instantaneous linear velocity of the tail part for the same angular speed consequently shifting the relative position of the fin shaft towards the leading edge is an effective way to increase the stabilization force when the ship is sailing at zero low velocity however at medium high speeds the chordwise hydrodynamic center is located at about 1 4 of the chord length the relative chordwise position of the center of pressure the ratio of the distance from the center of pressure to the forward edge to the average chord length can be approximated by the following formula lowry and polhamus 1957 wang 1998 14 c p c 0 25 c m c l α cos a c d h α sin a where c p c is the relative position of the hydrodynamic center of pressure c d h α is the drag coefficient at medium high velocity c m m ρ u 2 a 4 d 2 is the moment coefficient of the fin m is the driving moment eq 14 can be verified using experimental data for the naca fin presented in table 1 jin et al 2015 in order to reduce power consumption of the servosystem most fin shafts of traditional fins are designed to be located at about 1 4 chord length fig 13 shows the percentage increase of the stabilization force p f at zero speed and the percentage increase of the drive torque p t at a cruise speed of 18 kn for a fin angle of 10 relative to the normal fin when the relative position of the fin shaft changes from 1 4 to 1 7 chord length it can be seen from fig 13 that the slope of p t is greater than the slope of p f which indicates that moving the fin shaft closer to the leading edge will quickly increase power consumption at high speed when the power consumption of the servosystem and the mechanical strength of the fin are both taken into account a relative position of the fin shaft of between 1 5 to 1 6 chord length is recommended 3 3 optimization of the sweep angle from eq 13 it can be inferred that when the relative position of the fin shaft is consistently set as the average chord length the stabilization force does not change significantly as the sweep angle changes if the relative position of the fin shaft is set as the root chord which is equivalent to moving the position of the fin shaft towards the leading edge both the speed of the aft part of the fin and the stabilization force will increase arastehfar et al 2019 measured the average thrust of the fin at different sweep angles 0 10 20 30 and 40 and concluded that although sweep angles of 10 and 20 will slightly affect the fin thrust the effect is not remarkable lentink et al 2007 conducted wind tunnel experiments to investigate the impact of varying the sweep angle from 5 to 50 their results confirmed that a small sweep angle offers superior performance at low speed whereas a large sweep angle is more favorable at high speed in fact the low speed of the airfoil is equivalent to the medium high speed of the hydrofoil indicating that a sweep angle of less than 20 performs better similar conclusions can be obtained from our experimental results as shown in fig 10 thus based on the above analyses and fig 8 a sweep angle between 10 and 20 is recommended 3 4 optimization of aspect ratio at zero low velocities when the relative position of the fin shaft and the fin area are fixed reducing the aspect ratio will increase the speed of the tail part effectively increasing the stabilization force nonetheless at medium high speeds a decrease in the aspect ratio reduces the lift coefficient and increases the non linearity of the lift coefficient makoto et al 2016 mizoguchi and itoh 2013 shields and mohseni 2013 furthermore decreasing the aspect ratio will lead to a larger fin angle under the same wave disturbance resulting in a larger flow and higher power requirements of the hydrodynamic servosystem which in turn aggravates mechanical wear thus the aspect ratio of the non retractable fin should lie within the range of 0 7 1 0 for conventional applications the shape of the ship s hull and the desired anti rolling effects are the main factors considered in the design of the aspect ratio and fin area to simplify the selection of a suitable aspect ratio we assume that 100 of lift generated by the fins can be used to stabilize the ship the anti rolling requirement can be transformed into the forced roll requirement that is the roll indices that cause ship roll via active rotation of the fins when the ship sails in calm seas when the fins work in the forced roll mode fossen 2011 the rolling equation can be expressed as 15 i x δ i x φ 2 n u φ d h φ k c where φ is the roll angle of the ship i x δ i x represents the inertia moment of the roll 2 n u is the damping coefficient caused by the roll motion of the vessel d denotes the displacement weight of the vessel and h is the metacentric height using the laplace transform eq 15 can be transformed into 16 φ s 2 f f g z i x δ i x s 2 2 ω ϕ n u s ω ϕ 2 where ω φ d h i x δ i x is the harmonic roll frequency of the ship n u n u ω φ i x δ i x represents the dimensionless damping coefficient and g z is the moment arm at zero low speed we obtain 17 φ s 2 f f l g z i x δ i x s 2 2 ω ϕ n u s ω ϕ 2 where f f l is the stabilization force at zero low speed calculated from eq 13 at medium high velocities we obtain 18 φ s 2 f f h g z i x δ i x s 2 2 ω ϕ n u s ω ϕ 2 where f f h is the stabilization force at medium high speed calculated from eq 1 the forced roll angles in different work modes are affected by the fin area and its aspect ratio when the maximum forced roll angle fin area and ship speed are constant φ s in eq 18 is affected by c l α in eq 1 the relationship between lift coefficient c l α and aspect ratio c l α can be described as lowry and polhamus 1957 wang 1998 19 c l α a 0 α λ cos α l s λ 2 cos 4 α l s 4 57 3 a 0 π c d c λ α 57 3 2 assuming the required maximum roll angle is 13 and the ship sails at 18 0 kn which is the typical cruising speed of a warship the variation of fin area with aspect ratio is illustrated in fig 14 when the maximum forced roll angle fin area and ship speed are constant φ s in eq 17 is affected by force f f l in eq 13 and f f l will increase with decreasing aspect ratio assuming the maximum required roll angle is 7 and the ship sails at 0 0 kn the variation of fin area with aspect ratio is also shown in fig 14 to meet the required forced roll angle the two curves intersect at an aspect ratio of about 0 56 taking into account the different technical requirements of ships an aspect ratio in the range of 0 4 0 6 is recommended 3 5 example optimization of hydrofoil profile values of the above parameters must be defined according to the specific requirements of the ship taking a 1000 ton patrol ship as an example for which the forced roll angle of the ship is provided in the technical specifications the following conditions were defined 1 the amplitude of the fin angle is 42 in the resonant period of movement and the roll angle of the ship is not smaller than 7 when the ship is moored or floating unpowered 2 the amplitude of the fin angle is 18 in the period of harmonic roll motion and the roll angle of the ship is not less than 13 when the ship sails at a speed of 18 kn to meet the above requirements minimizing the fin area and driving moment are taken as the optimization objectives the objective function can be expressed as 20 g a m m s t φ m 7 u 0 0 kn φ m 13 u 18 0 kn where m m is the maximum moment in one rotation period and φ m is the maximum forced roll angle the real coded genetic algorithm ga was introduced to optimize the objective function g as an efficient and simple optimization algorithm the ga has been widely used in many fields shah and singh 2019 song et al 2019 by overcoming the hamming cliff problem the real coded ga achieves high accuracy when solving the objective function to simplify the optimization process the sweep angle α ls was fixed at 13 according to our previous experience and the variable p o a r f λ was optimized the calculation process is as follows step 1 initialize the population size popsize maximum optimization number maxgens cross probability proxover mutation probability promutation lower bound of p o aclobound and upper bound of p o acupbound the initial population popu is randomly generated within the upper and lower bounds let the loop variable k be zero step 2 calculate the fitness of the chromosome and record the best individual bestj step 3 generate a new population popu through the selection crossover and mutation operations step 4 determine whether the termination condition is satisfied if it is satisfied exit the loop and go to step 5 otherwise go back to step 2 step 5 output the optimal value of p o and bestj the optimized fin is illustrated in fig 15 and table 2 the fin area is 4 9 m2 the aspect ratio is 0 5 and the relative position of the fin shaft is 0 20 chord length 4 forced roll test using an actual ship 4 1 test description the optimal hydrofoil profile in fig 15 was installed in a 1000 ton patrol ship testing of the sailing vessel under forced roll was performed in the east sea of china photographs the experimental scene are shown in fig 16 to accurately measure the roll motion of the ship the central control unit ccu of the fin stabilizer was arranged on the fore and aft centerline two independent inertial measurement units imu were installed in the ccu ellipse made by sbg systems france and orientus made by advanced navigation australia roll angle roll angular velocity and angular acceleration were sent from each imu to a pc 104 embedded computer every 20 ms via an rs 232 interface for serial communication then the pc 104 computer used the roll information to calculate instructions for controlling the fin angle when the fin stabilizer was working in the anti roll mode the roll information was then sent from the embedded computer to a pc based data acquisition system via the can bus when the forced roll test was performed at a ship speed of 0 0 kn the ship floated near the dock and there were almost no waves when the forced roll test was performed at a ship speed of 3 0 kn and 18 0 kn the wave height was about 0 3 0 4 m in the experimental sea area which is less than the sea state code 2 and met the required experimental condition 4 2 experimental data results of the tests performed at a ship speed of 0 0 kn 3 0 kn and 18 0 kn are presented in fig 17 it can be seen from fig 17 that the optimal fin meets the technical requirement specifications the forced roll angle was more than 8 at zero speed roll angles were higher than 9 and 14 at a ship speed of 3 0 kn and 18 0 kn respectively as part of the all speed fin stabilizer study initial testing of the real ship was performed on a sister ship the old patrol ship is only equipped a conventional trapezoidal naca 0015 fin as shown in fig 18 therefore a simple update was performed in order to use the traditional fin stabilizer at zero low speed the modifications included an update of the control software and increasing the electrical limiting angle mechanical limiting angle and working angle basic parameters of the two fin stabilizers are listed in table 2 after the old fin had been updated the results of the forced roll test performed on the sister patrol ship to verify the optimization procedure described in section 3 are listed in table 3 considering the difference in fin area the fourth column of table 3 represents the virtual roll data obtained by enlarging the fin area 3 6 m2 of the old patrol ship to the fin area 4 9 m2 of the new patrol ship equipped with the optimization fin the maximum working angle of the traditional fins installed on the old patrol ship is 32 0 so there is no roll angle of 42 0 and 37 5 compared with the virtual fins on the old patrol ship the forced roll capacity of the optimized fin on the new patrol ship increased 47 7 at zero speed and 29 5 at a ship speed of 3 0 kn however due to the reduced aspect ratio the forced roll angle is reduced by 6 6 at 18 0 kn the forced roll angle of the old patrol ship at zero speed is shown in fig 19 based on the test results it can be concluded that the proposed method for optimizing the hydrofoil profile is effective 5 conclusions this paper presented a numerical model of the fin stabilization force at zero low velocity for the analysis a parallelogram fin was installed in real ship and numerical formulae were used to model the components of hydrodynamic force the proposed force equation was verified by experiment using the flat fin of a parallelogram hydrofoil the mechanism for generating the stabilization force will vary at different speeds and the discrepancies among the various force generating mechanisms lead to different requirements for the hydrofoil profile therefore the main parameters of the hydrofoil profile change under different mechanisms in order to optimize these competing parameters a range of profile parameters including fin shaft position sweep angle and aspect ratio were investigated furthermore an actual sailing test was performed in calm seas to verify the stabilization moment generated by the optimized fin based on the test results it can be concluded that the optimized fin meets the requirements of the fin stabilizer across a range of speeds moreover the proposed stabilization force model offers a suitable degree of accuracy to meet requirements for the design of engineering applications in future work we will conduct actual ship tests to reduce the roll motion to further verify the model of the stabilization force generated by fins at zero low speed and to analyze the effects of the optimized hydrofoil profile on roll damping across a wider range of velocities credit authorship contribution statement jiguang song conceptualization methodology software writing original draft peng
