18105,biofouling is ubiquitous in reclaimed water distribution systems and causes various industrial economic and health issues this paper investigated the anti biofouling efficacy of electromagnetic fields emfs for agricultural emitters used for two types of reclaimed water 16s rrna gene sequencing and x ray diffraction were applied to determine the microbial communities and mineral compositions in biofilms the obtained results revealed that emf treatment significantly changed the bacterial communities and reduced their diversities in biofilm by affecting water quality parameters network analysis results indicated that emfs were detrimental to the co occurrence patterns of mutualistic relationships among bacterial species destroyed the connectivity and complexity of the networks and inhibited biofilm formation decreased total biomass and extracellular polymeric substance eps content emf treatment could also decrease the deposition of mineral precipitates reducing the carbonate and silicate content in biofilm the decrease of eps content appeared to reduce biofilm induced mineral crystallization while the ion precipitations accelerated by emfs caused an erosive effect on biofilm the results demonstrated that emf treatment is an effective chemical free and anti biofouling treatment method with great potential for biofouling control in reclaimed water distribution systems graphical abstract image 1 keywords electromagnetic field biofouling control biofilm microbial community mineral precipitation 1 introduction in correlation with the increases in water shortage population growth and urbanization the demand and amount of reclaimed water rw has grown over time for example china the largest user of rw yi et al 2011 utilized more than 70 109 m3 rw in 2018 ministry of water resources website 2019 rw could be applicable to meet water demands in various fields including agricultural irrigation urban miscellaneous uses groundwater replenishment and industrial utilizations yi et al 2011 however since various microorganisms and soluble salts are present in rw pedrero et al 2010 biofouling inevitably appears in rw distribution systems song et al 2019b which can significantly alter solid liquid interface in the systems barton et al 2008 typically increasing boundary shear stress and associated flow resistance walker et al 2013 thus it drastically impedes the systems hydraulic efficiency cowle et al 2019 moreover biofouling is known to cause odor and health problems percival and walker 1999 pipeline corrosion wang et al 2012 and the blockage of emitters zhou et al 2013 therefore the biofouling formation mechanisms and controlling strategies have always been among the most difficult topics need to be solved to date biofouling control in rw distribution systems has mainly been achieved by disinfection with strong chemicals song et al 2019b tin et al 2017 however the application of chemical disinfectants is becoming more restricted because of its environmental risks high cost and the long term bacterial resistance to disinfectants mah and o toole 2001 mercier et al 2016 thus alternative chemical free strategies for controlling biofouling are in great demand recently the electromagnetic magnetic field emf treatment has attracted extensive interest for scaling and or biofouling control chibowski and szcześ 2018 mercier et al 2016 piyadasa et al 2017 due to its environmental friendliness low cost low energy consumption and easy to operate characteristics esmaeilnezhad et al 2017 it was reported that emfs act on the ions dissolved in water like calcium ion and bicarbonate radical and could suppress calcium carbonate deposition scaling chibowski and szcześ 2018 silva et al 2015 also emf treatment has been assessed on controlling microbial cells and the results implied that emfs may affect the growth rate viability adhesion and metabolic activity of microorganisms bayır et al 2015 huwiler et al 2012 piyadasa et al 2018 trueba et al 2014 as biofilms commonly consist of bacteria and minerals e g carbonate sulfate it can be inferred that emfs may have various impacts on biofilm formation with rw trueba et al 2015 reported that emfs with 15 mt intensity weakened the growth of biofilm and reduced its adhesion capacity in a heat exchanger condenser gérard et al 2015 also indicated that the formation of biofilm under a very low frequency emf treatment was two times lower than unexposed biofilm however other studies reported that low intensity and very low frequency emfs did not have significant impacts on biofilms in water distribution systems di campli et al 2010 gosselin et al 2018 the varying responses of biofilm to emfs highlight the need for further research in addition to the direct impact of emf on biofilm formation as emfs make impacts on both biofilm growth and mineral crystallization there may be interactions between biofilms and mineral precipitates under emf treatment among the few available studies trueba et al 2014 indicated that ionic precipitations induced by emfs could decrease the binding ability of extracellular polymeric substances eps and thus reduce the biofilm formation in contrast gosselin et al 2018 reported that emf treatment did not significantly affect biofilms although it was able to modify caco3 crystallization despite these research advances the effects of emfs on biofilm mineral precipitation and their interactions are still elusive besides the formation of biofilm is closely related to bacterial communities such as their diversity composition and co occurrence patterns duran pinedo et al 2011 lequette et al 2019 rochex et al 2008 however the effects of emfs on the interactions among bacteria and their community structures in biofilms have not been fully understood yet although understanding emf impacts on bacterial communities might uncover the potential anti biofouling mechanisms of emfs for rw distribution systems accordingly the objectives of this study were to i determine whether or not emfs could effectively control the biofouling in rw distribution systems ii clarify the effects of emfs on bacterial communities and mineral precipitation and iii elucidate the interactions between biofilm and mineral precipitates and the potential anti biofouling mechanisms of emfs herein biofilm was cultured inside emitters in an agricultural rw conveyance system 16s rrna gene sequencing x ray diffraction xrd and biofilm component analyses were conducted to determine the microbial communities viable and total bacterial biomass eps content and mineral composition in biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental system the testing system was an in house designed biofilm cultivation experimental platform with emitters a device used for conveying pressurized water flow attached to an agricultural drip irrigation system fig 1 the platform had four units each unit built with four irrigation laterals and each lateral contained 180 identical emitters the structural parameters of the labyrinth flow path of emitter are provided in table s1 in addition the flow condition inside labyrinth path contained the mainstream area and the low speed vortex region feng et al 2018 two types of reclaimed water treated by a sequencing batch aeration wastewater recycling system sbwl and a cyclic activated sludge system cass technology were used in the study and the treated water quality results are summarized in table s2 the water was filtered by a disc filter 106 μm pore size and then flowed into the branch pipe made from polyvinyl chloride the magnetized water was generated using a magnetizer manufacture yishui china type md 63 with coils twined around branch pipes the strength of emfs was in a range of 1 200 mt with an intensity of 1 a and a frequency of 1 10 khz two types of water treatment systems with and without emf treatments were set up sbwl m m indicates with emfs sbwl control group without emfs cass m and cass control group without emfs an intermittent run mode was applied for the systems 14 h each day 7 00 a m 9 00 p m at the operating pressure of 0 1 mpa 2 2 evaluation parameters of emitter performance over time the growth of biofilms gradually clogged the emitters thus to evaluate the performance of the emitters for rw the average discharge variation rate dra and christiansen of uniformity cu were determined supplementary materials section 1 2 2 3 biofilm extraction a previous study song et al 2019b observed that cu was lower than 80 after biofilms were cultivated for about 800 h which displayed that the drip irrigation laterals could not be used based on the china national standard 2009 therefore three sampling events at 260 h 520 h and 780 h of system operation were selected for the study at each sampling time one drip lateral was selected for emitter sampling the emitters along a lateral were numbered from 1 to 180 in direction of water flow hereafter single lateral was divided in six groups of emitters emitters 1st 30th 31st 60th 61st 90th 91st 120th 121th 150th and 151th 180th during each sampling event six replicated samples were collected from each aforementioned group of emitters biofilm in narrow paths of emitters were removed gently using an aseptic brush the obtained biofilms from each group of emitters were mixed and stored in 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 80 c 2 4 biofilm testing 2 4 1 high throughput sequencing and data analyses e z n a soil kits omega bio tek norcross ga u s were used to extract dna from biofilms and the obtained dna was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis with 1 gel concentration the concentration of extracted dna from samples was kept higher than 20 ng ml for further detection and analysis the v3 v4 variable regions of 16s rrna were amplified using universal bacterial primers 338f 5 actcctacgggaggcagcag 3 and 806r 5 ggactachvgggtwtctaat 3 after electrophoresis with 2 agarose gel pcr products were mixed in equidensity ratios and purified with qiagen gel extraction kit qiagen germany sequencing libraries were generated using ion plus fragment library kit 48 rxns kit thermofisher usa following the manufacturer protocol the libraries were sequenced using the ions5tmxl platform novogene co ltd beijing china cutadapt v1 9 1 http cutadapt readthedocs io en stable martin 2011 was used to trim the high throughput sequences to obtain raw sequence reads the chimeras in the raw reads were removed using vsearch rognes et al 2016 https github com torognes vsearch and then the high quality data clean sequence reads could be obtained uparse pipeline version 7 1 was used to cluster the operational taxonomic units otus at 97 identity based on the clean sequence reads across all treatments ribosomal database project rdp wang et al 2007 was applied to classify the bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences the richness index observed otu numbers and shannon index were calculated using mothur software version v 1 30 1 schloss et al 2009 2 4 2 construction and analysis of bacterial networks network analysis is a useful method for ascertaining the co occurrence patterns among bacteria an online molecular ecological network analysis mena http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena login cgi kong et al 2019 was used to construct the bacterial networks for the four treatments sbwl m sbwl cass m and cass each treatment had 18 replicates with three periods in brief the standardized relative abundances deng et al 2012 of otus were uploaded to mena platform fifteen replicates based on the similarities in each treatment were kept and used to obtain the spearman rank correlation matrix two tailed p 0 05 without taking the logarithm all the networks were constructed using the same threshold and visualized by cytoscape 3 7 0 software evaluation methods of the networks and topological roles of otus were described in supplementary materials section 1 3 2 4 3 the content of viable bacterial biomass eps and total biofilm biomass the dry weight dw of biofilms was used to determine the total biofilm biomass as 16s rrna gene sequencing could only provide the relative abundance of species this study measured the content of phospholipid fatty acids plfas to quantify viable bacterial biomass in biofilms the content of plfas eps and dw testing methods can be found elsewhere zhou et al 2013 2 4 4 mineral components of biofilms biofilm samples were dried using a freeze dryer manufacture kuansons china type fd a10n the obtained solid substances were mixed uniformly and determined by an x ray diffractometer manufacture bruker germany type d8 advance operating condition 40 kv voltage and 40 ma electric current to acquire the diffraction spectrums and the composition of mineral precipitates except for the crystalline minerals others were defined as non crystalline materials ncms 2 5 statistical analysis wilcoxon rank sum test was used to screen the otus with a significant difference in abundance between emf treatment and control groups p adjust 0 05 and bh method benjamini and hochberg 1995 was applied to control the false discovery rate wilcoxon rank sum test was also applied to analyze the significances of diversity indexes between different treatments via r software version 3 5 0 weighted principal coordinate analyses pcoa were performed to show the differences among the bacterial communities intergroup differences were conducted by analysis of similarity anosim and weighted analysis of molecular variance amova via the vegan package of r software version 3 5 0 spearman analysis artusi et al 2002 was selected to analyze the correlation between environmental factors and bacterial communities 3 results 3 1 bacterial community composition and differential microflora under emf treatment a total of 5 636 520 clean reads were detected after high throughput sequencing of 72 biofilm samples 6 466 otus were classified at a 97 similarity level the rarefaction curves fig s1 of all treatments were asymptotic and the good s coverage were higher than 0 99 table s3 indicating that the sequence depths were sufficient a total of 44 phyla were identified and they were further classified to 58 classes 137 orders 284 families and 795 genera proteobacteria 33 3 69 0 was the most dominant phylum across different treatments followed by firmicutes 0 8 45 0 bacteroidetes 6 9 23 8 cyanobacteria 0 6 11 2 and actinobacteria 2 8 5 5 fig 2 a these five phyla accounted for more than 86 4 of the biofilm species after emf treatment the relative abundance of proteobacteria and firmicutes showed increasing and decreasing trends taxonomic dendrogram of the detected bacterial communities at 260 h is shown in fig 2b dendrograms at 520 h and 780 h can be seen in fig s2 results indicated that 506 840 otus relative abundance differed significantly p 0 05 fig 2b and fig s2 red note between emf and control samples the differential otus were mainly distributed in proteobacteria 42 3 47 1 bacteroidetes 9 7 15 6 planctomycetes 5 6 8 9 actinobacteria 5 3 7 5 firmicutes 3 2 6 7 and verrucomicrobia 3 9 5 3 the dominant differential species in abundance top five table s4 were otu 7 rhodobacteraceae otu 26 janthinobacterium otu 87 pseudomonas and otu 5296 rhodobacteraceae otu 6222 pseudomonas etc 3 2 effect of emf treatment on the diversities of bacterial communities the variations of the richness index observed otu number and shannon index are shown in fig 3 a the figure shows that emf treatment significantly p 0 05 table s5 reduced the community diversity the richness index and shannon index decreased by 6 4 12 2 and 3 8 11 0 pcoa fig 3b was applied to define the dissimilarities among different treatments the bacterial communities of biofilm samples in emf groups and control groups were distinctly separated anosim fig s3 and amova table s6 results further confirmed that the beta diversity of emf treatment groups was significantly p 0 01 different from control groups moreover there were more significant differences between the two kinds of reclaimed water which were drastically separated on the first axis of pcoa besides the second axis of pcoa can notably describe the results of different operation periods it was found that emfs changed the properties of water fig s4 the electroconductibility ec and the surface tension st of the two kinds of rw decreased by 6 8 7 2 and 19 7 27 8 while the dissolved oxygen content doc and oxidation reduction potential orp increased by 3 8 5 8 and 71 2 97 3 and the ph of the solution increased 0 09 0 10 to further explore the correlation between environmental variables and bacterial communities spearman analysis was conducted and results show that the five changed water parameters had obvious correlations with the majority of bacteria fig 4 for example the five dominant phyla proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes cyanobacteria and actinobacteria had significant correlations p 0 05 with ph ec st and orp indicating that emf treatment changed the bacterial communities by affecting the water quality parameters 3 3 molecular ecological networks of bacterial community the phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens were constructed to identify the co occurrence patterns among bacteria and the properties of the networks are shown in table 1 the results show that the connectivity of the four networks conform to the power law model 0 81 r 2 of power law 0 97 which represents that most bacteria were almost unrelated to other bacteria while few bacteria had many connections kong et al 2019 the average connectivity in emf treated groups sbwl m 2 90 cass m 3 24 were lower than the control groups sbwl 4 37 cass 5 38 and the network size became smaller with emfs indicating that the emfs reduced the connectivity and complexity of the networks the average geodesic distances avggd in the pmens were 4 3 7 1 which implies that the nodes were closely connected with each other and the four networks had small world properties kong et al 2019 moreover the avggd with emfs were higher compared to control groups implying that emfs decreased interactions among species peura et al 2015 the modularity of the empirical networks in the four treatments were higher than that of the respective random networks which suggests that all networks were modular furthermore there were striking differences among the empirical networks for the average clustering coefficient average path distance and modularity the overall pmens were visualized in fig 5 a d there were 9 8 8 and 6 modules nodes number was higher than 6 for sbwl m sbwl cass m and cass groups respectively other connections were relatively small 2 6 nodes a total of 289 406 311 and 386 nodes were obtained and the number of connections were 420 886 503 and 877 in the four treatments the results show that emf treatment could drastically reduce the number of nodes and connections of the networks the otus with the largest links in the four treatments were rhodobacteraceae otu 5296 gammaproteobacteria otu 368 hirschia otu 78 and sphingomonadaceae otu 921 and they all belong to proteobacteria the buck of the links between the otus were positive blue line and account for 69 5 57 4 86 3 and 78 9 in the four treatments after the implementation of emf treatment the number of positive links decreased by 37 3 42 6 the topological roles of the otus were described in zi pi plots fig 5e and f most of the otus 98 0 were peripherals and 66 7 86 2 of the peripherals only had connections in their individual modules i e pi 0 as for sbwl m sbwl cass m and cass treatments about 1 4 7 6 1 3 and 2 3 of the otus were generalists table s7 including 0 7 2 0 1 0 and 1 3 that were module hubs and 0 7 5 7 0 3 and 1 0 that were connectors the generalist otus were changed after emf treatment and the number of generalist otus decreased by 55 6 87 1 besides network hubs did not appear in all networks 3 4 characteristics of biofilm components and the performance of the emitters the characteristic components of biofilms were shown in fig 6 after emf treatment the content of plfas fig 6a eps fig 6b and ncms fig 6c decreased by 30 2 60 5 23 5 40 4 and 31 9 63 1 respectively the mineral components of biofilms inside emitters mainly included quartz carbonate calcite aragonite monohydrocalcite and dolomite and silicate muscovite feldspar and chlorite fig s5 in general calcite 21 2 58 6 was the most dominant mineral precipitate across different treatments followed by muscovite 20 8 33 4 aragonite 0 5 27 9 quartz 7 0 19 7 and feldspar 2 3 17 0 compared to control groups quartz content fig 6d in emf groups decreased by 15 3 26 9 the control effects of emfs on carbonate fig 6e and silicate fig 6f were better than those of quartz and the content of carbonate and silicate drastically decreased by 20 7 49 3 and 19 1 41 5 besides it was found that emf treatment inhibited the precipitation of calcite while promoted the deposition of aragonite fig s6 and effectively reduced the content of muscovite and feldspar finally the total content of minerals decreased by 22 4 41 9 the reduction of characteristic biofilm components plfas eps and minerals in emf groups led to decreased biofilm biomass inside the emitters by 35 1 53 8 fig s7a as a result emf treatment effectively maintained the performance of emitters increasing the dra and cu by 41 6 43 2 fig s7b and 35 3 38 2 fig s7c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of emfs on bacterial communities this paper demonstrated that emf is a chemical free and efficient treatment in mitigating biofouling in the rw distribution systems emfs significantly changed the bacterial community of biofilm and reduced the content of the characteristic biofilm components some researchers indicated that the anti biofouling effect of emfs was attributed to the inhibition of bacterial growth bayır et al 2015 gérard et al 2015 our study also showed that bacterial counts were reduced after emf treatment fig s8 one possible explanation is the electroporation of bacterial membranes i e cytoplasmic membrane the application of emfs can induce a voltage difference across the bacterial membrane beveridge et al 2002 if the voltage exceeds the threshold for electroporation generally assumed about 1 v the transmembrane pores can be opened leading to an ion imbalance and nonreversible cell inactivation garcía et al 2003 in fact a laboratory study had shown that 15 min of continuous treatment reduced the number of bacteria effectively duda et al 2011 moreover the reported sterilizing effect of emfs varies greatly as it is tightly related to the strength and frequency of the magnetic field pipeline materials flow rate etc piyadasa et al 2017 which may lead to greatly varying anti biofilm capacity of emfs gérard et al 2015 gosselin et al 2018 trueba et al 2015 in this study the germicidal rate was close to 50 under 24 h of emf treatment indicating that emfs could mitigate the formation of biofilm to a certain extent and cause the changes in bacterial community in biofilm except for the sterilization effect our results also demonstrated that emfs changed the bacterial communities by affecting water quality parameters fig 4 however it was difficult to differentiate which effect played a more significant role for bacterial community changes future studies are needed to elucidate the emf effects on bacterial biofilm communities and functions network analysis for the emf treated groups and control groups clearly demonstrates the impacts of emfs on the co occurrence patterns of bacteria in biofilms network established on random matrices theory is more sturdy and could precisely reveal the interactions between microorganisms in complex biological environments zhou et al 2011 the obtained results revealed that the network sizes the total nodes and the bacterial connections particularly the positive links 292 509 434 and 692 in sbwl m sbwl cass m cass respectively were significantly decreased under emf treatment which was in accordance with the variations of diversities shannon indexes and richness indexes generally the complexities of a network always have a positive correlation with the stabilization of a community liang et al 2016 fig 5 shows that the networks in control groups were more complex than those of emf groups highlighting that emf treatment affected the co occurrence pattern of bacterial community on the other hand positive links generally indicate symbiotic relationships co construction of biofilms or exchange of metabolites between microorganisms layeghifard et al 2017 negative links imply predation relationships or competitions under environmental stress deng et al 2016 thus emfs appeared to break the reciprocal interactions between bacteria moreover emf treatment reduced the average connectivities while it increased the average geodesic distances of networks implying that emfs suppressed the transfer efficiency of energy matter and information among bacteria peura et al 2015 zhou et al 2011 in fact multiple interspecies interactions can affect biofilm formation and development simões et al 2010 burmølle et al 2006 found that symbiotic effects among multiple bacterial species promoted biofilm biomass production and de la fuente et al 2013 described that antagonistic interactions among bacterial species inhibited biofilm formation therefore it can be inferred that emf treatment could disrupt the stability of the community networks and the symbiotic relationships of bacteria which in turn affected the content of plfas and eps and reduced biofilm formation 4 2 effect of emfs on mineral precipitation carbonate and silicate precipitations were easily formed inside the flow path of emitters which might be because the outlet of an emitter was in contact with air the concentrations of soluble ions would increase with the water evaporation while the system was not in operation it was found that the content of carbonate in biofilm drastically decreased with the application of emfs fig 6e one explanation is that the magnetic field mf might prevent inhibit the carbonate precipitation within biofilms it is known that mf could decompose water clusters into monomers or smaller clusters and reduce the hydrogen bond force and intermolecular force between water molecules chibowski and szcześ 2018 thereby the surface tension of water was reduced fig s4 while the activity of water increased the changes in the physicochemical properties of water could accelerate the formation of hydrated amorphous calcium carbonate hacc on the other hand mf induces faster proton transfer from bicarbonate ions to water madsen 2004 causing an increase of carbonate ions and promoting carbonate precipitation consequently carbonates were more likely precipitated in water other than in biofilm moreover we found that mf inhibited the sedimentation of calcite while promoted the deposition of aragonite figs s6a b mainly because mf accelerated the dehydration process of hacc dehydration was completed before aragonites were converted to calcite similar to the previous reports cefalas et al 2010 chang and tai 2010 besides the content of aragonite was still lower than that of calcite in this study which might be due to the relatively weak adhesion force between aragonite and the surfaces of emitters as aragonite was easily washed away by the turbulence inside the emitters the silicates inside the emitters mainly consisted of muscovite feldspar and a small amount of chlorite figs s6d f despite the physical depositions silicates also could be formed by chemical reactions as the ph of water is one of the main factors affecting the formation of silica scale silicate precipitation would be restrained with the increase of ph when ph is ranged between 7 and 13 neofotistou and demadis 2004 this study found that emf treatment increased the ph of the reclaimed water fig s4 and therefore could inhibit the formation of silica scale to a certain extent on the other hand calcium carbonate always provides nucleation sites for the formation of silicate once calcium carbonate is formed silicon ions will be adsorbed on the surface of calcium carbonate and aggregate to form a mixed scale with carbonate scale umar and saaid 2013 therefore emf treatment inhibited the carbonate precipitation and indirectly decreased the silicate nucleation sites which further led to the decrease of silicate content moreover emf treatment reduced the deposition of quartz this may be attributed to the reduced eps content responsible for the decreased particle capture efficiency nonetheless the controlling effect of emf on quartz was lower than carbonate and silicate which might be due to stable physicochemical properties of quartz 4 3 anti biofouling mechanisms of emfs and engineering implications as emfs can directly impact both bacteria activity and mineral precipitations biofilm formation can be affected by both processes interestingly there was a significantly p 0 01 positive correlation between mineral content and eps content fig s9 which indicates that interactions might exist between biofilms and mineral precipitates under emf treatment in fact the formation of mineral precipitates is always influenced by biofilm yang et al 2010 as microbial secretions i e eps may enhance the retention of inorganic ions herzberg and elimelech 2008 and preexisting biofilm can induce mineral crystallization thompson et al 2012 moreover biofilm can inhibit the diffusion of the accumulated solutes herzberg and elimelech 2008 thus emf drastically decreased the content of plfas and eps reducing the biomineralization capacity of biofilm and inhibiting the formation of mineral deposits as for the effects of minerals on biofilm field emission scanning electron microscopy images fig s10 showed that the surface roughness of biofilm in the emf groups was higher than that of the control groups this was mainly due to emfs which could crystallize the dissolved ions e g co3 2 ca2 into small particles that could be easily deposited on biofilms trueba et al 2015 however this kind of fine particle scale was not firmly adhered to the flow paths and could easily be rinsed at a low speed water flow i e 1 m s 1 shahryari and pakshir 2008 causing an erosion effect on the biofilms that increased its surface roughness and lead to its detachment moreover the fine precipitates could decrease the molecular bonding of eps resulting in the destruction of the biofilms eguía et al 2008 these combined effects may reduce the contents of biofilm biomass and eps in general the regulatory path of emfs on the biofouling of emitters are summarized in fig s11 on one hand emf treatment directly inactivated bacteria and affected the water quality e g ph ec st doc and orp which significantly changed the community structures and interactions of bacteria in biofilms this also caused a decrease of eps and plfas on the other hand emfs acted on ions and water quality parameters which effectively reduced the mineral precipitation in addition the decrease in eps content might reduce the biomineralization capacity of biofilm while the ion precipitations caused an erosive effect on biofilms although obtained results clearly demonstrate that emf treatment can effectively control biofilms inside the emitters it is necessary to evaluate the engineering implications of the results for its successful application to rw distribution systems thus chlorination song et al 2019b the most common method for controlling biofouling in rw distribution systems was compared with emfs in terms of anti biofouling capacity cost environmental risks and safety using similar testing devices the biomass of biofilm treated with chlorination and emfs decreased by 22 5 43 0 and 35 1 53 8 indicating that emfs had a better anti biofouling capacity the detailed cost comparations between emfs and chlorination are described in supplementary materials section 3 2 in brief the power of the magnetizer used during the experiment was 20 w the electricity cost was about 1 6 for operating 1 000 h thus the initial installation of magnetizers 718 5 for a magnetizer can be considered as the main cost for emf treatment in contrast since rw includes high quantity of organic matters which generally demand high chlorine increased dose of chlorine will be needed to control biofouling the cost of chlorination is about 22 2 each time raw chemical cost for chlorination is about 2 2 and additional labor cost is 20 based on china pay level although initial installation cost is higher for emf treatment continuous chlorination will be needed to control biofilms thus over the long term the cost of emf treatment would be cheaper than chlorination moreover continuous chlorination can even aggravate biofouling due to the resistance of bacteria wang et al 2019 and induce toxic disinfection products that can cause adverse environmental and public health effects hrudey 2009 song et al 2019a emf treatment causes less environmental risks and comparatively safer than chlorination therefore this study suggested that emf treatment is a potential method for biofouling control in rw distribution systems 5 conclusions 1 emfs treatment significantly changed the bacterial communities the relative abundance of 506 840 otus differed significantly p 0 05 between emf and control samples and the differential otus were mainly distributed in proteobacteria account for 42 3 47 1 bacteroidetes 9 7 15 6 planctomycetes 5 6 8 9 actinobacteria 5 3 7 5 firmicutes 3 2 6 7 and verrucomicrobia 3 9 5 3 2 emf treatment reduced the bacterial community diversity where the richness index and shannon index decreased by 6 4 12 2 and 3 8 11 0 molecular ecological network analysis results demonstrated that emfs were detrimental to the co occurrence patterns among bacteria reduced the connectivity and complexity of the networks the positive connections among bacteria also decreased after emf treatment 3 after emf treatment the contents of plfas eps and ncm were reduced by 30 2 60 5 23 5 40 4 and 31 9 63 1 respectively the content of carbonate and silicate were reduced by 20 7 49 3 and 19 1 41 5 the total mineral precipitation reduced by 22 4 41 9 4 the decreased content of eps in biofilm might have weakened the induction of mineral salt crystallization while the small precipitations accelerated by emfs caused an erosive effect on biofilms the total biofilm biomass inside the emitters reduced by 35 1 53 8 with emf treatment overall the results demonstrated that emf is a chemical free effective treatment that can be used to control biofouling in reclaimed water distribution systems declaration of competing

shortage population growth and urbanization the demand and amount of reclaimed water rw has grown over time for example china the largest user of rw yi et al 2011 utilized more than 70 109 m3 rw in 2018 ministry of water resources website 2019 rw could be applicable to meet water demands in various fields including agricultural irrigation urban miscellaneous uses groundwater replenishment and industrial utilizations yi et al 2011 however since various microorganisms and soluble salts are present in rw pedrero et al 2010 biofouling inevitably appears in rw distribution systems song et al 2019b which can significantly alter solid liquid interface in the systems barton et al 2008 typically increasing boundary shear stress and associated flow resistance walker et al 2013 thus it drastically impedes the systems hydraulic efficiency cowle et al 2019 moreover biofouling is known to cause odor and health problems percival and walker 1999 pipeline corrosion wang et al 2012 and the blockage of emitters zhou et al 2013 therefore the biofouling formation mechanisms and controlling strategies have always been among the most difficult topics need to be solved to date biofouling control in rw distribution systems has mainly been achieved by disinfection with strong chemicals song et al 2019b tin et al 2017 however the application of chemical disinfectants is becoming more restricted because of its environmental risks high cost and the long term bacterial resistance to disinfectants mah and o toole 2001 mercier et al 2016 thus alternative chemical free strategies for controlling biofouling are in great demand recently the electromagnetic magnetic field emf treatment has attracted extensive interest for scaling and or biofouling control chibowski and szcześ 2018 mercier et al 2016 piyadasa et al 2017 due to its environmental friendliness low cost low energy consumption and easy to operate characteristics esmaeilnezhad et al 2017 it was reported that emfs act on the ions dissolved in water like calcium ion and bicarbonate radical and could suppress calcium carbonate deposition scaling chibowski and szcześ 2018 silva et al 2015 also emf treatment has been assessed on controlling microbial cells and the results implied that emfs may affect the growth rate viability adhesion and metabolic activity of microorganisms bayır et al 2015 huwiler et al 2012 piyadasa et al 2018 trueba et al 2014 as biofilms commonly consist of bacteria and minerals e g carbonate sulfate it can be inferred that emfs may have various impacts on biofilm formation with rw trueba et al 2015 reported that emfs with 15 mt intensity weakened the growth of biofilm and reduced its adhesion capacity in a heat exchanger condenser gérard et al 2015 also indicated that the formation of biofilm under a very low frequency emf treatment was two times lower than unexposed biofilm however other studies reported that low intensity and very low frequency emfs did not have significant impacts on biofilms in water distribution systems di campli et al 2010 gosselin et al 2018 the varying responses of biofilm to emfs highlight the need for further research in addition to the direct impact of emf on biofilm formation as emfs make impacts on both biofilm growth and mineral crystallization there may be interactions between biofilms and mineral precipitates under emf treatment among the few available studies trueba et al 2014 indicated that ionic precipitations induced by emfs could decrease the binding ability of extracellular polymeric substances eps and thus reduce the biofilm formation in contrast gosselin et al 2018 reported that emf treatment did not significantly affect biofilms although it was able to modify caco3 crystallization despite these research advances the effects of emfs on biofilm mineral precipitation and their interactions are still elusive besides the formation of biofilm is closely related to bacterial communities such as their diversity composition and co occurrence patterns duran pinedo et al 2011 lequette et al 2019 rochex et al 2008 however the effects of emfs on the interactions among bacteria and their community structures in biofilms have not been fully understood yet although understanding emf impacts on bacterial communities might uncover the potential anti biofouling mechanisms of emfs for rw distribution systems accordingly the objectives of this study were to i determine whether or not emfs could effectively control the biofouling in rw distribution systems ii clarify the effects of emfs on bacterial communities and mineral precipitation and iii elucidate the interactions between biofilm and mineral precipitates and the potential anti biofouling mechanisms of emfs herein biofilm was cultured inside emitters in an agricultural rw conveyance system 16s rrna gene sequencing x ray diffraction xrd and biofilm component analyses were conducted to determine the microbial communities viable and total bacterial biomass eps content and mineral composition in biofilms 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental system the testing system was an in house designed biofilm cultivation experimental platform with emitters a device used for conveying pressurized water flow attached to an agricultural drip irrigation system fig 1 the platform had four units each unit built with four irrigation laterals and each lateral contained 180 identical emitters the structural parameters of the labyrinth flow path of emitter are provided in table s1 in addition the flow condition inside labyrinth path contained the mainstream area and the low speed vortex region feng et al 2018 two types of reclaimed water treated by a sequencing batch aeration wastewater recycling system sbwl and a cyclic activated sludge system cass technology were used in the study and the treated water quality results are summarized in table s2 the water was filtered by a disc filter 106 μm pore size and then flowed into the branch pipe made from polyvinyl chloride the magnetized water was generated using a magnetizer manufacture yishui china type md 63 with coils twined around branch pipes the strength of emfs was in a range of 1 200 mt with an intensity of 1 a and a frequency of 1 10 khz two types of water treatment systems with and without emf treatments were set up sbwl m m indicates with emfs sbwl control group without emfs cass m and cass control group without emfs an intermittent run mode was applied for the systems 14 h each day 7 00 a m 9 00 p m at the operating pressure of 0 1 mpa 2 2 evaluation parameters of emitter performance over time the growth of biofilms gradually clogged the emitters thus to evaluate the performance of the emitters for rw the average discharge variation rate dra and christiansen of uniformity cu were determined supplementary materials section 1 2 2 3 biofilm extraction a previous study song et al 2019b observed that cu was lower than 80 after biofilms were cultivated for about 800 h which displayed that the drip irrigation laterals could not be used based on the china national standard 2009 therefore three sampling events at 260 h 520 h and 780 h of system operation were selected for the study at each sampling time one drip lateral was selected for emitter sampling the emitters along a lateral were numbered from 1 to 180 in direction of water flow hereafter single lateral was divided in six groups of emitters emitters 1st 30th 31st 60th 61st 90th 91st 120th 121th 150th and 151th 180th during each sampling event six replicated samples were collected from each aforementioned group of emitters biofilm in narrow paths of emitters were removed gently using an aseptic brush the obtained biofilms from each group of emitters were mixed and stored in 50 ml centrifuge tubes at 80 c 2 4 biofilm testing 2 4 1 high throughput sequencing and data analyses e z n a soil kits omega bio tek norcross ga u s were used to extract dna from biofilms and the obtained dna was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis with 1 gel concentration the concentration of extracted dna from samples was kept higher than 20 ng ml for further detection

then the high quality data clean sequence reads could be obtained uparse pipeline version 7 1 was used to cluster the operational taxonomic units otus at 97 identity based on the clean sequence reads across all treatments ribosomal database project rdp wang et al 2007 was applied to classify the bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences the richness index observed otu numbers and shannon index were calculated using mothur software version v 1 30 1 schloss et al 2009 2 4 2 construction and analysis of bacterial networks network analysis is a useful method for ascertaining the co occurrence patterns among bacteria an online molecular ecological network analysis mena http ieg4 rccc ou edu mena login cgi kong et al 2019 was used to construct the bacterial networks for the four treatments sbwl m sbwl cass m and cass each treatment had 18 replicates with three periods in brief the standardized relative abundances deng et al 2012 of otus were uploaded to mena platform fifteen replicates based on the similarities in each treatment were kept and used to obtain the spearman rank correlation matrix two tailed p 0 05 without taking the logarithm all the networks were constructed using the same threshold and visualized by cytoscape 3 7 0 software evaluation methods of the networks and topological roles of otus were described in supplementary materials section 1 3 2 4 3 the content of viable bacterial biomass eps and total biofilm biomass the dry weight dw of biofilms was used to determine the total biofilm biomass as 16s rrna gene sequencing could only provide the relative abundance of species this study measured the content of phospholipid fatty acids plfas to quantify viable bacterial biomass in biofilms the content of plfas eps and dw testing methods can be found elsewhere zhou et al 2013 2 4 4 mineral components of biofilms biofilm samples were dried using a freeze dryer manufacture kuansons china type fd a10n the obtained solid substances were mixed uniformly and determined by an x ray diffractometer manufacture bruker germany type d8 advance operating condition 40 kv voltage and 40 ma electric current to acquire the diffraction spectrums and the composition of mineral precipitates except for the crystalline minerals others were defined as non crystalline materials ncms 2 5 statistical analysis wilcoxon rank sum test was used to screen the otus with a significant difference in abundance between emf treatment and control groups p adjust 0 05 and bh method benjamini and hochberg 1995 was applied to control the false discovery rate wilcoxon rank sum test was also applied to analyze the significances of diversity indexes between different treatments via r software version 3 5 0 weighted principal coordinate analyses pcoa were performed to show the differences among the bacterial communities intergroup differences were conducted by analysis of similarity anosim and weighted analysis of molecular variance amova via the vegan package of r software version 3 5 0 spearman analysis artusi et al 2002 was selected to analyze the correlation between environmental factors and bacterial communities 3 results 3 1 bacterial community composition and differential microflora under emf treatment a total of 5 636 520 clean reads were detected after high throughput sequencing of 72 biofilm samples 6 466 otus were classified at a 97 similarity level the rarefaction curves fig s1 of all treatments were asymptotic and the good s coverage were higher than 0 99 table s3 indicating that the sequence depths were sufficient a total of 44 phyla were identified and they were further classified to 58 classes 137 orders 284 families and 795 genera proteobacteria 33 3 69 0 was the most dominant phylum across different treatments followed by firmicutes 0 8 45 0 bacteroidetes 6 9 23 8 cyanobacteria 0 6 11 2 and actinobacteria 2 8 5 5 fig 2 a these five phyla accounted for more than 86 4 of the biofilm species after emf treatment the relative abundance of proteobacteria and firmicutes showed increasing and decreasing trends taxonomic dendrogram of the detected bacterial communities at 260 h is shown in fig 2b dendrograms at 520 h and 780 h can be seen in fig s2 results indicated that 506 840 otus relative abundance differed significantly p 0 05 fig 2b and fig s2 red note between emf and control samples the differential otus were mainly distributed in proteobacteria 42 3 47 1 bacteroidetes 9 7 15 6 planctomycetes 5 6 8 9 actinobacteria 5 3 7 5 firmicutes 3 2 6 7 and verrucomicrobia 3 9 5 3 the dominant differential species in abundance top five table s4 were otu 7 rhodobacteraceae otu 26 janthinobacterium otu 87 pseudomonas and otu 5296 rhodobacteraceae otu 6222 pseudomonas etc 3 2 effect of emf treatment on the diversities of bacterial communities the variations of the richness index observed otu number and shannon index are shown in fig 3 a the figure shows that emf treatment significantly p 0 05 table s5 reduced the community diversity the richness index and shannon index decreased by 6 4 12 2 and 3 8 11 0 pcoa fig 3b was applied to define the dissimilarities among different treatments the bacterial communities of biofilm samples in emf groups and control groups were distinctly separated anosim fig s3 and amova table s6 results further confirmed that the beta diversity of emf treatment groups was significantly p 0 01 different from control groups moreover there were more significant differences between the two kinds of reclaimed water which were drastically separated on the first axis of pcoa besides the second axis of pcoa can notably describe the results of different operation periods it was found that emfs changed the properties of water fig s4 the electroconductibility ec and the surface tension st of the two kinds of rw decreased by 6 8 7 2 and 19 7 27 8 while the dissolved oxygen content doc and oxidation reduction potential orp increased by 3 8 5 8 and 71 2 97 3 and the ph of the solution increased 0 09 0 10 to further explore the correlation between environmental variables and bacterial communities spearman analysis was conducted and results show that the five changed water parameters had obvious correlations with the majority of bacteria fig 4 for example the five dominant phyla proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes cyanobacteria and actinobacteria had significant correlations p 0 05 with ph ec st and orp indicating that emf treatment changed the bacterial communities by affecting the water quality parameters 3 3 molecular ecological networks of bacterial community the phylogenetic molecular ecological networks pmens were constructed to identify the co occurrence patterns among bacteria and the properties of the networks are shown in table 1 the results show that the connectivity of the four networks conform to the power law model 0 81 r 2 of power law 0 97 which represents that most bacteria were almost unrelated to other bacteria while few bacteria had many connections kong et al 2019 the average connectivity in emf treated groups sbwl m 2 90 cass m 3 24 were lower than the control groups sbwl 4 37 cass 5 38 and the network size became smaller with emfs indicating that the emfs reduced the connectivity and complexity of the networks the average geodesic distances avggd in the pmens were 4 3 7 1 which implies that the nodes were closely connected with each other and the four networks had small world properties kong et al 2019 moreover the avggd with emfs were higher compared to control groups implying that emfs decreased interactions among species peura et al 2015 the modularity of the empirical networks in the four treatments were higher than that of the respective random networks which suggests that all networks were modular furthermore there were striking differences among the empirical networks for the average clustering coefficient average path distance and modularity the overall pmens were visualized in fig 5 a d there were 9 8 8 and 6 modules nodes number was higher than 6 for sbwl m sbwl cass m and cass groups respectively other connections were relatively small 2 6 nodes a total of 289 406 311 and 386 nodes were obtained and the number of connections were 420 886 503 and 877 in the four treatments the results show that emf treatment could drastically reduce the number of nodes and connections of the networks the otus with the largest links in the four treatments were rhodobacteraceae otu 5296 gammaproteobacteria otu 368 hirschia otu 78 and sphingomonadaceae otu 921 and they all belong to proteobacteria the buck of the links between the otus were positive blue line and account for 69 5 57 4 86 3 and 78 9 in the four treatments after the implementation of emf treatment the number of positive links decreased by 37 3 42 6 the topological roles of the otus were described in zi pi plots fig 5e and f most of the otus 98 0 were peripherals and 66 7 86 2 of the peripherals only had connections in their individual modules i e pi 0 as for sbwl m sbwl cass m and cass treatments about 1 4 7 6 1 3 and 2 3 of the otus were generalists table s7 including 0 7 2 0 1 0 and 1 3 that were module hubs and 0 7 5 7 0 3 and 1 0 that were connectors the generalist otus were changed after emf treatment and the number of generalist otus decreased by 55 6 87 1 besides network hubs did not appear in all networks 3 4 characteristics of biofilm components and the performance of the emitters the characteristic components of biofilms were shown in fig 6 after emf treatment the content of plfas fig 6a eps fig 6b and ncms fig 6c decreased by 30 2 60 5 23 5 40 4 and 31 9 63 1 respectively the mineral components of biofilms inside emitters mainly included quartz carbonate calcite aragonite monohydrocalcite and dolomite and silicate muscovite feldspar and chlorite fig s5 in general calcite 21 2 58 6 was the most dominant mineral precipitate across different treatments followed by muscovite 20 8 33 4 aragonite 0 5 27 9 quartz 7 0 19 7 and feldspar 2 3 17 0 compared to control groups quartz content fig 6d in emf groups decreased by 15 3 26 9 the control effects of emfs on carbonate fig 6e and silicate fig 6f were better than those of quartz and the content of carbonate and silicate drastically decreased by 20 7 49 3 and 19 1 41 5 besides it was found that emf treatment inhibited the precipitation of calcite while promoted the deposition of aragonite fig s6 and effectively reduced the content of muscovite and feldspar finally the total content of minerals decreased by 22 4 41 9 the reduction of characteristic biofilm components plfas eps and minerals in emf groups led to decreased biofilm biomass inside the emitters by 35 1 53 8 fig s7a as a result emf treatment effectively maintained the performance of emitters increasing the dra and cu by 41 6 43 2 fig s7b and 35 3 38 2 fig s7c 4 discussion 4 1 effect of emfs on bacterial communities this paper demonstrated that emf is a chemical free and efficient treatment in mitigating biofouling in the rw distribution systems emfs significantly changed the bacterial community of biofilm and reduced the content of the characteristic biofilm components some researchers indicated that the anti biofouling effect of emfs was attributed to the inhibition of bacterial growth bayır et al 2015 gérard et al 2015 our study also showed that bacterial counts were reduced after emf treatment fig s8 one possible explanation is the electroporation of bacterial membranes i e cytoplasmic membrane the application of emfs can induce a voltage difference across the bacterial membrane beveridge et al 2002 if the voltage exceeds the threshold for electroporation generally assumed about 1 v the transmembrane pores can be opened leading to an ion imbalance and nonreversible cell inactivation garcía et al 2003 in fact a laboratory study had shown that 15 min of continuous treatment reduced the number of bacteria effectively duda et al 2011 moreover the reported sterilizing effect of emfs varies greatly as it is tightly related to the strength and frequency of the magnetic field pipeline materials flow rate etc piyadasa et al 2017 which may lead to greatly varying anti biofilm capacity of emfs gérard et al 2015 gosselin et al 2018 trueba et al 2015 in this study the germicidal rate was close to 50 under 24 h of emf treatment indicating that emfs could mitigate the formation of biofilm to a certain extent and cause the changes in bacterial community in biofilm except for the sterilization effect our results also demonstrated that emfs changed the bacterial communities by affecting water quality parameters fig 4 however it was difficult to differentiate which effect played a more significant role for bacterial community changes future studies are needed to elucidate the emf effects on bacterial biofilm communities and functions network analysis for the emf treated groups and control groups clearly demonstrates the impacts of emfs on the co occurrence patterns of bacteria in biofilms network established on random matrices theory is more sturdy and could precisely reveal the interactions between microorganisms in complex biological environments zhou et al 2011 the obtained results revealed that the network sizes the total nodes and the bacterial connections particularly the positive links 292 509 434 and 692 in sbwl m sbwl cass m cass respectively were significantly decreased under emf treatment which was in accordance with the variations of diversities shannon indexes and richness indexes generally the complexities of a network always have a positive correlation with the stabilization of a community liang et al 2016 fig 5 shows that the networks in control groups were more complex than those of emf groups highlighting that emf treatment affected the co occurrence pattern of bacterial community on the other hand positive links generally indicate symbiotic relationships co construction of biofilms or exchange of metabolites between microorganisms layeghifard et al 2017 negative links imply predation relationships or competitions under environmental stress deng et al 2016 thus emfs appeared to break the reciprocal interactions between bacteria moreover emf treatment reduced the average connectivities while it increased the average geodesic distances of networks implying that emfs suppressed the transfer efficiency of energy matter and information among bacteria peura et al 2015 zhou et al 2011 in fact multiple interspecies interactions can affect biofilm formation and development simões et al 2010 burmølle et al 2006 found that symbiotic effects among multiple bacterial species promoted biofilm biomass production and de la fuente et al 2013 described that antagonistic interactions among bacterial species inhibited biofilm formation therefore it can be inferred that emf treatment could disrupt the stability of the community networks and the symbiotic relationships of bacteria which in turn affected the content of plfas and eps and reduced biofilm formation 4 2 effect of emfs on mineral precipitation carbonate and silicate precipitations were easily formed inside the flow path of emitters which might be because the outlet of an emitter was in contact with air the concentrations of soluble ions would increase with the water evaporation while the system was not in operation it was found that the content of carbonate in biofilm drastically decreased with the application of emfs fig 6e one explanation is that the magnetic field mf might prevent inhibit the carbonate precipitation within biofilms it is known that mf could decompose water clusters into monomers or smaller clusters and reduce the hydrogen bond force and intermolecular force between water molecules chibowski and szcześ 2018 thereby the surface tension of water was reduced fig s4 while the activity of water increased the changes in the physicochemical properties of water could accelerate the formation of hydrated amorphous calcium carbonate hacc on the other hand mf induces faster proton transfer from bicarbonate ions to water madsen 2004 causing an increase of carbonate ions and promoting carbonate precipitation consequently carbonates were more likely precipitated in water other than in biofilm moreover we found that mf inhibited the sedimentation of calcite while promoted the deposition of aragonite figs s6a b mainly because mf accelerated the dehydration process of hacc dehydration was completed before aragonites were converted to calcite similar to the previous reports cefalas et al 2010 chang and tai 2010 besides the content of aragonite was still lower than that of calcite in this study which might be due to the relatively weak adhesion force between aragonite and the surfaces of emitters as aragonite was easily washed away by the turbulence inside the emitters the silicates inside the emitters mainly consisted of muscovite feldspar and a small amount of chlorite figs s6d f despite the physical depositions silicates also could be formed by chemical reactions as the ph of water is one of the main factors affecting the formation of silica scale silicate precipitation would be restrained with the increase of ph when ph is ranged between 7 and 13 neofotistou and demadis 2004 this study found that emf treatment increased the ph of the reclaimed water fig s4 and therefore could inhibit the formation of silica scale to a certain extent on the other hand calcium carbonate always provides nucleation sites for the formation of silicate once calcium carbonate is formed silicon ions will be adsorbed on the surface of calcium carbonate and aggregate to form a mixed scale with carbonate scale umar and saaid 2013 therefore emf treatment inhibited the carbonate precipitation and indirectly decreased the silicate nucleation sites which further led to the decrease of silicate content moreover emf treatment reduced the deposition of quartz this may be attributed to the reduced eps content responsible for the decreased particle capture efficiency nonetheless the controlling effect of emf on quartz was lower than carbonate and silicate which might be due to stable physicochemical properties of quartz 4 3 anti biofouling mechanisms of emfs and engineering implications as emfs can directly impact both bacteria activity and mineral precipitations biofilm formation can be affected by both processes interestingly there was a significantly p 0 01 positive correlation between mineral content and eps content fig s9 which indicates that interactions might exist between biofilms and mineral precipitates under emf treatment in fact the formation of mineral precipitates is always influenced by biofilm yang et al 2010 as microbial secretions i e eps may enhance the retention of inorganic ions herzberg and elimelech 2008 and preexisting biofilm can induce mineral crystallization thompson et al 2012 moreover biofilm can inhibit the diffusion of the accumulated solutes herzberg and elimelech 2008 thus emf drastically decreased the content of plfas and eps reducing the biomineralization capacity of biofilm and inhibiting the formation of mineral deposits as for the effects of minerals on biofilm field emission scanning electron microscopy images fig s10 showed that the surface roughness of biofilm in the emf groups was higher than that of the control groups this was mainly due to emfs which could crystallize the dissolved ions e g co3 2 ca2 into small particles that could be easily deposited on biofilms trueba et al 2015 however this kind of fine particle scale was not firmly adhered to the flow paths and could easily be rinsed at a low speed water flow i e 1 m s 1 shahryari and pakshir 2008 causing an erosion effect on the biofilms that increased its surface roughness and lead to its detachment moreover the fine precipitates could decrease the molecular bonding of eps resulting in the destruction of the biofilms eguía et al 2008 these combined effects may reduce the contents of biofilm biomass and eps in general the regulatory path of emfs on the biofouling of emitters are summarized in fig s11 on one hand emf treatment directly inactivated bacteria and affected the water quality e g ph ec st doc and orp which significantly changed the community structures and interactions of bacteria in biofilms this also caused a decrease of eps and plfas on the other hand emfs acted on ions and water quality parameters which effectively reduced the mineral precipitation in addition the decrease in eps content might reduce the biomineralization capacity of biofilm while the ion precipitations caused an erosive effect on biofilms although obtained results clearly demonstrate that emf treatment can effectively control biofilms inside the emitters it is necessary to evaluate the engineering implications of the results for its successful application to rw distribution systems thus chlorination song et al 2019b the most common method for controlling biofouling in rw distribution systems was compared with emfs in terms of anti biofouling capacity cost environmental risks and safety using similar testing devices the biomass of biofilm treated with chlorination and emfs decreased by 22 5 43 0 and 35 1 53 8 indicating that emfs had a better anti biofouling capacity the detailed cost comparations between emfs and chlorination are described in supplementary materials section 3 2 in brief the power of the magnetizer used during the experiment was 20 w the electricity cost was about 1 6 for operating 1 000 h thus the initial installation of magnetizers 718 5 for a magnetizer can be considered as the main cost for emf treatment in contrast since rw includes high quantity of organic matters which generally demand high chlorine increased dose of chlorine will be needed to control biofouling the cost of chlorination is about 22 2 each time raw chemical cost for chlorination is about 2 2 and additional labor cost is 20 based on china pay level although initial installation cost is higher for emf treatment continuous chlorination will be needed to control biofilms thus over the long term the cost of emf treatment would be cheaper than chlorination moreover continuous chlorination can even aggravate biofouling due to the resistance of bacteria wang et al 2019 and induce toxic disinfection products that can cause adverse environmental and public health effects hrudey 2009 song et al 2019a emf treatment causes less environmental risks and comparatively safer than chlorination therefore this study suggested that emf treatment is a potential method for biofouling control in rw distribution systems 5 conclusions 1 emfs treatment significantly changed the bacterial communities the relative abundance of 506 840 otus differed significantly p 0 05 between emf and control samples and the differential otus were mainly distributed in proteobacteria account for 42 3 47 1 bacteroidetes 9 7 15 6 planctomycetes 5 6 8 9 actinobacteria 5 3 7 5 firmicutes 3 2 6 7 and verrucomicrobia 3 9 5 3 2 emf treatment reduced the bacterial community diversity where the richness index and shannon index decreased by 6 4 12 2 and 3 8 11 0 molecular ecological network analysis results demonstrated that emfs were detrimental to the co occurrence patterns among bacteria reduced the connectivity and complexity of the networks the positive connections among bacteria also decreased after emf treatment 3 after emf treatment the contents of plfas eps and ncm were reduced by 30 2 60 5 23 5 40 4 and 31 9 63 1 respectively the content of carbonate and silicate were reduced by 20 7 49 3 and 19 1 41 5 the total mineral precipitation reduced by 22 4 41 9 4 the decreased content of eps in biofilm might have weakened the induction of mineral salt crystallization while the small precipitations accelerated by emfs caused an erosive effect on biofilms the total biofilm biomass inside the emitters reduced by 35 1 53 8 with emf treatment overall the results demonstrated that emf is a chemical free effective treatment that can be used to control biofouling in reclaimed water distribution systems declaration of competing

18106,while in many countries people have access to cheap and safe potable tap water the global consumption of bottled water is rising flanders belgium where this study is located has an exceptionally high consumption of bottled water per capita however in the interest of resource efficiency and global environmental challenges the consumption of tap water is preferable to our knowledge an integrated analysis of the main reasons why people consume tap and bottled water is absent in flanders belgium using flemish survey data n 2309 we first compared tap and bottled water consumers through bivariate correlation analysis subsequently path modelling techniques were used to further investigate these correlations our results show that bottled water consumption in flanders is widespread despite environmental and financial considerations for a large part this is caused by negative perceptions about tap water many consumers consider it unhealthy unsafe and prefer the taste of bottled water furthermore we found that the broader social context often inhibits the consumption of tap water on the one hand improper infrastructures e g lead piping can limit access to potable tap water on the other hand social norms exist that promote bottled water lastly results suggest that the consumption of bottled water is most common among men older people and less educated groups we conclude that future research and policy measures will benefit from an approach that integrates all behavioural aspects associated with water type consumption this will enable both governments and tap water companies to devise more effective policies to manage and support tap water supply networks graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water sustainability pro environmental behaviour quality

requires 1000 2000 times more energy to produce bottled water 5 6 10 2 mj 1 1 in comparison to tap water 0 005 mj 1 1 gleick and cooley 2009 pacific institute 2007 therefore tap water is preferable in the interest of resource efficiency bottle manufacturing has a particularly high environmental impact horowitz et al 2018 most single use bottles are made of plastic polyethylene terephthalate pet which is sourced from fossil fuels gleick and cooley 2009 considering that bottled water production reached almost 100 billion gallons in 2017 and considering the worldwide preference for plastic bottles rodwan 2017 bottled water consumption greatly contributes to global plastic pollution the chemical by products of plastic such as phthalates pollute the air water and soil olson 1999 furthermore plastic non biodegradable waste often ends up in nature barnes et al 2009 shaw and sahni 2014 vastly accumulating in landfills water bodies and remote islands jambeck et al 2015 lavers and bond 2017 olson 1999 subsequently ecosystems are disturbed and wildlife is threatened because animals are entangled in plastic debris or ingest it chae and an 2018 wabnitz and nichols 2010 while in many countries people have easy access to cheap and safe potable tap water wilk 2006 bottled water consumption has been increasing on a global scale arnold and larsen 2006 rodwan 2017 in a study of the flanders environment agency 2018b 66 of the participants indicated that they drink bottled water at least half of the time averaging 0 4 l per day flanders has an exceptionally high per capita consumption of bottled water european commission 2013 there appears to be a disconnect between bottled water consumption and its environmental impact saylor et al 2011 paradoxically flanders has played a pioneering role in the development of tap water supply systems the region hosted the first 1902 continuous scheme of water disinfection through chlorine for potable purposes mcguire 2006 white 2010 for the consumption of tap water to be the norm it seems that the development of tap water supply networks is a necessary but insufficient condition extensive insight in water consumption behaviour is critical for the effectiveness of tap water supply networks this will also help governments develop policies that induce behavioural change van der linden 2015 in recent years there has been a growing academic interest in the reasons why people consume tap and bottled water most studies to date have employed a product oriented approach where participants are asked to evaluate a product i e a type of water debbeler et al 2018 these studies have identified four important considerations 1 health and safety concerns about tap water e g ballantine et al 2019 debbeler et al 2018 people often prefer bottled water because they associate tap water with chemicals chlorine sediments etc mcleod et al 2014 rahman et al 2017 ward et al 2009 2 organoleptic properties i e sensorial information such as taste and odour play a major role in water type consumption ballantine et al 2019 doria 2006 debbeler et al 2018 conclude that bottled water consumers indicate taste as a core driver to consume bottled water given that many consumers prefer its taste over tap water moreover people seem to relate organoleptic properties of beverages to its perceived healthiness and safety luckow and delahunty 2004 saylor et al 2011 the taste of tap water is often associated with the presence of unhealthy substances font ribera et al 2017 more recently 3 environmental concerns have been a growing consideration in water type consumption the environmental impact of bottled water might lead people to consume tap water qian 2018 ward et al 2009 this behaviour fits within the larger trend of environmentally friendly consumption leonidou et al 2010 lastly 4 financial considerations might influence consumers in their choice of water van der linden 2015 ward et al 2009 generally tap water is significantly cheaper than bottled water abrahams et al 2000 ferrier 2001 in flanders belgium tap water cost on average 0 005 l flanders environment agency n d in comparison 1 l bottled water costs approximately 0 60 these product oriented approaches often led to voluntarist explanations suggesting that consumers make deliberate choices based on product evaluations e g ballantine et al 2019 ward et al 2009 less attention has been paid to socio contextual explanations including the broader social context wherein water is consumed and the sociodemographic characteristics of consumers firstly the social context could potentially influence individual water consumption behaviour given the fact that consumer decisions are made within a broader context spaargaren and van vliet 2000 on the one hand improper infrastructures e g lead pipes can limit access to potable tap water juba and tanyanyiwa 2018 in this context doria et al 2009 pointed out the need to combine research on product evaluations with more objective and technical approaches that focus on supply reliability on the other hand society installs social norms that define appropriate behaviour and therefore influence consumer decisions higgs 2015 etale et al 2018 show that social norms often promote bottled water particularly on special occasions e g when visitors are present secondly certain sociodemographic characteristics appear to influence water type preferences research indicates that age gender and educational attainment might be relevant factors but consistent evidence about the direction and strength of these associations is still lacking see for example debbeler et al 2018 doria 2010 etale et al 2018 family et al 2019 rosinger et al 2018 xu and lin 2018 sociodemographic influences may also serve as causal antecedents mediated by other factors associated with water type consumption doria 2010 while previous inquiries into the relationship between age and environmentalism found a significant association this relationship is complex grønhøj and thøgersen 2009 in general younger people are more concerned about environmental issues yet research also points out that this does not always translate into environmentally friendly consumption young people seem less likely to make changes in their consumption behaviour kagawa 2007 in general environmentally friendly consumers tend to be older casalo and escario 2018 which might translate into a preference for tap water among older people two opposing effects are hypothesised with respect to gender woman generally perceive tap water as more hazardous anadu and harding 2000 juba and tanyanyiwa 2018 saylor et al 2011 but are also more concerned about environmental issues mccright 2010 in addition highly educated consumers may favour tap water because they tend to have less health and safety concerns ochoo et al 2017 park et al 2019 and possess a greater general environmental concern franzen and meyer 2009 against this background we analysed the main reasons why people consume tap and bottled water in flanders belgium flanders is a particularly noteworthy case because it has both an excellent tap water supply network and relatively high levels of environmental concern among its population european commission 2017 yet bottled water consumption is exceptionally high in this region european commission 2013 in order to explain this paradoxical situation we suggest an integrated analysis of the behavioural aspect associated with water type consumption to this end we coupled product oriented approaches to socio contextual explanations in our integrated approach we considered the product i e a type of water the actor i e the sociodemographic characteristics of consumers and the broader social context wherein water is consumed extensive insight into the behavioural aspects associated with the consumption of tap and bottled water will enable both governments and tap water companies to device more effective strategies to manage and support tap water supply networks van der linden 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 data acquisition the questionnaire for our survey was led by the flemish water knowledge center vlakwa vito an agency facilitating knowledge transfer on water in flanders belgium in 2018 the online survey the water survey among the citizens was launched citizens of the flemish region of belgium could answer a variety of questions regarding water related attitudes and behaviours the questionnaire was carried out through an online application using limesurvey a company specialised in online surveys the survey was first introduced by the flemish radio to augment response rates the questionnaire was additionally dispersed through social media advertised by public figures and distributed with the newsletters of the federation of flemish water and sewage managers aquaflanders and vlakwa a total of 2345 individuals participated in the survey only participants above the age of 18 were included in the subsequent analysis additionally 24 participants were manually excluded due to incomplete data ultimately the assessment was performed on 2309 participants given that the overall distribution of the participants sociodemographic characteristics gender education age and residence did not fully align with the general flemish demographics eurostat 2018 statbel 2019 statistics flanders 2019 a specific set of poststratification weights was introduced to ensure the survey s representativity towards the target population this weighing was achieved by dividing the population proportion by the sample proportion for each group subsequently weights were multiplied after weighting the sample distribution was in line with the general population characteristics cf table 1 2 2 variables water type consumption was measured by inquiring participants about the amount of tap water that they consume at home relative to bottled water i e how frequently do you drink tap water instead of bottled water at home participants could reply to the questions based on a five point scale 1 always 5 seldom or never the scale was reversed thus high scores on the scale were associated with increased consumption of tap water relative to bottled water to assess the impact of product evaluations four questions were used health and safety concerns were questioned using a six point scale 1 totally disagree 6 totally agree with the following statement tap water in flanders is safe and healthy this response scale was reversed to construct a variable where high scores indicated high health and safety concerns about tap water the same unreversed response scale was used to identify general environmentally friendly consumers item it is clear to me what environmentally friendly products and pesticides are and i am willing to use them high scores were associated with environmentally friendly consumers furthermore respondents were asked why they consume bottled water taste preferences was one of the answer categories based on this question a dummy variable was constructed for taste preferences score 1 the participant preferred the taste of bottled water participants were additionally inquired about the amount of money they spend on drinking water participants who were able to estimate their spending habits on drinking water were considered to take into account the financial consequences of consumer decisions this response was translated into a proxy variable with dummy coding 1 denoted an inclination to financial considerations to estimate the influence of the broader social context four questions were used an improper infrastructure was measured by two items i have lead pipes and i do not have access to tap water these items were combined into one dummy variable score 1 indicated limited access to potable tap water social norms were measured using two dummies items bottled water present better during meals and if i have visitors i prefer bottled water lastly sociodemographic characteristics include age ranging from 18 to 86 gender score 1 female and the highest educational attainment of the head of the household i e primary provider of the household income primary education or less secondary education tertiary education 2 3 research setup the analysis in this study was conducted stepwise we started with descriptive statistics to evaluate water type consumption in the flemish context secondly we used spearman correlations to analyse bivariate associations and to compare the characteristics of bottled water consumers with tap water consumers thirdly path modelling techniques were used to further investigate the interrelation between the variables associated with water type consumption resulting in a path model with 12 variables such model is comprised of causal chains i e direct and indirect relationships between variables duncan 1966 modelling causal chains has proven to be a valuable approach to research on water type consumption in the past e g doria et al 2005 doria et al 2009 levêque and burns 2017 in this paper we were able to investigate the potentially mediated relationship between water type consumption and sociodemographic characteristics to estimate a causal model that fits well with our data we used the software package mplus our path model was constructed with both binary and continuous outcome variables consequently the model combined linear regressions when the outcome was continuous with non linear regressions i e logit or probit regression when the outcome was binary specifically using a robust weighted least square estimator wlsmv linear regression coefficients were estimated when the outcome variable was continuous and probit coefficients were estimated when the outcome was binary muthén and muthén 1998 2017 model fit evaluation was based on multiple fit statistics as recommended by kline 2015 χ 2 test comparative fit index cfi standardised root mean square residual srmr and root mean square error of approximation rmsea cut off points for fit statistics provide a indicative tool for model evaluation lai and green 2016 standards in this analysis were borrowed from hooper et al 2007 and kline 2015 the χ 2 test should be significant p 0 05 but a large sample size as is the case in this analysis may cause the test to be unreliable srmr and rmsea 0 05 indicate a good fit while fit values below 0 08 are often seen as acceptable whereas initial standards claimed that cfi 0 9 indicates a bad fit recent recommendations require cfi 0 95 for a good fit given that fit indices should be evaluated together instead of independently kline 2015 0 9 cfi 0 95 was considered acceptable in combination with srmr and rmsea scores 0 05 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics in our data almost 45 of the participants indicated that they drink bottled water half the time or more cf table 2 furthermore 90 agreed when asked whether they are environmentally friendly consumers and almost 60 kept track of their spending habits on drinking water there appears to be a cognitive disconnect between the consumption of bottled water on the one hand and environmental and financial considerations on the other hand among our participants only 20 considered tap water completely healthy and safe most participants seemed to perceive tap water as relatively healthy and safe but not entirely in 15 2 of cases taste preferences were indicated as drivers to consume bottled water instead of tap water furthermore 3 1 of our participants had no access to potable tap water at the time of the survey lastly 10 of participants said to consume bottled water because it presents better during meals and more than 25 indicated to prefer bottled water when visitors are present 3 2 correlations analysis a spearman correlation analysis was used to evaluate bivariate correlations between water type consumption on the one hand and product evaluations and socio contextual factors on the other hand cf fig 1 positive correlations indicated a positive correlation with the consumption of tap water relative to the consumption of bottled water results showed that both product evaluations and socio contextual explanations were significantly correlated with water type consumption the consumption of tap water seemed negatively correlated with risk perceptions ρ 0 408 p 0 001 and taste preferences ρ 0 386 p 0 001 suggesting that bottled water consumers may have higher health and safety concerns about tap water and consider its taste inferior to bottled water tap water consumers were more likely to be environmentally friendly consumers ρ 0 140 p 0 001 and inclined to financial considerations ρ 0 071 p 0 001 the negative correlation between the consumption of tap water and access to potable tap water ρ 0 080 p 0 001 showed that people who do not have access to potable tap water consume significantly more bottled water furthermore social norms played a role in water type consumption tap water consumption was negatively correlated with the perception that bottled water presents better during meals ρ 0 055 p 0 01 moreover a significant positive correlation was found between the consumption of tap water and the perception that bottled water is preferred when visitors are present ρ 0 171 p 0 001 this suggests the existence of a group that predominantly drinks tap water but deliberately consumes bottled water when visitors are present lastly all sociodemographic characteristics were significantly correlated with water type consumption younger participants ρ 0 093 p 0 001 women ρ 0 046 p 0 05 and families where the head of the household is highly educated ρ 0 152 p 0 001 on average reported a higher consumption of tap water 3 3 path model to further investigate the bivariate correlations discussed above we employed path modelling techniques cf duncan 1966 given the binary outcome variables in the model a robust weighted least square estimator wlsmv was used to achieve this muthén and muthén 1998 2017 in total two models were estimated the model fit of the first model cf fig 2 indicated that improvements could be made χ 2 234 36 p 0 001 cfi 0 66 srmr 0 079 rmsea 0 066 using lagrange multipliers or modification indices as they are often referred to we were able to find ways in which our model could be improved bentler 2010 in combination with theoretical arguments some covariance between mediators was accounted for in a secondary model cf fig 3 firstly social norms were allowed to covariate additionally covariance between health and safety concerns and taste preferences was included because previous research shows a correlation between the two font ribera et al 2017 finally the secondary model included covariance between social norms when visitors are present on the one hand and the variables on risk perceptions taste preferences and access to potable tap water on the other hand overall an acceptable fit was reached for the secondary model χ 2 78 83 p 0 001 cfi 0 90 srmr 0 049 rmsea 0 041 moreover the secondary model explains more than half of the variance in water type consumption r 2 0 52 the standardized direct and indirect effects discovered in the secondary model are visually represented in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively this model confirmed that participants with health and safety concerns about tap water consumed more bottled water std β 0 277 p 0 001 the inferior taste of tap water was another reason to consume bottled water std β 0 444 p 0 001 environmental std β 0 131 p 0 001 and financial considerations std β 0 129 p 0 001 seemed to be positively associated with the consumption of tap water participants without access to potable tap water consumed significantly more bottled water std β 0 152 p 0 001 furthermore the perception that bottled water presents better during meals was negatively associated with the consumption of tap water std β 0 178 p 0 01 additionally a positive relation was found between the perception that bottled water is preferred in the presence of visitors and the consumption of tap water std β 0 215 p 0 001 this confirms the existence of a group of predominantly tap water consumers who deliberately serve bottled water to their visitors overall a strong link between the sociodemographic characteristics of consumers and water type consumption was found in the data the bivariate analysis revealed a negative relationship between age and the consumption of tap water the path model suggested that environmental std β 0 143 p 0 001 and financial considerations std β 0 265 p 0 001 were more common among older participants in contrast taste preferences for bottled water std β 0 149 p 0 001 and the perception that bottled water presents better during meals std β 0 185 p 0 001 were less common among the older generations while the indirect relationship between age and the consumption of tap water was positive this seemed to be compensated by a negative direct effect std β 0 188 p 0 001 in other words older participants consumed more bottled water than younger people despite the fact that they were more likely to consider the environmental and financial impact of consumer decision and that they were less likely to indicate taste and social norms as reasons for drinking bottled water it thus seems that there are reasons external to our model e g generational effects that drive older people to consume bottled water with respect to gender a bivariate positive relationship was found suggesting that women consume relatively more tap water than men whereas women had more health and safety concerns std β 0 104 p 0 001 and were less inclined to financial considerations std β 0 224 p 0 001 these positive indirect effects are compensated by a positive direct effect std β 0 076 p 0 01 and negative indirect effects generally environmentally friendly consumption was more common among women std β 0 062 p 0 05 the perception that bottles present better during meals seemed less common amongst women std β 0 127 p 0 01 put in another way women consumed more tap water than men despite health and safety concerns and the fact that they were less inclined to financial considerations in part this could be explained by the finding that female participants were more likely to be environmentally friendly consumers and less susceptible to social norms that promote bottled water during meals lastly the level of education was negatively correlated with the consumption of bottled water this could be explained by the fact that health and safety concerns about tap water were less common among higher educated groups std β 0 188 p 0 001 additionally we found a positive direct relation between higher education and the consumption of tap water std β 0 097 p 0 05 lastly significant covariances between mediators were observed cf table 3 the results showed a positive association between social norms i e the idea that bottles present better during meals and that they are preferred when visitors are present std cov 0 384 p 0 001 furthermore a positive association between health and safety concerns and taste preferences was found std cov 0 281 p 0 001 suggesting that people who dislike the taste of tap water perceived tap water as less healthy and safe and vice versa lastly a negative covariance was found between the perception that bottled water is preferred in the presence of visitors on the one hand and taste preferences std cov 0 221 p 0 001 risk perceptions about tap water std cov 0 109 p 0 01 and access to potable tap water std cov 0 190 p 0 05 on the other hand these findings suggest that occasional bottled water consumers serve bottled water to their visitors due to social norms yet have no taste preferences for bottled water less health and safety concerns about bottled water and no limitations in access to potable tap water 4 discussion in the interest of resource efficiency and global environmental challenges such as water scarcity and pollution tap water is preferable to bottled water gleick and cooley 2009 tap water is a short chain product with a minimum footprint as infrastructures are all in place for other non potable uses of tap water despite the fact that many countries provide cheap and safe potable tap water wilk 2006 the consumption of bottled water is rising worldwide arnold and larsen 2006 rodwan 2017 in flanders belgium the situation is particularly puzzling this region has an exceptionally high per capita consumptions of bottled water european commission 2013 in combination with an excellent tap water supply network and a population with relatively high environmental concerns european commission 2017 to support the use of tap water supply networks and develop more effective policies to induce behavioural change it is vital to understand water consumption behaviour van der linden 2015 in this article we aimed to provide an integrated analysis of the main reasons why people consume tap and bottled water to this end we complemented the product oriented approach of previous research with a more contextualised approach as a testament to the comprehensive nature of our study we were able to explain more than 50 of the differences in water type consumption we found that environmental and financial considerations drive people to consume tap water yet the consumption of bottled water is widespread in flanders with almost 45 of our participants drinking bottled water at home at least half the time this is in stark contrast with the fact that approximately 90 of the participants indicated that they are willing to buy environmentally friendly products and the fact that approximately 60 of the participants kept track of their water spending habits there appears to be a disconnect between individual water consumption behaviour environmental consequences and financial consideration in particular the disconnect between bottled water consumption and its environmental impact is substantial similar findings have been described by debbeler et al 2018 as the water consumption paradox the results show that part of this paradox can be explained by contextual factors that inhibit tap water consumption our findings firstly signal social norms in flanders that promote bottled water brei and tadajewski 2015 argue that these norms are potentially caused by marketing and branding campaigns of bottled water companies in addition bottled water has historically been more high status wilk 2006 social norms are typically augmented on special occasions e g in the event that visitors are present presenting bottled water to visitors might be a sign of status appreciation and respect etale et al 2018 our survey further suggests that approximately 3 of the flemish population of belgium does not have access to potable tap water at home similarly flemish official statistics indicate that 2 3 of flemish households are not connected to the tap water network flanders environment agency 2017 in contrast belgium s progress reports on sustainable development goal sdg 6 1 i e universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all united nations 2019 p 7 21 indicate that 100 of the population has access to basic drinking water sources sachs et al 2019 this includes all water sources tap water wells springs rainwater and packaged water such as bottled water that can be reached within a 30 min round trip world health organisation 2017 for 1 6 of the populations these sources are not always available at home sachs et al 2019 our results suggest that this may be caused by lead piping which drives people to consume bottled water moreover based on our survey an estimated 1 2 has a privately managed water well at home households with these wells seem to consume significantly more bottled water it appears that water wells are only minimally used for drinking purposes see also flanders environment agency 2018b although belgium seems compliant to sdg 6 1 sustainability objectives should focus more on access to tap water supply networks furthermore our study confirms that the water consumption paradox is also caused by the negative perceptions many consumers have about tap water the consumption of bottled water is most common among people who perceive tap water as unhealthy and unsafe moreover bottled water consumers often perceive the taste of tap water as inferior in line with the study van der linden 2015 conducted in the netherlands we found that the influence of environmental and financial considerations is less salient than the influence of risk perceptions and taste preferences about tap water similar to the findings of levêque and burns 2017 we found a strong connection between these risk perceptions and taste preferences furthermore public perceptions about tap water appear to be negatively biased during blind taste experiments participants have been unable to differentiate between tap and bottled water e g debbeler et al 2018 wells 2005 additionally many studies fail to prove that tap water is less healthy and safe than bottled water e g ahmad and bajahlan 2009 lalumandier and ayers 2000 moreover the legal framework for quality control is more stringent for tap water than for bottled water ca 60 parameters are used for the quality control of tap water and tap water producers screen for additional organics vlaamse overheid 2002 furthermore belgium reports 99 6 compliance with european and flemish quality regulations flanders environment agency 2018a in contrast these regulations do not always apply to bottled water flanders environment agency 2018a moreover studies have questioned the quality of bottled water calling for an improved framework of control cidu et al 2011 zamberlan da silva et al 2008 furthermore the healthiness of plastic bottled water is questioned because microplastics originating from the packaging may infiltrate the drinking water mason et al 2018 consequently perceptions about tap water are often based on subjective judgements instead of objective differences anadu and harding 2000 slovic 1987 they are augmented by media coverage of drinking water problems and water pollution anadu and harding 2000 parag and roberts 2009 and by distrust of governments and the tap water industry doria et al 2009 macgregor and fleming 1996 ironically this distrust might be partly caused by environmental groups that call attention to water pollution and the government s inactivity foltz 1999 in addition the impact of bottled water producers should not be neglected because they are powerful market agents that shape consumer perceptions brei and tadajewski 2015 they promote their products as healthy and pure implying that tap water is not doria 2006 ferrier 2001 wilk 2006 in terms of sociodemographic differences the consumption of bottled water appears most common among older people men and less educated groups for age this seems to be explained by a residual direct effect unrelated to any mediator in our model given the comprehensive nature of our model this most likely points to a cohort effect instead of variables not included in the model this means that generational differences might be explained by shared temporal life experiences e g the growth of the market for bottled water during the 1960s and 1970s and the subsequent marketing campaigns brei and tadajewski 2015 furthermore we confirm that environmentally friendly consumers are mainly woman mccright 2010 in additional women seem less susceptible to social norms that promote bottled water during meals pacheco et al 2018 argue that for women bottled water consumption is a function of quality and safety while males may be more driven by its social and cultural functions in combination with a residual direct effect these mechanisms outweigh women s health and safety concerns about tap water and the fact that women are less inclined to financial considerations less educated groups seem to consume more bottled water because they have more health and safety concerns about tap water compared to higher educated groups possibly higher educated people are better in discerning the scientific information that generally supports tap water quality from other information dupont et al 2010 in addition sociodemographic groups age education and gender seemed to have equal access to tap water based on our findings we cannot conclude that in a flemish context inequality exists in access to tap water services from an equity point of view belgium appears to comply with sdg 6 1 it is especially noteworthy that we did not find educational differences in access to potable tap water because less educated groups tend to live in areas with inferior infrastructures adams et al 2016 however future research may specifically include geographical data because spatial inequalities such as a rural urban divide may still exist bain et al 2014 lastly the idea that bottled water is preferred on special occasions such as the presence of visitors seems uniformly accepted given the variety of influential factors we suggest integrated policy measures that consider the product i e the type of water but also the actor i e the consumer and the social context wherein water is consumed in order to facilitate tap water consumption a social marketing campaign that promotes tap water could be beneficial to this cause see saylor et al 2011 firstly such a campaign should 1 engage in information dissemination and advertising efforts that tackles the negative perceptions many consumers have about tap water and promote its benefits tap water usually receives little or negative publicity debbeler et al 2018 governments and drinking water companies seem to do little to confront the negative claims made about tap water foltz 1999 in this context queiroz et al 2013 point to the disconnect between public investment in infrastructures and provision of adequate information about water supply systems moreover they argue that the absence of communication channels might cause uncertainty about the quality of public water sources and promote distrust in public water supplies the lack of public campaigns may be caused by the fact that drinking water only accounts for a marginal percentage of all tap water used limiting the financial implications of such efforts parag and roberts 2009 in contrast the sale of bottled water has been called the greatest advertising and branding campaign in history because companies package and sell something that is freely available queiroz et al 2012 p 328 furthermore 2 the social marketing campaign should create a social context that promotes tap water instead of inhibiting it on the one hand policy must endeavour to enable tap water consumption governments and tap water companies should optimise tap water supply infrastructures on the other hand the activation and manipulation of social norms shows potential in leveraging behavioural change van der linden 2015 social norms that promote tap water might be activated and stimulated through aforementioned advertising and branding e g bottling eco friendly tap water in reusable bottles lastly 3 knowledge on the sociodemographic characteristics of bottled water consumers allows social marketing campaigns to include and target specific groups i e older people men and less educated groups like all research our study has its limitations one of the limitations of this study is that fact that cross sectional data was used consequently it is hard to draw causal conclusions while perceptions indeed affect behaviour the opposite is also true perceptions and attitudes are often influenced by past experiences in our case the act of drinking a certain type of water potentially influences perceptions about different water sources doria 2010 future research might employ longitudinal techniques in order to gain a better causal understanding of the relationship between perceptions and behaviour additionally we were mainly interested in the nature of social norms in flanders i e whether they promote bottled or tap water future research may further develop these social norms e g looking at their quantitative impact such as the frequency of visits but also differentiating between more occasions moreover social norms are context and culture specific studies might compare social norms cross nationally and cross culturally similarly cross national investigations may compare institutional contexts and supply systems whereas flanders has a relatively good supply system we expect infrastructure issues to play a bigger role in other countries with a less developed system e g juba and tanyanyiwa 2018 in harare zimbabwe future research should also investigate the influence of social networks and interpersonal communication these are important factors that influence perceptions and social norms doria 2010 lastly while we aimed to examine the influence of objective infrastructural issues other studies by levêque and burns 2017 for example include a more subjective measure of tap water infrastructures i e how do people perceive infrastructure quality and maintenance theses studies show the interconnectedness between environmental concerns perceptions on risk taste and infrastructures further research may differentiate between objective and subjective dimensions of infrastructure and how they relate to other perceptions about water types 5 conclusions in this study we found that the consumption of bottled water in flanders is widespread despite environmental and financial considerations in part this can be explained by negative perceptions about tap water these product evaluations however are only part of the story in this study we have shown the importance of socio contextual explanations including the sociodemographic characteristics of consumers and the broader social context wherein water is consumed both future research and policy measures will benefit from an integrated approach that considers the product i e a type of water the actor i e the consumer and the broader social context we suggest three measures that tackle negative perceptions about tap water and create a social context that promotes tap water 1 advertising and branding campaigns that provide an answer to the negative perceptions about tap water and activate social norms that promote tap water consumption 2 ensuring that everybody has access to potable tap water 3 targeted action towards specific groups i e older people males and less educated groups funding sources this was supported by a grant from water link declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18106,while in many countries people have access to cheap and safe potable tap water the global consumption of bottled water is rising flanders belgium where this study is located has an exceptionally high consumption of bottled water per capita however in the interest of resource efficiency and global environmental challenges the consumption of tap water is preferable to our knowledge an integrated analysis of the main reasons why people consume tap and bottled water is absent in flanders belgium using flemish survey data n 2309 we first compared tap and bottled water consumers through bivariate correlation analysis subsequently path modelling techniques were used to further investigate these correlations our results show that bottled water consumption in flanders is widespread despite environmental and financial considerations for a large part this is caused by negative perceptions about tap water many consumers consider it unhealthy unsafe and prefer the taste of bottled water furthermore we found that the broader social context often inhibits the consumption of tap water on the one hand improper infrastructures e g lead piping can limit access to potable tap water on the other hand social norms exist that promote bottled water lastly results suggest that the consumption of bottled water is most common among men older people and less educated groups we conclude that future research and policy measures will benefit from an approach that integrates all behavioural aspects associated with water type consumption this will enable both governments and tap water companies to devise more effective policies to manage and support tap water supply networks graphical abstract image 1 keywords drinking water sustainability pro environmental behaviour quality perceptions 1 introduction environmental challenges such as water scarcity and pollution are increasingly becoming a global concern du plessis 2019 in flanders belgium respectively 94 1 65 8 and 61 9 of the population considers climate change droughts and water pollution as serious problems european commission 2013 2017 the production and consumption of bottled water is a contributor to these problems cole et al 2011 free et al 2014 united states government accountability office 2009 one litre of bottled water requires on average 3 l of water over its entire lifecycle additionally it requires 1000 2000 times more energy to produce bottled water 5 6 10 2 mj 1 1 in comparison to tap water 0 005 mj 1 1 gleick and cooley 2009 pacific institute 2007 therefore tap water is preferable in the interest of resource efficiency bottle manufacturing has a particularly high environmental impact horowitz et al 2018 most single use bottles are made of plastic polyethylene terephthalate pet which is sourced from fossil fuels gleick and cooley 2009 considering that bottled water production reached almost 100 billion gallons in 2017 and considering the worldwide preference for plastic bottles rodwan 2017 bottled water consumption greatly contributes to global plastic pollution the chemical by products of plastic such as phthalates pollute the air water and soil olson 1999 furthermore plastic non biodegradable waste often ends up in nature barnes et al 2009 shaw and sahni 2014 vastly accumulating in landfills water bodies and remote islands jambeck et al 2015 lavers and bond 2017 olson 1999 subsequently ecosystems are disturbed and wildlife is threatened because animals are entangled in plastic debris or ingest it chae and an 2018 wabnitz and nichols 2010 while in many countries people have easy access to cheap and safe potable tap water wilk 2006 bottled water consumption has been increasing on a global scale arnold and larsen 2006 rodwan 2017 in a study of the flanders environment agency 2018b 66 of the participants indicated that they drink bottled water at least half of the time averaging 0 4 l per day flanders has an exceptionally high per capita consumption of bottled water european commission 2013 there appears to be a disconnect between bottled water consumption and its environmental impact saylor et al 2011 paradoxically flanders has played a pioneering role in the development of tap water supply systems the region hosted the first 1902 continuous scheme of water disinfection through chlorine for potable purposes mcguire 2006 white 2010 for the consumption of tap water to be the norm it seems that the development of tap water supply networks is a necessary but insufficient condition extensive insight in water consumption behaviour is critical for the effectiveness of tap water supply networks this will also help governments develop policies that induce behavioural change van der linden 2015 in recent years there has been a growing academic interest in the reasons why people consume tap and bottled water most studies to date have employed a product oriented approach where participants are asked to evaluate a product i e a type of water debbeler et al 2018 these studies have identified four important considerations 1 health and safety concerns about tap water e g ballantine et al 2019 debbeler et al 2018 people often prefer bottled water because they associate tap water with chemicals chlorine sediments etc mcleod et al 2014 rahman et al 2017 ward et al 2009 2 organoleptic properties i e sensorial information such as taste and odour play a major role in water type consumption ballantine et al 2019 doria 2006 debbeler et al 2018 conclude that bottled water consumers indicate taste as a core driver to consume bottled water given that many consumers prefer its taste over tap water moreover people seem to relate organoleptic properties of beverages to its perceived healthiness and safety luckow and delahunty 2004 saylor et al 2011 the taste of tap water is often associated with the presence of unhealthy substances font ribera et al 2017 more recently 3 environmental concerns have been a growing consideration in water type consumption the environmental impact of bottled water might lead people to consume tap water qian 2018 ward et al 2009 this behaviour fits within the larger trend of environmentally friendly consumption leonidou et al 2010 lastly 4 financial considerations might influence consumers in their choice of water van der linden 2015 ward et al 2009 generally tap water is significantly cheaper than bottled water abrahams et al 2000 ferrier 2001 in flanders belgium tap water cost on average 0 005 l flanders environment agency n d in comparison 1 l bottled water costs approximately 0 60 these product oriented approaches often led to voluntarist explanations suggesting that consumers make deliberate choices based on product evaluations e g ballantine et al 2019 ward et al 2009 less attention has been paid to socio contextual explanations including the broader social context wherein water is consumed and the sociodemographic characteristics of consumers firstly the social context could potentially influence individual water consumption behaviour given the fact that consumer decisions are made within a broader context spaargaren and van vliet 2000 on the one hand improper infrastructures e g lead pipes can limit access to potable tap water juba and tanyanyiwa 2018 in this context doria et al 2009 pointed out the need to combine research on product evaluations with more objective and technical approaches that focus on supply reliability on the other hand society installs social norms that define appropriate behaviour and therefore influence consumer decisions higgs 2015 etale et al 2018 show that social norms often promote bottled water particularly on special occasions e g when visitors are present secondly certain sociodemographic characteristics appear to influence water type preferences research indicates that age gender and educational attainment might be relevant factors but consistent evidence about the direction and strength of these associations is still lacking see for example debbeler et al 2018 doria 2010 etale et al 2018 family et al 2019 rosinger et al 2018 xu and lin 2018 sociodemographic influences may also serve as causal antecedents mediated by other factors associated with water type consumption doria 2010 while previous inquiries into the relationship between age and environmentalism found a significant association this relationship is complex grønhøj and thøgersen 2009 in general younger people are more concerned about environmental issues yet research also points out that this does not always translate into environmentally friendly consumption young people seem less likely to make changes in their consumption behaviour kagawa 2007 in general environmentally friendly consumers tend to be older casalo and escario 2018 which might translate into a preference for tap water among older people two opposing effects are hypothesised with respect to gender woman generally perceive tap water as more hazardous anadu and harding 2000 juba and tanyanyiwa 2018 saylor et al 2011 but are also more concerned about environmental issues mccright 2010 in addition highly educated consumers may favour tap water because they tend to have less health and safety concerns ochoo et al 2017 park et al 2019 and possess a greater general environmental concern franzen and meyer 2009 against this background we analysed the main reasons why people consume tap and bottled water in flanders belgium flanders is a particularly noteworthy case because it has both an excellent tap water supply network and relatively high levels of environmental concern among its population european commission 2017 yet bottled water consumption is exceptionally high in this region european commission 2013 in order to explain this paradoxical situation we suggest an integrated analysis of the behavioural aspect associated with water type consumption to this end we coupled product oriented approaches to socio contextual explanations in our integrated approach we considered the product i e a type of water the actor i e the sociodemographic characteristics of consumers and the broader social context wherein water is consumed extensive insight into the behavioural aspects associated with the consumption of tap and bottled water will enable both governments and tap water companies to device more effective strategies to manage and support tap water supply networks van der linden 2015 2 materials and methods 2 1 data acquisition the questionnaire for our survey was led by the flemish water knowledge center vlakwa vito an agency facilitating knowledge transfer on water in flanders belgium in 2018 the online survey the water survey among the citizens was launched citizens of the flemish region of belgium could answer a variety of questions regarding water related attitudes and behaviours the questionnaire was carried out through an online application using limesurvey a company specialised in online surveys the survey was first introduced by the flemish radio to augment response rates the questionnaire was additionally dispersed through social media advertised by public figures and distributed with the newsletters of the federation of flemish water and sewage managers aquaflanders and vlakwa a total of 2345 individuals participated in the survey only participants above the age of 18 were included in the subsequent analysis additionally 24 participants were manually excluded due to incomplete data ultimately the assessment was performed on 2309 participants given that the overall distribution of the participants sociodemographic characteristics gender education age and residence did not fully align with the general flemish demographics eurostat 2018 statbel 2019 statistics flanders 2019 a specific set of poststratification weights was introduced to ensure the survey s representativity towards the target population this weighing was achieved by dividing the population proportion by the sample proportion for each group subsequently weights were multiplied after weighting the sample distribution was in line with the general population characteristics cf table 1 2 2 variables water type consumption was measured by inquiring participants about the amount of tap water that they consume at home relative to bottled water i e how frequently do you drink tap water instead of bottled water at home participants could reply to the questions based on a five point scale 1 always 5 seldom or never the scale was reversed thus high scores on the scale were associated with increased consumption of tap water relative to bottled water to assess the impact of product evaluations four questions were used health and safety concerns were questioned using a six point scale 1 totally disagree 6 totally agree with the following statement tap water in flanders is safe and healthy this response scale was reversed to construct a variable where high scores indicated high health and safety concerns about tap water the same unreversed response scale was used to identify general environmentally friendly consumers item it is clear to me what environmentally friendly products and pesticides are and i am willing to use them high scores were associated with environmentally friendly consumers furthermore respondents were asked why they consume bottled water taste preferences was one of the answer categories based on this question a dummy variable was constructed for taste preferences score 1 the participant preferred the taste of bottled water participants were additionally inquired about the amount of money they spend on drinking water participants who were able to estimate their spending habits on drinking water were considered to take into account the financial consequences of consumer decisions this response was translated into a proxy variable with dummy coding 1 denoted an inclination to financial considerations to estimate the influence of the broader social context four questions were used an improper infrastructure was measured by two items i have lead pipes and i do not have access to tap water these items were combined into one dummy variable score 1 indicated limited access to potable tap water social norms were measured using two dummies items bottled water present better during meals and if i have visitors i prefer bottled water lastly sociodemographic characteristics include age ranging from 18 to 86 gender score 1 female and the highest educational attainment of the head of the household i e primary provider of the household income primary education or less secondary education tertiary education 2 3 research setup the analysis in this study was conducted stepwise we started with descriptive statistics to evaluate water type consumption in the flemish context secondly we used spearman correlations to analyse bivariate associations and to compare the characteristics of bottled water consumers with tap water consumers thirdly path modelling techniques were used to further investigate the interrelation between the variables associated with water type consumption resulting in a path model with 12 variables such model is comprised of causal chains i e direct and indirect relationships between variables duncan 1966 modelling causal chains has proven to be a valuable approach to research on water type consumption in the past e g doria et al 2005 doria et al 2009 levêque and burns 2017 in this paper we were able to investigate the potentially mediated relationship between water type consumption and sociodemographic characteristics to estimate a causal model that fits well with our data we used the software package mplus our path model was constructed with both binary and continuous outcome variables consequently the model combined linear regressions when the outcome was continuous with non linear regressions i e logit or probit regression when the outcome was binary specifically using a robust weighted least square estimator wlsmv linear regression coefficients were estimated when the outcome variable was continuous and probit coefficients were estimated when the outcome was binary muthén and muthén 1998 2017 model fit evaluation was based on multiple fit statistics as recommended by kline 2015 χ 2 test comparative fit index cfi standardised root mean square residual srmr and root mean square error of approximation rmsea cut off points for fit statistics provide a indicative tool for model evaluation lai and green 2016 standards in this analysis were borrowed from hooper et al 2007 and kline 2015 the χ 2 test should be significant p 0 05 but a large sample size as is the case in this analysis may cause the test to be unreliable srmr and rmsea 0 05 indicate a good fit while fit values below 0 08 are often seen as acceptable whereas initial standards claimed that cfi 0 9 indicates a bad fit recent recommendations require cfi 0 95 for a good fit given that fit indices should be evaluated together instead of independently kline 2015 0 9 cfi 0 95 was considered acceptable in combination with srmr and rmsea scores 0 05 3 results 3 1 descriptive statistics in our data almost 45 of the participants indicated that they drink bottled water half the time or more cf table 2 furthermore 90 agreed when asked whether they are environmentally friendly consumers and almost 60 kept track of their spending habits on drinking water there appears to be a cognitive disconnect between the consumption of bottled water on the one hand and environmental and financial considerations on the other hand among our participants only 20 considered tap water completely healthy and safe most participants seemed to perceive tap water as relatively healthy and safe but not entirely in 15 2 of cases taste preferences were indicated as drivers to consume bottled water instead of tap water furthermore 3 1 of our participants had no access to potable tap water at the time of the survey lastly 10 of participants said to consume bottled water because it presents better during meals and more than 25 indicated to prefer bottled water when visitors are present 3 2 correlations analysis a spearman correlation analysis was used to evaluate bivariate correlations between water type consumption on the one hand and product evaluations and socio contextual factors on the other hand cf fig 1 positive correlations indicated a positive correlation with the consumption of tap water relative to the consumption of bottled water results showed that both product evaluations and socio contextual explanations were significantly correlated with water type consumption the consumption of tap water seemed negatively correlated with risk perceptions ρ 0 408 p 0 001 and taste preferences ρ 0 386 p 0 001 suggesting that bottled water consumers may have higher health and safety concerns about tap water and consider its taste inferior to bottled water tap water consumers were more likely to be environmentally friendly consumers ρ 0 140 p 0 001 and inclined to financial considerations ρ 0 071 p 0 001 the negative correlation between the consumption of tap water and access to potable tap water ρ 0 080 p 0 001 showed that people who do not have access to potable tap water consume significantly more bottled water furthermore social norms played a role in water type consumption tap water consumption was negatively correlated with the perception that bottled water presents better during meals ρ 0 055 p 0 01 moreover a significant positive correlation was found between the consumption of tap water and the perception that bottled water is preferred when visitors are present ρ 0 171 p 0 001 this suggests the existence of a group that predominantly drinks tap water but deliberately consumes bottled water when visitors are present lastly all sociodemographic characteristics were significantly correlated with water type consumption younger participants ρ 0 093 p 0 001 women ρ 0 046 p 0 05 and families where the head of the household is highly educated ρ 0 152 p 0 001 on average reported a higher consumption of tap water 3 3 path model to further investigate the bivariate correlations discussed above we employed path modelling techniques cf duncan 1966 given the binary outcome variables in the model a robust weighted least square estimator wlsmv was used to achieve this muthén and muthén 1998 2017 in total two models were estimated the model fit of the first model cf fig 2 indicated that improvements could be made χ 2 234 36 p 0 001 cfi 0 66 srmr 0 079 rmsea 0 066 using lagrange multipliers or modification indices as they are often referred to we were able to find ways in which our model could be improved bentler 2010 in combination with theoretical arguments some covariance between mediators was accounted for in a secondary model cf fig 3 firstly social norms were allowed to covariate additionally covariance between health and safety concerns and taste preferences was included because previous research shows a correlation between the two font ribera et al 2017 finally the secondary model included covariance between social norms when visitors are present on the one hand and the variables on risk perceptions taste preferences and access to potable tap water on the other hand overall an acceptable fit was reached for the secondary model χ 2 78 83 p 0 001 cfi 0 90 srmr 0 049 rmsea 0 041 moreover the secondary model explains more than half of the variance in water type consumption r 2 0 52 the standardized direct and indirect effects discovered in the secondary model are visually represented in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively this model confirmed that participants with health and safety concerns about tap water consumed more bottled water std β 0 277 p 0 001 the inferior taste of tap water was another reason to consume bottled water std β 0 444 p 0 001 environmental std β 0 131 p 0 001 and financial considerations std β 0 129 p 0 001 seemed to be positively associated with the consumption of tap water participants without access to potable tap water consumed significantly more bottled water std β 0 152 p 0 001 furthermore the perception that bottled water presents better during meals was negatively associated with the consumption of tap water std β 0 178 p 0 01 additionally a positive relation was found between the perception that bottled water is preferred in the presence of visitors and the consumption of tap water std β 0 215 p 0 001 this confirms the existence of a group of predominantly tap water consumers who deliberately serve bottled water to their visitors overall a strong link between the sociodemographic characteristics of consumers and water type consumption was found in the data the bivariate analysis revealed a negative relationship between age and the consumption of tap water the path model suggested that environmental std β 0 143 p 0 001 and financial considerations std β 0 265 p 0 001 were more common among older participants in contrast taste preferences for bottled water std β 0 149 p 0 001 and the perception that bottled water presents better during meals std β 0 185 p 0 001 were less common among the older generations while the indirect relationship between age and the consumption of tap water was positive this seemed to be compensated by a negative direct effect std β 0 188 p 0 001 in other words older participants consumed more bottled water than younger people despite the fact that they were more likely to consider the environmental and financial impact of consumer decision and that they were less likely to indicate taste and social norms as reasons for drinking bottled water it thus seems that there are reasons external to our model e g generational effects that drive older people to consume bottled water with respect to gender a bivariate positive relationship was found suggesting that women consume relatively more tap water than men whereas women had more health and safety concerns std β 0 104 p 0 001 and were less inclined to financial considerations std β 0 224 p 0 001 these positive indirect effects are compensated by a positive direct effect std β 0 076 p 0 01 and negative indirect effects generally environmentally friendly consumption was more common among women std β 0 062 p 0 05 the perception that bottles present better during meals seemed less common amongst women std β 0 127 p 0 01 put in another way women consumed more tap water than men despite health and safety concerns and the fact that they were less inclined to financial considerations in part this could be explained by the finding that female participants were more likely to be environmentally friendly consumers and less susceptible to social norms that promote bottled water during meals lastly the level of education was negatively correlated with the consumption of bottled water this could be explained by the fact that health and safety concerns about tap water were less common among higher educated groups std β 0 188 p 0 001 additionally we found a positive direct relation between higher education and the consumption of tap water std β 0 097 p 0 05 lastly significant covariances between mediators were observed cf table 3 the results showed a positive association between social norms i e the idea that bottles present better during meals and that they are preferred when visitors are present std cov 0 384 p 0 001 furthermore a positive association between health and safety concerns and taste preferences was found std cov 0 281 p 0 001 suggesting that people who dislike the taste of tap water perceived tap water as less healthy and safe and vice versa lastly a negative covariance was found between the perception that bottled water is preferred in the presence of visitors on the one hand and taste preferences std cov 0 221 p 0 001 risk perceptions about tap water std cov 0 109 p 0 01 and access to potable tap water std cov 0 190 p 0 05 on the other hand these findings suggest that occasional bottled water consumers serve bottled water to their visitors due to social norms yet have no taste preferences for bottled water less health and safety concerns about bottled water and no limitations in access to potable tap water 4 discussion in the interest of resource efficiency and global environmental challenges such as water scarcity and pollution tap water is preferable to bottled water gleick and cooley 2009 tap water is a short chain product with a minimum footprint as infrastructures are all in place for other non potable uses of tap water despite the fact that many countries provide cheap and safe potable tap water wilk 2006 the consumption of bottled water is rising worldwide arnold and larsen 2006 rodwan 2017 in flanders belgium the situation is particularly puzzling this region has an exceptionally high per capita consumptions of bottled water european commission 2013 in combination with an excellent tap water supply network and a population with relatively high environmental concerns european commission 2017 to support the use of tap water supply networks and develop more effective policies to induce behavioural change it is vital to understand water consumption behaviour van der linden 2015 in this article we aimed to provide an integrated analysis of the main reasons why people consume tap and bottled water to this end we complemented the product oriented approach of previous research with a more contextualised approach as a testament to the comprehensive nature of our study we were able to explain more than 50 of the differences in water type consumption we found that environmental and financial considerations drive people to consume tap water yet the consumption of bottled water is widespread in flanders with almost 45 of our participants drinking bottled water at home at least half the time this is in stark contrast with the fact that approximately 90 of the participants indicated that they are willing to buy environmentally friendly products and the fact that approximately 60 of the participants kept track of their water spending habits there appears to be a disconnect between individual water consumption behaviour environmental consequences and financial consideration in particular the disconnect between bottled water consumption and its environmental impact is substantial similar findings have been described by debbeler et al 2018 as the water consumption paradox the results show that part of this paradox can be explained by contextual factors that inhibit tap water consumption our findings firstly signal social norms in flanders that promote bottled water brei and tadajewski 2015 argue that these norms are potentially caused by marketing and branding campaigns of bottled water companies in addition bottled water has historically been more high status wilk 2006 social norms are typically augmented on special occasions e g in the event that visitors are present presenting bottled water to visitors might be a sign of status appreciation and respect etale et al 2018 our survey further suggests that approximately 3 of the flemish population of belgium does not have access to potable tap water at home similarly flemish official statistics indicate that 2 3 of flemish households are not connected to the tap water network flanders environment agency 2017 in contrast belgium s progress reports on sustainable development goal sdg 6 1 i e universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all united nations 2019 p 7 21 indicate that 100 of the population has access to basic drinking water sources sachs et al 2019 this includes all water sources tap water wells springs rainwater and packaged water such as bottled water that can be reached within a 30 min round trip world health organisation 2017 for 1 6 of the populations these sources are not always available at home sachs et al 2019 our results suggest that this may be caused by lead piping which drives people to consume bottled water moreover based on our survey an estimated 1 2 has a privately managed water well at home households with these wells seem to consume significantly more bottled water it appears that water wells are only minimally used for drinking purposes see also flanders environment agency 2018b although belgium seems compliant to sdg 6 1 sustainability objectives should focus more on access to tap water supply networks furthermore our study confirms that the water consumption paradox is also caused by the negative perceptions many consumers have about tap water the consumption of bottled water is most common among people who perceive tap water as unhealthy and unsafe moreover bottled water consumers often perceive the taste of tap water as inferior in line with the study van der linden 2015 conducted in the netherlands we found that the influence of environmental and financial considerations is less salient than the influence of risk perceptions and taste preferences about tap water similar to the findings of levêque and burns 2017 we found a strong connection between these risk perceptions and taste preferences furthermore public perceptions about tap water appear to be negatively biased during blind taste experiments participants have been unable to differentiate between tap and bottled water e g debbeler et al 2018 wells 2005 additionally many studies fail to prove that tap water is less healthy and safe than bottled water e g ahmad and bajahlan 2009 lalumandier and ayers 2000 moreover the legal framework for quality control is more stringent for tap water than for bottled water ca 60 parameters are used for the quality control of tap water and tap water producers screen for additional organics vlaamse overheid 2002 furthermore belgium reports 99 6 compliance with european and flemish quality regulations flanders environment agency 2018a in contrast these regulations do not always apply to bottled water flanders environment agency 2018a moreover studies have questioned the quality of bottled water calling for an improved framework of control cidu et al 2011 zamberlan da silva et al 2008 furthermore the healthiness of plastic bottled water is questioned because microplastics originating from the packaging may infiltrate the drinking water mason et al 2018 consequently perceptions about tap water are often based on subjective judgements instead of objective differences anadu and harding 2000 slovic 1987 they are augmented by media coverage of drinking water problems and water pollution anadu and harding 2000 parag and roberts 2009 and by distrust of governments and the tap water industry doria et al 2009 macgregor and fleming 1996 ironically this distrust might be partly caused by environmental groups that call attention to water pollution and the government s inactivity foltz 1999 in addition the impact of bottled water producers should not be neglected because they are powerful market agents that shape consumer perceptions brei and tadajewski 2015 they promote their products as healthy and pure implying that tap water is not doria 2006 ferrier 2001 wilk 2006 in terms of sociodemographic differences the consumption of bottled water appears most common among older people men and less educated groups for age this seems to be explained by a residual direct effect unrelated to any mediator in our model given the comprehensive nature of our model this most likely points to a cohort effect instead of variables not included in the model this means that generational differences might be explained by shared temporal life experiences e g the growth of the market for bottled water during the 1960s and 1970s and the subsequent marketing campaigns brei and tadajewski 2015 furthermore we confirm that environmentally friendly consumers are mainly woman mccright 2010 in additional women seem less susceptible to social norms that promote bottled water during meals pacheco et al 2018 argue that for women bottled water consumption is a function of quality and safety while males may be more driven by its social and cultural functions in combination with a residual direct effect these mechanisms outweigh women s health and safety concerns about tap water and the fact that women are less inclined to financial considerations less educated groups seem to consume more bottled water because they have more health and safety concerns about tap water compared to higher educated groups possibly higher educated people are better in discerning the scientific information that generally supports tap water quality from other information dupont et al 2010 in addition sociodemographic groups age education and gender seemed to have equal access to tap water based on our findings we cannot conclude that in a flemish context inequality exists in access to tap water services from an equity point of view belgium appears to comply with sdg 6 1 it is especially noteworthy that we did not find educational differences in access to potable tap water because less educated groups tend to live in areas with inferior infrastructures adams et al 2016 however future research may specifically include geographical data because spatial inequalities such as a rural urban divide may still exist bain et al 2014 lastly the idea that bottled water is preferred on special occasions such as the presence of visitors seems uniformly accepted given the variety of influential factors we suggest integrated policy measures that consider the product i e the type of water but also the actor i e the consumer and the social context wherein water is consumed in order to facilitate tap water consumption a social marketing campaign that promotes tap water could be beneficial to this cause see saylor et al 2011 firstly such a campaign should 1 engage in information dissemination and advertising efforts that tackles the negative perceptions many consumers have about tap water and promote its benefits tap water usually receives little or negative publicity debbeler et al 2018 governments and drinking water companies seem to do little to confront the negative claims made about tap water foltz 1999 in this context queiroz et al 2013 point to the disconnect between public investment in infrastructures and provision of adequate information about water supply systems moreover they argue that the absence of communication channels might cause uncertainty about the quality of public water sources and promote distrust in public water supplies the lack of public campaigns may be caused by the fact that drinking water only accounts for a marginal percentage of all tap water used limiting the financial implications of such efforts parag and roberts 2009 in contrast the sale of bottled water has been called the greatest advertising and branding campaign in history because companies package and sell something that is freely available queiroz et al 2012 p 328 furthermore 2 the social marketing campaign should create a social context that promotes tap water instead of inhibiting it on the one hand policy must endeavour to enable tap water consumption governments and tap water companies should optimise tap water supply infrastructures on the other hand the activation and manipulation of social norms shows potential in leveraging behavioural change van der linden 2015 social norms that promote tap water might be activated and stimulated through aforementioned advertising and branding e g bottling eco friendly tap water in reusable bottles lastly 3 knowledge on the sociodemographic characteristics of bottled water consumers allows social marketing campaigns to include and target specific groups i e older people men and less educated groups like all research our study has its limitations one of the limitations of this study is that fact that cross sectional data was used consequently it is hard to draw causal conclusions while perceptions indeed affect behaviour the opposite is also true perceptions and attitudes are often influenced by past experiences in our case the act of drinking a certain type of water potentially influences perceptions about different water sources doria 2010 future research might employ longitudinal techniques in order to gain a better causal understanding of the relationship between perceptions and behaviour additionally we were mainly interested in the nature of social norms in flanders i e whether they promote bottled or tap water future research may further develop these social norms e g looking at their quantitative impact such as the frequency of visits but also differentiating between more occasions moreover social norms are context and culture specific studies might compare social norms cross nationally and cross culturally similarly cross national investigations may compare institutional contexts and supply systems whereas flanders has a relatively good supply system we expect infrastructure issues to play a bigger role in other countries with a less developed system e g juba and tanyanyiwa 2018 in harare zimbabwe future research should also investigate the influence of social networks and interpersonal communication these are important factors that influence perceptions and social norms doria 2010 lastly while we aimed to examine the influence of objective infrastructural issues other studies by levêque and burns 2017 for example include a more subjective measure of tap water infrastructures i e how do people perceive infrastructure quality and maintenance theses studies show the interconnectedness between environmental concerns perceptions on risk taste and infrastructures further research may differentiate between objective and subjective dimensions of infrastructure and how they relate to other perceptions about water types 5 conclusions in this study we found that the consumption of bottled water in flanders is widespread despite environmental and financial considerations in part this can be explained by negative perceptions about tap water these product evaluations however are only part of the story in this study we have shown the importance of socio contextual explanations including the sociodemographic characteristics of consumers and the broader social context wherein water is consumed both future research and policy measures will benefit from an integrated approach that considers the product i e a type of water the actor i e the consumer and the broader social context we suggest three measures that tackle negative perceptions about tap water and create a social context that promotes tap water 1 advertising and branding campaigns that provide an answer to the negative perceptions about tap water and activate social norms that promote tap water consumption 2 ensuring that everybody has access to potable tap water 3 targeted action towards specific

18107,streams and rivers are now recognized to be sites of intense carbon c emissions yet the lack of c emission estimates that integrate beyond individual river systems has slowed their inclusion in landscape c budgets here we apply empirical models of co 2 and ch 4 concentrations and gas exchange continuously along entire fluvial networks to derive the total fluvial co 2 and ch 4 emissions in large 3000 to 30 000 km2 watersheds located across the boreal biome of québec canada we assess how total fluvial network c emissions vary with landscape and climate properties and compare their magnitude to other components of the landscape c budget the total fluvial network emissions expressed as per unit watershed area ranged from 0 7 to 29 2 g c m 2 yr 1 for co 2 and 4 1780 mg c m 2 yr 1 for ch 4 and neither was related to watershed area or drainage density rather watershed slope and terrestrial net productivity were major drivers of the integrated network fluvial emissions we also show that steeper watersheds had a greater proportion of emissions relative to downstream export of c from the watershed integrated fluvial emissions are of the same magnitude as the terrestrial c sink yet these two fundamental components of the boreal landscape c budget are not tightly coupled keywords carbon river networks aquatic ecosystems carbon dioxide methane 1 introduction the continental biosphere plays an important role in the global c cycle as both a source and a sink to the atmosphere global and regional terrestrial c models require accounting for both input and loss terms and lateral export of c to inland waters is now recognized a major loss component of terrestrial ecosystems cole et al 2007 ciais et al 2008 battin et al 2009 turner et al 2013 butman et al 2016 ussiri and lal 2017 zscheischler et al 2017 this lateral loss involves the movement of organic and inorganic soil derived c into inland waters kindler et al 2011 deirmendjian and abril 2018 and is critically important not only to the functioning of the receiving systems but also in shaping the net c balance of the terrestrial ecosystem itself once in the aquatic ecosystem terrestrially derived c is either buried in aquatic sediments tranvik et al 2009 ferland et al 2014 heathcote et al 2015 mendonça et al 2017 outgassed to the atmosphere mostly as co 2 raymond et al 2013 drake et al 2017 or ultimately reaches the ocean meybeck 1982 sarmiento and sundquist 1992 ludwig and probst 1996 regnier et al 2013 of these three fates terrestrially derived c outgassed to the atmosphere is likely the largest in magnitude but the least well quantified drake et al 2017 the terrestrial c returned to the atmosphere is mostly in the form of co 2 cole et al 2007 either through the direct emission of terrestrially derived co 2 or the degradation of soil derived organic matter to co 2 within the aquatic ecosystem and subsequent emission cole and caraco 2001 duarte and prairie 2005 aufdenkampe et al 2011 hotchkiss et al 2015 in addition the delivery of terrestrial organic c to inland waters also strongly influences their metabolism and among other processes the production and subsequent emission of ch 4 further influencing the regional greenhouse gas ghg and warming potential budgets streams and rivers typically occupy much smaller surface areas than lakes in most watersheds yet they represent the most biogeochemically active land water interfaces mcclain et al 2003 it is now recognized that a significant fraction of the return of terrestrially derived c to the atmosphere occurs within fluvial networks lundin et al 2013 wallin et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 rasilo et al 2017 hutchins et al 2017 horgby et al 2019 these fluvial c emissions represent a component of the landscape net ecosystem exchange nee that is seldom accounted for but which is now increasingly recognized as of potential regional significance jonsson et al 2007 karlsson et al 2010 buffam et al 2011 lundin et al 2016 webb et al 2018 within a given fluvial network riverine co 2 and ch 4 fluxes vary as a function of local properties including topography wallin et al 2011 surrounding riparian soils öquist et al 2009 rasilo et al 2017 flury and ulseth 2019 and position along the hydrological continuum crawford et al 2013 hotchkiss et al 2015 wallin et al 2018 all of which may in turn co vary with groundwater c inputs lupon et al 2019 as well as local physical conditions that will determine gas exchange raymond et al 2012 rocher ros et al 2019 there may be thus large heterogeneity in riverine fluxes within a given watershed and indeed much research has been devoted over the past decades to understanding the magnitude and regulation of reach specific river c dynamics and ghg fluxes kling et al 1992 jones and mulholland 1998 hope et al 2004 wallin et al 2011 rasilo et al 2017 rocher ros et al 2019 from a landscape c perspective however it is not the features at the reach scale that matter but rather the integrated fluvial network c emission that is the metric of interest because this is the most relevant scale in the context of watershed or regional c budgets it is also commensurable with other key elements of the landscape c budget such as soil c accumulation or net primary production npp and is an essential component of the terrestrial lateral c loss equation together with downstream riverine c export from whole watersheds contrary to the latter flux which can be relatively easily quantified by repeatedly sampling one single outflow that captures the net export from the entire riverine network within the watershed the integrated fluvial c emissions from an entire network cannot be derived from any single measurement made within the network this is because the total fluvial emission is a network property that results from the complex interactions of at least three major groups of drivers 1 the configuration of the fluvial network itself in terms of density and size distribution of streams and overall network architecture 2 biogeochemical which influence the inputs and rates of processing of the various c species present in the stream waters 3 physical and hydrological which determine water transport velocity and turbulence and therefore the movement of gases and air water exchange these three sets of drivers do not necessarily co vary at the landscape scale for example hutchins et al 2019 showed that the baseline amount of c that circulates within fluvial networks differs between regions likely as a function of watershed npp and soil organic c content this baseline fluvial c appears to be unrelated to network configuration alone such that the integrated fluvial emissions should vary between regions as a function of all these drivers in addition these drivers may be operating differently on co 2 and ch 4 such that the integrated fluvial emissions of one gas cannot be derived from the other therefore the total integrated fluvial c gas emissions themselves become a distinct property not just of the fluvial network but of the landscape as a whole whose drivers are not necessarily those that are acting at the reach scale current fluvial research has increasingly focused on upscaling river emissions at various spatial scales but interestingly these efforts provide little insight on the actual magnitude and control of integrated fluvial emissions across watersheds and regions for the most part previous studies tend to propagate average values across rivers or utilise single drivers as an upscaling tool and therefore fail to capture the biogeochemical hydrologic and geomorphologic interactions that underlie this inherent landscape property as a result we lack a basic understanding not only of the actual magnitude of integrated fluvial network fluxes but also of the actual drivers of this network property and its potential connections to climate or environmental factors this understanding is particularly important for the boreal biome which is a major global terrestrial net sink of c steinkamp and gruber 2015 but which also contains one of the densest and most complex fluvial networks on earth a few studies have attempted to derive some form of total fluvial c emissions for entire boreal watersheds jonsson et al 2007 lundin et al 2013 but none to date has attempted to assess how this variable varies with watershed and network properties and along large scale regional environmental topographic and climatic gradients here we present the first study to explicitly attempt to quantify the integrated fluvial network c co 2 and ch 4 emissions from a range of watersheds distributed across the boreal region of québec to do this we have taken a suite of empirical models and propagated them at large scales throughout the entire river networks of 19 major watersheds within the boreal biome of québec fig 1 this approach combines three categories of models 1 network configuration the stream network was defined using high resolution digital elevation models dems to obtain the network configuration and relevant parameters for each point flow distance elevation channel slope 2 network biogeochemistry we used empirical models of riverine co 2 and ch 4 concentrations at any given point in the network that account for both cross regional as well as within network variability hutchins et al 2019 3 network physical exchange published empirical models methods natchimuthu et al 2017 were used to obtain high resolution gas exchange coefficients k from stream morphology and modeled water velocity and we applied these models to obtain a specific k for each point distributed along the entire network we combined the high resolution modeled p co 2 p ch 4 and k at each river position to derive an actual modeled flux at each river point these were then summed across all stream points to derive an integrated network emission for each of our 19 target watersheds we further assess how this landscape property varies across these watersheds as a function of landscape and climate properties and explore how it relates to other landscape level c metrics these watersheds range widely in size and this allows us to further explore the potential watershed allometry of the integrated fluvial c emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 stream network modeling here we apply a stream network modeling approach to quantify integrated network c co 2 and ch 4 emissions in our study area hutchins et al 2020 high resolution digital elevation models dems 23 m 23 m and waterbody polygons from the national hydrological network nhn were obtained from geogratis http geogratis cgdi gc ca the stream network was modeled using dems and the hydrology toolbox in arcgis 10 for 19 watersheds from the nhn fig 1 after the stream network of each watershed was modeled in arcgis 10 using the canadian digital elevation model cdem the resulting stream was in raster or pixel format waterbody polygons from the nhn includes lakes ponds and large rivers the nhn waterbody polygons were manually corrected to remove large rivers leaving only lakes and ponds the corrected polygons were then converted to rasters pixels of the same resolution of the cdem and the modeled stream network the stream network modeled under the waterbodies excluding rivers was then removed so there were no streams allowed under lakes the resulting stream network pixels were converted to points for the purpose of applying additional information to each modeled point from rasters of elevation from cdem flow length from arcgis hydrology toolbox and strahler order from arcgis hydrology toolbox values for both were applied to every point 2 1 1 stream area widths were modeled here on the basis of a relationship of 173 rivers and streams measurements fig s1 in boreal québec from hutchins et al 2019 which included these measurements 173 streams out of 190 sampled this continuous width model yielded similar values as downing et al 2012 as seen in fig s5 this model of width based on flow length was applied to every stream point where w is width m and l is flow length m 1 log w 0 0958 log l 2 0 954 log l 2 023 r 2 0 58 n 173 the stream area a associated to each point was calculated by multiplying the modeled width w by the distance d between stream points 2 a w d 2 1 2 discharge and velocity we used a watershed area km2 and mean annual discharge m3 s 1 relationship we developed here fig s2 from long term monitoring of 54 streams table s1 and rivers across northern québec we applied this model to the watershed area of the modeled watersheds to estimate discharge 3 log q 0 96 log a 3 62 r 2 0 99 n 54 additionally we modeled velocity m s 1 fig s3 for each stream point using discharge m3 s 1 and width m based on a relationship we developed from 287 stream gauging measurements from hutchins 2019 4 v e x p 0 866 l o g q 1 419 l o g w 1 578 r 2 0 86 n 287 2 1 3 pco2 and pch4 propagation the atlas of the biosphere was used to obtain net primary production npp foley et al 1996 from which an average was calculated for each nhn watershed table s2 the watersheds in the northern regions were cut at 69 2 w to the west and 55 5 n to the north since high latitude and low elevation landscapes with discontinuous permafrost were outside the model parameters p co 2 and p ch 4 were modeled using the relationships developed by hutchins et al 2019 which were based on 190 measurements made across the watersheds modeled in this study the p co 2 model from hutchins et al 2019 which included downstream distance and npp showed reasonable agreement between other boreal study areas the p ch 4 model from hutchins et al 2019 included elevation rather than downstream distance in addition to npp both p co 2 and p ch 4 models included an average npp value npp kg m 2 yr 1 for the nhn watersheds table s2 p co 2 μatm was modeled based on flow length l m to each point in the modeled stream network and the watershed npp 5 p c o 2 e x p 0 293 log l 4 480 n p p 8 304 similarly pch4 μatm was modeled for each stream point using elevation e m and npp for each watershed 6 p c h 4 e x p 0 00328 log e 15 742 n p p 0 318 using these two models a p co 2 and p ch 4 value was assigned to every point in the modeled stream network fig s4 shows an example of a portion of the stream network modeled for co 2 2 1 4 gas exchange gas exchange coefficient k600 values fig 2 fig s5 were applied to each stream point based on water velocity m s 1 and slope from natchimuthu et al 2017 7 k

k600 was capped at 100 since higher values are unrealistic in our watersheds and with our pco2 values rocher ros et al 2019 these k600 values were then applied to each stream point and converted to k co 2 and k ch 4 using schmidt numbers wanninkhof 1992 which were used to calculate a point flux of co 2 and ch 4 regional co2 schmidt numbers s c c o 2 were calculated on regional temperature t where 8 s c c o 2 1911 1 118 11 t 3 4527 t 2 0 041320 t 3 k600 values m d 1 were then converted to k c o 2 using the regional s c c o 2 9 k c o 2 k 600 s c c o 2 600 0 67 similarly regional ch4 schmidt

multiplied by the area that corresponds to each stream point see above resulting in the total co 2 and ch 4 emission for each stream section associated to a point the co 2 and ch 4 emissions of every stream section were summed for each of nhn 19 watersheds fig 1 resulting in total daily fluvial emissions from the entire stream network surface in a given watershed total annual emissions were estimated by multiplying the average fluxes by 214 days which represents an average ice free period 184 days plus an additional 30 days to account for the spring melt and winter emissions as used in

generated for each of the empirical models we used then for each of the 10 000 iterations coefficients were randomly selected from a normal distribution constrained by the variance covariance matrices total emission values reported in the text figures and tables correspond to the median and 90 confidence interval of the monte carlo simulations 2 3 landscape and climate properties and other components of the landscape c budget average watershed slope derived from dems annual net ecosystem production nep from turner et al 2013 mean annual temperature mat from new et al 1999 and surface soil organic c from tarnocai et al 2011 were calculated with the watershed polygons from nhn using the spatial analyst toolbox in arcgis similarly watershed area was calculated using the nhn watershed polygons these landscape factors slope nep mat soil c and watershed area were compared to network co 2 and ch 4 emissions using spearman s rank correlation mean annual discharge for each watershed was derived from a discharge area relationship developed using 54 gauged watershed distributed throughout northern québec table s1 doc and dic concentrations for the high order rivers were obtained from hutchins et al 2019 for the regions containing the modeled watersheds table s3 for each watershed doc and dic concentrations were multiplied by modeled mean annual discharge and divided by watershed area to provide an estimate of export from the watershed upstream the estimated long term average discharge from the relationship in fig s2 was then multiplied by the regional doc and dic concentrations mg l 1 hutchins et al 2019 table s3 in high order rivers for the corresponding watersheds this provided an estimate of annual export of both doc and dic for each watershed the annual doc and dic export was then divided by watershed area for an estimate of lateral yields or area specific export 3 results and discussion 3 1 watershed and stream network properties the study watersheds ranged from 2800 to 29 000 km2 and were chosen to represent the major gradients in topography vegetation cover geology and climate that exist within the boreal biome of québec see details in table 1 the stream network comprised 0 21 0 96 of the total area of each of these watersheds with an overall average of 0 38 table 1 this is comparable to allen et al 2018 and downing et al 2012 that concluded that streams and rivers likely cover 0 58 and 0 30 0 56 of the global land surface respectively first order streams dominated the stream length in all watersheds 42 also similar to the downing et al 2012 global estimate of 52 but only accounted for an average of 14 of the total stream network surface area the contribution of order 1 streams to total fluvial surface varied greatly among watersheds from 5 to 18 and within this range of watersheds the contribution of small order streams to total stream surface did not have a clear pattern with watershed size the average contribution of subsequent stream orders hovered around 10 15 fig s6 a critical aspect of this exercise is to obtain a robust estimate of the total stream surface for each of these networks and since this cannot be derived from gis methods for determining stream areas are highly uncertain especially at large scales and it is a significant challenge in any upscaling exercise using empirical models based on measurements is one method that can help approximate stream areas within a study region to this end we developed an empirical model to derive stream width based on flow length see methods section for details that is effective across the boreal biome of québec fig s1 and which yields values that generally agree with a previous published model of global stream width fig s7 downing et al 2012 3 2 modeled fluvial co 2 and ch 4 surface concentrations as a first step we modeled p co 2 continuously along the stream network on the basis of flow length position and watershed npp based on empirical models previously developed for these same regions hutchins et al 2019 fig s4 the modeled p co 2 declined downstream in all fluvial networks which is a direct result of the model structure and the general downstream behaviour of co 2 and the average values for a given stream order differed between watersheds as a function of local npp the mean p co 2 predicted for stream order 1 ranged from 1722 to 5942 μatm across watersheds whereas the mean p co 2 predicted for stream order 6 ranged from 498 to 1670 μatm fig s8 these surface water stream p co 2 values are well within the range reported for boreal and temperate streams and rivers across northern latitudes jones and mulholland 1998 billett and moore 2008 teodoru et al 2009 öquist et al 2009 humborg et al 2010 koprivnjak et al 2010 butman and raymond 2011 wallin et al 2013 2018 crawford et al 2013 2014 huotari et al 2013 campeau et al 2014 bodmer et al 2016 magin et al 2017 rocher ros et al 2019 likewise we modeled surface water p ch 4 continuously along the stream network based on our previously developed empirical models for these regions hutchins et al 2019 and the resulting modeled p ch 4 averaged 635 μatm range 8 2 9192 μatm across all watersheds which was higher but generally comparable to the boreal average in a global riverine methane database mean 266 μatm range 2 2 1856 μatm methdb from stanley et al 2016 contrary to co 2 the modeled ch 4 did not have a distinct pattern in relation to stream order but there were still major differences between watersheds in average p ch 4 for any given stream order fig s9 driven by differences in average elevation and npp hutchins et al 2019 3 3 modeling stream surface emissions we modeled the gas exchange coefficients k600 for each stream point on the basis of stream morphometry and hydrology combining existing empirical models and geospatial data for these same regions see methods for details we used the models recently proposed by natchimuthu et al 2017 because they are the ones that best capture the topographic and hydrological features of our boreal networks as opposed to the commonly applied k models from raymond et al 2012 that have been shown to be not suitable in some locations for example in higher energy systems ulseth et al 2019 thus we have applied the models from natchimuthu et al 2017 which were developed in a similar landscape with similar stream channel slopes to our watersheds overall there was a strong coherence between the models from ulseth et al 2019 with those of natchimuthu et al 2017 for our study watersheds fig s10 r 0 92 the modeled k600 ranged from 0 02 to 100 m d 1 fig s5 and were within the range that has been applied in other similar studies butman and raymond 2011 striegl et al 2012 raymond et al 2013 wallin et al 2018 rocher ros et al 2019 our modeled k600 had a median 4 0 m d 1 and a mean 10 7 m d 1 here we have used continuous modeled k600 based on empirically modeled velocity methods and slope from gis to integrate gas exchange throughout stream networks we acknowledge there is still major uncertainty in river gas exchange and have included uncertainty in the analysis hall and ulseth 2019 however the k600 that we apply here represent the best estimates that can be derived with current tools we superimposed these modeled k600 to modeled surface water co 2 and ch 4 concentrations along the entire fluvial network to derive co 2 and ch 4 emissions continuously at a 23 m resolution our modeling yields a consistent pattern across the 19 watersheds wherein the k600 increases downstream up to strahler stream order six declining thereafter in the largest orders fig 2a this pattern partly derives from the fact that these boreal landscapes are generally characterized by relatively flat topography 10 with a relatively small proportion of high slope 10 high turbulence headwater streams that may attain extremely high k600 values ulseth et al 2019 which could bias our results if not well accounted for additionally there was a general pattern of declining p co 2 with increasing k600 fig 2b consistent with an analysis of a global dataset by rocher ros et al 2019 interestingly the interplay between the network patterns in k600 and p co 2 fig s8 results in roughly similar average co 2 fluxes from strahler orders one to six with somewhat lower average fluxes in higher orders fig s11 within any given network this pattern in fluxes is important because it modulates the contribution of the various river orders to the total network fluxes and minimizes the potential biases due to either over or underestimation of k600 importantly there are large differences in average fluxes between watersheds for any given stream order which reflect the structure of the empirical models that incorporate not only drivers of gas exchange but also proxies that capture cross watershed differences that influence the baseline input of c to the network hutchins et al 2019 this highlights the importance of correctly modeling both the physical aspects of the fluvial network that influence gas exchange but also the features that drive the supply of c to the fluvial network much of the literature of aquatic fluxes and terrestrial c balances presents annual values and for comparative purposes we present our results in terms of annual values as well there is significant uncertainty in temporal extrapolation of riverine fluxes in particular accounting for ice off emissions campeau et al 2014 and winter emissions through open water patches striegl et al 2012 and through ice and snow wallin et al 2013 in this regard the influence of seasonality in stream gas concentrations in a subset of our sites is relatively modest explaining 17 of the total variation in p co 2 and 4 in p ch 4 n 173 hutchins 2019 much less than the spatial variation across streams and regions where emissions continue during at least a portion of winter hutchins 2019 we have calculated annual riverine gas emissions by multiplying the daily open water fluxes by 214 days so as to capture some of the additional emissions outside of the approximately 184 days of ice free season in boreal québec as observed by campeau et al 2014 the mean watershed co 2 point fluxes per area of stream predicted for stream order 1 ranged from 151 to 3112 g c m 2 yr 1 whereas for stream order 6 the range was from 49 to 2251 g c m 2 yr 1 fig s8 these mean watershed co 2 point fluxes are within the range of published fluxes in rivers from northern latitudes 95 16 745 g c m 2 yr 1 compiled by wallin et al 2013 these point fluxes showed a large heterogeneity but a general small increasing trend with increasing stream order to strahler order 5 then declining fig s11 which is consistent with the spatial heterogeneities in fluxes reported by duvert et al 2018 we carried out the same exercise for ch 4 and obtained an overall average point flux of 23 2 g c m 2 yr 1 with a slight increasing pattern with increasing stream order fig s12 published ch 4 flux estimates for rivers are sparse compared with co 2 fluxes however the global riverine methane database methdb stanley et al 2016 has compiled much of the literature on riverine ch 4 fluxes resulting in a large range from 0 26 to 689 g c m 2 yr 1 daily fluxes converted to annual for comparison with a mean of 22 3 g c m 2 yr 1 it is clear that ch 4 fluxes are very heterogeneous but our modeled fluxes are within a published range 3 4 integrated fluvial co 2 and ch 4 emissions the integrated network emissions were calculated by expanding point fluxes to stream section area multiplying pixel length by modeled width and areal flux then summing the entire stream network surface of the watersheds the resulting total riverine emissions were then expressed as emissions per area of stream surface and also per watershed area fig 3 co 2 emissions per stream area of the modeled watersheds had a median of 1177 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 3a iqr 612 1638 ch 4 emissions per stream area of the modeled watersheds were a median of 23 2 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 3b iqr 3 5 57 2 there are very few published values to which we can compare these estimates as the majority of published values represent either reach values or upscaled river fluxes that are based on propagating mean flux values to an ensemble of rivers which are not analogous to our integrated network fluxes one of the closest published estimates are perhaps those of butman and raymond 2011 who distinguished fluxes by stream order and reported a range of 882 4008 g c m 2 yr 1 for the conterminous usa as discussed above fluvial ch 4 emissions have received considerably less attention than co 2 emissions and to our knowledge there are no comparable estimates of integrated network emissions of ch 4 per stream area in the literature we also expressed these integrated riverine network emissions as a function of watershed area and our modeled total network co 2 emissions were distributed around a median of 4 6 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 3a iqr 1 6 7 9 there are several studies that have expressed average river fluxes as a function of watershed area for individual rivers or river reaches but again this is not analogous to integrating emissions over the entire network of a given watershed lundin et al 2013 our median integrated co 2 emissions 4 6 g c m 2 yr 1 can be best compared to the findings of other large scale studies that have at least incorporated a range of stream orders and expressed the resulting fluxes per watershed area table 2 for example teodoru et al 2009 also in boreal québec reported average regional emissions of 2 1 g c m 2 yr 1 and humborg et al 2010 reported 1 9 g c m 2 yr 1 for all of sweden in contrast the large scale studies in alaska and the yukon river basin yielded higher estimates of 9 7 stackpoole et al 2017 and 9 0 striegl et al 2012 g c m 2 yr 1 however smaller scale studies in alaska crawford et al 2013 and the northwest territories zolkos et al 2019 found much lower emissions of 0 4 g c m 2 yr 1 modeled integrated ch 4 emissions showed a larger relative range than their co 2 counterparts from 4 0 to 1780 mg c m 2 yr 1 with a median of 118 mg c m 2 yr 1 fig 2b iqr 8 8 206 fluvial ch 4 emissions have to our knowledge no comparable published whole network integrated ch 4 flux estimate other than the one presented by lundin et al 2013 for a small boreal subarctic watershed in sweden which yielded a comparable number 65 mg c m 2 yr 1 the average from river ch 4 studies in the boreal biome scaled to the watershed was also comparable at 39 mg c m 2 yr 1 ranging from 1 7 to 65 table 2 3 5 total network co 2 and ch 4 emissions these total network co 2 and ch 4 emissions are the result of network architecture landscape features and climate effects and we can now explore potential drivers of the variation of this watershed property across the landscape fig 4 shows how total co 2 and ch 4 emissions vary as a function of key morphologic and topographic features of these watersheds total co 2 emissions showed little correlation with percent stream area within the watershed fig 4a spearman s rho 0 34 or total watershed area fig 4b spearman s rho 0 21 but showed a positive correlation with average watershed slope fig 4c spearman s rho 0 69 although at a reach scale slope influences riverine emissions by modulating local turbulence and therefore gas exchange at the whole watershed scale slope must be also linked to the overall input of c from land that is then degassed throughout the network similarly total ch 4 emissions showed little correlation with percent stream area fig 4d spearman s rho 0 34 or watershed area fig 4e spearman s rho 0 11 but unlike co 2 there was little correlation with watershed slope fig 4f spearman s rho 0 24 suggesting perhaps an in stream source of ch 4 that is independent of watershed properties the total co 2 and ch 4 emissions varied by almost 10 and 100 fold respectively across the modeled watersheds yet this variation was unrelated to either river network size or watershed size a result that is somewhat counterintuitive because it would be expected that total c emissions would tend to increase with the proportion of river surface within the watershed and decline with watershed size the latter allometry of c emissions would be expected because smaller watersheds tend to be dominated by lower stream orders which tend to emit at higher rates for unit stream surface than large rivers fig s11 therefore potentially yielding higher integrated emission values however at this range of watershed sizes 2000 km2 it is clear that the relationship between watershed area and fluvial network composition is highly variable fig s6 such that there is no clear allometry in total emissions anymore some of the higher emission values reported in the literature i e lundin et al 2013 wallin et al 2013 may actually reflect an allometric scaling that is still present when working at much smaller watershed sizes but which should not be assumed to be transposable to larger spatial scales in addition to network architecture and watershed size there was a large gradient in the average estimated watershed net primary production npp and mean annual temperature mat across watersheds from 290 to 560 g c m 2 yr 1 table s2 and 5 6 to 1 7 c fig 5 respectively linked to these there was also a relatively wide range in average net ecosystem production nep across watersheds average annual terrestrial net ecosystem production for each of the watersheds was obtained from a bottom up model by turner et al 2013 and ranged from 10 to 110 g c m 2 yr 1 total co 2 emissions were correlated with average watershed nep fig 5a spearman s rho 0 71 and mat fig 5b spearman s rho 0 62 there was also a large gradient in soil organic c shown in average watershed surface soil organic c content amount of c in the active layer of soil the top 30 cm with a range of 0 05 15 2 kg m 2 there was a negative correlation between watershed soil c and total co 2 emissions fig 5c spearman s rho 0 49 stream co 2 has been shown to be sourced from recently fixed atmospheric co 2 campeau et al 2019 which would explain the positive relationship between nep and co 2 emissions additionally nep is not necessarily equivalent to carbon storage lovett et al 2006 and lateral carbon export can be modern burd et al 2018 meaning soil c is stored on longer timescales the negative relationship with soil c and total co 2 emissions could be explained by lower sloped watersheds storing more c slope discussed below compared to total co 2 emissions there were stronger correlations between total ch 4 emissions and climate there were positive relationships between total ch 4 emissions and both nep fig 5d spearman s rho 0 87 and mat fig 5e spearman s rho 0 85 unlike co 2 there was no correlation between total ch 4 emissions and soil c fig 5f spearman s rho 0 08 however the strong temperature dependence of ch 4 likely renders it more sensitive to climate than co 2 which is reflected in the relationship with ch 4 emissions and mat the empirical models we used here to model network gases were developed on the basis of summer values so the patterns that we present are most representative for this particular period of the boreal year likely there is large uncertainty related to ice off spring off gassing campeau et al 2014 hutchins 2019 and emissions of open water patches striegl et al 2012 during winter months here we have used a longer period than ice cover in an attempt to capture some of these emissions but this is a major uncertainty and more study is needed in this area 3 6 significance of network emissions fluvial co 2 emissions originate from a combination of injection of soil derived co 2 and from the internal mineralization of soil derived doc rasilo et al 2017 lupon et al 2019 although the physical forcing and the intensity of gas exchange varies greatly within a given network and also on average between watersheds the variations in total watershed co 2 emissions must reflect differences in the input and processing of terrestrial c because the co 2 generated from either process will degas sooner or later within the network the total co 2 emissions therefore represent an integrated estimate of c export from land into the fluvial network at the whole watershed scale regardless of whether the c is delivered in the form of soil derived co 2 that is then vented or as doc that is decomposed and converted to co 2 within the fluvial network in this regard there was one order of magnitude difference between the highest and lowest total watershed co 2 emissions 0 6 5 2 g c m 2 yr 1 this range of total co 2 fluxes must necessarily reflect differences in the magnitude of lateral c export from these large watersheds linked to a complex interplay between terrestrial productivity soil properties biogeochemical processing hydrology and network configuration the lack of any strong relationships with fluvial network surface area and watershed size in these large watersheds climate and other landscape features suggests the existence of overlapping and offsetting effects driving these integrated fluxes and modulating the overall emissions watershed slope however appears to be a common driver of total co 2 emissions fig 4c perhaps through its multiple roles in influencing land cover and the physiognomy of surrounding soils as well as hydrology and the architecture of the network it is interesting to place these watershed co 2 fluxes in the context of the corresponding riverine export of c which represents the portion of the c lost from land that is not emitted as co 2 within the network but rather transported downstream in the form of doc and dic from large rivers thus already having undergone sedimentation in lakes or river sediments river export has been extensively studied over the past decades connolly et al 2018 meybeck 1982 sarmiento and sundquist 1992 ludwig and probst 1996 regnier et al 2013 tank et al 2012 but few studies butman et al 2016 to date have actually combined whole watershed emission and export estimates to yield a perspective of whole watershed c loss in order to do this we produced a first order estimate of the riverine export of dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic for each of the modeled watersheds using our own existing data of c concentrations in large rivers draining these watersheds hutchins et al 2019 and mean annual discharge estimated from a regional relationship based on watershed area table s1 the estimated riverine doc and dic export from these watersheds ranged from 2 to 6 2 g c m 2 yr 1 for doc and from 1 to 4 2 g c m 2 yr 1 for dic and were of the same order of magnitude of the our estimated total watershed co 2 emissions 0 6 5 2 g c m 2 yr 1 the total c export from land to the network can therefore be approximated by summing the total co 2 watershed emissions and the fluvial c export from these watersheds yielding total fluvial c losses total co 2 emissions doc export dic export from the modeled watersheds ranging from 4 7 to 36 g c m 2 yr 1 median 12 6 iqr 5 8 14 7 fig 6 total ch 4 emissions are negligible in terms of the landscape carbon balance with a median 0 2 g c m 2 yr 1 however it should be noted that in terms of greenhouse gas warming potential ch 4 emissions would equal 1 7 g c m 2 yr 1 in co 2 equivalents additionally modeled ch 4 emissions only include diffusive emissions and omit any bubble emissions it is interesting to note that slope not only influenced the magnitude of total co 2 emissions but also the relative contribution of co 2 emission to total watershed c loss by rivers total co 2 emissions doc export dic export which increased with watershed slope fig 7 a with co 2 dominating total loss in higher sloped watersheds and downstream export of doc and dic dominating low sloped watersheds this pattern is in agreement with previous reports from individual catchments in the krycklan catchment in sweden a high slope watershed co 2 emissions dominated total river loss 53 of total export wallin et al 2013 whereas in the abitibi region québec a low slope region containing four of the modeled watersheds here doc and dic dominated export with co 2 emissions contributing only 13 of total export li 2016 there is an increasing realization that lateral c losses from soils to inland waters may represent a largely overlooked yet non negligible component of terrestrial c budgets butman et al 2016 webb et al 2018 and our results confirm that the integrated watershed c losses are indeed significant relative to other watershed scale properties in these boreal landscapes in particular these fluvial c losses total co 2 emissions doc export dic export could potentially offset the estimated net ecosystem production of the watersheds which ranged from 10 to 106 g c m 2 yr 1 median 60 iqr 18 6 80 5 by as much as 14 47 median 23 while watershed slope was related to co 2 emissions and to the partition of fluvial watershed c loss into gaseous and dissolved forms slope also explained the variability in riverine co 2 emissions per unit watershed nep fig 7b which ranged by an order of magnitude from 2 9 to 28 7 median 8 4 iqr 6 1 14 3 it is still unclear what the underlying mechanisms are that determine that certain watersheds lose a higher percentage of their fixed c via their fluvial networks and what determines the pathways of this loss emission versus riverine export but regardless these aquatic fluxes are significant from a whole landscape c perspective the net terrestrial c sinks and the losses through fluvial co 2 emissions are two watershed properties that do not appear to be tightly coupled each likely having their specific set of drivers and yet both are fundamental components of the overall landscape c budget of the boreal biome 4 conclusion in conclusion here we have integrated both co 2 and ch 4 emissions across entire fluvial networks within several major boreal catchments incorporating key topographic hydrologic and watershed properties that influence the fluvial c gas dynamics the resulting total riverine c emissions therefore reflect both the structure of the hydrologic network and of the surrounding landscape and when expressed per unit catchment area varied greatly 10 fold for co 2 100 fold for ch 4 between watersheds interestingly these total c gas emissions were completely unrelated to the density of river surface across these watersheds but were rather related to watershed slope average nep and soil organic matter contents the latter suggests that these integrated fluvial c emissions are in fact a property of the landscape as a whole and in many ways may be regarded as an extension of the terrestrial c budget total fluvial ch 4 emissions were additionally linked to average regional temperature confirming a strong climate link to fluvial methane dynamics that has consequences to future emission scenarios the magnitude of integrated network c emissions is similar to that of total watershed fluvial c export via dic and doc and together these c loss terms mediated by fluvial networks represent a signification fraction of the estimated nep in these boreal landscapes that needs to be incorporated into current regional c source sink models and budgets declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18107,streams and rivers are now recognized to be sites of intense carbon c emissions yet the lack of c emission estimates that integrate beyond individual river systems has slowed their inclusion in landscape c budgets here we apply empirical models of co 2 and ch 4 concentrations and gas exchange continuously along entire fluvial networks to derive the total fluvial co 2 and ch 4 emissions in large 3000 to 30 000 km2 watersheds located across the boreal biome of québec canada we assess how total fluvial network c emissions vary with landscape and climate properties and compare their magnitude to other components of the landscape c budget the total fluvial network emissions expressed as per unit watershed area ranged from 0 7 to 29 2 g c m 2 yr 1 for co 2 and 4 1780 mg c m 2 yr 1 for ch 4 and neither was related to watershed area or drainage density rather watershed slope and terrestrial net productivity were major drivers of the integrated network fluvial emissions we also show that steeper watersheds had a greater proportion of emissions relative to downstream export of c from the watershed integrated fluvial emissions are of the same magnitude as the terrestrial c sink yet these two fundamental components of the boreal landscape c budget are not tightly coupled keywords carbon river networks aquatic ecosystems carbon dioxide methane 1 introduction the continental biosphere plays an important role in the global c cycle as both a source and a sink to the atmosphere global and regional terrestrial c models require accounting for both input and loss terms and lateral export of c to inland waters is now recognized a major loss component of terrestrial ecosystems cole et al 2007 ciais et al 2008 battin et al 2009 turner et al 2013 butman et al 2016 ussiri and lal 2017 zscheischler et al 2017 this lateral loss involves the movement of organic and inorganic soil derived c into inland waters kindler et al 2011 deirmendjian and abril 2018 and is critically important not only to the functioning of the receiving systems but also in shaping the net c balance of the terrestrial ecosystem itself once in the aquatic ecosystem terrestrially derived c is either buried in aquatic sediments tranvik et al 2009 ferland et al 2014 heathcote et al 2015 mendonça et al 2017 outgassed to the atmosphere mostly as co 2 raymond et al 2013 drake et al 2017 or ultimately reaches the ocean meybeck 1982 sarmiento and sundquist 1992 ludwig and probst 1996 regnier et al 2013 of these three fates terrestrially derived c outgassed to the atmosphere is likely the largest in magnitude but the least well quantified drake et al 2017 the terrestrial c returned to the atmosphere is mostly in the form of co 2 cole et al 2007 either through the direct emission of terrestrially derived co 2 or the degradation of soil derived organic matter to co 2 within the aquatic ecosystem and subsequent emission cole and caraco 2001 duarte and prairie 2005 aufdenkampe et al 2011 hotchkiss et al 2015 in addition the delivery of terrestrial organic c to inland waters also strongly influences their metabolism and among other processes the production and subsequent emission of ch 4 further influencing the regional greenhouse gas ghg and warming potential budgets streams and rivers typically occupy much smaller surface areas than lakes in most watersheds yet they represent the most biogeochemically active land water interfaces mcclain et al 2003 it is now recognized that a significant fraction of the return of terrestrially derived c to the atmosphere occurs within fluvial networks lundin et al 2013 wallin et al 2013 raymond et al 2013 rasilo et al 2017 hutchins et al 2017 horgby et al 2019 these fluvial c emissions represent a component of the landscape net ecosystem exchange nee that is seldom accounted for but which is now increasingly recognized as of potential regional significance jonsson et al 2007 karlsson et al 2010 buffam et al 2011 lundin et al 2016 webb et al 2018 within a given fluvial network riverine co 2 and ch 4 fluxes vary as a function of local properties including topography wallin et al 2011 surrounding riparian soils öquist et al 2009 rasilo et al 2017 flury and ulseth 2019 and position along the hydrological continuum crawford et al 2013 hotchkiss et al 2015 wallin et al 2018 all of which may in turn co vary with groundwater c inputs lupon et al 2019 as well as local physical conditions that will determine gas exchange raymond et al 2012 rocher ros et al 2019 there may be thus large heterogeneity in riverine fluxes within a given watershed and indeed much research has been devoted over the past decades to understanding the magnitude and regulation of reach specific river c dynamics and ghg fluxes kling et al 1992 jones and mulholland 1998 hope et al 2004 wallin et al 2011 rasilo et al 2017 rocher ros et al 2019 from a landscape c perspective however it is not the features at the reach scale that matter but rather the integrated fluvial network c emission that is the metric of interest because this is the most relevant scale in the context of watershed or regional c budgets it is also commensurable with other key elements of the landscape c budget such as soil c accumulation or net primary production npp and is an essential component of the terrestrial lateral c loss equation together with downstream riverine c export from whole watersheds contrary to the latter flux which can be relatively easily quantified by repeatedly sampling one single outflow that captures the net export from the entire riverine network within the watershed the integrated fluvial c emissions from an entire network cannot be derived from any single measurement made within the network this is because the total fluvial emission is a network property that results from the complex interactions of at least three major groups of drivers 1 the configuration of the fluvial network itself in terms of density and size distribution of streams and overall network architecture 2 biogeochemical which influence the inputs and rates of processing of the various c species present in the stream waters 3 physical and hydrological which determine water transport velocity and turbulence and therefore the movement of gases and air water exchange these three sets of drivers do not necessarily co vary at the landscape scale for example hutchins et al 2019 showed that the baseline amount of c that circulates within fluvial networks differs between regions likely as a function of watershed npp and soil organic c content this baseline fluvial c appears to be unrelated to network configuration alone such that the integrated fluvial emissions should vary between regions as a function of all these drivers in addition these drivers may be operating differently on co 2 and ch 4 such that the integrated fluvial emissions of one gas cannot be derived from the other therefore the total integrated fluvial c gas emissions themselves become a distinct property not just of the fluvial network but of the landscape as a whole whose drivers are not necessarily those that are acting at the reach scale current fluvial research has increasingly focused on upscaling river emissions at various spatial scales but interestingly these efforts provide little insight on the actual magnitude and control of integrated fluvial emissions across watersheds and regions for the most part previous studies tend to propagate average values across rivers or utilise single drivers as an upscaling tool and therefore fail to capture the biogeochemical hydrologic and geomorphologic interactions that underlie this inherent landscape property as a result we lack a basic understanding not only of the actual magnitude of integrated fluvial network fluxes but also of the actual drivers of this network property and its potential connections to climate or environmental factors this understanding is particularly important for the boreal biome which is a major global terrestrial net sink of c steinkamp and gruber 2015 but which also contains one of the densest and most complex fluvial networks on earth a few studies have attempted to derive some form of total fluvial c emissions for entire boreal watersheds jonsson et al 2007 lundin et al 2013 but none to date has attempted to assess how this variable varies with watershed and network properties and along large scale regional environmental topographic and climatic gradients here we present the first study to explicitly attempt to quantify the integrated fluvial network c co 2 and ch 4 emissions from a range of watersheds distributed across the boreal region of québec to do this we have taken a suite of empirical models and propagated them at large scales throughout the entire river networks of 19 major watersheds within the boreal biome of québec fig 1 this approach combines three categories of models 1 network configuration the stream network was defined using high resolution digital elevation models dems to obtain the network configuration and relevant parameters for each point flow distance elevation channel slope 2 network biogeochemistry we used empirical models of riverine co 2 and ch 4 concentrations at any given point in the network that account for both cross regional as well as within network variability hutchins et al 2019 3 network physical exchange published empirical models methods natchimuthu et al 2017 were used to obtain high resolution gas exchange coefficients k from stream morphology and modeled water velocity and we applied these models to obtain a specific k for each point distributed along the entire network we combined the high resolution modeled p co 2 p ch 4 and k at each river position to derive an actual modeled flux at each river point these were then summed across all stream points to derive an integrated network emission for each of our 19 target watersheds we further assess how this landscape property varies across these watersheds as a function of landscape and climate properties and explore how it relates to other landscape level c metrics these watersheds range widely in size and this allows us to further explore the potential watershed allometry of the integrated fluvial c emissions 2 materials and methods 2 1 stream network modeling here we apply a stream network modeling approach to quantify integrated network c co 2 and ch 4 emissions in our study area hutchins et al 2020 high resolution digital elevation models dems 23 m 23 m and waterbody polygons from the national hydrological network nhn were obtained from geogratis http geogratis cgdi gc ca the stream network was modeled using dems and the hydrology toolbox in arcgis 10 for 19 watersheds from the nhn fig 1 after the stream network of each watershed was modeled in arcgis 10 using the canadian digital elevation model cdem the resulting stream was in raster or pixel format waterbody polygons from the nhn includes lakes ponds and large rivers the nhn waterbody polygons were manually corrected to remove large rivers leaving only lakes and ponds the corrected polygons were then converted to rasters pixels of the same resolution of the cdem and the modeled stream network the stream network modeled under the waterbodies excluding rivers was then removed so there were no streams allowed under lakes the resulting stream network pixels were converted to points for the purpose of applying additional information to each modeled point from rasters of elevation from cdem flow length from arcgis hydrology toolbox and strahler order from arcgis hydrology toolbox values for both were applied to every point 2 1 1 stream area widths were modeled here on the basis of a relationship of 173 rivers and streams measurements fig s1 in boreal québec from hutchins et al 2019 which included these measurements 173 streams out of 190 sampled this continuous width model yielded similar values as downing et al 2012 as seen in fig s5 this model of width based on flow length was applied to every stream point where w is width m and l is flow length m 1 log w 0 0958 log l 2 0 954 log l 2 023 r 2 0 58 n 173 the stream area a associated to each point was calculated by multiplying the modeled width w by the distance d between stream points 2 a w d 2 1 2 discharge and velocity we used a watershed area km2 and mean annual discharge m3 s 1 relationship we developed here fig s2 from long term monitoring of 54 streams table s1 and rivers across northern québec we applied this model to the watershed area of the modeled watersheds to estimate discharge 3 log q 0 96 log a 3 62 r 2 0 99 n 54 additionally we modeled velocity m s 1 fig s3 for each stream point using discharge m3 s 1 and width m based on a relationship we developed from 287 stream gauging measurements from hutchins 2019 4 v e x p 0 866 l o g q 1 419 l o g w 1 578 r 2 0 86 n 287 2 1 3 pco2 and pch4 propagation the atlas of the biosphere was used to obtain net primary production npp foley et al 1996 from which an average was calculated for each nhn watershed table s2 the watersheds in the northern regions were cut at 69 2 w to the west and 55 5 n to the north since high latitude and low elevation landscapes with discontinuous permafrost were outside the model parameters p co 2 and p ch 4 were modeled using the relationships developed by hutchins et al 2019 which were based on 190 measurements made across the watersheds modeled in this study the p co 2 model from hutchins et al 2019 which included downstream distance and npp showed reasonable agreement between other boreal study areas the p ch 4 model from hutchins et al 2019 included elevation rather than downstream distance in addition to npp both p co 2 and p ch 4 models included an average npp value npp kg m 2 yr 1 for the nhn watersheds table s2 p co 2 μatm was modeled based on flow length l m to each point in the modeled stream network and the watershed npp 5 p c o 2 e x p 0 293 log l 4 480 n p p 8 304 similarly pch4 μatm was modeled for each stream point using elevation e m and npp for each watershed 6 p c h

k600 was capped at 100 since higher values are unrealistic in our watersheds and with our pco2 values rocher ros et al 2019 these k600 values were then applied to each stream point and converted to k co 2 and k ch 4 using schmidt numbers wanninkhof 1992 which were used to calculate a point flux of co 2 and ch 4 regional co2 schmidt numbers s c c o 2 were calculated on regional temperature t where

multiplied by the area that corresponds to each stream point see above resulting in the total co 2 and ch 4 emission for each stream section associated to a point the co 2 and ch 4 emissions of every stream section were summed for each of nhn 19 watersheds fig 1 resulting in total daily fluvial emissions from the entire stream network surface in a given watershed total annual emissions were estimated by multiplying the average fluxes by 214 days which represents an average ice free period 184 days plus an additional 30 days to account for the spring melt and winter emissions as used in

total emission values reported in the text figures and tables correspond to the median and 90 confidence interval of the monte carlo simulations 2 3 landscape and climate properties and other

derived from a discharge area relationship developed using 54 gauged watershed distributed throughout northern québec table s1 doc and dic concentrations for the high order rivers were obtained from hutchins et al 2019 for the regions containing the modeled watersheds table s3 for each watershed doc and dic concentrations were multiplied by modeled mean annual discharge and divided by watershed area to provide an estimate of export from the watershed upstream the estimated long term average discharge from the relationship in fig s2 was then multiplied by the regional doc and dic concentrations mg l 1 hutchins et al 2019 table s3 in high order rivers for the corresponding watersheds this provided an estimate of annual export of both doc and dic for each watershed the annual doc and dic export was then divided by watershed area for an estimate of lateral yields or area specific export 3 results and discussion 3 1 watershed and stream network properties the study watersheds ranged from 2800 to 29 000 km2 and were chosen to represent the major gradients in topography vegetation cover geology and climate that exist within the boreal biome of québec see details in table 1 the stream network comprised 0 21 0 96 of the total area of each of these watersheds with an overall average of 0 38 table 1 this is comparable to allen et al 2018 and downing et al 2012 that concluded that streams and rivers likely cover 0 58 and 0 30 0 56 of the global land surface respectively first order streams dominated the stream length in all watersheds 42 also similar to the downing et al 2012 global estimate of 52 but only accounted for an average of 14 of the total stream network surface area the contribution of order 1 streams to total fluvial surface varied greatly among watersheds from 5 to 18 and within this range of watersheds the contribution of small order streams to total stream surface did not have a clear pattern with watershed size the average contribution of subsequent stream orders hovered around 10 15 fig s6 a critical aspect of this exercise is to obtain a robust estimate of the total stream surface for each of these networks and since this cannot be derived from gis methods for determining stream areas are highly uncertain especially at large scales and it is a significant challenge in any upscaling exercise using empirical models based on measurements is one method that can help approximate stream areas within a study region to this end we developed an empirical model to derive stream width based on flow length see methods section for details that is effective across the boreal biome of québec fig s1 and which yields values that generally agree with a previous published model of global stream width fig s7 downing et al 2012 3 2 modeled fluvial co 2 and ch 4 surface concentrations as a first step we modeled p co 2 continuously along the stream network on the basis of flow length position and watershed npp based on empirical models previously developed for these same regions hutchins et al 2019 fig s4 the modeled p co 2 declined downstream in all fluvial networks which is a direct result of the model structure and the general downstream behaviour of co 2 and the average values for a given stream order differed between watersheds as a function of local npp the mean p co 2 predicted for stream order 1 ranged from 1722 to 5942 μatm across watersheds whereas the mean p co 2 predicted for stream order 6 ranged from 498 to 1670 μatm fig s8 these surface water stream p co 2 values are well within the range reported for boreal and temperate streams and rivers across northern latitudes jones and mulholland 1998 billett and moore 2008 teodoru et al 2009 öquist et al 2009 humborg et al 2010 koprivnjak et al 2010 butman and raymond 2011 wallin et al 2013 2018 crawford et al 2013 2014 huotari et al 2013 campeau et al 2014 bodmer et al 2016 magin et al 2017 rocher ros et al 2019 likewise we modeled surface water p ch 4 continuously along the stream network based on our previously developed empirical models for these regions hutchins et al 2019 and the resulting modeled p ch 4 averaged 635 μatm range 8 2 9192 μatm across all watersheds which was higher but generally comparable to the boreal average in a global riverine methane database mean 266 μatm range 2 2 1856 μatm methdb from stanley et al 2016 contrary to co 2 the modeled ch 4 did not have a distinct pattern in relation to stream order but there were still major differences between watersheds in average p ch 4 for any given stream order fig s9 driven by differences in average elevation and npp hutchins et al 2019 3 3 modeling stream surface emissions we modeled the gas exchange coefficients k600 for each stream point on the basis of stream morphometry and hydrology combining existing empirical models and geospatial data for these same regions see methods for details we used the models recently proposed by natchimuthu et al 2017 because they are the ones that best capture the topographic and hydrological features of our boreal networks as opposed to the commonly applied k models from raymond et al 2012 that have been shown to be not suitable in some locations for example in higher energy systems ulseth et al 2019 thus we have applied the models from natchimuthu et al 2017 which were developed in a similar landscape with similar stream channel slopes to our watersheds overall there was a strong coherence between the models from ulseth et al 2019 with those of natchimuthu et al 2017 for our study watersheds fig s10 r 0 92 the modeled k600 ranged from 0 02 to 100 m d 1 fig s5 and were within the range that has been applied in other similar studies butman and raymond 2011 striegl et al 2012 raymond et al 2013 wallin et al 2018 rocher ros et al 2019 our modeled k600 had a median 4 0 m d 1 and a mean 10 7 m d 1 here we have used continuous modeled k600 based on empirically modeled velocity methods and slope from gis to integrate gas exchange throughout stream networks we acknowledge there is still major uncertainty in river gas exchange and have included uncertainty in the analysis hall and ulseth 2019 however the k600 that we apply here represent the best estimates that can be derived with current tools we superimposed these modeled k600 to modeled surface water co 2 and ch 4 concentrations along the entire fluvial network to derive co 2 and ch 4 emissions continuously at a 23 m resolution our modeling yields a consistent pattern across the 19 watersheds wherein the k600 increases downstream up to strahler stream order six declining thereafter in the largest orders fig 2a this pattern partly derives from the fact that these boreal landscapes are generally characterized by relatively flat topography 10 with a relatively small proportion of high slope 10 high turbulence headwater streams that may attain extremely high k600 values ulseth et al 2019 which could bias our results if not well accounted for additionally there was a general pattern of declining p co 2 with increasing k600 fig 2b consistent with an analysis of a global dataset by rocher ros et al 2019 interestingly the interplay between the network patterns in k600 and p co 2 fig s8 results in roughly similar average co 2 fluxes from strahler orders one to six with somewhat lower average fluxes in higher orders fig s11 within any given network this pattern in fluxes is important because it modulates the contribution of the various river orders to the total network fluxes and minimizes the potential biases due to either over or underestimation of k600 importantly there are large differences in average fluxes between watersheds for any given stream order which reflect the structure of the empirical models that incorporate not only drivers of gas exchange but also proxies that capture cross watershed differences that influence the baseline input of c to the network hutchins et al 2019 this highlights the importance of correctly modeling both the physical aspects of the fluvial network that influence gas exchange but also the features that drive the supply of c to the fluvial network much of the literature of aquatic fluxes and terrestrial c balances presents annual values and for comparative purposes we present our results in terms of annual values as well there is significant uncertainty in temporal extrapolation of riverine fluxes in particular accounting for ice off emissions campeau et al 2014 and winter emissions through open water patches striegl et al 2012 and through ice and snow wallin et al 2013 in this regard the influence of seasonality in stream gas concentrations in a subset of our sites is relatively modest explaining 17 of the total variation in p co 2 and 4 in p ch 4 n 173 hutchins 2019 much less than the spatial variation across streams and regions where emissions continue during at least a portion of winter hutchins 2019 we have calculated annual riverine gas emissions by multiplying the daily open water fluxes by 214 days so as to capture some of the additional emissions outside of the approximately 184 days of ice free season in boreal québec as observed by campeau et al 2014 the mean watershed co 2 point fluxes per area of stream predicted for stream order 1 ranged from 151 to 3112 g c m 2 yr 1 whereas for stream order 6 the range was from 49 to 2251 g c m 2 yr 1 fig s8 these mean watershed co 2 point fluxes are within the range of published fluxes in rivers from northern latitudes 95 16 745 g c m 2 yr 1 compiled by wallin et al 2013 these point fluxes showed a large heterogeneity but a general small increasing trend with increasing stream order to strahler order 5 then declining fig s11 which is consistent with the spatial heterogeneities in fluxes reported by duvert et al 2018 we carried out the same exercise for ch 4 and obtained an overall average point flux of 23 2 g c m 2 yr 1 with a slight increasing pattern with increasing stream order fig s12 published ch 4 flux estimates for rivers are sparse compared with co 2 fluxes however the global riverine methane database methdb stanley et al 2016 has compiled much of the literature on riverine ch 4 fluxes resulting in a large range from 0 26 to 689 g c m 2 yr 1 daily fluxes converted to annual for comparison with a mean of 22 3 g c m 2 yr 1 it is clear that ch 4 fluxes are very heterogeneous but our modeled fluxes are within a published range 3 4 integrated fluvial co 2 and ch 4 emissions the integrated network emissions were calculated by expanding point fluxes to stream section area multiplying pixel length by modeled width and areal flux then summing the entire stream network surface of the watersheds the resulting total riverine emissions were then expressed as emissions per area of stream surface and also per watershed area fig 3 co 2 emissions per stream area of the modeled watersheds had a median of 1177 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 3a iqr 612 1638 ch 4 emissions per stream area of the modeled watersheds were a median of 23 2 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 3b iqr 3 5 57 2 there are very few published values to which we can compare these estimates as the majority of published values represent either reach values or upscaled river fluxes that are based on propagating mean flux values to an ensemble of rivers which are not analogous to our integrated network fluxes one of the closest published estimates are perhaps those of butman and raymond 2011 who distinguished fluxes by stream order and reported a range of 882 4008 g c m 2 yr 1 for the conterminous usa as discussed above fluvial ch 4 emissions have received considerably less attention than co 2 emissions and to our knowledge there are no comparable estimates of integrated network emissions of ch 4 per stream area in the literature we also expressed these integrated riverine network emissions as a function of watershed area and our modeled total network co 2 emissions were distributed around a median of 4 6 g c m 2 yr 1 fig 3a iqr 1 6 7 9 there are several studies that have expressed average river fluxes as a function of watershed area for individual rivers or river reaches but again this is not analogous to integrating emissions over the entire network of a given watershed lundin et al 2013 our median integrated co 2 emissions 4 6 g c m 2 yr 1 can be best compared to the findings of other large scale studies that have at least incorporated a range of stream orders and expressed the resulting fluxes per watershed area table 2 for example teodoru et al 2009 also in boreal québec reported average regional emissions of 2 1 g c m 2 yr 1 and humborg et al 2010 reported 1 9 g c m 2 yr 1 for all of sweden in contrast the large scale studies in alaska and the yukon river basin yielded higher estimates of 9 7 stackpoole et al 2017 and 9 0 striegl et al 2012 g c m 2 yr 1 however smaller scale studies in alaska crawford et al 2013 and the northwest territories zolkos et al 2019 found much lower emissions of 0 4 g c m 2 yr 1 modeled integrated ch 4 emissions showed a larger relative range than their co 2 counterparts from 4 0 to 1780 mg c m 2 yr 1 with a median of 118 mg c m 2 yr 1 fig 2b iqr 8 8 206 fluvial ch 4 emissions have to our knowledge no comparable published whole network integrated ch 4 flux estimate other than the one presented by lundin et al 2013 for a small boreal subarctic watershed in sweden which yielded a comparable number 65 mg c m 2 yr 1 the average from river ch 4 studies in the boreal biome scaled to the watershed was also comparable at 39 mg c m 2 yr 1 ranging from 1 7 to 65 table 2 3 5 total network co 2 and ch 4 emissions these total network co 2 and ch 4 emissions are the result of network architecture landscape features and climate effects and we can now explore potential drivers of the variation of this watershed property across the landscape fig 4 shows how total co 2 and ch 4 emissions vary as a function of key morphologic and topographic features of these watersheds total co 2 emissions showed little correlation with percent stream area within the watershed fig 4a spearman s rho 0 34 or total watershed area fig 4b spearman s rho 0 21 but showed a positive correlation with average watershed slope fig 4c spearman s rho 0 69 although at a reach scale slope influences riverine emissions by modulating local turbulence and therefore gas exchange at the whole watershed scale slope must be also linked to the overall input of c from land that is then degassed throughout the network similarly total ch 4 emissions showed little correlation with percent stream area fig 4d spearman s rho 0 34 or watershed area fig 4e spearman s rho 0 11 but unlike co 2 there was little correlation with watershed slope fig 4f spearman s rho 0 24 suggesting perhaps an in stream source of ch 4 that is independent of watershed properties the total co 2 and ch 4 emissions varied by almost 10 and 100 fold respectively across the modeled watersheds yet this variation was unrelated to either river network size or watershed size a result that is somewhat counterintuitive because it would be expected that total c emissions would tend to increase with the proportion of river surface within the watershed and decline with watershed size the latter allometry of c emissions would be expected because smaller watersheds tend to be dominated by lower stream orders which tend to emit at higher rates for unit stream surface than large rivers fig s11 therefore potentially yielding higher integrated emission values however at this range of watershed sizes 2000 km2 it is clear that the relationship between watershed area and fluvial network composition is highly variable fig s6 such that there is no clear allometry in total emissions anymore some of the higher emission values reported in the literature i e lundin et al 2013 wallin et al 2013 may actually reflect an allometric scaling that is still present when working at much smaller watershed sizes but which should not be assumed to be transposable to larger spatial scales in addition to network architecture and watershed size there was a large gradient in the average estimated watershed net primary production npp and mean annual temperature mat across watersheds from 290 to 560 g c m 2 yr 1 table s2 and 5 6 to 1 7 c fig 5 respectively linked to these there was also a relatively wide range in average net ecosystem production nep across watersheds average annual terrestrial net ecosystem production for each of the watersheds was obtained from a bottom up model by turner et al 2013 and ranged from 10 to 110 g c m 2 yr 1 total co 2 emissions were correlated with average watershed nep fig 5a spearman s rho 0 71 and mat fig 5b spearman s rho 0 62 there was also a large gradient in soil organic c shown in average watershed surface soil organic c content amount of c in the active layer of soil the top 30 cm with a range of 0 05 15 2 kg m 2 there was a negative correlation between watershed soil c and total co 2 emissions fig 5c spearman s rho 0 49 stream co 2 has been shown to be sourced from recently fixed atmospheric co 2 campeau et al 2019 which would explain the positive relationship between nep and co 2 emissions additionally nep is not necessarily equivalent to carbon storage lovett et al 2006 and lateral carbon export can be modern burd et al 2018 meaning soil c is stored on longer timescales the negative relationship with soil c and total co 2 emissions could be explained by lower sloped watersheds storing more c slope discussed below compared to total co 2 emissions there were stronger correlations between total ch 4 emissions and climate there were positive relationships between total ch 4 emissions and both nep fig 5d spearman s rho 0 87 and mat fig 5e spearman s rho 0 85 unlike co 2 there was no correlation between total ch 4 emissions and soil c fig 5f spearman s rho 0 08 however the strong temperature dependence of ch 4 likely renders it more sensitive to climate than co 2 which is reflected in the relationship with ch 4 emissions and mat the empirical models we used here to model network gases were developed on the basis of summer values so the patterns that we present are most representative for this particular period of the boreal year likely there is large uncertainty related to ice off spring off gassing campeau et al 2014 hutchins 2019 and emissions of open water patches striegl et al 2012 during winter months here we have used a longer period than ice cover in an attempt to capture some of these emissions but this is a major uncertainty and more study is needed in this area 3 6 significance of network emissions fluvial co 2 emissions originate from a combination of injection of soil derived co 2 and from the internal mineralization of soil derived doc rasilo et al 2017 lupon et al 2019 although the physical forcing and the intensity of gas exchange varies greatly within a given network and also on average between watersheds the variations in total watershed co 2 emissions must reflect differences in the input and processing of terrestrial c because the co 2 generated from either process will degas sooner or later within the network the total co 2 emissions therefore represent an integrated estimate of c export from land into the fluvial network at the whole watershed scale regardless of whether the c is delivered in the form of soil derived co 2 that is then vented or as doc that is decomposed and converted to co 2 within the fluvial network in this regard there was one order of magnitude difference between the highest and lowest total watershed co 2 emissions 0 6 5 2 g c m 2 yr 1 this range of total co 2 fluxes must necessarily reflect differences in the magnitude of lateral c export from these large watersheds linked to a complex interplay between terrestrial productivity soil properties biogeochemical processing hydrology and network configuration the lack of any strong relationships with fluvial network surface area and watershed size in these large watersheds climate and other landscape features suggests the existence of overlapping and offsetting effects driving these integrated fluxes and modulating the overall emissions watershed slope however appears to be a common driver of total co 2 emissions fig 4c perhaps through its multiple roles in influencing land cover and the physiognomy of surrounding soils as well as hydrology and the architecture of the network it is interesting to place these watershed co 2 fluxes in the context of the corresponding riverine export of c which represents the portion of the c lost from land that is not emitted as co 2 within the network but rather transported downstream in the form of doc and dic from large rivers thus already having undergone sedimentation in lakes or river sediments river export has been extensively studied over the past decades connolly et al 2018 meybeck 1982 sarmiento and sundquist 1992 ludwig and probst 1996 regnier et al 2013 tank et al 2012 but few studies butman et al 2016 to date have actually combined whole watershed emission and export estimates to yield a perspective of whole watershed c loss in order to do this we produced a first order estimate of the riverine export of dissolved organic carbon doc and dissolved inorganic carbon dic for each of the modeled watersheds using our own existing data of c concentrations in large rivers draining these watersheds hutchins et al 2019 and mean annual discharge estimated from a regional relationship based on watershed area table s1 the estimated riverine doc and dic export from these watersheds ranged from 2 to 6 2 g c m 2 yr 1 for doc and from 1 to 4 2 g c m 2 yr 1 for dic and were of the same order of magnitude of the our estimated total watershed co 2 emissions 0 6 5 2 g c m 2 yr 1 the total c export from land to the network can therefore be approximated by summing the total co 2 watershed emissions and the fluvial c export from these watersheds yielding total fluvial c losses total co 2 emissions doc export dic export from the modeled watersheds ranging from 4 7 to 36 g c m 2 yr 1 median 12 6 iqr 5 8 14 7 fig 6 total ch 4 emissions are negligible in terms of the landscape carbon balance with a median 0 2 g c m 2 yr 1 however it should be noted that in terms of greenhouse gas warming potential ch 4 emissions would equal 1 7 g c m 2 yr 1 in co 2 equivalents additionally modeled ch 4 emissions only include diffusive emissions and omit any bubble emissions it is interesting to note that slope not only influenced the magnitude of total co 2 emissions but also the relative contribution of co 2 emission to total watershed c loss by rivers total co 2 emissions doc export dic export which increased with watershed slope fig 7 a with co 2 dominating total loss in higher sloped watersheds and downstream export of doc and dic dominating low sloped watersheds this pattern is in agreement with previous reports from individual catchments in the krycklan catchment in sweden a high slope watershed co 2 emissions dominated total river loss 53 of total export wallin et al 2013 whereas in the abitibi region québec a low slope region containing four of the modeled watersheds here doc and dic dominated export with co 2 emissions contributing only 13 of total export li 2016 there is an increasing realization that lateral c losses from soils to inland waters may represent a largely overlooked yet non negligible component of terrestrial c budgets butman et al 2016 webb et al 2018 and our results confirm that the integrated watershed c losses are indeed significant relative to other watershed scale properties in these boreal landscapes in particular these fluvial c losses total co 2 emissions doc export dic export could potentially offset the estimated net ecosystem production of the watersheds which ranged from 10 to 106 g c m 2 yr 1 median 60 iqr 18 6 80 5 by as much as 14 47 median 23 while watershed slope was related to co 2 emissions and to the partition of fluvial watershed c loss into gaseous and dissolved forms slope also explained the variability in riverine co 2 emissions per unit watershed nep fig 7b which ranged by an order of magnitude from 2 9 to 28 7 median 8 4 iqr 6 1 14 3 it is still unclear what the underlying mechanisms are that determine that certain watersheds lose a higher percentage of their fixed c via their fluvial networks and what determines the pathways of this loss emission versus riverine export but regardless these aquatic fluxes are significant from a whole landscape c perspective the net terrestrial c sinks and the losses through fluvial co 2 emissions are two watershed properties that do not appear to be tightly coupled each likely having their specific set of drivers and yet both are fundamental components of the overall landscape c budget of the boreal biome 4 conclusion in conclusion here we have integrated both co 2 and ch 4 emissions across entire fluvial networks within several major boreal catchments incorporating key topographic hydrologic and watershed properties that influence the fluvial c gas dynamics the resulting total riverine c emissions therefore reflect both the structure of the hydrologic network and of the surrounding landscape and when expressed per unit catchment area varied greatly 10 fold for co 2 100 fold for ch 4 between watersheds interestingly these total c gas emissions were completely unrelated to the density of river surface across these watersheds but were rather related to watershed slope average nep and soil organic matter contents the latter suggests that these integrated fluvial c emissions are in fact a property of the landscape as a whole and in many ways may be regarded as an extension of the terrestrial c budget total fluvial ch 4 emissions were additionally linked to average regional temperature confirming a strong climate link to fluvial methane dynamics that has consequences to future emission scenarios the magnitude of integrated network c emissions is similar to that of total watershed fluvial c export via dic and doc and together these c loss terms mediated by fluvial networks represent a signification fraction of the estimated nep in these boreal landscapes that needs to be incorporated into current regional c source sink models and budgets declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18108,there are two means by which metals associate with microplastics in the aquatic environment firstly they may be adsorbed to the plastic surface or hydrogenous biogenic accumulations thereon and secondly they may be present in the polymeric matrix as functional additives or as reaction or recyclate residues in this study the relative significance of these associations is evaluated with respect to pb in beached marine microplastics thus adsorbed pb was determined in 5 mm neutrally coloured polyethylene pellets that contained no detectable pb added during manufacture by digestion in dilute aqua regia while the bioaccessibility of this association was evaluated using an avian physiologically based extraction test pbet here up to about 0 1 μg g 1 of pb was adsorbed to the plastic and between about 60 and 70 of the metal was accessible lead present as additive or residue was determined by x ray fluorescence analysis of a wider range of beached plastics polyolefins and polyvinyl chloride with a selection of positive samples grated to mm dimensions and subjected to the pbet here total pb concentrations up to 40 000 μg g 1 and bioaccessibilities up to 16 were observed with bioaccessible concentrations exceeding equivalent values for adsorbed pb by several orders of magnitude ingestive exposure to pb and potentially other toxic metals is more important through the presence of additives in historical plastics and recyclate residues in contemporary plastics than from adsorption and it is recommended that future studies focus more on the environmental impacts and fate of metals bound in this form keywords microplastics metals lead additive adsorption bioaccessibility 1 introduction among the many and varied environmental impacts of marine microplastics is their ability to transport contaminants and act as a means of contaminant exposure to wildlife li et al 2016 karbalaei et al 2018 empirical studies have demonstrated that neutral organic contaminants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls are readily sorbed by the hydrophobic microplastic surface from the surrounding aqueous medium velzeboer et al 2014 liu et al 2019 however recent calculations and considerations have questioned the significance of this route for exposure and bioaccumulation compared with natural pathways beckingham and ghosh 2017 lohmann 2017 with suggestions that ingested microplastics could even act as chemical cleansers in the digestive environment koelmans et al 2016 more important in this respect appears to be the presence of organic chemicals in the plastic matrix as reaction or recyclate residues or as functional additives like plasticisers antioxidants and flame retardants hermabessiere et al 2017 gallo et al 2018 because many residues and additives are not chemically but physically bound to the plastic matrix they are able to migrate with experiments using fluids mimicking digestive conditions of fish and seabirds demonstrating considerable mobilisation of bisphenol a and various phthalate esters and flame retardants and evidence of enhanced bioaccumulation or biological estrogenicity tanaka et al 2015 coffin et al 2019 many metals have also been shown to be associated with marine microplastics thus laboratory and field studies have revealed that metal ions are able to adsorb directly to the plastic surface or to surficial accumulations of hydrogenous and biogenic matter rochman et al 2014 brennecke et al 2016 while non destructive x ray fluorescence techniques have demonstrated the presence of historical and recycled additives within the polymeric matrix nakashima et al 2012 turner 2016 what is less clear however is the relative significance of the two associations of metal hereafter termed adsorbed and matrix with regard to transport fate and potential environmental impacts like mobility in seawater or dissolution in the digestive system of a plastic ingesting animal wang et al 2017 munier and bendell 2018 in the present study the associations of pb with beached marine microplastics through adsorption from the environment and incorporation as a functional additive are quantified by appropriate analytical techniques and their mobilities compared by subjecting samples to a simulated avian physiologically based extraction test pbet lead was selected for study as among trace metals it has a relatively high affinity for plastic surfaces and accumulations thereon ashton et al 2010 holmes et al 2014 it was historically important as a pigment for colour and a heat stabiliser in plastics hansen et al 2013 and is highly toxic to seabirds finkelstein et al 2003 with evidence that pb derived from ingested plastic is able to accumulate lavers and bond 2016 the two associations of pb or any metal in microplastics and their mechanisms of release are conceptualised in fig 1 and serve to assist the definitions and discussion below thus firstly pb is physically held in the plastic as a simple compounded additive pb x matrix which is able to diffuse through the water saturated matrix itself or on dissociation with the rate of the latter ph dependent secondly pb is bound at adsorption sites on the plastic or on a more reactive and charged coating that has accumulated on the plastic surface during suspension pbads and is able to undergo release through desorption should environmental conditions change while two distinctive associations and mechanisms of release are illustrated it is likely that both processes occur simultaneously or successively in seawater or in the avian digestive environment 2 methods 2 1 sampling samples of marine plastics were collected by hand from the strandlines of south or south west i e atlantic facing sandy beaches within 10 km of plymouth south west england sampling focussed on black white and off white pellets and mainly pre production pellets n 300 whose primary and secondary diameters ranged from about 2 to 4 mm and which are known to accumulate trace metals but are largely free from metallic additives ashton et al 2010 and hard thermoplastic objects and fragments i e excluding rubbers and foams of a range of colours n 180 whose largest dimension ranged from 10 mm to about 250 mm in the laboratory plastic pellets were washed through a 1 mm mesh with the aid of a nylon brush and subsequently ultrasonicated for 5 min in distilled water to remove extraneous non adsorbed material after drying at 40 c pellets were categorised by colour and morphology shape and the five most abundant categories namely white discs black discs smooth white cylinders rough white cylinders and translucent amber ovoids were retained in a series of screw capped plastic jars for further characterisation and experimental work plastic objects and fragments were washed through a 2 mm mesh before being dried and stored in a series of polyethylene boxes 2 2 xrf analysis plastic objects and fragments and selected plastic pellets were analysed for a range of elements contained in the matrix as additives of which the main focus was pb by field portable x ray fluorescence xrf spectrometry using a battery powered niton xl3t 950 he goldd xrf configured in a thermo fisher scientific shielded accessory stand turner and solman 2016 measurements were made over the flattest surface of each sample and with thickness correction applied for counting periods of 40 s at 50 kv and 40 μa and 20 s at 20 kv and 100 μa for quality assurance purposes two reference polyethylene discs pe 071 n and t 18 were analysed after every 15 samples with concentrations returned for all elements including pb within 15 of reference values and whose precisions as relative standard deviations were better than 10 median measurement detections limits based on three counting errors for samples returning non detects were about 5 μg g 1 for pb 2 3 avian pbet and residual pb extraction five plastic samples whose added pb concentrations exceeded 1000 μg g 1 plus a control where pb was undetected by the xrf were micronized to 3 mm in diameter using a stainless steel scalpel and grater in order to increase exposure of the internal structure and attain a size comparable with the pellets aliquots of 100 mg of each sample were then weighed into individual 60 ml screw capped polypropylene centrifuge tubes meanwhile 20 random pellets from each of the five categories plus 20 virgin plastic pellets sourced from a local injection moulding facility algram ltd plympton were added to a series of centrifuge tubes and the total mass in each case 500 mg recorded in order to determine the reactivity or bioaccessibility of pb in the plastic pellets and micronized plastics samples were subjected to a physiologically based extraction test pbet based on the digestive conditions present in marine birds and in particular in procellariiforms turner 2018 thus 1 l of digestive solution containing 1 pepsin lyophilised powder from porcine gastric mucosa sigma aldrich in 0 1 m nacl solution whose ph had been adjusted to 2 5 by addition of 1 m hcl was prepared in a glass volumetric flask and 40 ml were added to each

co association of pb with cr also determined by xrf in samples of polyethylene and polypropylene and in a mass ratio of about 4 1 suggests the presence of lead chromate particulates as a pigment for

bound as an additive or residue within the polymeric matrix this is expected as diffusion coefficients defining pb species traversing the plastic particle are orders of magnitude greater than those defining diffusion in the aqueous medium town et al 2018 what is significant however and more than offsets differences in percentage bioaccessibility is the difference in absolute concentrations of pb released between the two associations that are many orders of magnitude for plastics with no functionally added pb the quantity of adsorbed pb largely depends on the surface area and length of time suspended in the water column rochman et al 2014 and for microplastic pellets of the size and shape considered here 0 05 μg g 1 can be considered a representative bioaccessible concentration of adsorbed metal based on the pbet results fig 2 for micronized plastics of comparable dimensions containing leaded additives bioaccessible concentrations range from about 20 to 1200 μg g 1 in the pbet

samples made by xrf as part of the study may afford some indication of the quantity of added pb that is bioaccessible more generally thus despite pb being restricted or phased out in consumer plastics 28 beached samples out of 180 analysed by xrf were positive for pb presumably because of the presence of legacy plastics and the dilution of pb through the recycling of older plastics nakashima et al

ingestion is greater overall for metals present as additives or residues from manufacturing moreover based on general reaction considerations and for a given plastic risk is predicted to increase with decreasing particle size increasing gut acidity and and increasing time for digestion although the focus of the present study has been on pb data garnered simultaneously or independently on cd albeit

18108,there are two means by which metals associate with microplastics in the aquatic environment firstly they may be adsorbed to the plastic surface or hydrogenous biogenic accumulations thereon and secondly they may be present in the polymeric matrix as functional additives or as reaction or recyclate residues in this study the relative significance of these associations is evaluated with respect to pb in beached marine microplastics thus adsorbed pb was determined in 5 mm neutrally coloured polyethylene pellets that contained no detectable pb added during manufacture by digestion in dilute aqua regia while the bioaccessibility of this association was evaluated using an avian physiologically based extraction test pbet here up to about 0 1 μg g 1 of pb was adsorbed to the plastic and between about 60 and 70 of the metal was accessible lead present as additive or residue was determined by x ray fluorescence analysis of a wider range of beached plastics polyolefins and polyvinyl chloride with a selection of positive samples grated to mm dimensions and subjected to the pbet here total pb concentrations up to 40 000 μg g 1 and bioaccessibilities up to 16 were observed with bioaccessible concentrations exceeding equivalent values for adsorbed pb by several orders of magnitude ingestive exposure to pb and potentially other toxic metals is more important through the presence of additives in historical plastics and recyclate residues in contemporary plastics than from adsorption and it is recommended that future studies focus more on the environmental impacts and fate of metals bound in this form keywords microplastics metals lead additive adsorption bioaccessibility 1 introduction among the many and varied environmental impacts of marine microplastics is their ability to transport contaminants and act as a means of contaminant exposure to wildlife li et al 2016 karbalaei et al 2018 empirical studies have demonstrated that neutral organic contaminants like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and polychlorinated biphenyls are readily sorbed by the hydrophobic microplastic surface from the surrounding aqueous medium velzeboer et al 2014 liu et al 2019 however recent calculations and considerations have questioned the significance of this route for exposure and bioaccumulation compared with natural pathways beckingham and ghosh 2017 lohmann 2017 with suggestions that ingested microplastics could even act as chemical cleansers in the digestive environment koelmans et al 2016 more important in this respect appears to be the presence of organic chemicals in the plastic matrix as reaction or recyclate residues or as functional additives like plasticisers antioxidants and flame retardants hermabessiere et al 2017 gallo et al 2018 because many residues and additives are not chemically but physically bound to the plastic matrix they are able to migrate with experiments using fluids mimicking digestive conditions of fish and seabirds demonstrating considerable mobilisation of bisphenol a and various phthalate esters and flame retardants and evidence of enhanced bioaccumulation or biological estrogenicity tanaka et al 2015 coffin et al 2019 many metals have also been shown to be associated with marine microplastics thus laboratory and field studies have revealed that metal ions are able to adsorb directly to the plastic surface or to surficial accumulations of hydrogenous and biogenic matter rochman et al 2014 brennecke et al 2016 while non destructive x ray fluorescence techniques have demonstrated the presence of historical and recycled additives within the polymeric matrix nakashima et al 2012 turner 2016 what is less clear however is the relative significance of the two associations of metal hereafter termed adsorbed and matrix with regard to transport fate and potential environmental impacts like mobility in seawater or dissolution in the digestive system of a plastic ingesting animal wang et al 2017 munier and bendell 2018 in the present study the associations of pb with beached marine microplastics through adsorption from the environment and incorporation as a functional additive are quantified by appropriate analytical techniques and their mobilities compared by subjecting samples to a simulated avian physiologically based extraction test pbet lead was selected for study as among trace metals it has a relatively high affinity for plastic surfaces and accumulations thereon ashton et al 2010 holmes et al 2014 it was historically important as a pigment for colour and a heat stabiliser in plastics hansen et al 2013 and is highly toxic to seabirds finkelstein et al 2003 with evidence that pb derived from ingested plastic is able to accumulate lavers and bond 2016 the two associations of pb or any metal in microplastics and their mechanisms of release are conceptualised in fig 1 and serve to assist the definitions and discussion below thus firstly pb is physically held in the plastic as a simple compounded additive pb x matrix which is able to diffuse through the water saturated matrix itself or on dissociation with the rate of the latter ph dependent secondly pb is bound at adsorption sites on the plastic or on a more reactive and charged coating that has accumulated on the plastic surface during suspension pbads and is able to undergo release through desorption should environmental conditions change while two distinctive associations and mechanisms of release are illustrated it is likely that both processes occur simultaneously or successively in seawater or in the avian digestive environment 2 methods 2 1 sampling samples of marine plastics were collected by hand from the strandlines of south or south west i e atlantic facing sandy beaches within 10 km of plymouth south west england sampling focussed on black white and off white pellets and mainly pre production pellets n 300 whose primary and secondary diameters ranged from about 2 to 4 mm and which are known to accumulate trace metals but are largely free from metallic additives ashton et al 2010 and hard thermoplastic objects and fragments i e excluding rubbers and foams of a range of colours n 180 whose largest dimension ranged from 10 mm to about 250 mm in the laboratory plastic pellets were washed through a 1 mm mesh with the aid of a nylon brush and subsequently ultrasonicated for 5 min in distilled water to remove extraneous non adsorbed material after drying at 40 c pellets were categorised by colour and morphology shape and the five most abundant categories namely white discs black discs smooth white cylinders rough white cylinders and translucent amber ovoids were retained in a series of screw capped plastic jars for further characterisation and experimental work plastic objects and fragments were washed through a 2 mm mesh before being dried and stored in a series of polyethylene boxes 2 2 xrf analysis plastic objects and fragments and selected plastic pellets were analysed for a range of elements contained in the matrix as additives of which the main focus was pb by field portable x ray fluorescence xrf spectrometry using a battery powered niton xl3t 950 he goldd xrf configured in a thermo fisher scientific shielded accessory stand turner and solman 2016 measurements were made over the flattest surface of each sample and with thickness correction applied for counting periods of 40 s at 50 kv and 40 μa and 20 s at 20 kv and 100 μa for quality assurance purposes two reference polyethylene discs pe 071 n and t 18 were analysed after every 15 samples with concentrations returned for all elements including pb within 15 of reference values and whose precisions as relative standard deviations were better than 10 median measurement detections limits based on three counting errors for samples returning non detects were about 5 μg g 1 for pb 2 3 avian pbet and residual pb extraction five plastic samples whose added pb concentrations exceeded 1000 μg g 1 plus a control where pb was undetected by the xrf were micronized to 3 mm in diameter using a stainless steel scalpel and grater in order to increase exposure of the internal structure and attain a size comparable with the pellets aliquots of 100 mg of each sample were then weighed into individual 60 ml screw capped polypropylene centrifuge tubes meanwhile 20 random pellets from each of the five categories plus 20 virgin plastic pellets sourced from a local injection moulding facility algram ltd plympton were added to a series of centrifuge tubes and the total mass in each case 500 mg recorded in order to determine the reactivity or bioaccessibility of pb in the plastic pellets and micronized plastics samples were subjected to a physiologically based extraction test pbet based on the digestive conditions present in marine birds and in particular in procellariiforms turner 2018 thus 1 l of digestive solution containing 1 pepsin lyophilised powder

biodegradation during subsurface passage this is one of the very few field studies of torcs analysing an extensive and long set of data encompassing 37 compounds measured fortnightly to monthly at a number of groundwater observation wells over the duration of 6 years with the model analysis we characterize and quantify the biodegradation processes of a number of torcs not well studied yet e g 9

bertelkamp et al 2014 retardation was found to be less important at the here investigated site 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the urban water cycle of berlin is described as a semi closed system relying partly on indirect wastewater reuse as approximately 70 of the abstraction raw water for drinking water production comes from mar by bank filtration and pond infiltration of surface water containing secondary treated wastewater e g grünheid et al 2005 massmann et al 2008 which is also the case of our study site located on the eastern shore of lake tegel fig 1 a the lake is fed by the havel river the stream tegeler flieβ and the nordgraben canal which contains high amounts of secondary treated wastewater followed by phosphate elimination before discharges into the environment hass et al 2012 schimmelpfennig et al 2012b fig 1b recently this treatment stage has been upgraded with powdered activated carbon dosing to remove torcs hydraulic and torc loads are highly variable due to additional management options including a pipeline located under the lake s bottom and connecting to a point near the outlet of the river havel schimmelpfennig et al 2012a sperlich et al 2017a due to induced bank filtration lake water infiltrates into the sandy aquifer towards a lineament of drinking water wells located at 100 m distance from the shore operated by the water company berliner wasserbetriebe bwb there a transect of groundwater monitoring wells transect tegel has been used to extensively study the behaviour of torcs during bank filtration since 2002 fig 1c at the transect fluvial and glacio fluvial medium sized sand deposits form a 40 m thick aquifer partially subdivided by an aquitard the transect comprises of seven shallow and four deep monitoring wells and reaches from the lake towards a production well 13 the travel time to the production well ranges between 3 and 5 months depending on the abstraction rates grünheid et al 2005 richter et al 2008 and variations of hydraulic heads and mud deposition massmann et al 2008 identified a vertical age stratification ranging from months to decades at depth suggesting that older bank filtrate water from the opposite shore is encountered at the deeper part of the transect regarding the redox conditions in the aquifer those were found to vary between oxic sub oxic conditions during winter and anoxic conditions during summer henzler et al 2016 figures si 14 and si 15 show temporal evolution of electron donor electron acceptors and hydraulic and hydrogeochemical parameters in table 1 soil properties are described in grünheid et al 2005 this study concentrates on three monitoring wells aligned in flow direction and receiving pure young bank filtrate from the nearest lakeshore teg371op sen3302 and sen3303 here oxic conditions are encountered near the infiltration zone followed by denitrification and manganese reduction processes yet never reaching sulfate reduction the extent and location of the distinct redox zones are varying considerably as a function of seasonal changes in water temperatures affecting the rates of the microbially mediated terminal electron acceptor reactions henzler et al 2016 the outcomes of this work complement previous investigations on torcs at the site grünheid et al 2005 richter et al 2008 massmann et al 2008 wiese et al 2011 hass et al 2012 henzler et al 2014 whereby henzler et al 2014 used a similar model approach for 12 compounds monitored at the site between 2002 and 2005 2 2 data origin the tegel transect has been regularly monitored by bwb for hydraulic heads temperatures major ions and a large set of torcs the set up and calibration of the groundwater flow and conservative transport model rely on water level and temperature data measured from the january 3 2012 to the february 26 2018 at the lake and five monitoring wells teg371op sen3302 sen3303 sen3304 and teg374 torcs were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry using either a tandem mass spectrometer xevo tq s waters or a high resolution mass spectrometer exactive plus thermo fisher scientific wode et al 2012 37 torcs were selected for modelling see table 2 after applying two criteria to the concentration time series of 275 torcs available for surface and groundwater monitoring wells teg371op sen3302 and

concentrations loq were ranked as loq 2 which may vary without affecting results when analytical methods and or measuring devices changed the lake water was monitored directly in front of the transect and in the micro sieve station which pumps lake water from a location at 6 km respectively from the lakeshore fig 1b schimmelpfennig et al 2012a both time series correlated well and were merged to one time series representing the input from the lake for the model except for primidone for which only the concentrations from the surface water in front of the transect were used torc concentrations in

the two dimensional model represents a vertical cross section of the transect to simulate groundwater flow heat and reactive transport processes from the lake to the abstraction well over six years 2012 2018 the numerical model is set up in the finite element software package feflow hans joerg diersch 2014 the flow system was solved by using the richards equation richards 1931 and an empirical model for the parametrization the reactive transport model was based on previous work henzler et al 2016 2014 using modflow mt3dms pht3d modelling framework see si fig 2 depicts the model domain of 40 m thickness and 178 m length spatially discretized by a triangular element mesh and illustrates its main physical features the monitoring and production wells and the boundaries for hydraulic heads temperature and solute compound concentration initial conditions for all model variables were set to zero and simulations runs start one year 347 days before the target time a spin up period of 3 times the mean travel time to the farthest observation point i e 360 days was considered sufficient for the simulation results to become independent from the initial conditions the porous media was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic within each recognized unit aquifer and aquitards see tables si 1 the bank filtrate enters the aquifer via the lakebed γ1 young bank filtrate water and the left side γ2 old bank filtrate water both are implemented as cauchy type boundary conditions with a constant external hydraulic head at 31 0 mnn normal null mean sea level the corresponding leakance factor served as calibration parameter the landside boundary was placed below the local aquitard γ3 and defined as a transient dirichlet type boundary whereby a time series of weighted average values of hydraulic heads of neighbouring wells teg050 teg341 and sen3304 was applied for the extraction rates at well 13 γ4 a weekly constant neumann type boundary was applied derived from averaged pumping rates of the surrounding wells 11 to 15 the no flow boundary at the bottom reflects the base of the aquifer annual recharge by precipitation was neglected temperature was utilized as a tracer to constrain the flow and conservative transport patterns along the modelled cross section thereby accounting for heat diffusion and retardation henzler et al 2016 seasonal temperature changes were applied at the lake boundary whilst below the lake and at the landside boundary a constant temperature of 11 c was set in line with the mean groundwater temperature in berlin region all inflow boundary conditions of the transport model were defined as dirichlet type boundary condition i e fixed mass concentration the behaviour of 37 selected trace organic compounds were simulated defining the following boundary conditions at the lake boundary the concentration time series of the combined datasets from the shallow surface water well and the micro sieve station was applied γ1 below the lake γ2 the model concentrations correspond to those observed in the deepest monitoring well teg374 where very old bank filtrate of around 20 years was found massmann et al 2008 at the landside boundary concentrations observed at the monitoring well sen3304 were assumed to be representative for the water quality arriving at the transect from the inland γ3 at first simulations were conducted assuming conservative behaviour from which observed deviations between modelled and measured concentrations at the monitoring wells teg371op sen3302 and sen3303 were attributed to transformation reactions those that appear to follow 1st order degradation were modelled as such applying spatially and temporally uniform 1st order rate degradation constants sorption or more complex degradation processes were not modelled here but hypotheses are discussed in the following the theoretical retardation coefficients r are included in table 2 and were calculated following empirical expressions karickhoff et al 1979 see si 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater flow temperature and tracer transport groundwater flow and conservative transport could be well captured with the model figure si 1 compares simulated and measured hydraulic heads which show a satisfactory agreement including the water table fluctuations fig 3 depicts an excellent adjustment between the observed and simulated groundwater temperature time series using an r 2 1 which is reasonable compared to 1 87 previously calibrated at the site henzler et al 2016 wiese and nützmann 2009 it also supports the idea that the selected monitoring wells receive only young water infiltrated from the nearest lakeshore tables s 1 shows the model parameters 3 2 persistent trace organic compounds for the compounds of this group conservative i e non reactive simulations yield the best approximation to the measured concentrations along the aquifer passage figure si 2 8 as the mean residence time to the most distant observation well is 4 months we cannot identify half lives that are 3 times the maximum travel time 4 8 months based on our model and data thus when simulation results suggest compounds to degrade with t1 2 433 days which is 3 times the maximum travel time they are termed persistent fig 4 a shows the measured and modelled time series of edta in surface water and at the three groundwater observation wells as an example for such compounds the results agree with the low degradability and sorption affinity at field scale reported by previous investigations e g henzler et al 2014 and references therein where its potential as enduring groundwater contaminant was noted danish et al 2016 maximum lake water concentrations up to 1 6 μg l of carbamazepine figure si 2 were identified but decrease one order of magnitude lower during the last three years of our target time the monitoring wells exhibit similar concentrations as the infiltrated ones in the first four years of the study indicating conservative behaviour which fits with some previous findings in the area of berlin sacher et al 2001 in contrast henzler et al 2014 reported carbamazepine degradation with a half live of 66 days for the same site however from mid 2016 onwards concentrations in groundwater lie above the input concentrations whereby a positive correlation with temperature is observed the reason for this behaviour is unclear it may either be explained by temperature dependent desorption of carbamazepine triggered by the strong decrease of inflow concentrations causing sorption disequilibrium between solid and fluid phase another possibility may be an unidentified contamination or irregularities in the groundwater flow field the adequate simulation of the observed temperature fluctuations does however suggest that the water arriving at the monitoring wells is indeed young lake water and that the groundwater flow is well captured the apparent release of carbamazepine occurs between the lakeshore and the first monitoring well teg371op whilst persistence and elevated concentrations were observed from there onwards a similar phenomenon was observed for nine other torcs including phenazone benzotriazole tolyltriazole as well as the transformation products gabalactam 9 ca adin amph dp and amdoph the latter however increased in summer 2017 only erratically at well teg371op primidone and pema figure si 4 are continuously present in the lake water with maximum concentrations of 0 6 μg l and 0 2 μg l and a mean concentration between 0 1 and 0 2 μg l and 0 05 0 1 μg l respectively those are slightly lower values than those reported by hass et al 2011 for wastewater effluents in berlin conservative behaviour for primidone has frequently been reported e g henzler et al 2014 and references therein and pema hass et al 2012 legal restrictions in the use of mtbe and etbe figure si 5 lowered their concentrations significantly in surface water after 2014 such that persistent behaviour of mtbe could only be reported for the two first years of simulation in column experiments mtbe has less efficient removal than etbe hübner et al 2012 henzler et al 2014 reported very low removal of mtbe at the site with a t1 2 of 82 days and bertelkamp et al 2014 found it biodegradable however also stated that mtbe is mostly described as persistent in the literature here occasional maximum concentrations of acesulfame figure si 3 were observed in summer in the lake water with concentrations as high as 10 μg l but concentrations strongly declined from 2015 onwards conservative behaviour can be deduced from the simulations as mostly found in other studies e g engelhardt et al 2013 whilst burke et al 2014a also reported redox dependent attenuation with removal under oxic penoxic to suboxic conditions candesartan and olmesartan figure si 6 show negligible attenuation after the short residence times of 3 4 months at the site their presence in the lake water also shows a sinusoidal signal with peaks in winter for unknown reasons at this site sartans were described out as possible mother compound of valsartan acid hellauer et al 2017 van baar 2015 the mean concentration of oxipurinol figure si 7 in the lake water was 2 5 μg l this value is similar to that reported for wastewater effluents of 3 μg l hermes et al 2018 including oxipurinol in the list of torcs in bank filtration oxypurinol has been shown to be well removed by activated carbon adsorption during drinking water treatment sperlich et al 2017b straub et al 2019 suggests that biodegradation of metformin figure si 8 under anaerobic conditions may occur in sludge sediments and soil media however this response was not observed at the site data in teg371op is likely erroneous the reason for concentration occasionally exceeding the conservative simulation is unclear tcpp figure si 5 appears to behave conservatively but it also has been removed only in the long term and under anaerobic conditions stepien et al 2013 hence 3 4 months of residence time at the site could be too short to observe degradation 3 3 reactive trace organic compounds 3 3 1 only present in lake water significant concentrations in the lake but concentrations below the respective loq in groundwater at all monitoring wells were found for these compounds first order biodegradation simulations were performed to approximate minimum rate constants and or maximum half live values table 2 rate constants were selected with simulated concentrations loq at the monitoring well closest to the lakeshore fig 4b metoprolol maximum concentrations of bezafibrate figure si 3 occur in the lake in winter up to the 0 1 μg l notice that this compound almost disappears in the lake from middle 2016 onwards its rapid depletion even after few centimetres during bank filtration was already identified by heberer et al 2004 the same behaviour was observed for metoprolol sotalol figure si 7 and 4 aaa figure si 9 rapid attenuation of metoprolol t1 2 1 37 h depending on redox conditions and temperatures as well as 4 aaa was already reported burke et al 2014a 2014b iomeprol and iopromid are continuously present in the surface water but concentrations significantly increase until 2014 to 5 μg l and 1 μg l respectively followed by a constant decline to 1 μg l and 0 5 μg l respectively grünheid et al 2005 identified iopromid a tri iodinated benzene derivate as stable and hydrophilic that is hard to remove by wastewater treatment and reported much higher surface water concentrations in lake tegel of around 20 μg l only one peak of 4 hydroxydiclofenac figure si 11 and deet figure si 12 at significant concentrations each were observed in the lake water but approximate rate constants were nevertheless estimated 3 3 2 present in groundwater with first order biodegradation behaviour fig 4c exemplary depicts the observed and simulated time series of pregabalin analysed since 2015 seasonal fluctuation of the concentration in the lake water exceeded 0 1 μg l in winter 2015 and since then decreased pregabalin did not show any retardation and its transport behaviour was very well reproduced with a rate constant λ 0 005 d 1 t1 2 140 days the dioh cbz figure si 2 is almost constantly present in the receiving water of sewage effluents and shows a similar time series than cbz könig et al 2016 its maximum concentration is 0 8 μg l in 2014 and concentrations steadily decrease to 0 2 μg l since then its fate during subsurface passage is well captured by the reactive model using λ 0 005 d 1 t1 2 140 days however observations during the last two years of the time series may indicate slightly better degradation during the warm summer and almost persistence in the winter seasons of 2017 and 2018 at least at teg371op the degradation rate could either be only affected by the water temperature or by both temperature and redox conditions at the same time oxic suboxic conditions in winter anaerobic in summer as such besides the known effect of enhanced biodegradation in with higher temperatures it is also possible that dioh cbz might degrade better under anaerobic conditions bahlmann et al 2014 gabapentin figure si 8 is reported as degradable under aerobic conditions at laboratory scale henning et al 2018 and in pilot studies using powdered activated carbon pac for the removal of organic micro pollutants as an additional advanced wastewater treatment step altmann et al 2016 meinel et al 2016 this was also confirmed in granular activated carbon gac absorbers for drinking water treatment sperlich et al 2017b and field studies for sequential mar hellauer et al 2018 here a rather low degradation rate of λ 0 0017 d 1 t1 2 407 days describes its behaviour in groundwater better at least during the time period when the concentration in the lake water is above 1 μg l later when concentrations in the lake were lower conservative and reactive simulations yield similar results grünheid et al 2005 reported water concentrations in tegel of 1 μg l of sulfamethoxazole figure si 13 with a removal percentage of 20 on the flow path for a time period between may 2003 march 2004 highly dependent on inflow concentration whilst it also behaves as degradable in column experiments depending on redox conditions bai et al 2019 at the same time sulfamethoxazole is often considered persistent van driezum et al 2019 maximum lake water concentrations of 0 2 μg l were reduced to 0 05 μg l during the studied time period a rate constant of λ 0 003 d 1 t1 2 230 days captures the main degradation trend of sulfamethoxazole in the aquifer prior 2015 while thereafter observed concentrations higher than the non reactive appear sporadically iopamidol figure si 10 shows lower degradability than iopromid and iomeprol at the site the maximum lake water concentration is 1 5 μg l concentration data in the groundwater exists only for 2012 and 2017 onwards with mean concentrations of 0 25 μg l at sen3303 the fate of iopamidol can be described by first order kinetics with λ 0 003 d 1 t1 2 230 days iodinated contrast media have been identified as very persistent in surface water and mobile in aquifers ternes and hirsch 2000 but they show high degradability throughout the subsurface passage zuehlke et al 2007 efficient removal of etbe figure si 5 was observed in hübner et al 2012 and in sand column experiments reaching removal efficiencies of 90 yeh and novak 1995 and among 70 80 bertelkamp et al 2016 although it is continuously present in the lake water with concentrations in the range of 0 1 1 2 μg l concentrations are negligible within the aquifer some data points suggest a good approximation with a reactive simulation of λ 0 008 d 1 t1 2 87 days 3 3 3 present in groundwater with more complex behaviour for some reactive compounds a simple first order degradation model could not capture the main trends and features of their occurrence along the bank filtration flow path well the main reason is probably that the assumption of a constant reaction rate constant is a simplification and rarely encountered in nature caused by for example transient temperatures and redox zones henzler et al 2016 or small scale heterogeneities of the aquifer e g organic rich zones or clay lenses compounds that appeared to be subject to temperature desorption from the aquifer following decreasing input concentrations are not included in this group it is beyond the scope of this paper reporting on many torcs to carry out more complex modelling and the behaviour of these compounds is therefore merely described qualitatively concentrations of 2 5 μg l of diclofenac figure si 7 were observed in wastewater effluents in berlin heberer 2002 diclofenac has also been reported to photodegrade in surface water bartels and von tümpling 2007 such tendency is clearly observed in the time series of the lake water with peaks during winter and absence during summer it seems that the input signal penetrating into the aquifer is retarded as indicated from the apparent time lag of the observed peaks compared to those in the non reactive simulation in teg371op which suggests sorption sorption of diclofenac was previously observed in laboratory experiments scheytt et al 2005 2006 and at field sites henzler et al 2014 besides it also appears to biodegrade along transect the analgesic phenazone and the phenazone type metabolite 4 faa figure si 9 have been reported to be redox sensitive only degrading in the presence of oxygen massmann et al 2006 greskowiak et al 2006 heberer et al 2008 hübner et al 2012 they are constantly present in the lake water from 0 05 to 0 4 μg l and 0 1 1 3 μg l respectively none of those compounds achieve complete depletion at the farthest observation point and they both display a strong seasonal signal in the bank filtrate with concentrations like the conservative simulation in summer and almost complete degradation in winter this is consistent to the inverse temperature correlation with better degradation in winter when the oxic zone is wider as described by massmann et al 2006 and greskowiak et al 2006 however their apparent decline along the flow path even to some extent during the summer suggests that both substances may also degrade under suboxic conditions the concentrations of valsartan figure si 6 in surface water show seasonal peaks in spring followed by a decrease to zero in autumn valsartan degrades along the flow path and seems to be affected by sorption as the observed concentration peaks arrive somewhat delayed at teg371op compared to the non reactive simulation beyond that point valsartan was hardly detected anymore benzotriazole and tolyltriazole figure si 12 are always present in surface water but concentrations also decreased in the last three years they have been reported as highly persistent during bank filtration hübner et al 2012 in column studies burke et al 2014a confirmed persistent behaviour for benzotriazole but observed some degradation under oxic penoxic to suboxic conditions for tolyltriazole whilst the behaviour of the compounds at the site seems to be mostly rather conservative some degradation is visible in the first half of the study period at least at sen3303 additionally they also display concentrations higher than to be expected from the conservative simulation in the summer seasons of 2017 and 2018 for which the reason remains unclear 3 4 transformation products five transformation products produced along the bank filtration were identified whilst 9 ca adin and dp were not present in the lake at all concentrations of amph gabalactam and valsartan acid in the bank filtrate increased along the flow path reactive modelling of their formation was beyond the scope of this paper 9 ca adin figure si 2 emerges between the lake and teg371op at concentrations 0 6 μg l seemingly correlating with the seasonal temperature signal further along the flow path degradation seems to occur to some extent which might be captured by a first order degradation model dp figure si 11 phenazone type metabolite exhibits a similar behaviour the formation of valsartan acid figure si 11 is not clearly identifiable along the flow path as it is already present in the surface water with maximum concentration of nearly 5 μg l however concentrations seem to increase before teg371op to be slowly degraded along the flow path downgradient valsartan acid has previously been poorly removed during bank filtration nödler et al 2013 van baar 2015 but significant removal was observed in sequential mar hellauer et al 2018 and during gac filtration nödler et al 2013 sperlich et al 2017b the latter attributed to biodegradation sperlich et al 2017b gabalactam figure si 8 is present in the lake in concentrations around 0 1 μg l but concentrations in the bank filtrate at teg371op in contrast display a seasonal variation with elevated concentrations in summer up to 0 35 μg l and values close to the loq of 0 05 μg l in winter the reason remains unclear as formation desorption as well as redox and or temperature dependent degradation are possible processes the inflow concentration of amph figure si 4 reddersen et al 2002 tends to follow a sinusoidal fluctuation with peaks positively correlated with winter seasons and concentrations in the bank filtrate are often above the conservative simulation figures si 17 23 show the mean variation of concentrations with distance for all torcs and the 1st order decay function of reactive torcs 4 conclusions this work evaluates the fate and transport behaviour of 37 trace organic compounds torcs at a bank filtration site lake tegel berlin for a relatively long time span of 6 years 2012 2018 based on the comparison of an extensive field data set and the numerical outcomes of a two dimensional reactive transport model we classified torcs according to their occurrence in three intermediate monitoring wells receiving young bank filtrate with a mean residence time of months tr 3 4 months only candesartan carbamazepine metformin olmesartan oxipurinol primidone acesulfame amdoph pema mtbe tcpp and edta were found to be persistent or displaying only negligible degradation in contrast bezafibrate metoprolol sotalol 4 aaa 4 hydroxydiclofenac iomeprol iopromid and deet were rapidly removed from the bank filtrate after infiltration not appearing in the closest observation well to the lakeshore still we approximated their maximum half live threshold values assuming uniform first order biodegradation rate constants although these results are plausible compared to literature values they should be considered as first estimates due to involved model uncertainties the compounds dioh cbz gabapentin pregabalin sulfamethoxazole iopamidol and etbe could be well described with uniform first order biodegradation and field scale representative first order degradation rate constants the transport behaviour of diclofenac phenazone valsartan 4 faa benzotriazole and tolyltriazole was more complex and could not be well described using a uniform first order biodegradation model despite evidence of sorption temperature and or redox dependent degradation for some compounds a detailed process analysis was beyond the scope of this paper and will be subject of a follow up paper finally 9 ca adin dp amph gabalactam and valsartan acid appear to have been generated on site and are related to other target torcs as possible mother compounds notice that during the summer of 2017 and towards the end of the monitoring period in 2018 evident concentration peaks of carbamazepine amdoph benzotriazole tolyltriazole phenazone 9 ca adin gabalactam dp and amph were identified in the monitoring wells partly well above concentrations to be expected from the conservative simulation resolving whether such so far undescribed behaviour could be attributed to local environmental conditions fostering temperature dependent desorption after the concentrations in the source water strongly declined will be subject of future investigations on the other hand very high retardation factor values of candesartan diclofenac bezafibrate valsartan and 4 hydroxydiclofenac in table 2 suggest that the behaviour classification and estimated 1st order rate constants derived from this study may be subject to bias due to the inherent strong sorption potential of these compounds overall the presented model based analysis of such a long term field dataset will improve the knowledge of the expected fate and behaviour of torcs during managed aquifer recharge and in groundwater it will also contribute to the currently sparse dataset of field scale biodegradation rate

18109,though bank filtration diminishes the loads of many trace organic compounds torcs present in the source water still there is a wide uncertainty on the influence of local environmental conditions on biodegradation processes this research addresses the fate and transport behaviour of 37 trace organic compounds at a bank filtration site in germany over a relatively long time span of six years using two dimensional heat and reactive transport modelling in feflow torcs are classified according to their occurrence in bank filtration wells with a residence time of up to 4 months we identify 12 persistent compounds 20 reactive compounds and 5 transformation products formed during aquifer passage estimates of first order biodegradation rate constants are given for six reactive compounds minimum biodegradation rate constants i e maximum half lives are approximated for eight compounds only present in the surface water for some compounds a simple first order degradation model did not yield satisfactory results and the behaviour appears to be more complex processes like sorption redox and or temperature dependent biodegradation and temperature dependent desorption are suspected but incorporating these into the model was beyond the scope of this paper that provides an overview for many compounds results highlight the ability of the sub surface to improve the water quality during

target torcs at a bank filtration site used for drinking water production which was intensively monitored from january 2012 to february 2018 two dimensional numerical reactive transport modelling was applied to distinguish between persistent and reactive torcs and to estimate field scale representative first order rate constants for reactive compounds that appeared to follow 1st order

bertelkamp et al 2014 retardation was found to be less important at the here investigated site 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the urban water cycle of berlin is described as a semi closed system relying partly on indirect wastewater reuse as approximately 70 of the abstraction raw water for drinking water production comes from mar by bank filtration and pond infiltration of surface water containing secondary treated wastewater e g grünheid et al 2005 massmann et al 2008 which is also the case of our study site located on the eastern shore of lake tegel fig 1 a the lake is fed by the havel river the stream tegeler flieβ and the nordgraben canal which contains high amounts of secondary treated wastewater followed by phosphate elimination before discharges into the environment hass et al 2012 schimmelpfennig et al 2012b fig 1b recently this treatment stage has been upgraded with powdered activated carbon dosing to remove torcs hydraulic and torc loads are highly variable due to additional management options including a pipeline located under the lake s bottom and connecting to a point near the outlet of the river havel schimmelpfennig et al 2012a sperlich et al 2017a due to induced bank filtration lake water infiltrates into the sandy aquifer towards a lineament of drinking water wells located at 100 m distance from the shore operated by the water company berliner wasserbetriebe bwb there a transect of groundwater monitoring wells transect tegel has been used to extensively study the behaviour of torcs during bank filtration since 2002 fig 1c at the transect fluvial and glacio fluvial medium sized sand deposits form a 40 m thick aquifer partially subdivided by an aquitard the transect comprises of seven shallow and four deep monitoring wells and reaches from the lake towards a production well 13 the travel time to the production well ranges between 3 and 5 months depending on the abstraction rates grünheid et al 2005 richter et al 2008 and variations of hydraulic heads and mud deposition massmann et al 2008 identified a vertical age stratification ranging from months to decades at depth suggesting that older bank filtrate water from the opposite shore is encountered at the deeper part of the transect regarding the redox conditions in the aquifer those were found to vary between oxic sub oxic conditions during winter and anoxic conditions during summer henzler et al 2016 figures si 14 and si 15 show temporal evolution of electron donor electron acceptors and hydraulic and hydrogeochemical parameters in table 1 soil properties are described in grünheid et al 2005 this study concentrates on three monitoring wells aligned in flow direction and receiving pure young bank filtrate from the nearest lakeshore teg371op sen3302 and sen3303 here oxic conditions are encountered near the infiltration zone followed by denitrification and manganese reduction processes yet never reaching sulfate reduction the extent and location of the distinct redox zones are varying considerably as a function of seasonal changes in water temperatures affecting the rates of the microbially mediated terminal electron acceptor reactions henzler et al 2016 the outcomes of this work complement previous investigations on torcs at the site grünheid et al 2005 richter et al 2008 massmann et al 2008 wiese et al 2011 hass et al 2012 henzler et al 2014 whereby henzler et al 2014 used a similar model approach for 12 compounds monitored at the site between 2002 and 2005 2 2 data origin the tegel transect has been regularly monitored by bwb for hydraulic heads temperatures major ions and a large set of torcs the set up and calibration of the groundwater flow and conservative transport model rely on water level and temperature data measured from the january 3 2012 to the february 26 2018 at the lake and five monitoring wells teg371op sen3302 sen3303 sen3304 and teg374 torcs were quantified by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry using either a tandem mass spectrometer xevo tq s waters or a high resolution mass spectrometer exactive plus thermo fisher scientific wode et al 2012 37 torcs were selected for modelling see table 2 after applying two criteria to the concentration time series of 275 torcs available for surface and groundwater monitoring wells teg371op sen3302 and sen3303 i existence of at least 10 data points higher than the limit of quantification loq ii the occurrence of a traceable and quantifiable breakthrough in at least one of the monitoring wells concentrations loq were ranked as loq 2 which may vary without affecting results when analytical methods and or measuring devices changed the lake water was monitored directly in front of the transect and in the micro sieve station which pumps lake water from a location at 6 km respectively from the lakeshore fig 1b schimmelpfennig et al 2012a both time series correlated well and were merged to one time series representing the input from the lake for the model except for primidone for which only the concentrations from the surface water in front of the transect were used torc concentrations in

the two dimensional model represents a vertical cross section of the transect to simulate groundwater flow heat and reactive transport processes from the lake to the abstraction well over six years 2012 2018 the numerical model is set up in the finite element software package feflow hans joerg diersch 2014 the flow system was solved by using the richards equation richards 1931 and an empirical model for the parametrization the reactive transport model was based on previous work henzler et al 2016 2014 using modflow mt3dms pht3d modelling framework see si fig 2 depicts the model domain of 40 m thickness and 178 m length spatially discretized by a triangular element mesh and illustrates its main physical features the monitoring and production wells and the boundaries for hydraulic heads temperature and solute compound concentration initial conditions for all model variables were set to zero and simulations runs start one year 347 days before the target time a spin up period of 3 times the mean travel time to the farthest observation point i e 360 days was considered sufficient for the simulation results to become independent from the initial conditions the porous media was assumed to be homogeneous and isotropic within each recognized unit aquifer and aquitards see tables si 1 the bank filtrate enters the aquifer via the lakebed γ1 young bank filtrate water and the left side γ2 old bank filtrate water both are implemented as cauchy type boundary conditions with a constant external hydraulic head at 31 0 mnn normal null mean sea level the corresponding leakance factor served as calibration parameter the landside boundary was placed below the local aquitard γ3 and defined as a transient dirichlet type boundary whereby a time series of weighted average values of hydraulic heads of neighbouring wells teg050 teg341 and sen3304 was applied for the extraction rates at well 13 γ4 a weekly constant neumann type boundary was applied derived from averaged pumping rates of the surrounding wells 11 to 15 the no flow boundary at the bottom reflects the base of the aquifer annual recharge by precipitation was neglected temperature was utilized as a tracer to constrain the flow and conservative transport patterns along the modelled cross section thereby accounting for heat diffusion and retardation henzler et al 2016 seasonal temperature changes were applied at the lake boundary whilst below the lake and at the landside boundary a constant temperature of 11 c was set in line with the mean groundwater temperature in berlin region all inflow boundary conditions of the transport model were defined as dirichlet type boundary condition i e fixed mass concentration the behaviour of 37 selected trace organic compounds were simulated defining the following boundary conditions at the lake boundary the concentration time series of the combined datasets from the shallow surface water well and the micro sieve station was applied γ1 below the lake γ2 the model concentrations correspond to those observed in the deepest monitoring well teg374 where very old bank filtrate of around 20 years was found massmann et al 2008 at the landside boundary concentrations observed at the monitoring well sen3304 were assumed to be representative for the water quality arriving at the transect from the inland γ3 at first simulations were conducted assuming conservative behaviour from which observed deviations between modelled and measured concentrations at the monitoring wells teg371op sen3302 and sen3303 were attributed to transformation reactions those that appear to follow 1st order degradation were modelled as such applying spatially and temporally uniform 1st order rate degradation constants sorption or more complex degradation processes were not modelled here but hypotheses are discussed in the following the theoretical retardation coefficients r are included in table 2 and were calculated following empirical expressions karickhoff et al 1979 see si 3 results and discussion 3 1 groundwater flow temperature and tracer transport groundwater flow and conservative transport could be well captured with the model figure si 1 compares simulated and measured hydraulic heads which show a satisfactory agreement including the water table fluctuations fig 3 depicts an excellent adjustment between the observed and simulated groundwater temperature time series using an r 2 1 which is reasonable compared to 1 87 previously calibrated at the site henzler et al 2016 wiese and nützmann 2009 it also supports the idea that the selected monitoring wells receive only young water infiltrated from the nearest lakeshore tables s 1 shows the model parameters 3 2 persistent trace organic compounds for the compounds of this group conservative i e non reactive simulations yield the best approximation to the measured concentrations along the aquifer passage figure si 2 8 as the mean residence time to the most distant observation well is 4 months we cannot identify half lives that are 3 times the maximum travel time 4 8 months based on our model and data thus when simulation results suggest compounds to degrade with t1 2 433 days which is 3 times the maximum travel time they are termed persistent fig 4 a shows the measured and modelled time series of edta in surface water and at the three groundwater observation wells as an example for such compounds the results agree with the low degradability and sorption affinity at field scale reported by previous investigations e g henzler et al 2014 and references therein where its potential as enduring groundwater contaminant was noted danish et al 2016 maximum lake water concentrations up to 1 6 μg l of carbamazepine figure si 2 were identified but decrease one order of magnitude lower during the last three years of our target time the monitoring wells exhibit similar concentrations as the infiltrated ones in the first four years of the study indicating conservative behaviour which fits with some previous findings in the area of berlin sacher et al 2001 in contrast henzler et al 2014 reported carbamazepine degradation with a half live of 66 days for the same site however from mid 2016 onwards concentrations in groundwater lie above the input concentrations whereby a positive correlation with temperature is observed the reason for this behaviour is unclear it may either be explained by temperature dependent desorption of carbamazepine triggered by the strong decrease of inflow concentrations causing sorption disequilibrium between solid and fluid phase another possibility may be an unidentified contamination or irregularities in the groundwater flow field the adequate simulation of the observed temperature fluctuations does however suggest that the water arriving at the monitoring wells is indeed young lake water and that the groundwater flow is well captured the apparent release of carbamazepine occurs between the lakeshore and the first monitoring well teg371op whilst persistence and elevated concentrations were observed from there onwards a similar phenomenon was observed for nine other torcs including phenazone benzotriazole tolyltriazole as well as the transformation products gabalactam 9 ca adin amph dp and amdoph the latter however increased in summer 2017 only erratically at well teg371op primidone and pema figure si 4 are continuously present in the lake water with maximum concentrations of 0 6 μg l and 0 2 μg l and a mean concentration between 0 1 and 0 2 μg l and 0 05 0 1 μg l respectively those are slightly lower values than those reported by hass et al 2011 for wastewater effluents in berlin conservative behaviour for primidone has frequently been reported e g henzler et al 2014 and references therein and pema hass et al 2012 legal restrictions in the use of mtbe and etbe figure si 5 lowered their concentrations significantly in surface water after 2014 such that persistent behaviour of mtbe could only be reported for the two first years of simulation in column experiments mtbe has less efficient removal than etbe hübner et al 2012 henzler et al 2014 reported very low removal of mtbe at the site with a t1 2 of 82 days and bertelkamp et al 2014 found it biodegradable however also stated that mtbe is mostly described as persistent in the literature here occasional maximum concentrations of acesulfame figure si 3 were observed in summer in the lake water with concentrations as high as 10 μg l but concentrations strongly declined from 2015 onwards conservative behaviour can be deduced from the simulations as mostly found in other studies e g engelhardt et al 2013 whilst burke et al 2014a also reported redox dependent attenuation with removal under oxic penoxic to suboxic conditions candesartan and olmesartan figure si 6 show negligible attenuation after the short residence times of 3 4 months at the site their presence in the lake water also shows a sinusoidal signal with peaks in winter for unknown reasons at this site sartans were described out as possible mother compound of valsartan acid hellauer et al 2017 van baar 2015 the mean concentration of oxipurinol figure si 7 in the lake water was 2 5 μg l this value is similar to that reported for wastewater effluents of 3 μg l hermes et al 2018 including oxipurinol in the list of torcs in bank filtration oxypurinol has been shown to be well removed by activated carbon adsorption during drinking water treatment sperlich et al 2017b straub et al 2019 suggests that biodegradation of metformin figure si 8 under anaerobic conditions may occur in sludge sediments and soil media however this response was not observed at the site data in teg371op is likely erroneous the reason for concentration occasionally exceeding the conservative simulation is unclear tcpp figure si 5 appears to behave conservatively but it also has been removed only in the long term and under anaerobic conditions stepien et al 2013 hence 3 4 months of residence time at the site could be too short to observe degradation 3 3 reactive trace organic compounds 3 3 1 only present in lake water significant concentrations in the lake but concentrations below the respective loq in groundwater at all monitoring wells were found for these compounds first order biodegradation simulations were performed to approximate minimum rate constants and or maximum half live values table 2 rate constants were selected with simulated concentrations loq at the monitoring well closest to the lakeshore fig 4b metoprolol maximum concentrations of bezafibrate figure si 3 occur in the lake in winter up to the 0 1 μg l notice that this compound almost disappears in the lake from middle 2016 onwards its rapid depletion even after few centimetres during bank filtration was already identified by heberer et al 2004 the same behaviour was observed for metoprolol sotalol figure si 7 and 4 aaa figure si 9 rapid attenuation of metoprolol t1 2 1 37 h depending on redox conditions and temperatures as well as 4 aaa was already reported burke et al 2014a 2014b iomeprol and iopromid are continuously present in the surface water but concentrations significantly increase until 2014 to 5 μg l and 1 μg l respectively followed by a constant decline to 1 μg l and 0 5 μg l respectively grünheid et al 2005 identified iopromid a tri iodinated benzene derivate as stable and hydrophilic that is hard to remove by wastewater treatment and reported much higher surface water concentrations in lake tegel of around 20 μg l only one peak of 4 hydroxydiclofenac figure si 11 and deet figure si 12 at significant concentrations each were observed in the lake water but approximate rate constants were nevertheless estimated 3 3 2 present in groundwater with first order biodegradation behaviour fig 4c exemplary depicts the observed and simulated time series of pregabalin analysed since 2015 seasonal fluctuation of the concentration in the lake water exceeded 0 1 μg l in winter 2015 and since then decreased pregabalin did not show any retardation and its transport behaviour was very well reproduced with a rate constant λ 0 005 d 1 t1 2 140 days the dioh cbz figure si 2 is almost constantly present in the receiving water of sewage effluents and shows a similar time series than cbz könig et al 2016 its maximum concentration is 0 8 μg l in 2014 and concentrations steadily decrease to 0 2 μg l since then its fate during subsurface passage is well captured by the reactive model using λ 0 005 d 1 t1 2 140 days however observations during the last two years of the time series may indicate slightly better degradation during the warm summer and almost persistence in the winter seasons of 2017 and 2018 at least at teg371op the degradation rate could either be only affected by the water temperature or by both temperature and redox conditions at the same time oxic suboxic conditions in winter anaerobic in summer as such besides the known effect of enhanced biodegradation in with higher temperatures it is also possible that dioh cbz might degrade better under anaerobic conditions bahlmann et al 2014 gabapentin figure si 8 is reported as degradable under aerobic conditions at laboratory scale henning et al 2018 and in pilot studies using powdered activated carbon pac for the removal of organic micro pollutants as an additional advanced wastewater treatment step altmann et al 2016 meinel et al 2016 this was also confirmed in granular activated carbon gac absorbers for drinking water treatment sperlich et al 2017b and field studies for sequential mar hellauer et al 2018 here a rather low degradation rate of λ 0 0017 d 1 t1 2 407 days describes its behaviour in groundwater better at least during the time period when the concentration in the lake water is above 1 μg l later when concentrations in the lake were lower conservative and reactive simulations yield similar results grünheid et al 2005 reported water concentrations in tegel of 1 μg l of sulfamethoxazole figure si 13 with a removal percentage of 20 on the flow path for a time period between may 2003 march 2004 highly dependent on inflow concentration whilst it also behaves as degradable in column experiments depending on redox conditions bai et al 2019 at the same time sulfamethoxazole is often considered persistent van driezum et al 2019 maximum lake water concentrations of 0 2 μg l were reduced to 0 05 μg l during the studied time period a rate constant of λ 0 003 d 1 t1 2 230 days captures the main degradation trend of sulfamethoxazole in the aquifer prior 2015 while thereafter observed concentrations higher than the non reactive appear sporadically iopamidol figure si 10 shows lower degradability than iopromid and iomeprol at the site the maximum lake water concentration is 1 5 μg l concentration data in the groundwater exists only for 2012 and 2017 onwards with mean concentrations of 0 25 μg l at sen3303 the fate of iopamidol can be described by first order kinetics with λ 0 003 d 1 t1 2 230 days iodinated contrast media have been identified as very persistent in surface water and mobile in aquifers ternes and hirsch 2000 but they show high degradability throughout the subsurface passage zuehlke et al 2007 efficient removal of etbe figure si 5 was observed in hübner et al 2012 and in sand column experiments reaching removal efficiencies of 90 yeh and novak 1995 and among 70 80 bertelkamp et al 2016 although it is continuously present in the lake water with concentrations in the range of 0 1 1 2 μg l concentrations are negligible within the aquifer some data points suggest a good approximation with a reactive simulation of λ 0 008 d 1 t1 2 87 days 3 3 3 present in groundwater with more complex behaviour for some reactive compounds a simple first order degradation model could not capture the main trends and features of their occurrence along the bank filtration flow path well the main reason is probably that the assumption of a constant reaction rate constant is a simplification and rarely encountered in nature caused by for example transient temperatures and redox zones henzler et al 2016 or small scale heterogeneities of the aquifer e g organic rich zones or clay lenses compounds that appeared to be subject to temperature desorption from the aquifer following decreasing input concentrations are not included in this group it is beyond the scope of this paper reporting on many torcs to carry out more complex modelling and the behaviour of these compounds is therefore merely described qualitatively concentrations of 2 5 μg l of diclofenac figure si 7 were observed in wastewater effluents in berlin heberer 2002 diclofenac has also been reported to photodegrade in surface water bartels and von tümpling 2007 such tendency is clearly observed in the time series of the lake water with peaks during winter and absence during summer it seems that the input signal penetrating into the aquifer is retarded as indicated from the apparent time lag of the observed peaks compared to those in the non reactive simulation in teg371op which suggests sorption sorption of diclofenac was previously observed in laboratory experiments scheytt et al 2005 2006 and at field sites henzler et al 2014 besides it also appears to biodegrade along transect the analgesic phenazone and the phenazone type metabolite 4 faa figure si 9 have been reported to be redox sensitive only degrading in the presence of oxygen massmann et al 2006 greskowiak et al 2006 heberer et al 2008 hübner et al 2012 they are constantly present in the lake water from 0 05 to 0 4 μg l and 0 1 1 3 μg l respectively none of those compounds achieve complete depletion at the farthest observation point and they both display a strong seasonal signal in the bank filtrate with concentrations like the conservative simulation in summer and almost complete degradation in winter this is consistent to the inverse temperature correlation with better degradation in winter when the oxic zone is wider as described by massmann et al 2006 and greskowiak et al 2006 however their apparent decline along the flow path even to some extent during the summer suggests that both substances may also degrade under suboxic conditions the concentrations of valsartan figure si 6 in surface water show seasonal peaks in spring followed by a decrease to zero in autumn valsartan degrades along the flow path and seems to be affected by sorption as the observed concentration peaks arrive somewhat delayed at teg371op compared to the non reactive simulation beyond that point valsartan was hardly detected anymore benzotriazole and tolyltriazole figure si 12 are always present in surface water but concentrations also decreased in the last three years they have been reported as highly persistent during bank filtration hübner et al 2012 in column studies burke et al 2014a confirmed persistent behaviour for benzotriazole but observed some degradation under oxic penoxic to suboxic conditions for tolyltriazole whilst the behaviour of the compounds at the site seems to be mostly rather conservative some degradation is visible in the first half of the study period at least at sen3303 additionally they also display concentrations higher than to be expected from the conservative simulation in the summer seasons of 2017 and 2018 for which the reason remains unclear 3 4 transformation products five transformation products produced along the bank filtration were identified whilst 9 ca adin and dp were not present in the lake at all concentrations of amph gabalactam and valsartan acid in the bank filtrate increased along the flow path reactive modelling of their formation was beyond the scope of this paper 9 ca adin figure si 2 emerges between the lake and teg371op at concentrations 0 6 μg l seemingly correlating with the seasonal temperature signal further along the flow path degradation seems to occur to some extent which might be captured by a first order degradation model dp figure si 11 phenazone type metabolite exhibits a similar behaviour the formation of valsartan acid figure si 11 is not clearly identifiable along the flow path as it is already present in the surface water with maximum concentration of nearly 5 μg l however concentrations seem to increase before teg371op to be slowly degraded along the flow path downgradient valsartan acid has previously been poorly removed during bank filtration nödler et al 2013 van baar 2015 but significant removal was observed in sequential mar hellauer et al 2018 and during gac filtration nödler et al 2013 sperlich et al 2017b the latter attributed to biodegradation sperlich et al 2017b gabalactam figure si 8 is present in the lake in concentrations around 0 1 μg l but concentrations in the bank filtrate at teg371op in contrast display a seasonal variation with elevated concentrations in summer up to 0 35 μg l and values close to the loq of 0 05 μg l in winter the reason remains unclear as formation desorption as well as redox and or temperature dependent degradation are possible processes the inflow concentration of amph figure si 4 reddersen et al 2002 tends to follow a sinusoidal fluctuation with peaks positively correlated with winter seasons and concentrations in the bank filtrate are often above the conservative simulation figures si 17 23 show the mean variation of concentrations with distance for all torcs and the 1st order decay function of reactive torcs 4 conclusions this work evaluates the fate and transport behaviour of 37 trace organic compounds torcs at a bank filtration site lake tegel berlin for a relatively long time span of 6 years 2012 2018 based on the comparison of an extensive field data set and the numerical outcomes of a two dimensional reactive transport model we classified torcs according to their occurrence in three intermediate monitoring wells receiving young bank filtrate with a mean residence time of months tr 3 4 months only candesartan carbamazepine metformin olmesartan oxipurinol primidone acesulfame amdoph pema mtbe tcpp and edta were found to be persistent or displaying only negligible degradation in contrast bezafibrate metoprolol sotalol 4 aaa 4 hydroxydiclofenac iomeprol iopromid and deet were rapidly removed from the bank filtrate after infiltration not appearing in the closest observation well to the lakeshore still we approximated their maximum half live threshold values assuming uniform first order biodegradation rate constants although these results are plausible compared to literature values they should be considered as first estimates due to involved model uncertainties the compounds dioh cbz gabapentin pregabalin sulfamethoxazole iopamidol and etbe could be well described with uniform first order biodegradation and field scale representative first order degradation rate constants the transport behaviour of diclofenac phenazone valsartan 4 faa benzotriazole and tolyltriazole was more complex and could not be well described using a uniform first order biodegradation model despite evidence of sorption temperature and or redox dependent degradation for some compounds a detailed process analysis was beyond the scope of this paper and will be subject of a follow up paper finally 9 ca adin dp amph gabalactam and valsartan acid appear to have been generated on site and are related to other target torcs as possible mother compounds notice that during the summer of 2017 and towards the end of the monitoring period in 2018 evident concentration peaks of carbamazepine amdoph benzotriazole tolyltriazole phenazone 9 ca adin gabalactam dp and amph were identified in the monitoring wells partly well above concentrations to be expected from the conservative simulation resolving whether such so far undescribed behaviour could be attributed to local environmental conditions fostering temperature dependent desorption after the concentrations in the source water strongly declined will be subject of future investigations on the other hand very high retardation factor values of candesartan diclofenac bezafibrate valsartan and 4 hydroxydiclofenac in table 2 suggest that the behaviour classification and estimated 1st order rate constants derived from this study may be subject to bias due to the inherent strong sorption potential of these compounds overall the presented model based analysis of such a long term field dataset will improve the knowledge of the expected fate and behaviour of torcs during managed aquifer recharge and in groundwater it will also contribute to the currently sparse dataset of field scale biodegradation rate
