14255,recalcitrant compounds and high salinity in industrial wastewaters are two major inhibitory parameter against the bacterial metabolism leading to necessity for the application of halotolerant microorganisms in biological treatment technologies hence this study focused on the biological treatment of saline bisphenol a bpa containing wastewater at different total dissolved solids tds 5 10 and 15 g l with bpa concentration of 50 mg l three sequencing batch reactors sbr were operated which applied different experimental conditions during 9 months the pure adsorption behavior of bpa onto sludge was described via freundlich isotherm model in batch experiments the operation of sequencing reactors with 5 days hydraulic retention time hrt indicated that optimal removal rates exceeded 96 3 88 and 57 for bpa cod toc respectively which was attained at high salinity the organisms responsible for bpa removal appeared to be more sensitive to different operating conditions than changes in salinity the bpa removal efficiency decreased from 96 3 to 69 8 when hrt decreased from 5 days to 0 25 days results indicated that biodegradation was the predominant process for bpa removal the biokinetic parameters in saline substrates were in the range of y 0 54 0 61 mg vss mg bpa kd 0 006 0 013 1 d ks 8 94 13 6 mg bpa l and Î¼m 0 3 0 4 1 d identification of mixed consortium at high

parameters sequencing batch reactor sbr saline wastewater treatment microbial community 1 introduction the increasingly water demand stringent discharge standards and constraints of water resources have caused an interest to discover the innovative wastewater treatment technologies the most industrial concern is by far the saline wastewaters treatment rich in industries such as petroleum petrochemical pharmaceutical landfill leachate pickling and agricultural pesticides and herbicides 1 saline wastewater has been unveiled by considerable quantities of inorganic salts and high values of xenobiotic organic compounds which are usually non biodegradable and resistant against common biological treatment processes inhibited by salt thus they rose a great concern about their contribution to adverse effect on almost all environmental supplies and application of halotolerant bacteria are required in alternative biological processes to enhance biodegradation rate of target recalcitrant organics in saline environment 2 3 biodegradation is an efficient technique capable of reducing the overall toxicity of organic substances in saline environment however salinity 1 salt gives rise to plasmolysis and or death of microorganisms reduces degradation kinetics inhibits the nitrification and forces the operation at low activated sludge loadings 4 5 saline environment involves in decantation problems caused by higher density 2 nowadays researchers are trying to identify novel bacterial isolates from saline environment to prepare halotolerant consortiums as one of the most interesting approaches for improving the performance of activated sludge systems 6 besides gradual biomass acclimation to high salinity have led to the obtention of satisfactory quality of effluent 7 effect of salinity on variations bacterial density as well as removal and destruction of organic pollutants has been considered in the literature 8 it was reported that acclimation to high salinity raised the halotolerant and or halophilic bacteria resulting in enhancement of the bioreactor performance 3 one of the most common organic compounds in saline environment generated in petrochemical plants is bisphenol a bpa 9 10 originating from condensation of major constituent phenol and acetone under low ph and high temperature conditions and is listed as a xenobiotic leads to hormonal imbalance in cells with the highest global volume consumption by 2022 11 the point that should be considered is that bpa is required as an intermediate to produce rubber and plastics glue ink poly vinyl chloride unsaturated polyesters and polyacrylate resins the environment receives bpa via effluents of industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp waste plastics in landfill leachate activated sludge processing units sediments of river or seawater 12 this leads to the ubiquitous occurrence of bpa in the environment making it a major focus of attention in activated sludge treatment processes adsorption to biomass accounts for a considerable removal of endocrine disrupting compounds 8 leading to major concerns for sludge management 13 studies indicated that bpa tends to sorption to the biomass originated from its hydrophobicity log kow 4 14 16 while some research on biodegradation of bpa have focused only on isolation and characterization of bacterial isolates in saline environment 17 18 based on literature none of them has characterized bpa biodegradation mechanism in such conditions eio et al 19 showed that mixed consortium from activated sludge achieved complete degradation of bpa in batch assays the wide range of catabolic pathways of mixed consortium provided efficient degradation of bpa and its biodegradation intermediates led to converting bpa to metabolites with much less estrogenic activity cydzik kwiatkowska et al 11 investigated the sludge granulation with the potential of removal of bpa rich wastewater containing 12 mg l bpa in sequencing reactors former studies were based on application of non halophilic species while detailed information on bpa degradation by halophiles and phylogenetic analysis is limited the lack of detailed information is despite the wide industrial application of bpa that was closely interrelated with saline nature of the effluents the sequencing batch reactor sbr has continued to be a robust process in high saline wastewaters treatment 2 7 this study was designed to investigate the overall performance and influence of effective operational parameters of sbr in biodegradation of bpa in a saline industrial wastewater the microbial community at highest salinity and mechanisms of bpa removal were also investigated in addition biokinetic coefficients of halotolerant consortium were evaluated 2 methods 2 1 reactor set up three plexi glass sbr systems with an operating volume of 10 l and size of 28 18 19 cm l w h were operated fig 1 a vacuum pump was employed to inject the synthesized wastewater into the reactors at required flow rate range of 2 40 l d controlled by programmable logic controllers the air pumps hailea model aco 208 with an air flow rate of 6 l min were used to create turbulent flow in the reactor contents and supply enough dissolved oxygen do 3 4 mg l through three stone air diffusers placed at the bottom of the reactor 2 2 reactor operation to test the effect of operational conditions on bpa removal various hydraulic retention time hrt values of 5 to 0 25 days were considered the operating conditions during the study are included in table 1 feeding settling and decanting were operated at 15 30 and 15 min respectively during all runs the steady state conditions were defined as conditions with less than 5 7 variations in effluent characteristics 2 3 inoculum preparation for the seed sludge aerobic activated sludge was obtained from wwtp of ahvaz iran the salt concentrations of the raw wastewater were adjusted in terms of tds parameter by adding a desired amount of nacl purchased commercially the first reactor received the raw wastewater containing 5 g l tds whereas the other two reactors treated the raw wastewater containing 10 and 15 g l tds the biomass was first incubated with the synthetic substrate containing glucose 400 mg l the desired amounts of nh4cl and kh2po4 were added to the tap water in keeping with c n p ratio of 100 5 1 salt build up was administered by stepwise increase in wastewater salt concentration to the substrate over a time period the acclimation to change salinity was occurred when the cod removal reached to over 80 after that the salt concentration was increased further the periods of acclimation to different tds concentrations are presented in table 1 once the cod removal reached to over 80 bpa sigma aldrich purity 99 increased stepwise in the raw wastewater to reach concentration of 50 mg l of bpa during one month bpa stock solution 1 m was dissolved in naoh aqueous media 19 sampling was carried out on raw wastewater effluent and mixed liquor of each sbr the ph was set in neutral range 7 5 0 2 with nahco3 2 4 adsorption test protocol the batch adsorption experiments were studied in 250 ml conical flasks with inactivated sludge originated from the sbrs these sbrs were operated at various salinities devoid of bpa as described above first the biomass was centrifuged at 4000 rpm during 10 min followed by decanting the supernatant and rinsing the pellet with mili q water thrice mercury ii sulfate 100 mg l was used to inactivate the biomass 20 afterwards the required mlss level was adjusted with tap water and the prepared samples were stored at 4 c for the equilibrium time determination 100 ml sterilized sludge solution with mlss concentration 2000 mg l were amended with 50 mg l of bpa concentration and shaken ikm 4000 ci germany at 125 rpm and 20 c ph was kept at 7 5 0 2 supernatant samples for measuring bpa concentrations were collected at 5 15 30 60 90 120 300 600 and 840 min the concentrations of 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l of bpa were considered to develop the sorption isotherms a blank sample without sludge was considered under the same conditions freundlich equilibrium model was applied for fitting the experimental data as expressed in eq 1 1 logqe logkf 1 n logce where ce mg l and qe mg g are the equilibrated concentration of sorbate in water and sorbent phase respectively kf mg g l mg 1 n and 1 n are capacity and intensity of sorption respectively clara et al 20 expressed that the sorption behavior can be explained in terms of the

not affect the bpa concentration subsequently 100 Î¼l filtrate was analyzed by the hplc system equipped with ultimate variable wavelength uv detector 2500 connected to a column 100 5 c18 4 6 mm 250 mm

for determination of adsorbed bpa on the sludge phase solid pellet was ultrasonicated for 30 min using 20 ml of methanol dichloromethane 1 1 v v afterwardes the liquid sample was rotary evaporated at 30 c to remove the solvent and dissolved again in 2 ml methanol and then analyzed according to the aforementioned hplc protocol 23 the detection limit of bpa was 0 1 mg l the intermediates of bpa biodegradation were discerned using lc ms agilent qqq 6410 analysis 2 7 isolation of halotolerant bacteria the isolation and selection of the halotolerant microorganisms able to degrade bpa were conducted in consecutive batch assays the inoculum for the first batch was taken from the biomass of sbr operated at 15 g l tds and then incubated into 100 ml culture medium in a 250 ml flask the

experimental flasks were adjusted to 100 mg l bpa and then maintained at 31 c in the dark with a reciprocal shaker during one week bpa was sterilized millipore membrane with 0 2 Î¼m pore size for removing bacterial the bacterial growth was detected by the variation of optical density at 600 nm after one week of cultivation 5 ml enriched sample was re incubated to another flask with 95 ml sterile medium under the same conditions 24 then for the next batch assay the inoculum was obtained from previous one this step was performed consecutively four times and then the culture was streaked on mineral agar plates containing 100 mg l bpa and 15 g l nacl based on tds and incubated at 31 c for 3 days large distinct colonies were isolated in pure culture on plates 2 8 the study of pure bacterial isolates the identification of bacteria was performed according to cultural morphological and biochemical features using bergey s manual of systematic bacteriology 25 as well as 16s rrna gene sequencing dna was exteracted using phenol chloroform extraction the 16s rrna genes were amplified with universal primers fd1 5 agagtttgatcctggctcag 3 and rd1 5 aaggaggtgatccagcc 3 the sequences

substances were purified and sequenced by using a 3730xl dna analyzer instrument applied biosystems under contract by bioneer inc south korea all fragmented sequences were edited and assembled using dna sequence assembler v4 2013 sequence analysis was carried out by using the eztaxon server http www ezbiocloud net eztaxon 26 phylogenetic analyses were accomplished in molecular evolutionary genetics analysis mega6 software package by maximum likelihood algorithm using kimura 2 parameter distances 27 and 1000 bootstrap replication 3 result and disscussion 3 1 batch experiments due to low volatility of bpa vapour pressure 5 34 10 7 mmhg at 25 c and henry s constant 10 Î¼pa m3 mol 1 28 abiotic removal owing to volatilization could be ignored no bpa removal was observed in biomass free experiments in the first 30 min the bpa adsorption on the chemically inactivated sludge was so quick data not shown and the bpa removal of 65 was obtained while there was no significant change after 1 h in all experiments determination of adsorption isotherm was carried out during 1 h contact time the adsorption isotherm of sludge at 15 g l tds concentration can be observed in fig 2 it was clear that the adsorption of bpa to sludge followed freundlich model the sorption data charecterizing both freundlich and linear equations for three salinities and the inactivated sludge are presented in table 2 the values of freundlich constant log kf recorded at different salinities varied from 0 771 to 0 615 for 5 to 15 g l tds table 2 respectively which were quite similar to those of clara et al 20 0 614 and seyhi et al 29 0 637 were obtained our results pointed out that the distribution coefficients log kd on different sludges were 1 97 2 42 2 03 2 42 and 1 97 2 27 for 5 10 and 15 g l tds respectively table 2 this parameter has the concentration dependent behavior which shows a decreasing trend with increasing free bpa concentrations 20 log kd was on a par with the value 2 52 yielded at bpa concentrations in low range 2 100 Î¼g l 13 chen et al 16 indicated that log kd values of bpa ranged from 2 to 2 75 applying high concentration range 2 5 40 mg l urase and kikuta 30 stated that log kd values of bpa on activated sludge were between 2 33 and 2 8 in comparison with the reported values in literatures our values of kd were consistent with other values from these results it can be postulated that the sludge had a high adsorption potential for this compound without being saturated in all tested concentrations 20 our results suggested that the salinity had no influence on the adsorption effeciency of bpa table 2 to the extent of our knowledge to date this is the first report about comparison between sorption constants of bpa at different salinity levels the impact of high salinity on adsorption of bpa in an aerobic sludge was negligible 8 song et al 31 observed a fluctuated rise in the bpa concentration in a municiple digester sludge during anaerobic membrane bioreactor treatment as salinity increased 0 15 gnacl l these studies contributed to different and contradictory conclusions 3 2 removal of bisphenol a during aerobic sbr treatment 3 2 1 effect of salinity the variations of bpa in sbr systems showed that the majority of bpa was degraded during sbrs operation high efficiencies of 93 95 and 96 3 were obtained at salinity values of 5 10 and 15 g l tds respectively fig 3 this difference could be ascribed to the acclimatization of biomass consortia that was implicated in bpa biodegradation to the saline conditions therefore the increased overall bpa removal efficiency in high salinity was possibly associated with the development of salt adapted microorganisms that especially attacked to the compounds fig s1 as a result of the accumulation of potassium glycerol betaine and amine acids within the cell the cellular ionic strength is increased thus enabling the halotolerant bacteria to balance the cellular ionic strength and external environment 3 in addition osmoregulation by inducing the atp formation could stimulate the obligatory energy dependent reactions in the cells 7 the obtained results were very close to those of luo et al 8 and zhao et al 1 the aforementioned bpa removal was comparable with reported values in previous research about full scale wwtps in a comprehensive survey of 25 canadian wwtps guerra et al 15 reported that the removal of bpa was above 70 3 2 2 effect of hrt the enhanced removal of bpa could be acquired as a result of hrt of 5 days and an organic loading 10 g bpa m3 d for all reactors moreover the bpa removal rate was decreased significantly with reduction of hrt values from 3 to 0 25 days fig 3 results indicated that hrt was an important factor for bpa removal which were consistent with a rapid decrease in the efficiency of mbr when olr increased 29 in contrast chen et al 16 expressed the performance robustness at lower hrts during the bpa removal in mbr 3 2 3 removal mechanism to investigate the removal mechanisms and fate of bpa the specific bpa content was also determined in the biomass of three sbrs during the experimental period using the measured bpa concentration in aquous solution and adsorbed onto the sludge the mass balance of bpa in the systems was conducted it was assumed that the biodegradation and sorption to sludge were the main routes governing the rate of bpa removal observed in this study bpa is relatively non volatile and has a high tendency towards sorption to the sludge matrix using eq 8 the value of biodegraded bpa was set up as the mass balance around the systems 29 32 8 min mbio mads meff where min mg d and meff mg d are the bpa mass of raw wastewater and effluent respectively and mads mg d and mbio mg d are the adsorbed and biodegraded bpa mass respectively from fig 4 the major part of bpa was biodegraded about 95 75 during the hrt of 5 days in the system operating at salinity up to 15 g l tds suggesting that the biomass consortia made an adjustment to bpa biodegradation in saline conditions the mass balance calculations demonestrated that the fraction of bpa quantified in mixed liquior accounted for 0 3 in the first experimental phase while the effluent bpa concentration was 3 9 fig 4 showed the change to lower hrts partly developed the sorption mechanism causing the accumulation of bpa in the sludge phase making it persistent against biodegradation concequently adsorption to the sludge obtained for about 1 9 when hrt of 6 h was applied and mean removal of 67 94 was occurred in the system operating at salinity up to 15 g l tds this confirms that biological removal was the principle mechanism of bpa removal higher hrts not only developed biodegradation but also was preferable for the bpa desorption from sludge phase 33 in other words bpa biodegradation was facilitated by adsorption phenomenon during sbrs operation with different salinities where the long hrt of the sequencing systems enhanced the bpa bioconversion due to adsorption to sludge phase 34 35 in another research guerra et al 15 found that sorption tendency of bpa to sludge was strongly affected by hrt in which longer hrts resulted in less sorption due to improvement of degradation and the fractions of bpa partitioning to sludge was reduced nacheva and sotelo 36 also reported similar observations who obtained higher polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs removal about 61 and lower contriobution of pahs sorption to the sludge in the mbr operated with long hrt it seems that high salinity had a negligible impact on bpa adsorption in the sludge phase fig 4 and consequently the adaptation of biomass to salinity levels results in enhancing the process performance in tds concentrations studied here which is more coincied with the establishment of endured microbial community 3 this also corroborated the results of adsorption table 2 the low accumulation of bpa in the sludge phase when salinity add up to 16 5 g l nacl has been observed by wenhai luo et al 8 3 3 kinetic study for effective designing and controlling the full scale reactors kinetic analysis is essential to ascertain the biokinetic coefficients using the data of laboratory or pilot plant studies the efficiency of sbrs in treating 5 10 and 15 g l tds saline wastewater under varying hrts in the range of 5 0 25 days corresponding to olr ranged from 10 to 200 g bpa m3 d were fitted to monod model according to the average steady state operating conditions fig 5 at high salinity contents the Î¼max of bpa degrading biomass was found to be greater table 3 it shows that the inhibitory effect of salinity was fewer on the biological activity during operational conditions perused here which provided higher growth rate at high salinity that resulted in higher bpa removal rate this is in agreement with the relevant literature 4 37 the most simple explanation for higher growth rate in the prolonged exposure to salinity is changing the bacterial metabolism pathways in aerobic conditions and the adjustment and multiplication of salt tolerant bacteria in halophilic activated sludge population 4 38 as the biomass mlvss concentration was raised the effluent bpa content decreased with increasing tds in the raw wastewater in this regards the maximum cod and toc removal rates were of 88 and 57 respectively which occured at 15 g l tds concentration for sbrs operating at 10 and 5 g l tds wastewaters the removal efficiencies of cod and toc were 82 6 48 and 77 3 37 8 respectively at steady state olr of 10 g bpa m3 d and hrt of 5 days it was observed from table 3 that km value at highest salt content 15 gtds l was found to be higher km 0 65 mgbpa vss d than that the km value at salinity of 10 and 5 gtds l which was due to higher growth rate Î¼m 0 4 d 1 at 15 gtds l sustained higher bpa removal efficiency of 95 74 compared to 94 6 at 5 gtds l respectively in compasion with a non saline activated sludge which was continously spiked with bpa ks values for biodegradation of bpa at different salinity contents 8 9 13 6 mgbpa l obtained in this study were higher 39 this indicated that the halophil microorganisms may possess a lower affinity to the substrate 38 and or they may require more substrate for survival 7 these results are also comparable to that of a pure culture chemostat which obtained the ks value of 13 mg l in a synthethic culture with 150 mg l of bpa 40 the observed y values from operated sbrs varied between 0 54 and 0 61 mgvss mgbpa table 3 by comparison lindblom et al 39 reported the y value 0 67 gcell gcod in non saline bpa degrading activated sludge meaninig that no significant changes were happened with increasing salinity of the feed wastewater in this study y and kd values are smaller than those obtained by hamoda et al 4 1 995 gvss gtoc and 0 299 1 d in 10 g l nacl saline wastewaster the bioaugmented saline activated sludge resulted in y and kd values 0 54 mgvss mgcod and 0 014 1 d respectively 24 which were quite similar to this study as denoted by y values carbon in bpa was oxidized by the bacteria population which was partly consumed for cell division the part that was left would either convert to the other metabolic intermediates or mineralize to co2 it should be refered that biomass compatibility to saline environment resulted in an effective organic removal performance for bpa degradation the obtained experimental data provide an evidence for active role of bpa degrading biomass in the promotion of process 3 4 characterization of salt tolerant bacteria six morphologically distinct bacterial strains with the capability of using bpa solely for their metabolism were derived from the reactor with salinity of 15 g l based on tds concentration on mineral agar plates as described in section 2 5 the nucleotide sequences with genbank accession numbers mk045317 mk045328 mk045320 mk045327 mk045329 and mk049903 for g11 g16 were noticed to be the strians pseudomonas aeruginosa g12 three diferent serratia marcescens g11 g13 g14 bordetella muralis g15 and bacillus subtilis g16 respectively by using 16s rrna gene sequencing fig 6 also some morphological and biochemical features of the obtained isolates are listed in table s1 the genera members known as bpa degradaers include sphingomonas pseudomonas achromobacter novosphingobium nitrosomonas serratia bordetella alcaligenes pandoraea klebsiella cupriavidus streptomyces and bacillus 41 among them genera sphingomonas and pseudomonas had imprortant roles in bpa biodegradation in seawater samples in media supplemented with 100 ppm bpa 42 bacillus sp strain is more prevalent among the gram positive bpa degraders 12 as bacillus pumilus strain bp 22dk efficiently degraded 100 mg l bpa within 1 day on a mineral salt 50 g l nacl medium supplied with growth factros e g peptone beef extract and yeast extract whereas this strain was not able for growing and degrading bpa as a sole substrate 43 in the current study bordetella muralis identified in biomass sample is affiliated with the burkholderiales order in alcaligenaceae family that can tolerate salinity up to 15 g l tds observed here high abundance of burkholderiales has been confirmed by increased concentrations of bpa in aerobic granular sludge 11 the abundance of this order has been also found to be dependent on increasing salinity 44 reports also indicate that bpa degrading bordetella sp os17 from soil can degrade bpa 41 removal 41 a novel bacterium achromobacter xylosoxidans belonging to alcaligenaceae is found out the potential for aerobic degradation of bpa 18 bacteria associated with the serratia genus have been found in a saline wwtp effluent sample 45 the results of matsumura et al 41 also cleared that serratia sp hi10 isolated from soil could degrade 59 3 of bpa at concentration 300 mg l at the second day therefore the existence of active players of bpa biodegradation in pure cultures likely plays a major role in the system which may promote the small scale systems by developing of salt tolerant bpa degraders to treat real industrial petrochemical wastewaters where salinity and bpa dosages are within the range of 20 g l tds and 50 ppm bpa 46 3 5 bpa degradation intermediates the by products exmained by lcms analysis were included 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 propanol m z 244 4 2 hydroxypropan 2 yl phenol m z 152 4 isopropenylphenol m z 137 4 hydroxyacetophenone hap m z 120 9 hydrochinone hq m z 110 4 and oxalic acid m z 89 fig s1 a possible pathway by bacterial metabolism based on the metabolites and recent studies 12 19 are elucidated here fig 7 the first bpa metabolic pathway connected to sphingomonas sp strain mv1 metabolism can be interpereted as the methyl hydroxylation of bpa and formation of 2 3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 2 propanediol not detected from 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl l propanol as a result of oxidative degradation 2 3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 2 propanediol persumably is cleaved to form 4 hydroxybenzoic acid hba previous studies of bpa degradation showed the accumulation of these metabolites in the cases like activated sludge microcosms 47 in the second proposed pathway bpa is cleaved into 4 2 hydroxypropan 2 yl phenol and hq the monooxygenation of the aromatic results in the cc bond cleavage which was then generated to 4 2 hydroxypropan 2 yl phenol and hq this pathway has also been derived from cupriavidus basilensis jf1 bacillus sp strain gzb and the bacterial consortium 19 48 49 where the monooxygenas enzymatic reaction activated by cofactors nadph and fad involve in metabolizing bpa further degradation of hq leads to the breakage of aromatic ring consequently generating oxalic acid 4 isopropenylphenol was also formed as a consequent of loss of hydrogen atom from carbocationic isopropylphenol it is expected that breaking c1 body from 4 2 hydroxypropan 2 yl phenol will lead to production of hap further oxidation of 4 isopropenylphenol and hap undergoes cleavage and produces hbal and hba rapidly although hbal and hba were not noticed they were presumed to be oxidised to oxalic acid which was noticed we suggested that oxalic acid might be subsequently metabolised to co2 and cell biomass 4 conclusion the key points from the obtained results are summarised here investigation of bpa adsorption in batch experiments on the saline biomass showed that increasing salinity had no influence on the adsorption process of bpa the application of sbr systems clarified that the principal amount of bpa 93 would be degraded through the operation in sequencing reactors mainly via biodegradation reaching an hrt 5 days and salinity ranging from 5 to 15 g l compatibility of the microbial community to changing salinity gave rise to an enhancement in the overall removal performance a decrease in hrt affected the process performance negatively the accumulation of bpa in sequencing reactors was determined to be less than 1 9 the biokinetic parameters in saline substrates were in the range of y 0 54 0 61 mg vss mg bpa kd 0 006 0 013 1 d ks 8 94 13 6 mg bpa l and Î¼m 0

14255,recalcitrant compounds and high salinity in industrial wastewaters are two major inhibitory parameter against the bacterial metabolism leading to necessity for the application of halotolerant microorganisms in biological treatment technologies hence this study focused on the biological treatment of saline bisphenol a bpa containing wastewater at different total dissolved solids tds 5 10 and 15 g l with bpa concentration of 50 mg l three sequencing batch reactors sbr were operated which applied different experimental conditions during 9 months the pure adsorption behavior of bpa onto sludge was described via freundlich isotherm model in batch experiments the operation of sequencing reactors with 5 days hydraulic retention time hrt indicated that optimal removal rates exceeded 96 3 88 and 57 for bpa cod toc respectively which was attained at high salinity the organisms responsible for bpa removal appeared to be more sensitive to different operating conditions than changes in salinity the bpa removal efficiency decreased from 96 3 to 69 8 when hrt decreased from 5 days to 0 25 days results indicated that biodegradation was the predominant process for bpa removal the

parameters sequencing batch reactor sbr saline wastewater treatment microbial community 1 introduction the increasingly water demand stringent discharge standards and constraints of water resources have caused an interest to discover the innovative wastewater treatment technologies the most industrial concern is by far the saline wastewaters treatment rich in industries such as petroleum petrochemical pharmaceutical landfill leachate pickling and agricultural pesticides and herbicides 1 saline wastewater has been unveiled by considerable quantities of inorganic salts and high values of xenobiotic organic compounds which are usually non biodegradable and resistant against common biological treatment processes inhibited by salt thus they rose a great concern about their contribution to adverse effect on almost all environmental supplies and application of halotolerant bacteria are required in alternative biological processes to enhance biodegradation rate of target recalcitrant organics in saline environment 2 3 biodegradation is an efficient technique capable of reducing the overall toxicity of organic substances in saline environment however salinity 1 salt gives rise to plasmolysis and or death of microorganisms reduces degradation kinetics inhibits the nitrification and forces the operation at low activated sludge loadings 4 5 saline environment involves in decantation problems caused by higher density 2 nowadays researchers are trying to identify novel bacterial isolates from saline environment to prepare halotolerant consortiums as one of the most interesting approaches for improving the performance of activated sludge systems 6 besides gradual biomass acclimation to high salinity have led to the obtention of satisfactory quality of effluent 7 effect of salinity on variations bacterial density as well as removal and destruction of organic pollutants has been considered in the literature 8 it was reported that acclimation to high salinity raised the halotolerant and or halophilic bacteria resulting in enhancement of the bioreactor performance 3 one of the most common organic compounds in saline environment generated in petrochemical plants is bisphenol a bpa 9 10 originating from condensation of major constituent phenol and acetone under low ph and high temperature conditions and is listed as a xenobiotic leads to hormonal imbalance in cells with the highest global volume consumption by 2022 11 the point that should be considered is that bpa is required as an intermediate to produce rubber and plastics glue ink poly vinyl chloride unsaturated polyesters and polyacrylate resins the environment receives bpa via effluents of industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtp waste plastics in landfill leachate activated sludge processing units sediments of river or seawater 12 this leads to the ubiquitous occurrence of bpa in the environment making it a major focus of attention in activated sludge treatment processes adsorption to biomass accounts for a considerable removal of endocrine disrupting compounds 8 leading to major concerns for sludge management 13 studies indicated that bpa tends to sorption to the biomass originated from its hydrophobicity log kow 4 14 16 while some research on biodegradation of bpa have focused only on isolation and characterization of bacterial isolates in saline environment 17 18 based on literature none of them has characterized bpa biodegradation mechanism in such conditions eio et al 19 showed that mixed consortium from activated sludge achieved complete degradation of bpa in batch assays the wide range of catabolic pathways of mixed consortium provided efficient degradation of bpa and its biodegradation intermediates led to converting bpa to metabolites with much less estrogenic activity cydzik kwiatkowska et al 11 investigated the sludge granulation with the potential of removal of bpa rich wastewater containing 12 mg l bpa in sequencing reactors former studies were based on application of non halophilic species while detailed information on bpa degradation by halophiles and phylogenetic analysis is limited the lack of detailed information is despite the wide industrial application of bpa that was closely interrelated with saline nature of the effluents the sequencing batch reactor sbr has continued to be a robust process in high saline wastewaters treatment 2 7 this study was designed to investigate the overall performance and influence of effective operational parameters of sbr in biodegradation of bpa in a saline industrial wastewater the microbial community at highest salinity and mechanisms of bpa removal were also investigated in addition biokinetic coefficients of halotolerant consortium were evaluated 2 methods 2 1 reactor set up three plexi glass sbr systems with an operating volume of 10 l and size of 28 18 19 cm l w h were operated fig 1 a vacuum pump was employed to inject the synthesized wastewater into the reactors at required flow rate range of 2 40 l d controlled by programmable logic controllers the air pumps hailea model aco 208 with an air flow rate of 6 l min were used to create turbulent flow in the reactor contents and supply enough dissolved oxygen do 3 4 mg l through three stone air diffusers placed at the bottom of the reactor 2 2 reactor operation to test the effect of operational conditions on bpa removal various hydraulic retention time hrt values of 5 to 0 25 days were considered the operating conditions during the study are included in table 1 feeding settling and decanting were operated at 15 30 and 15 min respectively during all runs the steady state conditions were defined as conditions with less than 5 7 variations in effluent characteristics 2 3 inoculum preparation for the seed sludge aerobic activated sludge was obtained from wwtp of ahvaz iran the salt concentrations of the raw wastewater were adjusted in terms of tds parameter by adding a desired amount of nacl purchased commercially the first reactor received the raw wastewater containing 5 g l tds whereas the other two reactors treated the raw wastewater containing 10 and 15 g l tds the biomass was first incubated with the synthetic substrate containing glucose 400 mg l the desired amounts of nh4cl and kh2po4 were added to the tap water in keeping with c n p ratio of 100 5 1 salt build up was administered by stepwise increase in wastewater salt concentration to the substrate over a time period the acclimation to change salinity was occurred when the cod removal reached to over 80 after that the salt concentration was increased further the periods of acclimation to different tds concentrations are presented in table 1 once the cod removal reached to over 80 bpa sigma aldrich purity 99 increased stepwise in the raw wastewater to reach concentration of 50 mg l of bpa during one month bpa stock solution 1 m was dissolved in naoh aqueous media 19 sampling was carried out on raw wastewater effluent and mixed liquor of each sbr the ph was set in neutral range 7 5 0 2 with nahco3 2 4 adsorption test protocol the batch adsorption experiments were studied in 250 ml conical flasks with inactivated sludge originated from the sbrs these sbrs were operated at various salinities devoid of bpa as described above first the biomass was centrifuged at 4000 rpm during 10 min followed by decanting the supernatant and rinsing the pellet with mili q water thrice mercury ii sulfate 100 mg l was used to inactivate the biomass 20 afterwards the required mlss level was adjusted with tap water and the prepared samples were stored at 4 c for the equilibrium time determination 100 ml sterilized sludge solution with mlss concentration 2000 mg l were amended with 50 mg l of bpa concentration and shaken ikm 4000 ci germany at 125 rpm and 20 c ph was kept at 7 5 0 2 supernatant samples for measuring bpa concentrations were collected at 5 15 30 60 90 120 300 600 and 840 min the concentrations of 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 mg l of bpa were considered to develop the sorption isotherms a blank sample without sludge was considered under the same conditions freundlich equilibrium model was applied for fitting the experimental data as expressed in eq 1 1 logqe logkf 1 n logce where ce mg l and qe mg g are the equilibrated concentration of sorbate in water and sorbent phase respectively kf mg g l mg 1 n and 1 n are capacity and intensity of sorption respectively clara et al 20 expressed that the sorption behavior can be explained in terms of the

biodegradation were discerned using lc ms agilent qqq 6410 analysis 2 7 isolation of halotolerant bacteria the isolation and selection of the halotolerant microorganisms able to degrade bpa were conducted in consecutive batch assays the inoculum for the first batch was taken from the biomass of sbr operated at 15 g l tds and then incubated into 100 ml culture medium in a 250 ml flask the

experimental flasks were adjusted to 100 mg l bpa and then maintained at 31 c in the dark with a reciprocal shaker during one week bpa was sterilized millipore membrane with 0 2 Î¼m pore size for removing bacterial the bacterial growth was detected by the variation of optical density at 600 nm after one week of cultivation 5 ml enriched sample was re incubated to another flask with 95 ml sterile medium under the same conditions 24 then for the next batch assay the inoculum was obtained from previous one this step was performed consecutively four times and then the culture was streaked on mineral agar plates containing 100 mg l bpa and 15 g l nacl based on tds and incubated at 31 c for 3 days large distinct colonies were isolated in pure culture on plates 2 8 the study of pure bacterial isolates the identification of bacteria was performed according to cultural morphological and biochemical features using bergey s manual of systematic bacteriology 25 as well as 16s rrna

genetics analysis mega6 software package by maximum likelihood algorithm using kimura 2 parameter distances 27 and 1000 bootstrap replication 3 result and disscussion 3 1 batch experiments due to low volatility of bpa vapour pressure 5 34 10 7 mmhg at 25 c and henry s constant 10 Î¼pa m3 mol 1 28 abiotic removal owing to volatilization could be ignored no bpa removal was observed in biomass free experiments in the first 30 min the bpa adsorption on the chemically inactivated sludge was so quick data not shown and the bpa removal of 65 was obtained while there was no significant change after 1 h in all experiments determination of adsorption isotherm was carried out during 1 h contact time the adsorption isotherm of sludge at 15 g l tds concentration can be observed in fig 2 it was clear that the adsorption of bpa to sludge followed freundlich model the sorption data charecterizing both freundlich and linear equations for three salinities and the inactivated sludge are presented in table 2 the values of freundlich constant log kf recorded at different salinities varied from 0 771 to 0 615 for 5 to 15 g l tds table 2 respectively which were quite similar to those of clara et al 20 0 614 and seyhi et al 29 0 637 were obtained our results pointed out that the distribution coefficients log kd on different sludges were 1 97 2 42 2 03 2 42 and 1 97 2 27 for 5 10 and 15 g l tds respectively table 2 this parameter has the concentration dependent behavior which shows a decreasing trend with increasing free bpa concentrations 20 log kd was on a par with the value 2 52 yielded at bpa concentrations in low range 2 100 Î¼g l 13 chen et al 16 indicated that log kd values of bpa ranged from 2 to 2 75 applying high concentration range 2 5 40 mg l urase and kikuta 30 stated that log kd values of bpa on activated sludge were between 2 33 and 2 8 in comparison with the reported values in literatures our values of kd were consistent with other values from these results it can be postulated that the sludge had a high adsorption potential for this compound without being saturated in all tested concentrations 20 our results suggested that the salinity had no influence on the adsorption effeciency of bpa table 2 to the extent of our knowledge to date this is the first report about comparison between sorption constants of bpa at different salinity levels the impact of high salinity on adsorption of bpa in an aerobic sludge was negligible 8 song et al 31 observed a fluctuated rise in the bpa concentration in a municiple digester sludge during anaerobic membrane bioreactor treatment as salinity increased 0 15 gnacl l these studies contributed to different and contradictory conclusions 3 2 removal of bisphenol a during aerobic sbr treatment 3 2 1 effect of salinity the variations of bpa in sbr systems showed that the majority of bpa was degraded during sbrs operation high efficiencies of 93 95 and 96 3 were obtained at salinity values of 5 10 and 15 g l tds respectively fig 3 this difference could be ascribed to the acclimatization of biomass consortia that was implicated in bpa biodegradation to the saline conditions therefore the increased overall bpa removal efficiency in high salinity was possibly associated with the development of salt adapted microorganisms that especially attacked to the compounds fig s1 as a result of the accumulation of potassium glycerol betaine and amine acids within the cell the cellular ionic strength is increased thus enabling the halotolerant bacteria to balance the cellular ionic strength and external environment 3 in addition osmoregulation by inducing the atp formation could stimulate the obligatory energy dependent reactions in the cells 7 the obtained results were very close to those of luo et al 8 and zhao et al 1 the aforementioned bpa removal was comparable with reported values in previous research about full scale wwtps in a comprehensive survey of 25 canadian wwtps guerra et al 15 reported that the removal of bpa was above 70 3 2 2 effect of hrt the enhanced removal of bpa could be acquired as a result of hrt of 5 days and an organic loading 10 g bpa m3 d for all reactors moreover the bpa removal rate was decreased significantly with reduction of hrt values from 3 to 0 25 days fig 3 results indicated that hrt was an important factor for bpa removal which were consistent with a rapid decrease in the efficiency of mbr when olr increased 29 in contrast chen et al 16 expressed the performance robustness at lower hrts during the bpa removal in mbr 3 2 3 removal mechanism to investigate the removal mechanisms and fate of bpa the specific bpa content was also determined in the biomass of three sbrs during the experimental period using the measured bpa concentration in aquous solution and adsorbed onto the sludge the mass balance of bpa in the systems was conducted it was assumed that the biodegradation and sorption to sludge were the main routes governing the rate of bpa removal observed in this study bpa is relatively non volatile and has a high tendency towards sorption to the sludge matrix using eq 8 the value of biodegraded bpa was set up as the mass balance around the systems 29 32 8 min mbio mads meff where min mg d and meff mg d are the bpa mass of raw wastewater and effluent respectively and mads mg d and mbio mg d are the adsorbed and biodegraded bpa mass respectively from fig 4 the major part of bpa was biodegraded about 95 75 during the hrt of 5 days in the system operating at salinity up to 15 g l tds suggesting that the biomass consortia made an adjustment to bpa biodegradation in saline conditions the mass balance calculations demonestrated that the fraction of bpa quantified in mixed liquior accounted for 0 3 in the first experimental phase while the effluent bpa concentration was 3 9 fig 4 showed the change to lower hrts partly developed the sorption mechanism causing the accumulation of bpa in the sludge phase making it persistent against biodegradation concequently adsorption to the sludge obtained for about 1 9 when hrt of 6 h was applied and mean removal of 67 94 was occurred in the system operating at salinity up to 15 g l tds this confirms that biological removal was the principle mechanism of bpa removal higher hrts not only developed biodegradation but also was preferable for the bpa desorption from sludge phase 33 in other words bpa biodegradation was facilitated by adsorption phenomenon during sbrs operation with different salinities where the long hrt of the sequencing systems enhanced the bpa bioconversion due to adsorption to sludge phase 34 35 in another research guerra et al 15 found that sorption tendency of bpa to sludge was strongly affected by hrt in which longer hrts resulted in less sorption due to improvement of degradation and the fractions of bpa partitioning to sludge was reduced nacheva and sotelo 36 also reported similar observations who obtained higher polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs removal about 61 and lower contriobution of pahs sorption to the sludge in the mbr operated with long hrt it seems that high salinity had a negligible impact on bpa adsorption in the sludge phase fig 4 and consequently the adaptation of biomass to salinity levels results in enhancing the process performance in tds concentrations studied here which is more coincied with the establishment of endured microbial community 3 this also corroborated the results of adsorption table 2 the low accumulation of bpa in the sludge phase when salinity add up to 16 5 g l nacl has been observed by wenhai luo et al 8 3 3 kinetic study for effective designing and controlling the full scale reactors kinetic analysis is essential to ascertain the biokinetic coefficients using the data of laboratory or pilot plant studies the efficiency of sbrs in treating 5 10 and 15 g l tds saline wastewater under varying hrts in the range of 5 0 25 days corresponding to olr ranged from 10 to 200 g bpa m3 d were fitted to monod model according to the average steady state operating conditions fig 5 at high salinity contents the Î¼max of bpa degrading biomass was found to be greater table 3 it shows that the inhibitory effect of salinity was fewer on the biological activity during operational conditions perused here which provided higher growth rate at high salinity that resulted in higher bpa removal rate this is in agreement with the relevant literature 4 37 the most simple explanation for higher growth rate in the prolonged exposure to salinity is changing the bacterial metabolism pathways in aerobic conditions and the adjustment and multiplication of salt tolerant bacteria in halophilic activated sludge population 4 38 as the biomass mlvss concentration was raised the effluent bpa content decreased with increasing tds in the raw wastewater in this regards the maximum cod and toc removal rates were of 88 and 57 respectively which occured at 15 g l tds concentration for sbrs operating at 10 and 5 g l tds wastewaters the removal efficiencies of cod and toc were 82 6 48 and 77 3 37 8 respectively at steady state olr of 10 g bpa m3 d and hrt of 5 days it was observed from table 3 that km value at highest salt content 15 gtds l was found to be higher km 0 65 mgbpa vss d than that the km value at salinity of 10 and 5 gtds l which was due to higher growth rate Î¼m 0 4 d 1 at 15 gtds l sustained higher bpa removal efficiency of 95 74 compared to 94 6 at 5 gtds l respectively in compasion with a non saline activated sludge which was continously spiked with bpa ks values for biodegradation of bpa at different salinity contents 8 9 13 6 mgbpa l obtained in this study were higher 39 this indicated that the halophil microorganisms may possess a lower affinity to the substrate 38 and or they may require more substrate for survival 7 these results are also comparable to that of a pure culture chemostat which obtained the ks value of 13 mg l in a synthethic culture with 150 mg l of bpa 40 the observed y values from operated sbrs varied between 0 54 and 0 61 mgvss mgbpa table 3 by comparison lindblom et al 39 reported the y value 0 67 gcell gcod in non saline bpa degrading activated sludge meaninig that no significant changes were happened with increasing salinity of the feed wastewater in this study y and kd values are smaller than those obtained by hamoda et al 4 1 995 gvss gtoc and 0 299 1 d in 10 g l nacl saline wastewaster the bioaugmented saline activated sludge resulted in y and kd values 0 54 mgvss mgcod and 0 014 1 d respectively 24 which were quite similar to this study as denoted by y values carbon in bpa was oxidized by the bacteria population which was partly consumed for cell division the part that was left would either convert to the other metabolic intermediates or mineralize to co2 it should be refered that biomass compatibility to saline environment resulted in an effective organic removal performance for bpa degradation the obtained experimental data provide an evidence for active role of bpa degrading biomass in the promotion of process 3 4 characterization of salt tolerant bacteria six morphologically distinct bacterial strains with the capability of using bpa solely for their metabolism were derived from the reactor with salinity of 15 g l based on tds concentration on mineral agar plates as described in section 2 5 the nucleotide sequences with genbank accession numbers mk045317 mk045328 mk045320 mk045327 mk045329 and mk049903 for g11 g16 were noticed to be the strians pseudomonas aeruginosa g12 three diferent serratia marcescens g11 g13 g14 bordetella muralis g15 and bacillus subtilis g16 respectively by using 16s rrna gene sequencing fig 6 also some morphological and biochemical features of the obtained isolates are listed in table s1 the genera members known as bpa degradaers include sphingomonas pseudomonas achromobacter novosphingobium nitrosomonas serratia bordetella alcaligenes pandoraea klebsiella cupriavidus streptomyces and bacillus 41 among them genera sphingomonas and pseudomonas had imprortant roles in bpa biodegradation in seawater samples in media supplemented with 100 ppm bpa 42 bacillus sp strain is more prevalent among the gram positive bpa degraders 12 as bacillus pumilus strain bp 22dk efficiently degraded 100 mg l bpa within 1 day on a mineral salt 50 g l nacl medium supplied with growth factros e g peptone beef extract and yeast extract whereas this strain was not able for growing and degrading bpa as a sole substrate 43 in the current study bordetella muralis identified in biomass sample is affiliated with the burkholderiales order in alcaligenaceae family that can tolerate salinity up to 15 g l tds observed here high abundance of burkholderiales has been confirmed by increased concentrations of bpa in aerobic granular sludge 11 the abundance of this order has been also found to be dependent on increasing salinity 44 reports also indicate that bpa degrading bordetella sp os17 from soil can degrade bpa 41 removal 41 a novel bacterium achromobacter xylosoxidans belonging to alcaligenaceae is found out the potential for aerobic degradation of bpa 18 bacteria associated with the serratia genus have been found in a saline wwtp effluent sample 45 the results of matsumura et al 41 also cleared that serratia sp hi10 isolated from soil could degrade 59 3 of bpa at concentration 300 mg l at the second day therefore the existence of active players of bpa biodegradation in pure cultures likely plays a major role in the system which may promote the small scale systems by developing of salt tolerant bpa degraders to treat real industrial petrochemical wastewaters where salinity and bpa dosages are within the range of 20 g l tds and 50 ppm bpa 46 3 5 bpa degradation intermediates the by products exmained by lcms analysis were included 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 propanol m z 244 4 2 hydroxypropan 2 yl phenol m z 152 4 isopropenylphenol m z 137 4 hydroxyacetophenone hap m z 120 9 hydrochinone hq m z 110 4 and oxalic acid m z 89 fig s1 a possible pathway by bacterial metabolism based on the metabolites and recent studies 12 19 are elucidated here fig 7 the first bpa metabolic pathway connected to sphingomonas sp strain mv1 metabolism can be interpereted as the methyl hydroxylation of bpa and formation of 2 3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 2 propanediol not detected from 2 2 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl l propanol as a result of oxidative degradation 2 3 bis 4 hydroxyphenyl 1 2 propanediol persumably is cleaved to form 4 hydroxybenzoic acid hba previous studies of bpa degradation showed the accumulation of these metabolites in the cases like activated sludge microcosms 47 in the second proposed pathway bpa is cleaved into 4 2 hydroxypropan 2 yl phenol and hq the monooxygenation of the aromatic results in the cc bond cleavage which was then generated to 4 2 hydroxypropan 2 yl phenol and hq this pathway has also been derived from cupriavidus basilensis jf1 bacillus sp strain gzb and the bacterial consortium 19 48 49 where the monooxygenas enzymatic reaction activated by cofactors nadph and fad involve in metabolizing bpa further degradation of hq leads to the breakage of aromatic ring consequently generating oxalic acid 4 isopropenylphenol was also formed as a consequent of loss of hydrogen atom from carbocationic isopropylphenol it is expected that breaking c1 body from 4 2 hydroxypropan 2 yl phenol will lead to production of hap further oxidation of 4 isopropenylphenol and hap undergoes cleavage and produces hbal and hba rapidly although hbal and hba were not noticed they were presumed to be oxidised to oxalic acid which was noticed we suggested that oxalic acid might be subsequently metabolised to co2 and cell biomass 4 conclusion the key points from the obtained results are summarised here investigation of bpa adsorption in batch experiments on the saline biomass showed that increasing salinity had no influence on the adsorption process of bpa the application of sbr systems clarified that the principal amount of bpa 93 would be degraded through the operation in sequencing reactors mainly via biodegradation reaching an hrt 5 days and salinity ranging from 5 to 15 g l compatibility of the microbial community to changing salinity gave rise to an enhancement in the overall removal performance a decrease in hrt affected the process performance negatively the accumulation of bpa in sequencing reactors was determined to be less than 1 9 the biokinetic parameters in saline substrates were in the range of y 0 54 0 61 mg vss mg bpa kd 0 006 0 013 1 d ks 8 94 13 6 mg bpa l and Î¼m 0

system might contribute to the biofouling formation this study provided useful information for biofouling control by regulating qs and qq in full scale mbrs keywords membrane bioreactor biofouling quorum sensing quorum quenching microbial community 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr is a compact system for wastewater treatment combining biological treatment and membrane filtration 1 with advantages of high volumetric loading less sludge production and high quality effluent mbr is widely applied to wastewater treatment 2 3 however during the operation of mbr small flocs would attach to membrane surface and form biofilm inducing membrane biofouling 4 5 biofouling in mbr can decrease membrane flux which is the bottleneck for the application of mbr 1 2 5 quorum sensing qs is a density based microbial regulation mechanism 6 playing an important role in biofilm formation 7 8 during qs microorganisms synthesize secret and sense autoinducers or chemical molecules to accomplish the communication among cells thus adjusting related genes expression and regulating microbial community behaviors such as mobility sludge granulation and biofilm formation 6 yeon et al 9 found that the transmembrane pressure tmp and n acyl homoserine lactones ahls autoinducer in membrane biofilm both increased with similar tendencies in mbr and qs was associated with biofouling moreover the addition of porcine kidney acylase i ahls degradation protein in mbr could decrease ahls concentrations and effectively mitigate biofouling on membrane 9 therefore investigation of qs mechanism in mbr would be useful for biofouling control signal molecules autoinducers the core elements in microbial qs systems include ahls in gram negative bacteria autoinducer peptides aip in gram positive bacteria and autoinducer 2 ai 2 shared in gram negative and gram positive bacteria in addition other classes of signal molecules have also been detected such as diffusible signal factor dsf in gram negative bacteria 10 and pseudomonas quinolone signal pqs secreted by gram negative bacteria especially pseudomonas aeruginosa 11 recently the second messenger 3 5 cyclic diguanosine monophosphate c di gmp was also reported as the highly versatile signal molecule controlling various biological processes 12 ahls based qs is the most important qs system in wastewater treatment technologies including mbrs and could be associated with biological processes of nitrification denitrification and organic matters removal 13 16 in addition ahls based qs could enhance the production of microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps facilitating biofilm formation 17 gamage et al 18 found that the formation of biofilm by burkholderia pseudomallei was impaired when the bpsi bpsr system a typical qs system was disturbed but could be recovered with the addition of n 3 oxo octanoyl l homoserine lactone 3 oxo c8 hsl therefore qs was crucial for biofilm formation in full scale mbrs quite a few qs genera genera abundances of 3 12 existed in activated sludge and membrane biofilm showing that qs based approach could be used for biofouling control 19 quorum quenching qq could disrupt qs by signal molecules e g ahls degradation and inactivation or by interfering with the signal receptor addition of qq enzyme e g lactonase and acylase or qq bacteria in mbrs could degrade or inactivate ahls by altering their structures and effectively control biofouling 9 20 ham et al 20 isolated a hemm 1 strain with the qq function and found that hemm 1 could secrete lactonase to degrade ahls thereby suppressing biofilm formation in mbrs maqbool et al 21 also confirmed that a qq strain bh 4 could reduce biofouling in a mbr in addition song et al 22 found endogenous ahls degradation function in activated sludge and verified the co existence of qs and qq however the function of microorganisms possessing qs or qq in full scale mbrs for biofouling control still needs further studies the purpose of the present study was to examine the qs and qq systems in a full scale mbr and their potential roles in regulating membrane biofilm formation ahls were detected by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms microbial communities in activated sludge and membrane biofilm were analyzed by high throughput sequencing qs and qq systems related genes and genera in activated sludge and membrane biofilm were analyzed by the metagenomic technique the present study could provide valuable information on qs qq based strategies for biofouling control in full scale mbrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 the investigated mbr process the schematic diagram of the full scale mbr is shown in fig a 1 the treatment capacity of the mbr wastewater treatment plant wwtp was 100 000 m3 d influent was firstly treated by the primary treatment process of coarse screen aerated grit chamber and fine screen and then was fed to the mbr process including anaerobic tank anoxic tank 1 aerobic tank anoxic tank 2 and finally the downstream membrane separation tank the step feeding pattern was applied to efficiently utilize influent organic matters for enhanced nitrogen removal through denitrification the activated sludge from membrane tank was recirculated to the aerobic zone with the recirculation ratio of 400 the nitrified mixed liquor was recirculated from the aerobic zone to the anoxic zone to promote denitrification in this wwtp phosphorus removal was mainly achieved by the addition of poly aluminum chloride in the anoxic tank 2 the detailed operational parameters are shown in table a 1 the design parameters of the membrane module are shown in table a 2 the pvdf hollow fiber membrane with a total surface area of 12 936 m2 and 0 3 Î¼m pore size was installed the designed flux was 19 6 l m2 h during the mbr operation 7 min for suction and 1 min of idle period with the pumping frequency of 36 39 hz were applied and tmp was usually controlled to below 35 kpa chemical cleaning of membrane was applied when tmp increased to beyond the threshold value after physical cleaning specifically sodium hypochlorite with the concentration of 200 500 mg l was used for cleaning 2 4 times per month and each time lasted 6 8 h meanwhile critic acid with the concentration of 0 1 1 was employed quarterly for cleaning and the duration was 6 8 h when tmp could not be effectively mitigated by chemical cleaning the membrane module would be dissembled and the foulants on membrane would be washed by high pressure water which was conducted approximately twice per year 2 2 ahls extraction and detection activated sludge samples for ahls detection were collected from the membrane tank and ascorbic acid with a mass concentration of 0 0001 was added for the suppression of microbial activity and stabilization of ahls the membrane biofilm was collected from membrane which was replaced due to breakage the membrane biofilm was dispersed in water by ultrasonication and then the mixed liquor was used for the ahls extraction ahls in eps and biomass phases were extracted and detected according to sun et al 23 with some modifications the biomass and eps should be separated before the extraction of ahls in the eps and biomass phases the mixed liquor activated sludge or membrane biofilm with the volume of 15 ml was centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was discharged the residues were re suspended in deionized water with the same volume and heated in a thermostat water bath at 80 c for 30 min then the mixture was centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was recorded as the eps phase the residues after eps extraction were recorded as the biomass phase for the extraction of ahls from biomass the biomass was re suspended in 5 ml of mixed solution methanol and acetonitrile 1 1 firstly then 50 Î¼l of protease inhibitor c was added and finally the mixture was disrupted using ultrasonic cell disruptor jy92 iin ningbo china at 200 w for 15 min after ultrasonication the mixed liquor was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was evaporated to dryness with nitrogen n2 using a nitrogen evaporator dc 12 shanghai china the residues were recorded as ahls in the biomass phase for the extraction of ahls in the eps phase 15 ml of eps extraction was filtered through a glass fiber membrane filter gf b 47 mm whatman uk and filtrates were concentrated by using solid phase extraction spe with the filtering velocity of approximately one drop every 3 s the retained compounds in spe were eluted with 5 ml of methanol and then evaporated to dryness finally the ahl extractives in both the biomass and eps phases after n2 evaporation were dissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile and filtered through a 0 2 Î¼m membrane ptfe Ñ13 0 22 Î¼m jinteng china for lc ms ms analysis with the protocol according to sun et al 23 2 3 high throughput sequencing and metagenomics the activated sludge samples of aerobic tank anaerobic tank anoxic tank 1 anoxic tank 2 and membrane separation tank were collected in march 2018 for high throughput sequencing the activated sludge samples from the 5 tanks were mixed for metagenomics analysis membrane biofilm samples were collected for both high throughput sequencing and metagenomics analysis dna was extracted with the fast dna spin kit illumina inc usa following the manufacturer s protocol the extraction was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr in the v4 region 515 f and 806r of the target fragment 16s rna gene by thermocycling 5 min at 94 c for initialization 30 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 c 30 s annealing at 52 c and 30 s extension at 70 c followed by 10 min final elongation at 72 c the length and concentration of the pcr products were detected by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the pcr products were purified with ezna gel extraction kit omega usa before library was constructed finally the library was sequenced on an illumina hiseq2500 platform and 250 bp paired end reads were generated the quality filtering on the paired end raw reads were performed to obtain the high quality clean reads and the reads were merged using flash v1 2 11 according to the relationship of overlap of the paired end clean reads the spliced sequences were called raw tags after removing the barcodes and primers the effective clean tags were obtained sequences analysis were performed by useurch software v10 and the sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic unit otu then the representative sequences of otu with the removed chimera and singleton were annotated based on the silva database the taxonomic information including kingdom phylum class order family genus and species was finally obtained the dna extracts of activated sludge and membrane biofilm samples were analyzed with the metagenomic sequencing method the reads information of the high throughput sequencing data was converted to the raw reads the quality control was performed using the trimmomactic toolkit which removed the low quality reads and adapter and then clean reads were obtained metagenomes of the samples were assembled using megahit 24 a series of k mers ranging from 35 to 90 k step 20 were used during the assembly process clean reads were mapped back to the assembled metagenomes and finally acquired the multiple assembly scaftigs open reading frames orfs were predicted using prodigl and the prediction results were clustered using linclust software 25 the function genes were annotated using blast against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database e value 0 001 26 the relative abundance of each kegg function was calculated by dividing its coverage by the total number of reads the unigenes sequences were compared with the ncbi nr database using blastp version 2 2 31 software to obtain the taxonomy information e value 0 001 2 4 analytical methods suspended solids ss volatile suspended solids vss chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n were detected according to standard methods 27 the membrane samples were sequentially soaked in ethanol with the concentration of 50 80 and 95 for 5 min each and then analyzed by scanning electron microscope sem zeiss supra 55 vp jena germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 mbr performance and microbial community the average influent concentrations of bod cod nh4 n tn tp and ss were 127 41 mg l 276 81 mg l 24 5 mg l 33 6 mg l 4 1 mg l and 210 101 mg l respectively and their effluent concentrations were 1 0 4 mg l 15 3 mg l 0 7 0 3 mg l 7 4 2 0 mg l 0 15 0 04 mg l and 4 0 2 mg l respectively specifically the average bod and cod removal percentages were 99 and 94 respectively indicating efficient organic matters removal nitrification was almost complete with an average nh4 n removal percentage of 97 the average effluent tn concentration varied between 1 8 and 13 7 mg l with the average removal percentage of 76 the phosphorus concentrations in every treatment units were detected from june to november showing no phosphorus release in the anaerobic tank and therefore no enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr occurred phosphorus removal was mainly achieved by the addition of poly aluminum chloride with the average removal percentage of 96 no ebpr occurred in the mbr which might be due to the insufficient organic matters in the anaerobic tank in addition the applied high recirculation ratio brought a high proportion of oxygen and nitrate to the anaerobic tank deteriorating the anaerobic condition for phosphorus release the top 10 phyla and dominant genera relative abundance 0 01 in activated sludge and membrane biofilm are shown in fig 1 at the phylum level fig 1a and b proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were abundant in both activated sludge and membrane biofilm with the abundances of 40 58 48 18 and 26 89 36 01 respectively proteobacteria consisted of aerobic anaerobic and facultative bacteria with diverse metabolic pathways which were common in wastewater treatment processes 28 29 bacteroidetes were crucial in hydrolysis and acetogenesis of organic matters benefiting nitrogen removal 19 a study on 10 mbrs by jo et al 19 showed that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were dominant in both activated sludge and membrane biofilm planctomycetes and choroflexi accounted for 3 52 4 36 and 3 34 4 13 in activated sludge and membrane biofilm respectively tian et al 30 found that planctomycetes and choroflexi were 2 of the most 5 abundant phyla in activated sludge from full scale anaerobic anoxic oxic nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes at the genus level unclassified chitinophagaceae unclassified saprospiraceae dechloromonas unclassified cryomorphaceae rhodoferax nitrospira and rubrivivax were dominant in activated sludge with the abundance of 7 98 11 10 6 52 9 42 6 02 10 46 2 94 3 48 2 35 2 74 1 40 3 52 and 1 50 2 04 respectively fig 1c nitrospira ferruginibacter unclassified saprospiraceae dechloromonas terrimonas unclassified xanthomonadaceae dokdonella and rhodoferax were dominant genera in membrane biofilm accounting for 6 80 6 72 5 53 3 57 3 35 2 41 2 29 and 2 18 respectively fig 1d the majority of bacteria detected in activated sludge was also found in membrane biofilm whereas their abundances differed significantly matar et al 31 confirmed that microbial communities in activated sludge and membrane biofilm of mbr were different and bacteria in membrane biofilm was not random assembly of microorganisms in activated sludge it can be expected that microorganisms in membrane biofilm would behave and function differently from the suspended ones in activated sludge on account of the distinct microbial communities 14 the dominant genera unclassified saprospiraceae dechloromonas rhodoferax and rubrivivax in activated sludge could participate in the metabolism of organic matters and nitrogen saprospiraceae unclassified at the genus level considered as representative predatory bacteria had the ability to hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides 32 dechloromonas usually involved in heterotrophic denitrification by using different types of organic carbons were abundant in wastewater treatment systems 19 33 rhodoferax facultative anaerobic bacteria could degrade a wide range of contaminants and perform fermentative metabolism 34 rubrivivax could survive in various environmental conditions and utilize many kinds of organic inorganic carbons playing an important role in organic matters and nitrogen removal 35 ferruginibacter terrimonas and unclassified xanthomonadaceae were more abundant in membrane biofilm compared to those in activated sludge xanthomonadaceae unclassified at the genus level had the ability to secret exopolysaccharides 36 which would elevate the exopolysaccharides content in membrane biofilm ferruginibacter accounted for 6 72 in membrane biofilm whereas only 0 0065 0 014 in activated sludge lee et al 37 found that ferruginibacter could involve in the glucose fermentation during the mbr operation degradation of exopolysaccharides in membrane biofilm might enrich ferruginibacter terrimonas was also considered as the typical fermentative bacteria and could involve in the biodegradation of organic matters 38 which would be vital to the degradation of biomolecules attached to membrane surface the results above indicated that polysaccharides and certain organic molecules or compounds might be enriched in membrane biofilm in comparison with those in activated sludge the sem images of membrane also verified that plenty of substances existed on the membrane surface fig a 2 moreover nitrospira with the ability to oxidize nitrite to nitrate was also enriched in membrane biofilm 6 7 whereas 2 5 in activated sludge jo et al 19 found that in 10 mbrs nitrospira was more profoundly abundant in membrane biofilm than that in activated sludge matar et al 31 also showed that nitrospira the presentative slow growing bacteria might take advantage in membrane biofilm which could provide relatively stable attachment sites for microorganisms 3 2 ahls detected in mbr the types and concentrations of ahls in activated sludge of membrane separation tank and membrane biofilm were detected fig 2 n butyryl l homoserine lactone c4 hsl and n octanoyl l homoserine lactone c8 hsl were dominant ahls in activated sludge with concentrations of 206 0 ng g vss and 201 2 ng g vss in the eps phase and 242 2 ng g vss and 18 8 ng g vss in the biomass phase the dominant ahls of c4 hsl and c8 hsl in both eps and biomass phases was in line with feng et al 15 tan et al 39 found that the concentrations of c4 hsl increased during the granulation and decreased during the granule dispersal indicating that c4 hsl was positively correlated to granule biofilm formation previous studies reported that c8 hsl would promote biofilm formation and granulation of sludge flocs in addition to the nitrification rate 8 40 moreover hu et al 7 found that c8 hsl was the major ahl to promote membrane biofouling n decanoyl l homoserine lactone c10 hsl n dodecanoyl l homoserine lactone c12 hsl and n 3 oxo decanoyl l homoserine lactone 3 oxo c10 hsl were major ahls detected in membrane biofilm with concentrations of 312 59 ng g vss 214 68 ng g vss and 145 71 ng g vss in the eps phase and 181 83 ng g vss 484 93 ng g vss and 77 38 ng g vss in the biomass phase the total ahls concentration in membrane biofilm was 1 1 folder higher than that in activated sludge wang et al 41 found that c10 hsl and c12 hsl were most abundant signals in biofilm and these two ahls were significantly correlated with the adhesion activity of biofilm the detected ahls of c4 hsl and c8 hsl in activated sludge were not found in membrane biofilm which might be the result of certain rare bacteria that could degrade c4 hsl and c8 hsl were enriched in membrane biofilm cheong et al 42 found that the culture supernatant of pseudomonas had the ability to degrade c8 hsl and pseudomonas genus was more abundant in membrane biofilm 0 004 than in activated sludge 0 0002 0 0003 moreover ham et al 20 found that hemm 1 with endogenous qq function could degrade certain ahls especially short chain ahls therefore some bacteria in membrane biofilm might have endogenous qq function causing the absence of c4 hsl and c8 hsl in membrane biofilm the detected ahls of c10 hsl c12 hsl 3 oxo c10 hsl and c6 hsl in membrane biofilm were not found in activated sludge which might be synthesized by specific microorganisms in membrane biofilm for example nitrosomonas was found in membrane biofilm and burton et al 43 found that nitrosomonas could secrete c6 hsl and c10 hsl in addition acinebacter genus was more abundant in membrane biofilm than that in activated sludge kang and park 44 found that acinebacter could synthesize c6 hsl and c12 hsl microbial community analysis showed that different types of dominant microorganisms existed in membrane biofilm and activated sludge which might result in different types of ahls production according to the study on biofilm formation by hu et al 7 during the development from flocs to biofilm bacteria would secret different types of ahls in the maturation phase of biofilm c6 hsl c8 hsl and 3 oxo c12 hsl were detected with relatively high concentrations while c8 hsl and 3 oxo c12 hsl were not observed in activated sludge it s worth noting that n tetradecanoyl l homoserine lactone the major ahl in the activation phase of biofilm formation was not found in sludge flocs and a low concentration existed in mature biofilm 7 in general more types of ahls would be found in mature biofilm compared with activated sludge meanwhile the ahls level in membrane biofilm was much higher than that in activated sludge as a density dependent communication mechanism the cells density in biofilm was obviously much higher than that in planktonic state which might trigger higher ahls levels 3 3 qs in activated sludge and membrane biofilm based on metagenomics analysis qs related functional genes were identified based on the kegg database diverse qs systems including ahls aip dsf and pqs and second messenger c di gmp systems were obtained in activated sludge fig 3 a the c di gmp synthesis protein gene dgc was the most abundant accounted for 80 2 of total qs genes ahls based qs genes were relatively low with the abundance of 0 0015 whereas the ahls based qs system contained most gene types of synthesis protein genes of luxi 0 0002 rhii 0 0003 cqsa 0 0005 and tral 0 0004 and the sensing protein gene of trar 0 00005 meanwhile synthesis protein genes of phna pqs phnb pqs lepb aip and rpff dsf were also observed with the abundances of 0 020 0 015 0 012 and 0 0008 respectively nitrosospira and methylobacterium genus harbored luxi while tral was contained in nitrosospira only feng et al 15 also found that nitrosospira had the ability to synthesize ahls besides rhii distributed in hirschia and phenylobacterium genus cqsa was merely harbored by burkholderia which was consistent with sun et al 45 dechloromonas sulfuritalea and arenimonas possessed the majority of dgc with the proportions of 15 1 4 3 and 2 9 respectively moreover aip pqs and dsf related qs genes were mainly distributed in dechloromonas arenimonas nitrosomonas and rubrivivax etc the qs genes associated with ahls ai 2 dsf pqs aip and c di gmp were also detected in membrane biofilm fig 3a dgc was still dominant with the abundance of 0 23 and accounted for 51 1 of total qs genes ahls system possessed synthesis protein genes luxi and rpal and sensing protein genes such as luxr rpar sdia and ccir with the total abundance of 0 046 meanwhile ai 2 synthesis protein gene lsrk and aip transporter protein gene lsrd were observed moreover the dsf qs system including synthesis protein genes rpff and rpfb transduction protein gene rpfc and sensing regulator gene rpfg was detected in membrane biofilm dechloromonas solimonas nitrospira and arenimonas possessed the majority of dgc luxi was harbored by lysobactor and hydrocarboniphaga bradyrhizobium harbored rpal rpar and ccir which was consistent with sun et al 40 rpfb was mainly distributed in candidus accumulibacter dechloromonas and methylibium rpff was harbored by methylibium thimonas and arenimonas etc besides dechloromonas and nitrospira contained phna phnb and lepb fig 3b the qs system in membrane biofilm possessed 42 functional genes with the gene abundance of 0 45 whereas 10 qs genes with the total abundance of 0 19 in activated sludge all qs systems ahls ai 2 dsf pqs aip and c di gmp with abundances of 0 046 0 00098 0 088 0 054 0 029 and 0 23 respectively were more abundant in membrane biofilm than those in activated sludge 0 0015 not found 0 00076 0 036 0 012 and 0 15 fig 4 a it is worth noting that ahls qs and dsf qs gene levels in membrane biofilm were 30 and 115 times higher respectively than those in activated sludge qs genes in membrane biofilm distributed in 33 genera and the total abundance of qs related genera was 17 7 and 19 genera possessed qs genes with the genera abundance of 9 8 in activated sludge in comparison with activated sludge qs system in membrane biofilm was more abundant more qs genes types with higher abundances and more types of qs related genus with higher genera abundances ahls qs genes were more profoundly abundant in membrane biofilm there were plentiful qs genes solely observed in membrane biofilm including 12 genes encoding ahls synthesis and sensing proteins as well as 13 genes regulating unknown qs functions more abundant ahls qs genes might contribute to the higher ahls levels meanwhile different ahls qs genes and genera might be responsible for distinct types of ahls in activated sludge and membrane biofilm previous studies indicated that ahls levels were positively correlated with biofilm formation and maintenance 8 9 therefore more abundant ahls qs system ahls genes abundances and ahls concentrations in membrane biofilm might play a crucial role in maintaining stability of biofilm in addition dgc was more abundant in membrane biofilm than that in activated sludge which might favor a higher concentration of c di gmp jenal et al 12 found that microorganisms would secret more c di gmp after attachment to surface to promote the synthesis of not only adhesins but also composition of biofilm and eventually enhancing biofilm formation dsf synthesis protein rpff has the ability to degrade c di gmp and can be activated by dsf signal molecules and then regulates c di gmp level and induces biofilm dispersal 10 12 hence high abundances of genes encoding dsf synthesis transduction and sensing proteins would elevate the dsf level in membrane biofilm and then rpff was stimulated to involve in the regulation of biofilm by degrading c di gmp it was reported that ai 2 could control the eps synthesis in escherichia coli and regulate biofilm formation 46 ai 2 synthesis protein gene lsrd and regulator gene lsrk were only found in membrane biofilm which might lead to the high ai 2 level and regulate biofilm formation 3 4 qq in activated sludge and membrane biofilm based on metagenomics qq related genes were detected in activated sludge including genes encoding acylase and lactonase ahls degrading enzymes ai 2 degrading protein gene lsrg and c di gmp degrading phosphodiesterase enzyme pde genes with the abundances of 0 00047 0 00036 0 0019 and 0 011 respectively fig 4a the gene encoding acylase was harbored by pseudoduganella actinoplanes and cupriavidu the lactonase gene was mainly distributed in cystobacter and phenylobacterium the above ahls qq microorganisms detected in the present study were not reported before actinomadura and unclassified atribacteria possessed lsrg nitrosomonas and thauera contained the majority of pde genes with the abundances of 20 9 and 11 1 respectively sun et al 16 also found that nitrosomonas and thauera harbored the pde gene acylase lactonase lsrg and pde were also found in membrane biofilm with abundances of 0 00097 0 00013 0 00026 and 0 0087 respectively fig 4a pde genes were mainly distributed in candidus accumulibacter nitrosomonas and thauera which was in line with sun et al 16 moreover pde genes were also harbored by dechloromonas selenomonas and curvibacter etc lsrg was only harbored by candidus accumulibacter pseudomonas and salinispora contained all acylase genes fig 4b cheong et al 42 found that pseudomonas had the ability to degrade a variety of ahls including c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl kim et al 47 isolated a total of 225 ahls degrading bacteria from lab scale reactors and full scale wwtps and found that pseudomonas could synthesize the extracellular qq enzyme to produce acylase total qq genes abundance in membrane biofilm was 0 01 whereas 0 012 in activated sludge specifically the abundances of lactonase gene lsrg and pde genes were lower in membrane biofilm than those in activated sludge fig 4a furthermore 42 genera that had qq functions were detected in activated sludge while 13 types of microorganisms had qq functions in membrane biofilm the abundance of qq related microorganisms in membrane biofilm was 5 6 much lower than that in activated sludge 11 5 fig 4b the suppressed qq system lower qq genes and genera abundances in membrane biofilm might keep the signal molecule concentrations high enough to ensure the operation of qs systems and the regulation of community behaviors for example biofilm formation it is worth noting that some dominant qq bacteria in activated sludge i e nitrosomonas and sulfuritalea lost their qq genes in membrane biofilm and other organisms without qq function in activated sludge harbored qq genes in membrane biofilm the results indicated that bacteria would perform distinct qq functions under different conditions i e planktonic or assembly qq has been widely applied to stop microbial group behaviors especially biofilm formation leading to biofouling in mbrs the general strategy for biofouling control by the qq method was the addition of qq enzymes i e acylase and lactonase and qq bacteria nowadays the regulation of qs and qq systems coexisted in wastewater treatment bioreactors may be promising in controlling biofouling in the present study diverse bacteria exhibited different qq functions in the same circumstance and some microorganisms might lose their qq functions when environmental conditions changed in view of this the qq bacteria isolated from specific conditions for controlling biofouling might lose their qq function therefore selecting the qq bacteria in situ should be preferable for qq based biofouling control 3 5 influence of nitrifiers and denitrifiers on qs and qq numerous qs and qq genera in activated sludge and membrane biofilm were found to contain nitrogen metabolism genes moreover nitrogen removal is the main biological process in the investigated full scale mbr therefore the influences of nitrogen removal systems on qs and qq in both activated sludge and membrane biofilm were investigated based on the metagenomics sequencing with results shown in fig 5 the total abundance of qs and qq genera in activated sludge was 9 8 and 79 6 of which simultaneously contained nitrogen removal genes with abundances of 7 8 the qs and qq genes harbored by nitrifiers and denitrifiers accounted for 65 6 specifically dechloromonas contained all types of denitrification genes nar 24 9 nir 15 7 nor 19 3 and nosz 14 2 indicating that dechloromonas played an important role in denitrification meanwhile dechloromonas was important to qs systems with the possession of the most dgc and high levels of lepb phna and phnb nitrosomonas harbored ammonia monooxygenase gene and entire hydroxylamine oxidase gene making nitrosomonas an important nitrifier in the mbr meanwhile high abundance of phnb and most pde were contained by nitrosomonas implying that nitrosomonas was important to qs and qq systems nitrosomonas was shown to be an important ahls qs genus with the ability to produce c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl 43 furthermore nitrospira nitrososopira sulfuritalea candidatus accumulibacter sediminibacterium and burkholderia in activated sludge involved in both nitrogen removal and qs qq sun et al 16 found that nitrospira and nitrosospira possessed ahls synthesis gene hdts and ai 2 synthesis gene in activated sludge nitrifiers and denitrifiers contributed a lot to the qs qq system the total abundance of qs and qq genera in membrane biofilm was 18 2 and 16 genera of which contained nitrogen removal genes simultaneously with the abundance of 14 1 both 69 1 of qs qq related genes and 52 0 of nitrogen removal genes were distributed in nitrosomonas nitrospira dechloromonas candidatus accumulibacter burkholderia rhodanobacter and thauera etc additionally some microorganisms with both qs qq and nitrogen removal functions were only observed in membrane biofilm accounting for 36 8 of the total qs and qq genera and with the abundance of 6 7 mellbye et al 48 found that aob of nitrosospira nob of nitrobacter and nitrospira could produce c10 hsl a monounsaturated ahl and c8 hsl respectively in addition sun et al 16 found that nitrifiers nitrosomonas and nitrospira and denitrifiers candidatus accumulibacter and thauera contained dgc and might involve in the regulation of c di gmp concentration besides huber et al 49 found that burkholderia could use the cepi cepr qs system to produce ahls and regulate biofilm formation feng et al 15 found that rhodanobacter possessed both denitrification related genes and ahls degrading genes a large proportion of bacteria responsible for nitrogen removal in membrane biofilm had qs qq functions and some were related to c di gmp the above results indicated that nitrifiers and denitrifiers might play important roles in qs and qq in the study of li et al 50 six ahls c6 hsl c8 hsl c10 hsl n 3 oxo hexanoyl l homoserinelactone 3 oxo c8 hsl and 3 oxo c10 hsl were dosed into an autotrophic nitrifying bioreactor the results indicated that the efficiencies of ammonia removal had a close correlation with the side chain length and Î² position substitution group of the ahls 50 the nitrogen removal systems and qs qq systems are closely related which deserves further studies additionally more types and higher abundances of bacteria in membrane biofilm involved in not only nitrogen cycling but also qs and qq systems it is worth noting that nitrospira the representative nob became the most abundant genus in membrane biofilm and involved in qs while this genus had no qs or qq functions in activated sludge meanwhile the functional genes for nitrogen removal in membrane biofilm were more abundant than those in activated sludge with the abundance of 0 29 whereas 0 029 in activated sludge fig 6 a in addition more types of organisms involved in the nitrogen cycling there were 36 genera responsible for nitrogen removal in membrane biofilm and 25 of which were found unrelated to nitrogen removal in activated sludge fig 6b the abundances of genera which were involved in nitrogen removal were also much higher than those in activated sludge fig 6c the nitrogen removal system was enhanced in membrane biofilm therefore the qs and nitrogen removal systems could be enhanced simultaneously in membrane biofilm and the nitrogen removal system might promote the qs system in membrane biofilm 4 conclusion in the full scale mbr microbial communities of activated sludge and membrane biofilm differed profoundly and ferruginibacter terrimonas as well as xanthomonadaceae involved in the metabolism of organics were significantly enriched in membrane biofilm which might induce the remarkably different qs qq systems c10 hsl c12 hsl and 3 oxo c10 hsl were major ahls in membrane biofilm all qs systems ahls ai 2 dsf pqs aip and c di gmp were more abundant in membrane biofilm while the qq system in membrane biofilm was suppressed the selectively enhanced qs system in membrane biofilm played a vital role in biofouling formation in addition nitrospira nitrosomonas candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas the dominant bacteria for nitrogen removal in membrane biofilm were also important to qs qq system the nitrogen removal systems were intensively correlated with qs and qq systems and the bacteria that possessed both nitrogen removal and qs qq genes profoundly enriched in membrane biofilm nitrifiers and denitrifiers might contribute a lot to biofouling formation measures for enhancing nitrogen removal systems might also act on the balance of qs and qq systems and ultimately influence the biofouling acknowledgements this work was supported by the national key research and development program

14256,biofouling hampers the long lasting operation of membrane bioreactor mbr and quorum sensing qs can be applied to control biofouling in this study n acyl homoserine lactones ahls qs quorum quenching qq functional genes and microbial communities in activated sludge and membrane biofilm from a full scale mbr were analyzed types and concentrations of ahls in activated sludge and membrane biofilm were remarkably different the major ahls detected in membrane biofilm were n decanoyl l homoserine lactone n dodecanoyl l homoserine lactone and n 3 oxo decanoyl l homoserine lactone while n butyryl l homoserine lactone and n octanoyl l homoserine lactone were dominant in activated sludge the concentration of ahls in membrane biofilm 1439 4 ng g vss was 1 1 folder higher than that in activated sludge 676 7 ng g vss all qs systems ahls ai 2 dsf pqs aip and c di gmp were enhanced in membrane biofilm with more types and higher abundances of genes and microorganisms the qq system was suppressed in membrane biofilm additionally nitrospira nitrosomonas candidatus accumulibacter and dechloromonas the dominant microorganisms for nitrogen removal in membrane biofilm also harbored diverse qs qq genes the microorganisms responsible for both nitrogen removal and qs qq accounted for 14 1 in total bacteria of membrane biofilm while 7 8 in activated sludge the nitrogen removal system might contribute to the biofouling formation this study provided useful information for biofouling control by regulating qs and qq in full scale mbrs keywords membrane bioreactor biofouling quorum sensing quorum quenching microbial community 1 introduction membrane bioreactor mbr is a compact system for wastewater treatment combining biological treatment and membrane filtration 1 with advantages of high volumetric loading less sludge production and high quality effluent mbr is widely applied to wastewater treatment 2 3 however during the operation of mbr small flocs would attach to membrane surface and form biofilm inducing membrane biofouling 4 5 biofouling in mbr can decrease membrane flux which is the bottleneck for the application of mbr 1 2 5 quorum sensing qs is a density based microbial regulation mechanism 6 playing an important role in biofilm formation 7 8 during qs microorganisms synthesize secret and sense autoinducers or chemical molecules to accomplish the communication among cells thus adjusting related genes expression and regulating microbial community behaviors such as mobility sludge granulation and biofilm formation 6 yeon et al 9 found that the transmembrane pressure tmp and n acyl homoserine lactones ahls autoinducer in membrane biofilm both increased with similar tendencies in mbr and qs was associated with biofouling moreover the addition of porcine kidney acylase i ahls degradation protein in mbr could decrease ahls concentrations and effectively mitigate biofouling on membrane 9 therefore investigation of qs mechanism in mbr would be useful for biofouling control signal molecules autoinducers the core elements in microbial qs systems include ahls in gram negative bacteria autoinducer peptides aip in gram positive bacteria and autoinducer 2 ai 2 shared in gram negative and gram positive bacteria in addition other classes of signal molecules have also been detected such as diffusible signal factor dsf in gram negative bacteria 10 and pseudomonas quinolone signal pqs secreted by gram negative bacteria especially pseudomonas aeruginosa 11 recently the second messenger 3 5 cyclic diguanosine monophosphate c di gmp was also reported as the highly versatile signal molecule controlling various biological processes 12 ahls based qs is the most important qs system in wastewater treatment technologies including mbrs and could be associated with biological processes of nitrification denitrification and organic matters removal 13 16 in addition ahls based qs could enhance the production of microbial extracellular polymeric substances eps facilitating biofilm formation 17 gamage et al 18 found that the formation of biofilm by burkholderia pseudomallei was impaired when the bpsi bpsr system a typical qs system was disturbed but could be recovered with the addition of n 3 oxo octanoyl l homoserine lactone 3 oxo c8 hsl therefore qs was crucial for biofilm formation in full scale mbrs quite a few qs genera genera abundances of 3 12 existed in activated sludge and membrane biofilm showing that qs based approach could be used for biofouling control 19 quorum quenching qq could disrupt qs by signal molecules e g ahls degradation and inactivation or by interfering with the signal receptor addition of qq enzyme e g lactonase and acylase or qq bacteria in mbrs could degrade or inactivate ahls by altering their structures and effectively control biofouling 9 20 ham et al 20 isolated a hemm 1 strain with the qq function and found that hemm 1 could secrete lactonase to degrade ahls thereby suppressing biofilm formation in mbrs maqbool et al 21 also confirmed that a qq strain bh 4 could reduce biofouling in a mbr in addition song et al 22 found endogenous ahls degradation function in activated sludge and verified the co existence of qs and qq however the function of microorganisms possessing qs or qq in full scale mbrs for biofouling control still needs further studies the purpose of the present study was to examine the qs and qq systems in a full scale mbr and their potential roles in regulating membrane biofilm formation ahls were detected by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry lc ms ms microbial communities in activated sludge and membrane biofilm were analyzed by high throughput sequencing qs and qq systems related genes and genera in activated sludge and membrane biofilm were analyzed by the metagenomic technique the present study could provide valuable information on qs qq based strategies for biofouling control in full scale mbrs 2 materials and methods 2 1 the investigated mbr process the schematic diagram of the full scale mbr is shown in fig a 1 the treatment capacity of the mbr wastewater treatment plant wwtp was 100 000 m3 d influent was firstly treated by the primary treatment process of coarse screen aerated grit chamber and fine screen and then was fed to the mbr process including anaerobic tank anoxic tank 1 aerobic tank anoxic tank 2 and finally the downstream membrane separation tank the step feeding pattern was applied to efficiently utilize influent organic matters for enhanced nitrogen removal through denitrification the activated sludge from membrane tank was recirculated to the aerobic zone with the recirculation ratio of 400 the nitrified mixed liquor was recirculated from the aerobic zone to the anoxic zone to promote denitrification in this wwtp phosphorus removal was mainly achieved by the addition of poly aluminum chloride in the anoxic tank 2 the detailed operational parameters are shown in table a 1 the design parameters of the membrane module are shown in table a 2 the pvdf hollow fiber membrane with a total surface area of 12 936 m2 and 0 3 Î¼m pore size was installed the designed flux was 19 6 l m2 h during the mbr operation 7 min for suction and 1 min of idle period with the pumping frequency of 36 39 hz were applied and tmp was usually controlled to below 35 kpa chemical cleaning of membrane was applied when tmp increased to beyond the threshold value after physical cleaning specifically sodium hypochlorite with the concentration of 200 500 mg l was used for cleaning 2 4 times per month and each time lasted 6 8 h meanwhile critic acid with the concentration of 0 1 1 was employed quarterly for cleaning and the duration was 6 8 h when tmp could not be effectively mitigated by chemical cleaning the membrane module would be dissembled and the foulants on membrane would be washed by high pressure water which was conducted approximately twice per year 2 2 ahls extraction and detection activated sludge samples for ahls detection were collected from the membrane tank and ascorbic acid with a mass concentration of 0 0001 was added for the suppression of microbial activity and stabilization of ahls the membrane biofilm was collected from membrane which was replaced due to breakage the membrane biofilm was dispersed in water by ultrasonication and then the mixed liquor was used for the ahls extraction ahls in eps and biomass phases were extracted and detected according to sun et al 23 with some modifications the biomass and eps should be separated before the extraction of ahls in the eps and biomass phases the mixed liquor activated sludge or membrane biofilm with the volume of 15 ml was centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was discharged the residues were re suspended in deionized water with the same volume and heated in a thermostat water bath at 80 c for 30 min then the mixture was centrifuged at 11 000 rpm for 15 min and the supernatant was recorded as the eps phase the residues after eps extraction were recorded as the biomass phase for the extraction of ahls from biomass the biomass was re suspended in 5 ml of mixed solution methanol and acetonitrile 1 1 firstly then 50 Î¼l of protease inhibitor c was added and finally the mixture was disrupted using ultrasonic cell disruptor jy92 iin ningbo china at 200 w for 15 min after ultrasonication the mixed liquor was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was evaporated to dryness with nitrogen n2 using a nitrogen evaporator dc 12 shanghai china the residues were recorded as ahls in the biomass phase for the extraction of ahls in the eps phase 15 ml of eps extraction was filtered through a glass fiber membrane filter gf b 47 mm whatman uk and filtrates were concentrated by using solid phase extraction spe with the filtering velocity of approximately one drop every 3 s the retained compounds in spe were eluted with 5 ml of methanol and then evaporated to dryness finally the ahl extractives in both the biomass and eps phases after n2 evaporation were dissolved in 1 ml of acetonitrile and filtered through a 0 2 Î¼m membrane ptfe Ñ13 0 22 Î¼m jinteng china for lc ms ms analysis with the protocol according to sun et al 23 2 3 high throughput sequencing and metagenomics the activated sludge samples of aerobic tank anaerobic tank anoxic tank 1 anoxic tank 2 and membrane separation tank were collected in march 2018 for high throughput sequencing the activated sludge samples from the 5 tanks were mixed for metagenomics analysis membrane biofilm samples were collected for both high throughput sequencing and metagenomics analysis dna was extracted with the fast dna spin kit illumina inc usa following the manufacturer s protocol the extraction was amplified by polymerase chain reaction pcr in the v4 region 515 f and 806r of the target fragment 16s rna gene by thermocycling 5 min at 94 c for initialization 30 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 94 c 30 s annealing at 52 c and 30 s extension at 70 c followed by 10 min final elongation at 72 c the length and concentration of the pcr products were detected by 1 agarose gel electrophoresis the pcr products were purified with ezna gel extraction kit omega usa before library was constructed finally the library was sequenced on an illumina hiseq2500 platform and 250 bp paired end reads were generated the quality filtering on the paired end raw reads were performed to obtain the high quality clean reads and the reads were merged using flash v1 2 11 according to the relationship of overlap of the paired end clean reads the spliced sequences were called raw tags after removing the barcodes and primers the effective clean tags were obtained sequences analysis were performed by useurch software v10 and the sequences with 97 similarity were assigned to the same operational taxonomic unit otu then the representative sequences of otu with the removed chimera and singleton were annotated based on the silva database the taxonomic information including kingdom phylum class order family genus and species was finally obtained the dna extracts of activated sludge and membrane biofilm samples were analyzed with the metagenomic sequencing method the reads information of the high throughput sequencing data was converted to the raw reads the quality control was performed using the trimmomactic toolkit which removed the low quality reads and adapter and then clean reads were obtained metagenomes of the samples were assembled using megahit 24 a series of k mers ranging from 35 to 90 k step 20 were used during the assembly process clean reads were mapped back to the assembled metagenomes and finally acquired the multiple assembly scaftigs open reading frames orfs were predicted using prodigl and the prediction results were clustered using linclust software 25 the function genes were annotated using blast against the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg database e value 0 001 26 the relative abundance of each kegg function was calculated by dividing its coverage by the total number of reads the unigenes sequences were compared with the ncbi nr database using blastp version 2 2 31 software to obtain the taxonomy information e value 0 001 2 4 analytical methods suspended solids ss volatile suspended solids vss chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp and ammonium nitrogen nh4 n were detected according to standard methods 27 the membrane samples were sequentially soaked in ethanol with the concentration of 50 80 and 95 for 5 min each and then analyzed by scanning electron microscope sem zeiss supra 55 vp jena germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 mbr performance and microbial community the average influent concentrations of bod cod nh4 n tn tp and ss were 127 41 mg l 276 81 mg l 24 5 mg l 33 6 mg l 4 1 mg l and 210 101 mg l respectively and their effluent concentrations were 1 0 4 mg l 15 3 mg l 0 7 0 3 mg l 7 4 2 0 mg l 0 15 0 04 mg l and 4 0 2 mg l respectively specifically the average bod and cod removal percentages were 99 and 94 respectively indicating efficient organic matters removal nitrification was almost complete with an average nh4 n removal percentage of 97 the average effluent tn concentration varied between 1 8 and 13 7 mg l with the average removal percentage of 76 the phosphorus concentrations in every treatment units were detected from june to november showing no phosphorus release in the anaerobic tank and therefore no enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr occurred phosphorus removal was mainly achieved by the addition of poly aluminum chloride with the average removal percentage of 96 no ebpr occurred in the mbr which might be due to the insufficient organic matters in the anaerobic tank in addition the applied high recirculation ratio brought a high proportion of oxygen and nitrate to the anaerobic tank deteriorating the anaerobic condition for phosphorus release the top 10 phyla and dominant genera relative abundance 0 01 in activated sludge and membrane biofilm are shown in fig 1 at the phylum level fig 1a and b proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were abundant in both activated sludge and membrane biofilm with the abundances of 40 58 48 18 and 26 89 36 01 respectively proteobacteria consisted of aerobic anaerobic and facultative bacteria with diverse metabolic pathways which were common in wastewater treatment processes 28 29 bacteroidetes were crucial in hydrolysis and acetogenesis of organic matters benefiting nitrogen removal 19 a study on 10 mbrs by jo et al 19 showed that proteobacteria and bacteroidetes were dominant in both activated sludge and membrane biofilm planctomycetes and choroflexi accounted for 3 52 4 36 and 3 34 4 13 in activated sludge and membrane biofilm respectively tian et al 30 found that planctomycetes and choroflexi were 2 of the most 5 abundant phyla in activated sludge from full scale anaerobic anoxic oxic nitrogen and phosphorus removal processes at the genus level unclassified chitinophagaceae unclassified saprospiraceae dechloromonas unclassified cryomorphaceae rhodoferax nitrospira and rubrivivax were dominant in activated sludge with the abundance of 7 98 11 10 6 52 9 42 6 02 10 46 2 94 3 48 2 35 2 74 1 40 3 52 and 1 50 2 04 respectively fig 1c nitrospira ferruginibacter unclassified saprospiraceae dechloromonas terrimonas unclassified xanthomonadaceae dokdonella and rhodoferax were dominant genera in membrane biofilm accounting for 6 80 6 72 5 53 3 57 3 35 2 41 2 29 and 2 18 respectively fig 1d the majority of bacteria detected in activated sludge was also found in membrane biofilm whereas their abundances differed significantly matar et al 31 confirmed that microbial communities in activated sludge and membrane biofilm of mbr were different and bacteria in membrane biofilm was not random assembly of microorganisms in activated sludge it can be expected that microorganisms in membrane biofilm would behave and function differently from the suspended ones in activated sludge on account of the distinct microbial communities 14 the dominant genera unclassified saprospiraceae dechloromonas rhodoferax and rubrivivax in activated sludge could participate in the metabolism of organic matters and nitrogen saprospiraceae unclassified at the genus level considered as representative predatory bacteria had the ability to hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides 32 dechloromonas usually involved in heterotrophic denitrification by using different types of organic carbons were abundant in wastewater treatment systems 19 33 rhodoferax facultative anaerobic bacteria could degrade a wide range of contaminants and perform fermentative metabolism 34 rubrivivax could survive in various environmental conditions and utilize many kinds of organic inorganic carbons playing an important role in organic matters and nitrogen removal 35 ferruginibacter terrimonas and unclassified xanthomonadaceae were more abundant in membrane biofilm compared to those in activated sludge xanthomonadaceae unclassified at the genus level had the ability to secret exopolysaccharides 36 which would elevate the exopolysaccharides content in membrane biofilm ferruginibacter accounted for 6 72 in membrane biofilm whereas only 0 0065 0 014 in activated sludge lee et al 37 found that ferruginibacter could involve in the glucose fermentation during the mbr operation degradation of exopolysaccharides in membrane biofilm might enrich ferruginibacter terrimonas was also considered as the typical fermentative bacteria and could involve in the biodegradation of organic matters 38 which would be vital to the degradation of biomolecules attached to membrane surface the results above indicated that polysaccharides and certain organic molecules or compounds might be enriched in membrane biofilm in comparison with those in activated sludge the sem images of membrane also verified that plenty of substances existed on the membrane surface fig a 2 moreover nitrospira with the ability to oxidize nitrite to nitrate was also enriched in membrane biofilm 6 7 whereas 2 5 in activated sludge jo et al 19 found that in 10 mbrs nitrospira was more profoundly abundant in membrane biofilm than that in activated sludge matar et al 31 also showed that nitrospira the presentative slow growing bacteria might take advantage in membrane biofilm which could provide relatively stable attachment sites for microorganisms 3 2 ahls detected in mbr the types and concentrations of ahls in activated sludge of membrane separation tank and membrane biofilm were detected fig 2 n butyryl l homoserine lactone c4 hsl and n octanoyl l homoserine lactone c8 hsl were dominant ahls in activated sludge with concentrations of 206 0 ng g vss and 201 2 ng g vss in the eps phase and 242 2 ng g vss and 18 8 ng g vss in the biomass phase the dominant ahls of c4 hsl and c8 hsl in both eps and biomass phases was in line with feng et al 15 tan et al 39 found that the concentrations of c4 hsl increased during the granulation and decreased during the granule dispersal indicating that c4 hsl was positively correlated to granule biofilm formation previous studies reported that c8 hsl would promote biofilm formation and granulation of sludge flocs in addition to the nitrification rate 8 40 moreover hu et al 7 found that c8 hsl was the major ahl to promote membrane biofouling n decanoyl l homoserine lactone c10 hsl n dodecanoyl l homoserine lactone c12 hsl and n 3 oxo decanoyl l homoserine lactone 3 oxo c10 hsl were major ahls detected in membrane biofilm with concentrations of 312 59 ng g vss 214 68 ng g vss and 145 71 ng g vss in the eps phase and 181 83 ng g vss 484 93 ng g vss and 77 38 ng g vss in the biomass phase the total ahls concentration in membrane biofilm was 1 1 folder higher than that in activated sludge wang et al 41 found that c10 hsl and c12 hsl were most abundant signals in biofilm and these two ahls were significantly correlated with the adhesion activity of biofilm the detected ahls of c4 hsl and c8 hsl in activated sludge were not found in membrane biofilm which might be the result of certain rare bacteria that could degrade c4 hsl and c8 hsl were enriched in membrane biofilm cheong et al 42 found that the culture supernatant of pseudomonas had the ability to degrade c8 hsl and pseudomonas genus was more abundant in membrane biofilm 0 004 than in activated sludge 0 0002 0 0003 moreover ham et al 20 found that hemm 1 with endogenous qq function could degrade certain ahls especially short chain ahls therefore some bacteria in membrane biofilm might have endogenous qq function causing the absence of c4 hsl and c8 hsl in membrane biofilm the detected ahls of c10 hsl c12 hsl 3 oxo c10 hsl and c6 hsl in membrane biofilm were not found in activated sludge which might be synthesized by specific microorganisms in membrane biofilm for example nitrosomonas was found in membrane biofilm and burton et al 43 found that nitrosomonas could secrete c6 hsl and c10 hsl in addition acinebacter genus was more abundant in membrane biofilm than that in activated sludge kang and park 44 found that acinebacter could synthesize c6 hsl and c12 hsl microbial community analysis showed that different types of dominant microorganisms existed in membrane biofilm and activated sludge which might result in different types of ahls production according to the study on biofilm formation by hu et al 7 during the development from flocs to biofilm bacteria would secret different types of ahls in the maturation phase of biofilm c6 hsl c8 hsl and 3 oxo c12 hsl were detected with relatively high concentrations while c8 hsl and 3 oxo c12 hsl were not observed in activated sludge it s worth noting that n tetradecanoyl l homoserine lactone the major ahl in the activation phase of biofilm formation was not found in sludge flocs and a low concentration existed in mature biofilm 7 in general more types of ahls would be found in mature biofilm compared with activated sludge meanwhile the ahls level in membrane biofilm was much higher than that in activated sludge as a density dependent communication mechanism the cells density in biofilm was obviously much higher than that in planktonic state which might trigger higher ahls levels 3 3 qs in activated sludge and membrane biofilm based on metagenomics analysis qs related functional genes were identified based on the kegg database diverse qs systems including ahls aip dsf and pqs and second messenger c di gmp systems were obtained in activated sludge fig 3 a the c di gmp synthesis protein gene dgc was the most abundant accounted for 80 2 of total qs genes ahls based qs genes were relatively low with the abundance of 0 0015 whereas the ahls based qs system contained most gene types of synthesis protein genes of luxi 0 0002 rhii 0 0003 cqsa 0 0005 and tral 0 0004 and the sensing protein gene of trar 0 00005 meanwhile synthesis protein genes of phna pqs phnb pqs lepb aip and rpff dsf were also observed with the abundances of 0 020 0 015 0 012 and 0 0008 respectively nitrosospira and methylobacterium genus harbored luxi while tral was contained in nitrosospira only feng et al 15 also found that nitrosospira had the ability to synthesize ahls besides rhii distributed in hirschia and phenylobacterium genus cqsa was merely harbored by burkholderia which was consistent with sun et al 45 dechloromonas sulfuritalea and arenimonas possessed the majority of dgc with the proportions of 15 1 4 3 and 2 9 respectively moreover aip pqs and dsf related qs genes were mainly distributed in dechloromonas arenimonas nitrosomonas and rubrivivax etc the qs genes associated with ahls ai 2 dsf pqs aip and c di gmp were also detected in membrane biofilm fig 3a dgc was still dominant with the abundance of 0 23 and accounted for 51 1 of total qs genes ahls system possessed synthesis protein genes luxi and rpal and sensing protein genes such as luxr rpar sdia and ccir with the total abundance of 0 046 meanwhile ai 2 synthesis protein gene lsrk and aip transporter protein gene lsrd were observed moreover the dsf qs system including synthesis protein genes rpff and rpfb transduction protein gene rpfc and sensing regulator gene rpfg was detected in membrane biofilm dechloromonas solimonas nitrospira and arenimonas possessed the majority of dgc luxi was harbored by lysobactor and hydrocarboniphaga bradyrhizobium harbored rpal rpar and ccir which was consistent with sun et al 40 rpfb was mainly distributed in candidus accumulibacter dechloromonas and methylibium rpff was harbored by methylibium thimonas and arenimonas etc besides dechloromonas and nitrospira contained phna phnb and lepb fig 3b the qs system in membrane biofilm possessed 42 functional genes with the gene abundance of 0 45 whereas 10 qs genes with the total abundance of 0 19 in activated sludge all qs systems ahls ai 2 dsf pqs aip and c di gmp with abundances of 0 046 0 00098 0 088 0 054 0 029 and 0 23 respectively were more abundant in membrane biofilm than those in activated sludge 0 0015 not found 0 00076 0 036 0 012 and 0 15 fig 4 a it is worth noting that ahls qs and dsf qs gene levels in membrane biofilm were 30 and 115 times higher respectively than those in activated sludge qs genes in membrane biofilm distributed in 33 genera and the total abundance of qs related genera was 17 7 and 19 genera possessed qs genes with the genera abundance of 9 8 in activated sludge in comparison with activated sludge qs system in membrane biofilm was more abundant more qs genes types with higher abundances and more types of qs related genus with higher genera abundances ahls qs genes were more profoundly abundant in membrane biofilm there were plentiful qs genes solely observed in membrane biofilm including 12 genes encoding ahls synthesis and sensing proteins as well as 13 genes regulating unknown qs functions more abundant ahls qs genes might contribute to the higher ahls levels meanwhile different ahls qs genes and genera might be responsible for distinct types of ahls in activated sludge and membrane biofilm previous studies indicated that ahls levels were positively correlated with biofilm formation and maintenance 8 9 therefore more abundant ahls qs system ahls genes abundances and ahls concentrations in membrane biofilm might play a crucial role in maintaining stability of biofilm in addition dgc was more abundant in membrane biofilm than that in activated sludge which might favor a higher concentration of c di gmp jenal et al 12 found that microorganisms would secret more c di gmp after attachment to surface to promote the synthesis of not only adhesins but also composition of biofilm and eventually enhancing biofilm formation dsf synthesis protein rpff has the ability to degrade c di gmp and can be activated by dsf signal molecules and then regulates c di gmp level and induces biofilm dispersal 10 12 hence high abundances of genes encoding dsf synthesis transduction and sensing proteins would elevate the dsf level in membrane biofilm and then rpff was stimulated to involve in the regulation of biofilm by degrading c di gmp it was reported that ai 2 could control the eps synthesis in escherichia coli and regulate biofilm formation 46 ai 2 synthesis protein gene lsrd and regulator gene lsrk were only found in membrane biofilm which might lead to the high ai 2 level and regulate biofilm formation 3 4 qq in activated sludge and membrane biofilm based on metagenomics qq related genes were detected in activated sludge including genes encoding acylase and lactonase ahls degrading enzymes ai 2 degrading protein gene lsrg and c di gmp degrading phosphodiesterase enzyme pde genes with the abundances of 0 00047 0 00036 0 0019 and 0 011 respectively fig 4a the gene encoding acylase was harbored by pseudoduganella actinoplanes and cupriavidu the lactonase gene was mainly distributed in cystobacter and phenylobacterium the above ahls qq microorganisms detected in the present study were not reported before actinomadura and unclassified atribacteria possessed lsrg nitrosomonas and thauera contained the majority of pde genes with the abundances of 20 9 and 11 1 respectively sun et al 16 also found that nitrosomonas and thauera harbored the pde gene acylase lactonase lsrg and pde were also found in membrane biofilm with abundances of 0 00097 0 00013 0 00026 and 0 0087 respectively fig 4a pde genes were mainly distributed in candidus accumulibacter nitrosomonas and thauera which was in line with sun et al 16 moreover pde genes were also harbored by dechloromonas selenomonas and curvibacter etc lsrg was only harbored by candidus accumulibacter pseudomonas and salinispora contained all acylase genes fig 4b cheong et al 42 found that pseudomonas had the ability to degrade a variety of ahls including c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl kim et al 47 isolated a total of 225 ahls degrading bacteria from lab scale reactors and full scale wwtps and found that pseudomonas could synthesize the extracellular qq enzyme to produce acylase total qq genes abundance in membrane biofilm was 0 01 whereas 0 012 in activated sludge specifically the abundances of lactonase gene lsrg and pde genes were lower in membrane biofilm than those in activated sludge fig 4a furthermore 42 genera that had qq functions were detected in activated sludge while 13 types of microorganisms had qq functions in membrane biofilm the abundance of qq related microorganisms in membrane biofilm was 5 6 much lower than that in activated sludge 11 5 fig 4b the suppressed qq system lower qq genes and genera abundances in membrane biofilm might keep the signal molecule concentrations high enough to ensure the operation of qs systems and the regulation of community behaviors for example biofilm formation it is worth noting that some dominant qq bacteria in activated sludge i e nitrosomonas and sulfuritalea lost their qq genes in membrane biofilm and other organisms without qq function in activated sludge harbored qq genes in membrane biofilm the results indicated that bacteria would perform distinct qq functions under different conditions i e planktonic or assembly qq has been widely applied to stop microbial group behaviors especially biofilm formation leading to biofouling in mbrs the general strategy for biofouling control by the qq method was the addition of qq enzymes i e acylase and lactonase and qq bacteria nowadays the regulation of qs and qq systems coexisted in wastewater treatment bioreactors may be promising in controlling biofouling in the present study diverse bacteria exhibited different qq functions in the same circumstance and some microorganisms might lose their qq functions when environmental conditions changed in view of this the qq bacteria isolated from specific conditions for controlling biofouling might lose their qq function therefore selecting the qq bacteria in situ should be preferable for qq based biofouling control 3 5 influence of nitrifiers and denitrifiers on qs and qq numerous qs and qq genera in activated sludge and membrane biofilm were found to contain nitrogen metabolism genes moreover nitrogen removal is the main biological process in the investigated full scale mbr therefore the influences of nitrogen removal systems on qs and qq in both activated sludge and membrane biofilm were investigated based on the metagenomics sequencing with results shown in fig 5 the total abundance of qs and qq genera in activated sludge was 9 8 and 79 6 of which simultaneously contained nitrogen removal genes with abundances of 7 8 the qs and qq genes harbored by nitrifiers and denitrifiers accounted for 65 6 specifically dechloromonas contained all types of denitrification genes nar 24 9 nir 15 7 nor 19 3 and nosz 14 2 indicating that dechloromonas played an important role in denitrification meanwhile dechloromonas was important to qs systems with the possession of the most dgc and high levels of lepb phna and phnb nitrosomonas harbored ammonia monooxygenase gene and entire hydroxylamine oxidase gene making nitrosomonas an important nitrifier in the mbr meanwhile high abundance of phnb and most pde were contained by nitrosomonas implying that nitrosomonas was important to qs and qq systems nitrosomonas was shown to be an important ahls qs genus with the ability to produce c6 hsl c8 hsl and c10 hsl 43 furthermore nitrospira nitrososopira sulfuritalea candidatus accumulibacter sediminibacterium and burkholderia in activated sludge involved in both nitrogen removal and qs qq sun et al 16 found that nitrospira and nitrosospira possessed ahls synthesis gene hdts and ai 2 synthesis gene in activated sludge nitrifiers and denitrifiers contributed a lot to the qs qq system the total abundance of qs and qq genera in membrane biofilm was 18 2 and 16 genera of which contained nitrogen removal genes simultaneously with the abundance of 14 1 both 69 1 of qs qq related genes and 52 0 of nitrogen removal genes were distributed in nitrosomonas nitrospira dechloromonas candidatus accumulibacter burkholderia rhodanobacter and thauera etc additionally some microorganisms with both qs qq and nitrogen removal functions were only observed in membrane biofilm accounting for 36 8 of the total qs

dominant bacteria for nitrogen removal in membrane biofilm were also important to qs qq system the nitrogen removal systems were intensively correlated with qs and qq systems and the bacteria that possessed both nitrogen removal and qs qq genes profoundly enriched in membrane biofilm nitrifiers and denitrifiers might contribute a lot to biofouling formation measures for enhancing nitrogen

14257,the present research focuses on the fabrication and application of the cr mil 101 nio 13x as a novel sonocatalyst nanocomposite the characterization study of the prepared samples was carried out by employing techniques including ftir xrd fesem afm edax and x ray dot mapping the fabricated nanocomposite was applied for the sonodestruction of organic dyes in the aqueous media all of the dependent reactions were performed under the optimized conditions following by the uv vis analysis to monitor the destruction progress the extent of sonocatalytic potency of the cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite was investigated versus the h2o2 associated destruction of methylene blue mb rhodamine b rhb and methyl orange mo as prevalent organic dyes under the ultrasonic irradiation in addition several influential parameters such as contact time initial dye concentration catalyst amount h2o2 concentration scavenger type and process type and their impact on the destruction of the mb rhb and mo were evaluated also employing the first order model the reaction kinetic was surveyed the values of 0 0323 min 1 and 21 4551 min were attained for the rate constant k and the half life t1 2 for the destruction of mb in the cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 system moreover considering the gathered details the significant performance of oh as a radical scavenger emanated from h2o2 during sonocatalytic destruction procedure is vividly proved besides to challenge the destruction potential of the new nanocomposite and to show the effective combination of its components the sonocatalytic function of the bare 13x and nio 13x were studied under the equivalent conditions and the subsequent results were precisely reported keywords cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite sonodestruction organic dyes kinetic 1 introduction the progressive growth of the world population along with the development of numerous industrial units and the subsequent waste materials originated from such activities is known as a serious threat to the environment therefore it has always been a concerning matter for many research teams and environmental protection organizations around the globe to find more applicable methods and materials to comprehensively confront the mentioned issue in this regard one important issue that could be included in the above specified subjects is the release of huge volumes of dyes into the environment by some industrial facilities the synthetic dyes are widely utilized in numerous fields of industry for instance textile and leather tanning units paper production process food processing petrochemical cells pharmaceutical and cosmetic units agricultural and wastewater treatments researches 1 also it has been reflected that there are more than 10 000 types of diverse dyes and pigments and an enormous value of 7 105 tons of them are manufactured annually on the other hand a considerable amount of these dyes discharge to the wastewater system not only during the production process but also by the ulterior industries that use these dyes to produce other commodities 2 3 thereupon considering the entrance of large values of dye contaminated wastewaters to the environment and the serious threat of severe obnoxious toxic effects like mutagenic and carcinogenic role on both aquatic biota and human beings which has been verified by the medicine science it is perceived as a substantial issue to remove this sort of contamination from water systems to the least amount possible 4 recently a number of biological and physicochemical procedures have been suggested and applied for the removal degradation of organic dye pollutants and also to diminish the related toxicity including biodegradation 5 electrochemical degradation 6 photocatalytic degradation 7 10 catalytic degradation 11 adsorption 12 13 membrane filtration 14 and ultrasonic wave 15 in recent years the application of ultrasonic irradiation for the destruction of organic contamination has been become extensively popular probably because of the emersion of remarkable values of hydroxyl radicals oh produced from the ultrasonic cavitation phenomenon 16 in brief when the ultrasonic waves are introduced to the liquid the rapid growth and subsequent collapse of the pre formed cavitation bubbles happens this implosion of cavitation bubbles causes the extremely increased temperature and pressure of approximately 5000 k and 1800 atm respectively the incredibly enhanced temperature and pressure occurred in collapsing cavitation bubbles zone in the solution triggers the thermal rupture of water molecules into highly reactive oh and h radicals and some other species and radicals such as ooh o atoms o2 and h2o 17 furthermore it has been reflected that the combination of catalysts along with the ultrasonic irradiation method attained much higher destruction rate and provided less time of reaction in comparison with just sonication 18 19 in accordance with that the zeolites have known as the aluminosilicate molecular sieves crystals including similar molecular size pores 20 these porous materials with the spectacular structural properties such as extensive pore volume vast surface area interconnected cavities and channels of molecular size have been unlimitedly used in several fields and for various purposes namely in agriculture nuclear medicine and biogas industries 21 and moreover as membrane in numerous membrane procedures 22 as adsorbents in separation and purification procedures 23 and as promising catalysts for the synthesize of the advanced applying materials 24 25 among several types of zeolites 13x is one of the most advantageous zeolites attributed to the faujasite fau family the linkage of sodalite cages via double 6 member ring d6r creates its framework which leads to the emersion of egregious pore diameter of 0 74 nm 26 plus it should be emphasized that the high content of aluminum of 13x structure makes it idealistic adsorbent for varied polar molecules 27 from the other point of view metal organic frameworks mofs have been the center of many attentions in recent years due to their significant physical and chemical characteristics for instance surface features pore size distribution and chemical performance 28 mofs represent large ordered and available pores and therefore they have been used in multiple research fields namely separation 29 30 drug delivery 31 gas storage processes 32 and catalysis 33 34 furthermore the chemical and physical characteristics and the pore diameters of mofs can be altered by using several linker molecules and various functionalities can be exerted by performing the appropriate modifications 28 among various sorts of mofs cr mil 101 displays a strong crystal building with two sorts of spherical like cages confined by 12 pentagonal forms and 16 forms 4 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal with the pore sizes of nearly 29 and 34 Ã¥ besides when two water molecules are heated at 423 k in air it is causes the appearance of two coordinated unsaturated sites in cr iii octahedral cluster in cr mil 101 which play the role of lewis acid site or catalytic active site in organic transfiguration reactions 31 moreover the nanoparticles nps are another class of operative materials that should be added to what explained above nickel oxide nanoparticles nio nps are counted as a class of promising nanomaterials 35 39 in fact nio is known as a p type semiconductor having band gap energy of 3 6 4 0 ev and it is thermally and chemically stable which is a vantage point for this material nio nps have been exerted in multiple applications for example lithium ion batteries catalysts procedures solar cells plates electrochemical bio sensors and light emitting diodes 40 44 in current research the novel nanocomposite catalyst of cr mil 101 metal organic framework mof over the nio 13x zeolite was synthesized through incorporation route and further applied for the sonodestruction of methylene blue mb rhodamine b rhb and methyl orange mo dyes in aqueous media using h2o2 as oh radicals source 2 experimental 2 1 materials nickel ii nitrate hexahydrate ni no3 2

c28h31cln2o3 rhb 98 were all of standard quality and purchased from merck and sigma aldrich also deionized water was used wherever was needed throughout the considered experiments 2 2 instrumentation to enlight all of the corners and complexities of the synthesized samples and to investigate all those properties in one which is the final nanocomposite several analytical techniques were planned and operated sequentially in this regard to observe the surface properties and details for instance the expected functional groups and the probable conversions during or after variant modification steps a schimadzu system ftir 160 spectrophotometer 400 to 4000 cm 1 of wavelength range with kbr pellets was employed and the resulted spectra were displayed and discussed in detail furthermore operating a stoe diffractometer with cuk Î± radiation at wavelength of 1 54056 Ã¥ 40 kv and 40 ma at 25 1 c the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns were acquired and the related results were recorded over the range of 2 91 in 2Î¸ with a scanning speed of 2 min 1 exploring the morphology and elemental features of the pre synthesized catalysts a field emission scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fesem edax and x ray dot mapping on a mira3 tescan scanning electron microscope assisted with an energy dispersive x ray were operated and the observations were reflected with the relevant explanation elsewhere the atomic force microscope afm of noncontact mode ara afm model full plus was applied and the experiments were carried out at 25 1 c in addition an ultrasonic apparatus sonic 6mx frequency of 37 khz and 100 w output acoustic power was used to prepare the catalysts and to investigate the destruction reactions progression also to provide the optical absorption spectrum of the prepared homogeneous suspension an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer cary 100 varian company in the wavelength range of 200 nm 800 nm was employed 2 3 synthesis of 13x zeolite for the synthesis of 13x zeolite by using a hydrothermal route the amount of 4 2 g of al oh 3 was added and dissolved into 8 4 ml of naoh aqueous solution with 50 w v at temperature of 100 c next 8 5 ml of deionized water was introduced to the prepared solution afterwards 15 1 g of naoh was added into this suspension and beside 60 ml of deionized water was poured in and heated at 50 c solution a elsewhere 45 2 g of na2sio3 was dissolved into a mixture of 250 ml deionized water and 15 2 g of naoh solution b those two previously implied solutions solutions a and b were mixed suddenly and the conclusive solution was exposed to the temperature of 70 c in an oven the ultimate powder substance was washed by deionized water and then dried at 80 c 45 2 4 synthesis of nio nanoparticles as specified before the nio nanoparticles were hydrothermally synthesized and then used for other stages of ulterior experiments leading to attain the ultimate nanocomposite material for this goal the amount of 0 5 g of ni no3 2 6h2o was poured into 100 ml of deionized water and the solution was intensely agitated for 1 h at room temperature 25 1 c when the stirring process was fully fulfilled for definite time the suspension was undergone filtration and pursuant washing by deionized water and then exposed to the temperature of 110 c for nightlong to gain a dried product the final attained nanoparticles were calcined at 550 c for 4 h 2 5 synthesis of cr mil 101 metal organic framework for the synthesis of cr mil 101 metal organic framework through the hydrothermal method at first 2 4 g of cr no3 3 9h2o and 0 98 g of h2bdc were added into a container including 29 ml of deionized water and the prepared solution was then intensely stirred at 40 c for 30 min next the mixture was introduced into a 50 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 c for overnight and when the heat treatment process was completed the solution was abandoned to lose the temperature to 25 1 c the room temperature when the temperature was descended to the noted point the envisaged green powder appeared to attain the extra purified product which is implying to the higher quality of cristallinity and porosity the acquired powder was washed with ethanol and dmf for multiple times the assigned purification stage wards off the unreacted h2bdc and the rest of impurities from the synthesized samples consequently the gained cr mil 101 was undergone heat treatment to be dried at 150 c for 12 h 2 6 synthesis of nio 13x zeolite nanocomposite to synthesize the nio 13x zeolite nanocomposite 0 5 g of nio nps was added into 100 ml of deionized water and the solution was treated by ultrasonic waves for 1 h then 2 g of the previously synthesized 13x zeolite was added to the solution and this mixture was rigorously shaken for 12 h as a matter of fact the shaking stage is undeniably necessary for this point of preparation as it causes nio nps to be dispersed all over the solution and deposited on the 13x zeolite the treated mixture was filtered and subsequently dried at 110 c for overnight and the resulted nanocomposite was placed in a furnace and undergone calcination at 500 c for 5 h 2 7 synthesis of cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite the cr mil 101 nio 13x zeolite nanocomposite was synthesized via an incorporation method first 0 5 g of the pre synthesized cr mil 101 metal organic framework was added to a container including 50 ml of deionized water and the solution exposed to the ultrasonic waves sonication for 10 min at room temperature 25 1 c then 1 5 g of nio 13x was introduced to the solution and generally immersed in the cited dispersion solution for about 6 h so that the particles had enough opportunity to accommodate and settle down into the porous spots of the structures ultimately the concluded sample was separated from the treated solution and dried at room temperature 25 1 c the cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite as the final product was calcined at 200 c for 24 h 2 8 batch experiments of organic dyes sonodestruction an ultrasonic aparatus was exerted for the investigation of the sonocatalytic destructive effects on the understudy mb rhb and mo dyes presented on the prepared catalysts in aqueous media initially 0 5 g l of cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite catalyst was poured into 50 ml of mb solution 25 mg l and this prepared solution was then stirred for 80 min in the dark this shaking stage leads to an effective interaction between catalyst and organic dye target which is inferred as adsorption desorption equilibrium between those two main components of the reaction afterwards it was exposed to the ultrasonic irradiation accompanied by h2o2 40 mmol l 2 ml after the specified reaction time of 80 min 2 ml of the treated solution was sampled and immediately centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to separate the nanocomposite sonocatalyst from the solution ultimately the supernatant was introduced to the uv vis device at wavelength of 664 nm for the determination of the remained mb dye additionally the effects of the other influential factors namely sonocatalyst type bare 13x nio 13x and cr mil 101 nio 13x sonocatalyst amount 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 mg l initial dye concentration 25 35 45 55 mg l the concentration of h2o2 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 mmol l and the time of reaction 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 min on the sonocatalytic performance of the cr mil 101 nio 13x catalyst were precisely investigated furthermore to evaluate the sonocatalytic destruction potential of the cr mil 101 nio 13x catalyst towards rhodamine b rhb and methyl orange mo in aqueous solution the same experiments with similar conditions pursuant to what explained above were accomplished and the collected results were reflected in this study 3 result and discussion 3 1 ftir in order to cover all possible aspects of the fabricated samples and to represent more comprehensive information regarding to their different characteristics the fourier transform infrared ftir technique was also applied and the collected results were meticulously discussed the corresponded spectra of the bare 13x fig 1 a nio 13x fig 1b cr mil 101 nio 13x fig 1c bare cr mil 101 fig 1d and bare nio nps fig 1e have been demonstrated in fig 1 based on the collected information from the ftir spectra it is proved that the certain peaks attributed to the 13x zeolite in the above cited three different samples emerge around the expected characteristic point this fact shows that the structure of the used 13x zeolite in those samples remained significantly undamaged after the processing stages further the observed peaks around 3419 cm 1 and 1629 cm 1 are referred to the vibrations of hydroxyl group oh bonding and hoh bending and also disassociated h2o absorption bonds in the 13x respectively moreover the peaks near 974 cm 1 is caused by oto external connection and internal tetrahedral asymmetrical stretching vibrations of the 13x zeolite on the other hand the emerged peaks near 752 cm 1 and 681 cm 1 are affiliated to the oto internal tetrahedral symmetrical stretching and external linkage vibrations respectively besides the peaks at round 557 cm 1 and 459 cm 1 are assigned to the bending vibrations of the double six rings d6r external linkage and the internal alo4 or sio4 tetrahedral units of 13x zeolite respectively 45 46 it is also notable that by performing a comparison between fig 1a and c no disfiguration or destructive change on the 13x zeolite framework or its chemical structure toward cr mil 101 nio 13x was spotted after the loading of nio nps and cr mil 101 the characteristic band corresponded to the niosi and or nioal of nio nps expected below 1000 cm 1 was not observed due to the overlapping with the bands related to the 13x zeolite the other peak at 1390 cm 1 which has been depicted in fig 1c is related to the carboxylate oco bond in terephthalic acid h2bdc caused by the immobilized cr mil 101 in the nanocomposite structure also bare cr mil 101 was separately analyzed via ftir as the corresponded spectrum has been displayed in fig 1d considering the collected data it is inferred that the formed peaks at 1402 cm 1 and 1622 cm 1 and 1664 cm 1 are originated from the carboxylate oco symmetric stretching vibration in h2bdc and plus the asymmetric stretching vibrations respectively additionally several appeared peaks at 1510 cm 1 11561 cm 1 1018 cm 1 885 cm 1 and 750 cm 1 are respectively attributed to the cc and ch bonds 47 fig 1e represents the spectrum of the bare nio nps meanwhile the formed broad absorption peaks around 3484 cm 1 and 1595 cm 1 are assigned to the adsorbed water molecules also it is notable that an emerged peak at 423 cm 1 is caused by the stretching vibrations of nio bonding 3 2 xrd all of the prepared samples were explored via the xrd analysis and the relevant patterns of the bare 13x fig 2 a nio 13x fig 2b cr mil 101 nio 13x fig 2c bare cr mil 101 fig 2d and bare nio nps fig 2e respectively depicted in fig 2 delving into the cited patterns the narrow sharp peaks at 2Î¸ angles of 6 0053 10 0009 11 6238 15 4370 18 2356 20 0073 23 4588 27 1569 29 4604 30 0928 31 0955 32 2107 and 33 3598 fig 1a respectively assigned to the miller indices of 111 220 311 331 511 440 620 533 622 642 731 733 and 660 are attributed to the 13x zeolite in fact it is acknowledged that the above mentioned values are in good consistency with those of 13x zeolite with icdd 00 041 0118 elsewhere several spotted narrow peaks at 2Î¸ angles 2 to 20 are affiliated to the bare cr mil 101 fig 2d illuminating the crystalline characteristic of the synthesized material according to fig 6e the immobilization of nio nps and cr mil 101 on the 13x zeolite causing the emersion of cr mil 101 nio 13x had no sensible negative influence on its framework hence three sharp peaks spotted at 2Î¸ angles of 2 0006 4 1052 9 0031 are attributed to the cr mil 101 five more emerged peaks at 2Î¸ angles of 37 2330 43 2727 62 8672 75 4360 and 79 3467 respectively affiliated to the miller indices of 111 200 220 311 and 222 are referred to the nio nps with icdd 01 1464 it is also emphasized that no characteristic peak exhibiting the existence of any impurity related to the immobilization process of cr mil 101 and nio nps species was spotted in the acquired xrd patterns meanwhile the size calculation of the synthesized nio nps accommodated on the 13x zeolite was carried out by applying the xrd analysis and also the line broadening of the peak at 2Î¸ 2 91 as measured using the debye scherrer eq 1 1 d 0 9 Î» Î² c o s Î¸ in the above cited equation d symbolizes the crystalline size Î» indicates the wavelength of cuk Î± radiation Î² represents the full width at half maximum fwhm of the definite diffraction peak and Î¸ is known as bragg diffraction angle employing the above noted equation the average size of 18 3 nm was calculated for the nio nps in the cr mil 101 nio 13x structure a simple comparison between xrd and fesem results clearly proved the good compatibility of the obtained average particle sizes from both characterization techniques 3 3 fesem the field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem was operated to provide an overview of morphology and crystalline properties of each of the prepared materials including bare 13x fig 3 a and 3b nio 13x fig 3c and d cr mil 101 nio 13x fig 3e and f bare cr mil 101 fig 3g and bare nio nps fig 3h and i and the related information was respectively illustrated in fig 3 looking crossly to the fesem micrographs the sphere like shapes of the nio nps the octahedral configuration of cr mil 101 and plus homogenous structure of the synthesized 13x were all undoubtedly verified according to the acquired details and precise observations the extensive immobilization of the cr mil 101 and nio nps on the 13x zeolite is irrevocably confirmed in addition fesem micrographs elucidated the fact that the performed loading process caused no noticeable negative variation on the crystalline or morphology specifications of 13x nio nps and cr mil 101 besides based on the estimation the average crystalline size of around 18 nm was indicated for nio nps in the synthesized cr mil 101 nio 13x composite 3 4 afm the atomic force microscopy afm analysis was also operated to monitor various structural characteristics of the prepared samples and to provide a better understanding of deeper prospects of the surface topography in this regard the attained afm micrographs 2d and 3d attributed to the bare 13x fig 4 a nio 13x fig 4b cr mil 101 nio 13x fig 4c and bare nio nps fig 4d have been shown in fig 4 it is of great significance to mention that by the evaluation of the above noted fig 4b and c two facts can be corroborated including first the successful formation of porous cr mil 101 nio 13x and second the appropriate size in nano scale of the synthesized nanocomposite which is in good agreement with that of fesem and xrd analysis 3 5 edax and edax elemental dot mapping to study the elemental composition of the synthesized bare 13x fig 5 a nio 13x fig 5b cr mil 101 nio 13x fig 5c and bare cr mil 101 fig 5d the energy dispersive x ray edax was exerted and the affiliated results were shown in fig 5 in fact the gathered information from edax characterization technique revealed the presence of al o na and si in the bare 13x nio 13x and cr mil 101 nio 13x which was previously clarified by fesem from the other point of view eight observed peaks in fig 5c unquestionably demonstrate the presence of ni cr c and o in the framework of cr mil 101 nio 13 moreover the obtained results proved the existence of nio in the fabricated structure the fesem micrographs of the cr mil 101 nio 13x accompanied by the corresponded edax elemental dot mappings have been reflected in fig 6 it is also noteworthy that the brighter areas in the elemental map show the higher concentrations of the specified element and beside to indicate several elements with their locations in nanomaterials variant colors were applied in each case surveying the elemental mappings and the distributions depicted in fig 6 the presence of elements namely na si al o ni cr and c is vividly acknowledged indeed the investigation of the obtained maps encourages the remarkable distribution of those elements over the cr mil 101 nio 13x which is implying the homogeneity of the understudy synthesized nanocomposite 3 6 evaluation of organic dyes sonodestruction reaction 3 6 1 effect of contact time in order to indicate the optimized reaction time for the sonodestruction of those previously cited dyes on the cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite structure and to reach the highest rate of destruction in a specific duration several time intervals were separately selected and the attained results studied to identify the most effective time of reaction the evaluation of the information obtained from those sequential experiments brightly expressed the coherency between the destruction rate and various time intervals therefore the investigation of the sonodestruction evolution was performed using the definite absorption band assigned to mb dye at maximum wavelength Î»max of nearly 664 nm in order to that initially 0 5 g l of cr mil 101 nio 13x structure was poured into 50 ml of mb in aqueous solution initial ph 7 with the concentration of 25 mg l and afterwards this suspension was consequently undergone the ultrasonic us irradiation accompanied by 40 mmol l of h2o2 the differences among the resulted uv vis spectra attributed to the mb dye over the cr mil 101 nio 13x elucidating the significance dependency of destruction towards the time of reaction have been respectively demonstrated in fig 7 a c according to the provided figures it is interpreted that as time passes the intensity of the characteristic peak affiliated to mb occurred at 664 nm decreases consecutively until the point 80 min at which the cited peak becomes almost invisible implying the highest destruction of 97 26 for mb based on the collected results and precise analysis the substantial visible light sonodestruction performance of the cr mil 101 nio 13x structure for the destruction of mb dye is strongly corroborated by the accomplished sonocatalytic experiments moreover the destruction yield percentage dy of sonodestruction was calculated using the eq 2 2 d y c 0 c t c 0 100 a 0 a t a 0 100 in the above mentioned equation c0 a0 and ct at in mg l respectively symbolize the concentrations of the understudy destructed mb dye in the initial and processed solutions after time t in min 3 6 2 sonodestruction kinetics investigation the sonodestruction reaction kinetics was also surveyed employing the curves of ln initial dye concentration against contact time min as it has been depicted in fig 7c further applying the first order equation of ln co ct kt the destruction rate constant k min 1 was calculated in the cited equation co represents the initial dye concentration ct symbolizes the dye concentration at time t and k is defined as the destruction rate constant meantime using the equation of t1 2 ln2 k the half life t1 2 value was measured in order to indicate the considered adsorption kinetics 0 5 g l of cr mil 101 nio 13x was poured into separated containers each including 25 mg l of the dye at definite time intervals and the obtained results have been represented in table 1 3 6 3 effect of the initial concentration of mb dye the evaluation and indication of the initial dye concentration and also its subsequent impact on the sonocatalytic reaction is of great importance it clarifies the practical capability of a certain amount of the synthesized nanocomposite for the destruction of increasing concentration of the organic dye hence a number of experiments was planned and carried out with a certain amount of cr mil 101 nio 13x versus various initial concentrations of the understudy organic dye as can be observed in fig 8 the enhancement of dye concentration from 25 to 55 mg l caused an undesirable effect on the destruction efficiency of the organic dye as it descended from 97 26 to 44 2 the explained phenomenon is referred to the unbalanced quantities of the nanocomposite catalyst presented in the solution toward the dye molecules concentration it is deduced that when the dosage of target molecules goes higher more active sites on the nanocomposite catalyst are occupied and eventually the absence of those recipient sites and plus hydroxyl radicals resulted from hydrogen peroxide becomes undeniably sensible based on the above provided explanation as the initial concentration of dye was incessantly increasing the dosage of the nanocomposite catalyst hydrogen peroxide and its affiliated hydroxyl radicals at the certain irradiation time kept constant and this lack of balance among the proportions of the reaction weakened the catalyst and caused descended destruction efficiency 3 6 4 effect of organic dye type to investigate the capability of the sonocatalytic system associated with the cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite the destruction procedure was performed for two other organic dyes of rhb and mo in aqueous media referring to the gathered results and as has been demonstrated from fig 9 the destruction efficiencies of mo Î»max 463 nm and rhb Î»max 554 were indicated as 85 14 and 94 3 in 100 min and 80 min respectively the gained information showed the fact that the differences in various types of employed organic dyes such as molecule sizes chemical compositions electric charges caused little variations in the performance of the sonocatalyst in the sonocatalytic destruction process 3 6 5 effect of h2o2 concentration the particular function of hydroxyl radicals divided from the hydrogen peroxide in the destruction process of organic dyes is irrefutable therefore to figure out the optimized concentration for h2o2 as the major source of oh in the solution is of great significance in order to indicate the most operative concentration of h2o2 for the destruction of mb in cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 six diverse experiments were planned and carried out each representing different concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 mmol l according to the results as demonstrated in fig 10 using 5 and 10 mmol l of h2o2 the destruction efficiency of 44 81 and 55 49 in 80 min were obtained respectively on the other hand the enhancement in the concentration of h2o2 to 20 40 mmol l through those specified consecutive sonodestruction experiments caused noticeable increase in the destruction efficiency of mb from 64 12 to 97 26 in 80 min the illustrated observation reveals the incontrovertible dependency between the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and its ulterior derivative hydroxyl radical and the destruction efficiency in addition extra increase in the concentration of h2o2 40 mmol l showed a continual diminution in the destruction efficiency and this is attributed to the excessive values of h2o2 which act as oh scavenger to produce perhydroxyl hoo radicals with lesser oxidation capability therefore the hydrogen peroxide with the optimized concentration of 40 mmol l was considered for subsequent destruction reactions 3 6 6 effect of process type from another point of view the reliability and functionality of each component of the reaction was examined by operating a series of inductive experiments on destruction of mb dye with us us h2o2 13x us h2o2 nio 13x us h2o2 cr mil 101 nio 13x h2o2 cr mil 101 nio 13x us and cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 systems and the related results were illustrated in fig 7 and table 1 also the initial concentration of 25 mg l for mb dye was selected for all of the above cited experiments the relevant results gathered from those designed experiments regarding to the destruction of mb include us only 8 86 us h2o2 32 88 13x us h2o2 37 89 cr mil 101 nio 13x h2o2 51 11 nio 13x us h2o2 62 10 cr mil 101 nio 13x us 97 26 cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 with constant quantities of 0 0323 0 0119 0 0096 0 0063 0 0048 0 0011 and 2 10 6 min 1 respectively ultimately the most effective outcome for the destruction of mb dye was attained using cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 system which is presumably affiliated to the hindering of the electron hole association through the linkage among 13x zeolite cr mil 101 and nio the collected information clarifies that all of the above mentioned components including cr mil 101 nio 13x us and h2o2 are necessary to achieve the highest yield of destruction of mb dye in aqueous solution 3 6 7 effect of scavenger type in order to determine the major species which are functioning as substantial active oxidants in the destruction reactions multiple designed experiments were fulfilled fig 11 explains that the addition of 20 mmol l of tert butyl alcohol t buoh and isopropyl alcohol ipa as oh scavenger to the solution consisting of 25 mg l of mb and 0 5 g l of the nanocomposite catalyst led to a tangible decrease of 40 in the destruction efficiency after 80 min of irradiation this observed sudden diminution clearly proves the primary role of oh as an essential oxidant in the applied sonocatalytic process elsewhere when the ammonium oxalate ao was added to the working solution as the hole scavenger a negligible decrease in the destruction efficiency of mb perceived based on the attained information it is inferred that the mentioned holes exhibit inconsiderable role as both oh origins and oxidizing agents 3 6 8 effect of catalyst amount since finding the optimized concentration of the synthesized sonocatalyst to reach a high yield destruction of the understudy organic dye is known as a milestone of the research a series of experiments with various amounts of cr mil 101 nio 13x ranging from 0 25 to 1 0 g l were implemented and the corresponded results were depicted in fig 12 hence the concentrations of the other components of the reaction including the organic dye 25 mg l and hydrogen peroxide 40 mmol l remained constant throughout several designed experiments in 80 min in this regard as the dosage of the synthesized sonocatalyst was increased the destruction efficiency ascended till the concentration of 0 5 g l after which it converted to a gradual decrease it is deduced that the affluent active sites associated with hydroxyl radicals on the cr mil 101 nio 13x lead to an ongoing increase in the destruction efficiency however the above spotted diminution for the concentrations higher than 0 5 g l is corresponded to the accumulation of the sonocatalyst affiliated nanoparticles as they probably lessen the quantity and distribution of the active sites and weaken the ultrasonic scattering by impeding the ultrasonic wave transmission into the processing solution finally the concentration of 0 5 g l was selected and applied as the optimized amount of the sonocatalyst for subsequent experiments 3 6 9 reproducibility and stability of the cr mil 101 nio 13x to study the reproducibility of the synthesized nanocomposite the used cr mil 101 nio 13x was immersed in an ethanol water solution with 1 1 v v ratio and pursuantly stirred for 20 min this washing process causes the mb molecules dissociation from the nanocomposite catalyst then the regenerated catalyst was dried and frequently used for several consecutive destruction cycles as a matter of fact after the first cycle of destruction a trivial decrease in the recovery of the cr mil 101 nio 13x was detected nevertheless the destruction efficiency for those above specified repetitious cycles remained sensibly high which is confirming the reliability and applicability of the fabricated nanocomposite catalyst for multiple destruction cycles as it has been described in fig 13 the regeneration process was implemented for four times and using the recovered sonocatalyst the destruction efficiencies higher than 92 achieved for those understudy cycles in order to provide a comprehensive comparison between the recovered and the fresh nanocomposite catalyst and to detect any probable characteristic variations ftir edax and fesem affiliated dot mapping were operated according to fig 14 a c the ftir analysis was applied to evaluate the recovered cr mil 101 nio 13x after the fourth cycle fig 14a the ftir corresponded results proved that there was no substantial change between the fresh and the recovered sonocatalyst moreover using the edax analysis the characteristic peaks of na si al o ni cr and c related to the recovered cr mil 101 nio 13x after the fourth cycle were acquired and depicted in fig 14b additionally the fesem affiliated dot mapping analysis fig 14c for the recovered sonocatalyst after the fourth cycle displayed no considerable distortion or destructive change in the framework of cr mil 101 nio 13x compared with the fresh one 3 6 10 the comparative study of the cr mil 101 nio 13x and the other reported catalysts to provide a bright and comprehensive view of the destruction potentials and applicability of the synthesized catalyst versus some other customarily used sono and photocatalysts in the removal destruction of the organic dyes the results containing the influential parameters for each case were gathered and precisely compared as can be observed in table 2 48 56 considering the results the superiority of the novel cr mil 101 nio 13x sonocatalyst nanocomposite against those mentioned catalysts is explicitly unveiled 3 6 11 suggested mechanism of the sonodestruction reaction as it has been well known the ultrasonic cavitation causes the occurrence of both light and hot heat spots assigned to the conditions like high temperature and pressure therefore the probable suggested mechanism for the sonocatalytic destruction of the considered organic dyes can be described by those two primary factors from another point of view the hydroxyl radicals are likely to form by the pyrolysis of water molecules under the special condition besides there is a phenomenon named sonoluminescence attributed to the ultrasonic cavitation which creates the light with a wide wavelength range when nio and cr mil 101 become exited by the created light with the relevant wavelength the sonogenerated electrons and plus the excited holes appear those produced excited electrons which are present in the conduction band cb of nio are able to migrate easily to the cb of cr mil 101 meantime the cited sonogenerated holes in the valence band vb of cr mil 101 simply migrate to the vb of nio the inverse motions of the sonogenerated electrons and holes rebate the possible accumulation and further raise the charge separation rate which leads to remarkably higher sonocatalytic performance also the sonogenerated electrons migrate toward the surface area of the synthesized nanocomposite catalyst where the operative electron receptors are located moreover the zeolites here emphasizing on 13x do not count as relevant absorbers of light in uv vis range and this well known feature turns them to appropriate supports for sonocatalysis as cited before due to the simple movements of the sonogenerated electrons of nio and cr mil 101 eventually they reach to the 13x zeolite the situated electrons on the surface area of cr mil 101 nio 13x respond to the hydrogen peroxide from the solution which causes the appearance of the hydroxyl radicals oha meanwhile the adsorbed h2o2 molecules initiate the scavenging process of the holes oh h2o to generate the reactive hydroxyl radicals ohb ultimately the produced oxidizers interact with the entrapped dye molecules on the cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite and this phenomenon implies to the electrostatic interaction leading to the formation of co2 h2o and some other species such as so4 2 no3 etc as the mineralization products eqs 3 11 also the above described process has been summarized and shown as a schematic mechanism in fig 15 3 ultrasonic irradiation cavitation effect heat light 4 nio heat or light nio 5 nio nio h vb nio e cb 6 nio e cb cr mil 101 nio cr mil 101

co2 h2o so4 2 no3 etc 4 conclusion the current research focuses on the synthesis and application of a novel cr mil 101 nio 13x sonocatalyst the mentioned sonocatalyst was synthesized by the incorporation method and pursuantly exerted for the destruction of three types of organic dyes in aqueous solution in existence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 various characterization techniques were employed and the obtained results verified the great applicability of the fabricated cr mil 101 nio 13x for high yield sonodestruction of the punctuated organic dyes furthermore multiple factors including contact time initial dye concentration catalyst amount h2o2 concentration scavenger type and process type were meticulously evaluated and optimized for the ulterior experiments it is acknowledged that using the uv vis analysis the maximum destruction efficiency of 97 26 was detected for cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 system comparing to the other previously specified components or systems in addition the observations revealed a tangible decline in the efficiency from 97 26 to 44 2 after the concentration of the understudy dye enhanced from 25 to 55 mg l besides based on the accomplished evaluations the optimized concentrations of catalyst hydrogen peroxide and organic dye to achieve the maximum destruction efficiency were 0 5 g l 40 mmol l and 25 mg l respectively elsewhere the gathered results indicated the destruction efficiencies of 85 14 and 94 3 for mo and rhb respectively the investigations on the radical scavengers functioning in the designed systems confirmed the outstanding performance of h2o2 generated oh in the sonochemical destruction of organic dye molecules in consequence it is stressed that the synthesized sonocatalyst shows considerable potentials for the significant destruction of dyes from aqueous media thereupon its particular performance for the destruction of further organic pollutants from the aqueous media can be examined in subsequent research studies acknowledgment the authors are greatly thankful for all of the sincere supports of lorestan university khorramabad iran 
14257,the present research focuses on the fabrication and application of the cr mil 101 nio 13x as a novel sonocatalyst nanocomposite the characterization study of the prepared samples was carried out by employing techniques including ftir xrd fesem afm edax and x ray dot mapping the fabricated nanocomposite was applied for the sonodestruction of organic dyes in the aqueous media all of the dependent reactions were performed under the optimized conditions following by the uv vis analysis to monitor the destruction progress the extent of sonocatalytic potency of the cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite was investigated versus the h2o2 associated destruction of methylene blue mb rhodamine b rhb and methyl orange mo as prevalent organic dyes under the ultrasonic irradiation in addition several influential parameters such as contact time initial dye concentration catalyst amount h2o2 concentration scavenger type and process type and their impact on the destruction of the mb rhb and mo were evaluated also employing the first order model the reaction kinetic was surveyed the values of 0 0323 min 1 and 21 4551 min were attained for the rate constant k and the half life t1 2 for the destruction of mb in the cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 system moreover considering the gathered details the significant performance of oh as a radical scavenger emanated from h2o2 during sonocatalytic destruction procedure is vividly proved besides to challenge the destruction potential of the new nanocomposite and to show the effective combination of its components the sonocatalytic function of the bare 13x and nio 13x were studied under the equivalent conditions and the subsequent results were precisely reported keywords cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite sonodestruction organic dyes kinetic 1 introduction the progressive growth of the world population along with the development of numerous industrial units and the subsequent waste materials originated from such activities is known as a serious threat to the environment therefore it has always been a concerning matter for many research teams and environmental protection organizations around the globe to find more applicable methods and materials to comprehensively confront the mentioned issue in this regard one important issue that could be included in the above specified subjects is the release of huge volumes of dyes into the environment by some industrial facilities the synthetic dyes are widely utilized in numerous fields of industry for instance textile and leather tanning units paper production process food processing petrochemical cells pharmaceutical and cosmetic units agricultural and wastewater treatments researches 1 also it has been reflected that there are more than 10 000 types of diverse dyes and pigments and an enormous value of 7 105 tons of them are manufactured annually on the other hand a considerable amount of these dyes discharge to the wastewater system not only during the production process but also by the ulterior industries that use these dyes to produce other commodities 2 3 thereupon considering the entrance of large values of dye contaminated wastewaters to the environment and the serious threat of severe obnoxious toxic effects like mutagenic and carcinogenic role on both aquatic biota and human beings which has been verified by the medicine science it is perceived as a substantial issue to remove this sort of contamination from water systems to the least amount possible 4 recently a number of biological and physicochemical procedures have been suggested and applied for the removal degradation of organic dye pollutants and also to diminish the related toxicity including biodegradation 5 electrochemical degradation 6 photocatalytic degradation 7 10 catalytic degradation 11 adsorption 12 13 membrane filtration 14 and ultrasonic wave 15 in recent years the application of ultrasonic irradiation for the destruction of organic contamination has been become extensively popular probably because of the emersion of remarkable values of hydroxyl radicals oh produced from the ultrasonic cavitation phenomenon 16 in brief when the ultrasonic waves are introduced to the liquid the rapid growth and subsequent collapse of the pre formed cavitation bubbles happens this implosion of cavitation bubbles causes the extremely increased temperature and pressure of approximately 5000 k and 1800 atm respectively the incredibly enhanced temperature and pressure occurred in collapsing cavitation bubbles zone in the solution triggers the thermal rupture of water molecules into highly reactive oh and h radicals and some other species and radicals such as ooh o atoms o2 and h2o 17 furthermore it has been reflected that the combination of catalysts along with the ultrasonic irradiation method attained much higher destruction rate and provided less time of reaction in comparison with just sonication 18 19 in accordance with that the zeolites have known as the aluminosilicate molecular sieves crystals including similar molecular size pores 20 these porous materials with the spectacular structural properties such as extensive pore volume vast surface area interconnected cavities and channels of molecular size have been unlimitedly used in several fields and for various purposes namely in agriculture nuclear medicine and biogas industries 21 and moreover as membrane in numerous membrane procedures 22 as adsorbents in separation and purification procedures 23 and as promising catalysts for the synthesize of the advanced applying materials 24 25 among several types of zeolites 13x is one of the most advantageous zeolites attributed to the faujasite fau family the linkage of sodalite cages via double 6 member ring d6r creates its framework which leads to the emersion of egregious pore diameter of 0 74 nm 26 plus it should be emphasized that the high content of aluminum of 13x structure makes it idealistic adsorbent for varied polar molecules 27 from the other point of view metal organic frameworks mofs have been the center of many attentions in recent years due to their significant physical and chemical characteristics for instance surface features pore size distribution and chemical performance 28 mofs represent large ordered and available pores and therefore they have been used in multiple research fields namely separation 29 30 drug delivery 31 gas storage processes 32 and catalysis 33 34 furthermore the chemical and physical characteristics and the pore diameters of mofs can be altered by using several linker molecules and various functionalities can be exerted by performing the appropriate modifications 28 among various sorts of mofs cr mil 101 displays a strong crystal building with two sorts of spherical like cages confined by 12 pentagonal forms and 16 forms 4 hexagonal and 12 pentagonal with the pore sizes of nearly 29 and 34 Ã¥ besides when two water molecules are heated at 423 k in air it is causes the appearance of two coordinated unsaturated sites in cr iii octahedral cluster in cr mil 101 which play the role of lewis acid site or catalytic active site in organic transfiguration reactions 31 moreover the nanoparticles nps are another class of operative materials that should be added to what explained above nickel oxide nanoparticles nio nps are counted as a class of promising nanomaterials 35 39 in fact nio is known as a p type semiconductor having band gap energy of 3 6 4 0 ev and it is thermally and chemically stable which is a vantage point for this material nio nps have been exerted in multiple applications for example lithium ion batteries catalysts procedures solar cells plates electrochemical bio sensors and light emitting diodes 40 44 in current research the novel nanocomposite catalyst of cr mil 101 metal organic framework mof over the nio 13x zeolite was synthesized through incorporation route and further applied for the sonodestruction of methylene blue mb rhodamine b rhb and methyl orange mo dyes in aqueous media using h2o2 as oh radicals source 2 experimental 2 1 materials nickel ii nitrate hexahydrate ni no3 2

c28h31cln2o3 rhb 98 were all of standard quality and purchased from merck and sigma aldrich also deionized water was used wherever was needed throughout the considered experiments 2 2 instrumentation to enlight all of the corners and complexities of the synthesized samples and to investigate all those properties in one which is the final nanocomposite several analytical techniques were planned and operated sequentially in this regard to observe the surface properties and details for instance the expected functional groups and the probable conversions during or after variant modification steps a schimadzu system ftir 160 spectrophotometer 400 to 4000 cm 1 of wavelength range with kbr pellets was employed and the resulted spectra were displayed and discussed in detail furthermore operating a stoe diffractometer with cuk Î± radiation at wavelength of 1 54056 Ã¥ 40 kv and 40 ma at 25 1 c the powder x ray diffraction xrd patterns were acquired and the related results were recorded over the range of 2 91 in 2Î¸ with a scanning speed of 2 min 1 exploring the morphology and elemental features of the pre synthesized catalysts a field emission scanning electron microscopy energy dispersive x ray spectroscopy fesem edax and x ray dot mapping on a mira3 tescan scanning electron microscope assisted with an energy dispersive x ray were operated and the observations were reflected with the relevant explanation elsewhere the atomic force microscope afm of noncontact mode ara afm model full plus was applied and the experiments were carried out at 25 1 c in addition an ultrasonic apparatus sonic 6mx frequency of 37 khz and 100 w output acoustic power was used to prepare the catalysts and to investigate the destruction reactions progression also to provide the optical absorption spectrum of the prepared homogeneous suspension an ultraviolet visible uv vis spectrophotometer cary 100 varian company in the wavelength range of 200 nm 800 nm was employed 2 3 synthesis of 13x zeolite for the synthesis of 13x zeolite by using a hydrothermal route the amount of 4 2 g of al oh 3 was added and dissolved into 8 4 ml of naoh aqueous solution with 50 w v at temperature of 100 c next 8 5 ml of deionized water was introduced to the prepared solution afterwards 15 1 g of naoh was added into this suspension and beside 60 ml of deionized water was poured in and heated at 50 c solution a elsewhere 45 2 g of na2sio3 was dissolved into a mixture of 250 ml deionized water and 15 2 g of naoh solution b those two previously implied solutions solutions a and b were mixed suddenly and the conclusive solution was exposed to the temperature of 70 c in an oven the ultimate powder substance was washed by deionized water and then dried at 80 c 45 2 4 synthesis of nio nanoparticles as specified before the nio nanoparticles were hydrothermally synthesized and then used for other stages of ulterior experiments leading to attain the ultimate nanocomposite material for this goal the amount of 0 5 g of ni no3 2 6h2o was poured into 100 ml of deionized water and the solution was intensely agitated for 1 h at room temperature 25 1 c when the stirring process was fully fulfilled for definite time the suspension was undergone filtration and pursuant washing by deionized water and then exposed to the temperature of 110 c for nightlong to gain a dried product the final attained nanoparticles were calcined at 550 c for 4 h 2 5 synthesis of cr mil 101 metal organic framework for the synthesis of cr mil 101 metal organic framework through the hydrothermal method at first 2 4 g of cr no3 3 9h2o and 0 98 g of h2bdc were added into a container including 29 ml of deionized water and the prepared solution was then intensely stirred at 40 c for 30 min next the mixture was introduced into a 50 ml teflon lined stainless steel autoclave and heated at 200 c for overnight and when the heat treatment process was completed the solution was abandoned to lose the temperature to 25 1 c the room temperature when the temperature was descended to the noted point the envisaged green powder appeared to attain the extra purified product which is implying to the higher quality of cristallinity and porosity the acquired powder was washed with ethanol and dmf for multiple times the assigned purification stage wards off the unreacted h2bdc and the rest of impurities from the synthesized samples consequently the gained cr mil 101 was undergone heat treatment to be dried at 150 c for 12 h 2 6 synthesis of nio 13x zeolite nanocomposite to synthesize the nio 13x zeolite nanocomposite 0 5 g of nio nps was added into 100 ml of deionized water and the solution was treated by ultrasonic waves for 1 h then 2 g of the previously synthesized 13x zeolite was added to the solution and this mixture was rigorously shaken for 12 h as a matter of fact the shaking stage is undeniably necessary for this point of preparation as it causes nio nps to be dispersed all over the solution and deposited on the 13x zeolite the treated mixture was filtered and subsequently dried at 110 c for overnight and the resulted nanocomposite was placed in a furnace and undergone calcination at 500 c for 5 h 2 7 synthesis of cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite the cr mil 101 nio 13x zeolite nanocomposite was synthesized via an incorporation method first 0 5 g of the pre synthesized cr mil 101 metal organic framework was added to a container including 50 ml of deionized water and the solution exposed to the ultrasonic waves sonication for 10 min at room temperature 25 1 c then 1 5 g of nio 13x was introduced to the solution and generally immersed in the cited dispersion solution for about 6 h so that the particles had enough opportunity to accommodate and settle down into the porous spots of the structures ultimately the concluded sample was separated from the treated solution and dried at room temperature 25 1 c the cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite as the final product was calcined at 200 c for 24 h 2 8 batch experiments of organic dyes sonodestruction an ultrasonic aparatus was exerted for the investigation of the sonocatalytic destructive effects on the understudy mb rhb and mo dyes presented on the prepared catalysts in aqueous media initially 0 5 g l of cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite catalyst was poured into 50 ml of mb solution 25 mg l and this prepared solution was then stirred for 80 min in the dark this shaking stage leads to an effective interaction between catalyst and organic dye target which is inferred as adsorption desorption equilibrium between those two main components of the reaction afterwards it was exposed to the ultrasonic irradiation accompanied by h2o2 40 mmol l 2 ml after the specified reaction time of 80 min 2 ml of the treated solution was sampled and immediately centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 min to separate the nanocomposite sonocatalyst from the solution ultimately the supernatant was introduced to the uv vis device at wavelength of 664 nm for the determination of the remained mb dye additionally the effects of the other influential factors namely sonocatalyst type bare 13x nio 13x and cr mil 101 nio 13x sonocatalyst amount 0 25 0 5 0 75 and 1 0 mg l initial dye concentration 25 35 45 55 mg l the concentration of h2o2 5 10 20 30 40 and 50 mmol l and the time of reaction 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 and 80 min on the sonocatalytic performance of the cr mil 101 nio 13x catalyst were precisely investigated furthermore to evaluate the sonocatalytic destruction potential of the cr mil 101 nio 13x catalyst towards rhodamine b rhb and methyl orange mo in aqueous solution the same experiments with similar conditions pursuant to what explained above were accomplished and the collected results were reflected in this study 3 result and discussion 3 1 ftir in order to cover all possible aspects of the fabricated samples and to represent more comprehensive information regarding to their different characteristics the fourier transform infrared ftir technique was also applied and the collected results were meticulously discussed the corresponded spectra of the bare 13x fig 1 a nio 13x fig 1b cr mil 101 nio 13x fig 1c bare cr mil 101 fig 1d and bare nio nps fig 1e have been demonstrated in fig 1 based on the collected information from the ftir spectra it is proved that the certain peaks attributed to the 13x zeolite in the above cited three different samples emerge around the expected characteristic point this fact shows that the structure of the used 13x zeolite in those samples remained significantly undamaged after the processing stages further the observed peaks around 3419 cm 1 and 1629 cm 1 are referred to the vibrations of hydroxyl group oh bonding and hoh bending and also disassociated h2o absorption bonds in the 13x respectively moreover the peaks near 974 cm 1 is caused by oto external connection and internal tetrahedral asymmetrical stretching vibrations of the 13x zeolite on the other hand the emerged peaks near 752 cm 1 and 681 cm 1 are affiliated to the oto internal tetrahedral symmetrical stretching and external linkage vibrations respectively besides the peaks at round 557 cm 1 and 459 cm 1 are assigned to the bending vibrations of the double six rings d6r external linkage and the internal alo4 or sio4 tetrahedral units of 13x zeolite respectively 45 46 it is also notable that by performing a comparison between fig 1a and c no disfiguration or destructive change on the 13x zeolite framework or its chemical structure toward cr mil 101 nio 13x was spotted after the loading of nio nps and cr mil 101 the characteristic band corresponded to the niosi and or nioal of nio nps expected below 1000 cm 1 was not observed due to the overlapping with the bands related to the 13x zeolite the other peak at 1390 cm 1 which has been depicted in fig 1c is related to the carboxylate oco bond in terephthalic acid h2bdc caused by the immobilized cr mil 101 in the nanocomposite structure also bare cr mil 101 was separately analyzed via ftir as the corresponded spectrum has been displayed in fig 1d considering the collected data it is inferred that the formed peaks at 1402 cm 1 and 1622 cm 1 and 1664 cm 1 are originated from the carboxylate oco symmetric stretching vibration in h2bdc and plus the asymmetric stretching vibrations respectively additionally several appeared peaks at 1510 cm 1 11561 cm 1 1018 cm 1 885 cm 1 and 750 cm 1 are respectively attributed to the cc and ch bonds 47 fig 1e represents the spectrum of the bare nio nps meanwhile the formed broad absorption peaks around 3484 cm 1 and 1595 cm 1 are assigned to the adsorbed water molecules also it is notable that an emerged peak at 423 cm 1 is caused by the stretching vibrations of nio bonding 3 2 xrd all of the prepared samples were explored via the xrd analysis and the relevant patterns of the bare 13x fig 2 a nio 13x fig 2b cr mil 101 nio 13x fig 2c bare cr mil 101 fig 2d and bare nio nps fig 2e respectively depicted in fig 2 delving into the cited patterns the narrow sharp peaks at 2Î¸ angles of 6 0053 10 0009 11 6238 15 4370 18 2356 20 0073 23 4588 27 1569 29 4604 30 0928 31 0955 32 2107 and 33 3598 fig 1a respectively assigned to the miller indices of 111 220 311 331 511 440 620 533 622 642 731 733 and 660 are attributed to the 13x zeolite in fact it is acknowledged that the above mentioned values are in good consistency with those of 13x zeolite with icdd 00 041 0118 elsewhere several spotted narrow peaks at 2Î¸ angles 2 to 20 are affiliated to the bare cr mil 101 fig 2d illuminating the crystalline characteristic of the synthesized material according to fig 6e the immobilization of nio nps and cr mil 101 on the 13x zeolite causing the emersion of cr mil 101 nio 13x had no sensible negative influence on its framework hence three sharp peaks spotted at 2Î¸ angles of 2 0006 4 1052 9 0031 are attributed to the cr mil 101 five more emerged peaks at 2Î¸ angles of 37 2330 43 2727 62 8672 75 4360 and 79 3467 respectively affiliated to the miller indices of 111 200 220 311 and 222 are referred to the nio nps with icdd 01 1464 it is also emphasized that no characteristic peak exhibiting the existence of any impurity related to the immobilization process of cr mil 101 and nio nps species was spotted in the acquired xrd patterns meanwhile the size calculation of the synthesized nio nps accommodated on the 13x zeolite was carried out by applying the xrd analysis and also the line broadening of the peak at 2Î¸ 2 91 as measured using the debye scherrer eq 1 1 d 0 9 Î» Î² c o s Î¸ in the above cited equation d symbolizes the crystalline size Î» indicates the wavelength of cuk Î± radiation Î² represents the full width at half maximum fwhm of the definite diffraction peak and Î¸ is known as bragg diffraction angle employing the above noted equation the average size of 18 3 nm was calculated for the nio nps in the cr mil 101 nio 13x structure a simple comparison between xrd and fesem results clearly proved the good compatibility of the obtained average particle sizes from both characterization techniques 3 3 fesem the field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem was operated to provide an overview of morphology and crystalline properties of each of the prepared materials including bare 13x fig 3 a and 3b nio 13x fig 3c and d cr mil 101 nio 13x fig 3e and f bare cr mil 101 fig 3g and bare nio nps fig 3h and i and the related information was respectively illustrated in fig 3 looking crossly to the fesem micrographs the sphere like shapes of the nio nps the octahedral configuration of cr mil 101 and plus homogenous structure of the synthesized 13x were all undoubtedly verified according to the acquired details and precise observations the extensive immobilization of the cr mil 101 and nio nps on the 13x zeolite is irrevocably confirmed in addition fesem micrographs elucidated the fact that the performed loading process caused no noticeable negative variation on the crystalline or morphology specifications of 13x nio nps and cr mil 101 besides based on the estimation the average crystalline size of around 18 nm was indicated for nio nps in the synthesized cr mil 101 nio 13x composite 3 4 afm the atomic force microscopy afm analysis was also operated to monitor various structural characteristics of the prepared samples and to provide a better understanding of deeper prospects of the surface topography in this regard the attained afm micrographs 2d and 3d attributed to the bare 13x fig 4 a nio 13x fig 4b cr mil 101 nio 13x fig 4c and bare nio nps fig 4d have been shown in fig 4 it is of great significance to mention that by the evaluation of the above noted fig 4b and c two facts can be corroborated including first the successful formation of porous cr mil 101 nio 13x and second the appropriate size in nano scale of the synthesized nanocomposite which is in good agreement with that of fesem and xrd analysis 3 5 edax and edax elemental dot mapping to study the elemental composition of the synthesized bare 13x fig 5 a nio 13x fig 5b cr mil 101 nio 13x fig 5c and bare cr mil 101 fig 5d the energy dispersive x ray edax was exerted and the affiliated results were shown in fig 5 in fact the gathered information from edax characterization technique revealed the presence of al o na and si in the bare 13x nio 13x and cr mil 101 nio 13x which was previously clarified by fesem from the other point of view eight observed peaks in fig 5c unquestionably demonstrate the presence of ni cr c and o in the framework of cr mil 101 nio 13 moreover the obtained results proved the existence of nio in the fabricated structure the fesem micrographs of the cr mil 101 nio 13x accompanied by the corresponded edax elemental dot mappings have been reflected in fig 6 it is also noteworthy that the brighter areas in the elemental map show the higher concentrations of the specified element and beside to indicate several elements with their locations in nanomaterials variant colors were applied in each case surveying the elemental mappings and the distributions depicted in fig 6 the presence of elements namely na si al o ni cr and c is vividly acknowledged indeed the investigation of the obtained maps encourages the remarkable distribution of those elements over the cr mil 101 nio 13x which is implying the homogeneity of the understudy synthesized nanocomposite 3 6 evaluation of organic dyes sonodestruction reaction 3 6 1 effect of contact time in order to indicate the optimized reaction time for the sonodestruction of those previously cited dyes on the cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite structure and to reach the highest rate of destruction in a specific duration several time intervals were separately selected and the attained results studied to identify the most effective time of reaction the evaluation of the information obtained from those sequential experiments brightly expressed the coherency between the destruction rate and various time intervals therefore the investigation of the sonodestruction evolution was performed using the definite absorption band assigned to mb dye at maximum wavelength Î»max of nearly 664 nm in order to that initially 0 5 g l of cr mil 101 nio 13x structure was poured into 50 ml of mb in aqueous solution initial ph 7 with the concentration of 25 mg l and afterwards this suspension was consequently undergone the ultrasonic us irradiation accompanied by 40 mmol l of h2o2 the differences among the resulted uv vis spectra attributed to the mb dye over the cr mil 101 nio 13x elucidating the significance dependency of destruction towards the time of reaction have been respectively demonstrated in fig 7 a c according to the provided figures it is interpreted that as time passes the intensity of the characteristic peak affiliated to mb occurred at 664 nm decreases consecutively until the point 80 min at which the cited peak becomes almost invisible implying the highest destruction of 97 26 for mb based on the collected results and precise analysis the substantial visible light sonodestruction performance of the cr mil 101 nio 13x structure for the destruction of mb dye is strongly corroborated by the accomplished sonocatalytic experiments moreover the destruction yield percentage dy of sonodestruction was calculated using the eq 2 2 d y c 0 c t c 0 100 a 0 a t a 0 100 in the above mentioned equation c0 a0 and ct at in mg l respectively symbolize the concentrations of the understudy destructed mb dye in the initial and processed solutions after time t in min 3 6 2 sonodestruction kinetics investigation the sonodestruction reaction kinetics was also surveyed employing the curves of ln initial dye concentration against contact time min as it has been depicted in fig 7c further applying the first order equation of ln co ct kt the destruction rate constant k min 1 was calculated in the cited equation co represents the initial dye concentration ct symbolizes the dye concentration at time t and k is defined as the destruction rate constant meantime using the equation of t1 2 ln2 k the half life t1 2 value was measured in order to indicate the considered adsorption kinetics 0 5 g l of cr mil 101 nio 13x was poured into separated containers each including 25 mg l of the dye at definite time intervals and the obtained results have been represented in table 1 3 6 3 effect of the initial concentration of mb dye the evaluation and indication of the initial dye concentration and also its subsequent impact on the sonocatalytic reaction is of great importance it clarifies the practical capability of a certain amount of the synthesized nanocomposite for the destruction of increasing concentration of the organic dye hence a number of experiments was planned and carried out with a certain amount of cr mil 101 nio 13x versus various initial concentrations of the understudy organic dye as can be observed in fig 8 the enhancement of dye concentration from 25 to 55 mg l caused an undesirable effect on the destruction efficiency of the organic dye as it descended from 97 26 to 44 2 the explained phenomenon is referred to the unbalanced quantities of the nanocomposite catalyst presented in the solution toward the dye molecules concentration it is deduced that when the dosage of target molecules goes higher more active sites on the nanocomposite catalyst are occupied and eventually the absence of those recipient sites and plus hydroxyl radicals resulted from hydrogen peroxide becomes undeniably sensible based on the above provided explanation as the initial concentration of dye was incessantly increasing the dosage of the nanocomposite catalyst hydrogen peroxide and its affiliated hydroxyl radicals at the certain irradiation time kept constant and this lack of balance among the proportions of the reaction weakened the catalyst and caused descended destruction efficiency 3 6 4 effect of organic dye type to investigate the capability of the sonocatalytic system associated with the cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite the destruction procedure was performed for two other organic dyes of rhb and mo in aqueous media referring to the gathered results and as has been demonstrated from fig 9 the destruction efficiencies of mo Î»max 463 nm and rhb Î»max 554 were indicated as 85 14 and 94 3 in 100 min and 80 min respectively the gained information showed the fact that the differences in various types of employed organic dyes such as molecule sizes chemical compositions electric charges caused little variations in the performance of the sonocatalyst in the sonocatalytic destruction process 3 6 5 effect of h2o2 concentration the particular function of hydroxyl radicals divided from the hydrogen peroxide in the destruction process of organic dyes is irrefutable therefore to figure out the optimized concentration for h2o2 as the major source of oh in the solution is of great significance in order to indicate the most operative concentration of h2o2 for the destruction of mb in cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 six diverse experiments were planned and carried out each representing different concentrations ranging from 5 to 50 mmol l according to the results as demonstrated in fig 10 using 5 and 10 mmol l of h2o2 the destruction efficiency of 44 81 and 55 49 in 80 min were obtained respectively on the other hand the enhancement in the concentration of h2o2 to 20 40 mmol l through those specified consecutive sonodestruction experiments caused noticeable increase in the destruction efficiency of mb from 64 12 to 97 26 in 80 min the illustrated observation reveals the incontrovertible dependency between the concentration of hydrogen peroxide and its ulterior derivative hydroxyl radical and the destruction efficiency in addition extra increase in the concentration of h2o2 40 mmol l showed a continual diminution in the destruction efficiency and this is attributed to the excessive values of h2o2 which act as oh scavenger to produce perhydroxyl hoo radicals with lesser oxidation capability therefore the hydrogen peroxide with the optimized concentration of 40 mmol l was considered for subsequent destruction reactions 3 6 6 effect of process type from another point of view the reliability and functionality of each component of the reaction was examined by operating a series of inductive experiments on destruction of mb dye with us us h2o2 13x us h2o2 nio 13x us h2o2 cr mil 101 nio 13x h2o2 cr mil 101 nio 13x us and cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 systems and the related results were illustrated in fig 7 and table 1 also the initial concentration of 25 mg l for mb dye was selected for all of the above cited experiments the relevant results gathered from those designed experiments regarding to the destruction of mb include us only 8 86 us h2o2 32 88 13x us h2o2 37 89 cr mil 101 nio 13x h2o2 51 11 nio 13x us h2o2 62 10 cr mil 101 nio 13x us 97 26 cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 with constant quantities of 0 0323 0 0119 0 0096 0 0063 0 0048 0 0011 and 2 10 6 min 1 respectively ultimately the most effective outcome for the destruction of mb dye was attained using cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 system which is presumably affiliated to the hindering of the electron hole association through the linkage among 13x zeolite cr mil 101 and nio the collected information clarifies that all of the above mentioned components including cr mil 101 nio 13x us and h2o2 are necessary to achieve the highest yield of destruction of mb dye in aqueous solution 3 6 7 effect of scavenger type in order to determine the major species which are functioning as substantial active oxidants in the destruction reactions multiple designed experiments were fulfilled fig 11 explains that the addition of 20 mmol l of tert butyl alcohol t buoh and isopropyl alcohol ipa as oh scavenger to the solution consisting of 25 mg l of mb and 0 5 g l of the nanocomposite catalyst led to a tangible decrease of 40 in the destruction efficiency after 80 min of irradiation this observed sudden diminution clearly proves the primary role of oh as an essential oxidant in the applied sonocatalytic process elsewhere when the ammonium oxalate ao was added to the working solution as the hole scavenger a negligible decrease in the destruction efficiency of mb perceived based on the attained information it is inferred that the mentioned holes exhibit inconsiderable role as both oh origins and oxidizing agents 3 6 8 effect of catalyst amount since finding the optimized concentration of the synthesized sonocatalyst to reach a high yield destruction of the understudy organic dye is known as a milestone of the research a series of experiments with various amounts of cr mil 101 nio 13x ranging from 0 25 to 1 0 g l were implemented and the corresponded results were depicted in fig 12 hence the concentrations of the other components of the reaction including the organic dye 25 mg l and hydrogen peroxide 40 mmol l remained constant throughout several designed experiments in 80 min in this regard as the dosage of the synthesized sonocatalyst was increased the destruction efficiency ascended till the concentration of 0 5 g l after which it converted to a gradual decrease it is deduced that the affluent active sites associated with hydroxyl radicals on the cr mil 101 nio 13x lead to an ongoing increase in the destruction efficiency however the above spotted diminution for the concentrations higher than 0 5 g l is corresponded to the accumulation of the sonocatalyst affiliated nanoparticles as they probably lessen the quantity and distribution of the active sites and weaken the ultrasonic scattering by impeding the ultrasonic wave transmission into the processing solution finally the concentration of 0 5 g l was selected and applied as the optimized amount of the sonocatalyst for subsequent experiments 3 6 9 reproducibility and stability of the cr mil 101 nio 13x to study the reproducibility of the synthesized nanocomposite the used cr mil 101 nio 13x was immersed in an ethanol water solution with 1 1 v v ratio and pursuantly stirred for 20 min this washing process causes the mb molecules dissociation from the nanocomposite catalyst then the regenerated catalyst was dried and frequently used for several consecutive destruction cycles as a matter of fact after the first cycle of destruction a trivial decrease in the recovery of the cr mil 101 nio 13x was detected nevertheless the destruction efficiency for those above specified repetitious cycles remained sensibly high which is confirming the reliability and applicability of the fabricated nanocomposite catalyst for multiple destruction cycles as it has been described in fig 13 the regeneration process was implemented for four times and using the recovered sonocatalyst the destruction efficiencies higher than 92 achieved for those understudy cycles in order to provide a comprehensive comparison between the recovered and the fresh nanocomposite catalyst and to detect any probable characteristic variations ftir edax and fesem affiliated dot mapping were operated according to fig 14 a c the ftir analysis was applied to evaluate the recovered cr mil 101 nio 13x after the fourth cycle fig 14a the ftir corresponded results proved that there was no substantial change between the fresh and the recovered sonocatalyst moreover using the edax analysis the characteristic peaks of na si al o ni cr and c related to the recovered cr mil 101 nio 13x after the fourth cycle were acquired and depicted in fig 14b additionally the fesem affiliated dot mapping analysis fig 14c for the recovered sonocatalyst after the fourth cycle displayed no considerable distortion or destructive change in the framework of cr mil 101 nio 13x compared with the fresh one 3 6 10 the comparative study of the cr mil 101 nio 13x and the other reported catalysts to provide a bright and comprehensive view of the destruction potentials and applicability of the synthesized catalyst versus some other customarily used sono and photocatalysts in the removal destruction of the organic dyes the results containing the influential parameters for each case were gathered and precisely compared as can be observed in table 2 48 56 considering the results the superiority of the novel cr mil 101 nio 13x sonocatalyst nanocomposite against those mentioned catalysts is explicitly unveiled 3 6 11 suggested mechanism of the sonodestruction reaction as it has been well known the ultrasonic cavitation causes the occurrence of both light and hot heat spots assigned to the conditions like high temperature and pressure therefore the probable suggested mechanism for the sonocatalytic destruction of the considered organic dyes can be described by those two primary factors from another point of view the hydroxyl radicals are likely to form by the pyrolysis of water molecules under the special condition besides there is a phenomenon named sonoluminescence attributed to the ultrasonic cavitation which creates the light with a wide wavelength range when nio and cr mil 101 become exited by the created light with the relevant wavelength the sonogenerated electrons and plus the excited holes appear those produced excited electrons which are present in the conduction band cb of nio are able to migrate easily to the cb of cr mil 101 meantime the cited sonogenerated holes in the valence band vb of cr mil 101 simply migrate to the vb of nio the inverse motions of the sonogenerated electrons and holes rebate the possible accumulation and further raise the charge separation rate which leads to remarkably higher sonocatalytic performance also the sonogenerated electrons migrate toward the surface area of the synthesized nanocomposite catalyst where the operative electron receptors are located moreover the zeolites here emphasizing on 13x do not count as relevant absorbers of light in uv vis range and this well known feature turns them to appropriate supports for sonocatalysis as cited before due to the simple movements of the sonogenerated electrons of nio and cr mil 101 eventually they reach to the 13x zeolite the situated electrons on the surface area of cr mil 101 nio 13x respond to the hydrogen peroxide from the solution which causes the appearance of the hydroxyl radicals oha meanwhile the adsorbed h2o2 molecules initiate the scavenging process of the holes oh h2o to generate the reactive hydroxyl radicals ohb ultimately the produced oxidizers interact with the entrapped dye molecules on the cr mil 101 nio 13x nanocomposite and this phenomenon implies to the electrostatic interaction leading to the formation of co2 h2o and some other species such as so4 2 no3 etc as the mineralization products eqs 3 11 also the above described process has been summarized and shown as a schematic mechanism in fig 15 3 ultrasonic irradiation cavitation effect heat light 4 nio heat or light nio 5 nio nio h vb nio e cb 6 nio e cb cr mil 101 nio cr mil 101

co2 h2o so4 2 no3 etc 4 conclusion the current research focuses on the synthesis and application of a novel cr mil 101 nio 13x sonocatalyst the mentioned sonocatalyst was synthesized by the incorporation method and pursuantly exerted for the destruction of three types of organic dyes in aqueous solution in existence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 various characterization techniques were employed and the obtained results verified the great applicability of the fabricated cr mil 101 nio 13x for high yield sonodestruction of the punctuated organic dyes furthermore multiple factors including contact time initial dye concentration catalyst amount h2o2 concentration scavenger type and process type were meticulously evaluated and optimized for the ulterior experiments it is acknowledged that using the uv vis analysis the maximum destruction efficiency of 97 26 was detected for cr mil 101 nio 13x us h2o2 system comparing to the other previously specified components or systems in addition the observations revealed a tangible decline in the efficiency from 97 26 to 44 2 after the concentration of the understudy dye enhanced from 25 to 55 mg l besides based on the accomplished evaluations the optimized concentrations of catalyst hydrogen peroxide and organic dye to achieve the maximum destruction efficiency were 0 5 g l 40 mmol l and 25 mg l respectively elsewhere the gathered results indicated the destruction efficiencies of 85 14 and 94 3 for mo and rhb respectively the investigations on the radical scavengers functioning in the designed systems confirmed the outstanding performance of h2o2 generated oh in the sonochemical destruction of organic dye molecules in consequence it is stressed that the synthesized sonocatalyst shows considerable potentials for the significant destruction of dyes from aqueous media thereupon its particular performance for the destruction of further organic pollutants from the aqueous media can be examined in subsequent research studies acknowledgment the authors are greatly thankful for all of the sincere supports of lorestan university khorramabad iran 
14258,microalgae harvesting is the major bottleneck for biomass production on a large scale in this study coagulation followed by dissolved air flotation daf was used as a harvesting method for chlorella sorokiniana cultivated in wastewater the harvesting performance was evaluated using four coagulants aluminum sulphate ferric chloride tanfloc sg and zetag 8185 usually used in water or wastewater treatment all coagulants tested showed high flotation efficiency at different conditions of dosage ph and flotation velocity the optimal doses were 10 mg l 1 zetag 8185 75 mg l 1 tanfloc sg 500 mg l 1 al2 so4 3 and 1000 mg l 1 fecl3 at ph 7 which showed the maximum efficiency of 98 4 94 5 95 4 96 7 at 8 cm min 1 respectively moreover the photobioreactor effluent quality significantly improved after harvesting tests using the optimal doses high removal was reached for turbidity 93 7 96 2 apparent color 91 7 92 3 tkn 90 2 92 6 total phosphorus 89 4 90 9 and tss 88 6 92 5 the use of metal salts requires caution due to the high residual concentration of iron and aluminum in the final effluent keywords chlorella sorokiniana coagulant dissolved air flotation microalgae wastewater 1 introduction microalgae is an environmental source of added value bioproducts e g pigments protein lipids fatty acids carbohydrates however the high costs associated to the biomass production do not make it commercially viable 1 harvesting microalgae cells is a major bottleneck and accounts for approximately 20 to 60 of the total production costs 2 biomass recovery from the medium is a difficult task due to the low microalgae concentration 0 5 5 0 g l 1 small cell diameter 5 50 Î¼m and negative surface charge 3 many techniques have been used for microalgae harvesting which comprises mainly filtration centrifugation sedimentation and flotation 4 flotation can be considered the most promising method for large scale applications and is the most cost effective for microalgae harvesting 5 moreover flotation is more efficient than sedimentation for microalgae harvesting from water using the same operational parameters for both techniques ph coagulant dose mixing time velocity gradient 6 despite this microalgae flotation is underexplored in terms of microalgae harvesting when compared to sedimentation even knowing its better efficacy for the process dissolved air flotation daf is a traditional type of flotation and has been reported as an efficient microalgae harvesting method 7 10 daf is a method based on the air micro bubble generation to promote the rise of microalgae flocs to the system s surface where the biomass is accumulated and recovered 11 previous to the flotation process microalgae cells must be destabilized which is the main aim of coagulation 12 in this process coagulants are added in the solution aiming to reduce the electrostastic repulsion between the microalgae cells then microalgae flocs are formed and they are able to be recovered by daf to reduce the cost incurred by cultivation various studies have suggested microalgae production coupled with wastewater treatment 13 16 savings in nutrients water and carbon which come from wastewater can lead to major cost reductions 17 however daf studies for biomass harvesting are usually carried out in culture medium 7 9 differently from the culture medium wastewater is a complex matrice which contains various solids and organic and inorganic compounds 21 these compounds may interact with the microalgae cells and coagulant and could interfere in the harvesting efficiency 22 thus studies focusing on the daf application for microalgae production using wastewater are relevant futhermore daf is an efficient treatment for wastewater removing the turbidity chemical oxygen demand suspended solids phosphorus and pathogenic protozoa as well as giardia spp cysts from the wastewater 23 25 therefore an improvement in wastewater quality is also expected after the harvesting process in addition information about the influence of retention time in the flotation tank on the harvesting efficiency and the final effluent quality have not been investigated this information is important to scale up the process and promote an efficient integration of microalgae production coupled with the wastewater treatment in this paper coagulation followed by daf was tested as a harvesting method for chlorella sorokiniana cultivated in wastewater the main aims of this paper are to evaluate 1 the chlorella sorokininana recovery by coagulation daf using four types of coagulants aluminum sulphate ferric chloride tanfloc sg and zetag 8185 2 the influence of retention time on the flotation tank on daf efficiency expressed as flotation velocity and 3 the improvements in wastewater quality after microalgae harvesting 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae cultivation chlorella sorokiniana strain 211 8k was cultivated using wastewater mixture previously treated by an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor the untreated wastewater mixture was prepared weekly using 400 l of piggery wastewater and 1200 l of municipal wastewater from a swine farm brotas brazil and a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp sÃ£o carlos brazil respectively it was pumped and anaerobically treated by a uasb reactor operating with a volume of 0 65 mÂ³ and hydraulic retention time of 3 days then the treated wastewater mixture was collected to feed three 50 l flat panel photobioreactors for microalgae growth piggery wastewater was used as an additional nutritional source to increase the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the wastewater mixture batch cultivation was carried out according to leite et al 13 over 7 days after the cultivation period the photobioreactor effluent pbre was collected homogenized and used for its characterization and flotation tests the ph was measured using a phmeter digimed brazil biomass concentration was determined by absorbance at 680 nm and by dry weight dw dw was determined gravimetrically by filtration of 10 ml of pbre into a 0 45 Î¼m glassmicrofiber membrane macherey nagel germany which was dried for 24 h at 60 c then dw was quantified by the difference of membrane weight before and after drying the pbre used in the coagulation flotation tests had a microalgae concentration expressed as dw of 0 6 g l 1 and a ph of 7 2 2 coagulation daf tests the harvesting experiments on a lab scale were perfomed using coagulation followed by daf to promote the microalgae separation from pbre in general coagulation and flocculation processes are required before the daf process however preliminary tests showed that the floc size achieved in the coagulation process was enough to conduct an efficient daf process it saves time and energy as the flocculation slow mixing duration is usually applied in the order of 15 30 min 24 coagulation is usually induced by adding chemical compounds and rapid mixing which causes the destabilization and aggregation of microalgae and particles in the solution here the coagulation tests were carried out in a traditional jar test apparatus and four coagulants were tested aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 synth ferric chloride fecl3 qhemis tanfloc sg tanac and zetag 8185 basf two inorganic and two organic coagulants were selected usually applied to water or wastewater treatment the metal salts al2 so4 3 and fecl3 are consolidated and used worldwide tanfloc sg and zetag 8185 are commercial cationic polymers based on tannin and polyacrylamide respectively flotation tests were conducted in a daf unit fig 1 which consisted of an air compressor saturation chamber 900 mm high 75 mm internal diameter and 3 l useful volume and four acrylic columms 750 mm high 60 mm internal diameter 5 mm wall thickness and 2 l useful volume the columms were operated in parallel which were connected directly to the saturation chamber the flow was controlled by needle valves tap water was saturated in the saturation chamber with compressed air for 20 min under a controlled pressure of 500 kpa in the flotation tests air saturated water was injected at a suitable amount in the the column s bottom entrance the average bubble diameter generated was 40 Î¼m at this operational condition 26 due to dilution using tap water for the bubble generation the analysis obtained from the flotation tests was corrected by multiplying the results for 1 2 this correctig factor was determined according to eq 1 1 f c v u v r v u where vu represents the volume of sample used in flotation tests and vr represents the volume of air saturated tap water to promote the bubbles samples of the flotation test effluent fte were collected at different times according to the flotation velocity tested vf the collection point was located at 20 cm from the column s bottom afterwards the fte samples were characterized by absorbance at 680 nm and physico chemical parameters 2 2 1 experimental procedure the coagulation tests were perfomed in a jar test apparatus using 2 l of pbre rapid mixing was carried out at a velocity gradient of 500 s 1 for 30 s after the coagulant dosing then the liquid in the jar was transferred to the flotation column in the daf unit the flotation tests were carried out using 20 of the recirculation rate air saturated water volume initial pbre volume and four different flotation velocities vf 8 12 18 and 24 cm min 1 these velocities correspond to the times of 150 100 67 and 50 s respectively the vf is an important parameter for scale up of the daf process generally the optimal vf found in the batch is used as the hydraulic load in the full scale wastewater treatment plants the experimental procedure was divided into two steps 1 determining the optimal dose for each coagulant the concentrations used were 0 5 1 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 mg l 1 for zetag 8185 5 0 10 25 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 for tanfloc sg 50 100 250 500 750 and 1000 mg l 1 for al2 so4 3 and fecl3 the tests were performed at an environmental condition ph 7 an optimal dosage was considered the coagulant concentration which reached the best harvesting efficiency considering all the flotation velocities tested 2 determining the optimal ph range for each coagulant the best dose of each coagulant was tested at different ph values ph 5 11 the ph was ajusted using 0 5 n hcl qhemis brazil or 5 n naoh qhemis brazil before the coagulantion all experiments were performed using pbre from one cultivation cycle to ensure the same conditions each condition was tested in triplicate and the maximum experimental error was 4 flotation efficiency fe or the percentage of biomass recovery from the wastewater was calculated according to eq 2 2 f e a i a f a i x 100 where a i and a f are the absorbance values at 680 nm before and after the flotation process respectively 2 3 zeta potential coagulant dosing can affect the flotation efficiency fe influencing the attraction repulsion forces and surface charges in the solution expressed by the zeta potential zp to measure this effect samples were collected immediately after the coagulation process the zp was measured using the zetasizer nano zs malvern uk at 25 c each coagulant dose was measured at least eight times 2 4 wastewater quality the improvement of the wastewater quality was assessed using the optimal dosages previously described in item 2 2 1 coagulation flotation tests were performed at the environmental condition ph 7 using the flotation velocity of 8 cm min 1 physicochemical characteristics of pbre and fte samples were determined by apparent color chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved organic carbon doc soluble cod scod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total phosphorus total suspended solids tss true color and turbidity for doc scod and true color analysis the samples were previously filtered in glass microfiber filters of 0 45 Î¼m macherey nagel germany the analyses were performed in triplicate and according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 27 the concentration of al and fe was determined in fte when al2 so4 3 and fecl3 were used as the coagulant respectively the residual metals were estimated using icp oes varian australia in triplicate 2 5 statistical analyses all results were expressed by mean value standard deviation the two way anova and tukey test were used to compare the flotation efficiencies found using different conditions the tukey test was also used to compare the final wastewater quality reached using each coagulant statistical analyses were performed with a significance level of 0 05 using minitab software version 18 1 minitab llc pa usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of coagulant type and dose the daf performance using the four coagulants at different doses is shown in fig 2 a c e g significant differences in the fe p 0 05 were obtained increasing the coagulant dose all the coagulants reached high fe 90 but used different magnitudes of the doses the optimal doses found were 10 mg l 1 zetag 8185 75 mg l 1 tanfloc sg 500 mg l 1 al2 so4 3 and 1000 mg l 1 fecl3 which showed the maximum fe of 98 4 94 5 95 4 96 7 at 8 cm min 1 respectively this shows the need for an amount of 16 7 mg zetag 8185 125 mg tanfloc sg 833 mg al2 so4 3 and 1666 7 mg fecl3 for each coagulant to recover 1 g of microalgae in these operational conditions in order to understand the effect of the coagulant dose in the electrostatic interactions zp measurements were carried out immediately after the coagulation fig 2b d f h the initial zp was 23 5 mv at ph 7 which is according to the previous study using chlorella sorokiniana 22 the four coagulants tested at different doses significantly increased the zp values p 0 05 the metal salts fig 2f h showed a similar behaviour high fe values were reached using coagulant dosages in which the zp values increased close to neutrality zp 0 this suggests that the main mechanism involved in the coagulation is charge neutralization the addition of al2 so4 3 and fecl3 mainly al 3 and fe 3 ions reduced the repulsive electrostatic forces of the microalgae surface close to neutrality which allowed more microalgae to be agglomerated into flocs 28 however a different zp tendency was found for the organic coagulants fig 2b h besides the zp reduction the highest concentration of 10 mg l 1 zetag 8185 and 75 mg l 1 tanfloc sg reached the zp values of 8 5 and 6 0 mv respectively the same zp pattern was also found using natural and commercial polymers for chlorella vulgaris harvesting 29 this means that another mechanism also contributed to the floc formation cationic polymer with high molecular weight can adsorb more than one negative particle simultaneously to bind them together 30 this mechanism is known as polymer bridging and the effect is usually irreversible 31 it may explain the results found using the organic coagulant as tanfloc sg and zetag 8185 are cationic polymers with a high molecular weight the zp is an important tool and can be used to control the coagulation efficiency for the daf process henderson et al 32 found that the optimal zp range from 8 mv to 2 mv leads to a high fe irrespective of the al2 so4 3 dose or ph the results obtained for the inorganic coagulants are in agreement with this optimal zp range 32 high fe 81 to 95 was achieved at zp values varying from 8 3 to 1 6 mv for al2 so4 3 while fe 90 to 96 was reached at zp values varying from 5 7 to 1 5 mv for fecl3 the vf tested 8 24 cm min 1 are usually in the range applied to full scale daf systems for water and wastewater treatment 12 vf showed a significant influence on fe tukey p 0 05 except when the zetag 8185 was used this may have happened due to the collision between flocs and bubbles which affect the ascending velocity of the floc bubble aggregate it has been reported that the bridging mechanism leads to bigger and stronger flocs than the charge neutralization mechanism 33 considering that the bubbles interact preferentially with flocs equal or larger than their size the coagulation mechanism directly affects the ascending velocity 8 the zetag 8185 showed the strongest bridging mechanism demonstrated by the lowest optimal dose 10 mg l 1 then the formation of few and large flocs is expected which explains the insignificant effect of vf on the harvesting efficiency 3 2 influence of ph the optimal dose of each coagulant 10 mg l 1 zetag 8185 75 mg l 1 tanfloc sg 500 mg l 1 al2 so4 3 and 1000 mg l 1 fecl3 was performed at different ph values 5 11 fig 3 a wide ph range was used to simulate the conditions found in the cultivation system usually the microalgae cultivation effluent shows ph around 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 9 5 for cultivation systems with and without ph control respectively 13 22 the metal salts are known by consuming the alkalinity and consequently reduce the ph in the solution 34 due to this the real ph range tested was 3 4 to 9 2 for fecl3 and the 3 8 to 9 0 for al2 so4 3 considering the initial alkalinity of 150 mg caco3 l 1 however in microalgae harvesting studies the optimal ph range is usually reported by the initial ph of the sample 29 32 35 in this case the optimal ph range is from 5 to 7 for fecl3 and al2 so4 3 which is according to the results obtained from a previous study using metal salts 7 in contrast the organic coagulants did not significantly change the initial ph of the sample the zetag 8185 showed high fe in the whole range studied ph 5 11 even using ph values higher than those recommended by the manufacturer ph 4 9 the tanfloc sg showed high fe in the range of 5 9 which is slightly higher than what is recommended by the manufacturer ph 4 5 8 it has been reported that high ph induces the formation of inorganic precipitates in wastewater e g mg2 ca2 po4 3 which have a positive charge 36 the precipitates may interact with negative microalgae cells by the mechanism of charge neutralization and form microalgae precipitate flocs 37 this phenomenon allows the daf application for microalgae harvesting 9 as the ph adjustment was done before the coagulant addition it could promote a synergic effect to investigate this possibility a blank test was carried out with only ph adjustment fig 3 considerable fe was obtained only with ph modification however no additive or synergistic effects were found at ph 11 the blank tests obtained an fe of 57 while fes of 12 9 19 4 and 25 7 respectively were found for ferric chloride aluminum sulphate and tanfloc sg at 8 cm min 1 in order to understand the ph effect in the electrostatic interactions zp measurements were done immediately after coagulation fig 4 as expected the zp values became more negative when the ph was increased which may explain the lower fe obtained at ph 11 the reduction of zp is attributed to the increase in oh ions concentration in the solution 38 as an exception the zetag 8185 reached a high fe 96 7 at all ph values tested the characteristics of the coagulant high positive charge and high molecular weight may contribute to its resistance to the zp variation for instance the zp variation was from 7 8 mv at ph 7 to 10 2 mv at ph 11 a summary of the conditions which promoted effective microalgae harvesting by coagulation daf is shown in fig 4 a separation was considered effective when fe greater than 80 was obtained in general the organic coagulants performed better than the metal salts while zetag 8185 was the only coagulant with an effective performance in all the ph and vf tested the results found in this work are according to the previous studies using flotation for microalgae harvesting table 1 it is important to note that all harvesting studies shown were carried out in culture medium conditions this fact demonstrates the importance of this study using microalgae cultivated in a wastewater mixture moreover even though the tests were carried out in this complex matrix we found effective harvesting efficiencies 90 at different conditions then the results confirmed the great potential of the coagulation daf application as a harvesting method for microalgae cultivation in wastewater concerning the operation parameters the flotation time used here 2 5 min vf 8 cm min 1 was lower than those studies 5 20 min this fact represents a considerable saving in the process duration 3 3 final effluent quality the selected analyses are widely used for wastewater characterization and quantify the physical apparent color true color turbidity cod scod and tss and chemical ph doc tkn and total phosphorus parameters of the samples the tests were perfomed at 8 cm min 1 to ensure the same conditions for all coagulants the results of pbre and fte for each coagulant are shown in table 2 the

because these parameters were directly associated to the microalgal biomass and wastewater solids removed during the coagulation daf test cassini et al 14 found similar nutrient removal 85 5 to 90 3 of total nitrogen and 85 7 to 86 7 of total phosphorus by microalgae flocculation using tannin and al2 so4 3 low removal was obtained for scod 29 9 to 34 4 doc 0 5 to 33 1 and true color 41 8 to 49 0 this happened due to the low removal capacity of dissolved solids from wastewater by the flotation 24 25 the tukey test was performed to evaluate the fte quality obtained using each coagulant the differences between the results obtained for each treatment are not significant for most of the studied parameters tukey test p 0 05 except for doc and ph the coagulants promoted different magnitudes of doc removal organic coagulants showed lower efficiencies 13 8 for zetag 8185 and 0 5 for tanfloc sg than the metal salts 25 3 for al2 so4 3 and 33 1 for fecl3 this may have occurred due to the presence of organic carbon in these coagulants to confirm this hypothesis a blank test was carried out doc measurements were taken in solutions with the coagulant doses 10 mg l 1 zetag 8185 75 mg l 1 tanfloc sg in deionized water the addition of zetag 8185 and tanfloc sg showed a doc increment in the samples of 3 8 and 18 9 mg l 1 respectively then the low doc removal was due to the presence of organic carbon in the coagulant concentration used for microalgae harvesting table 2 differently from the metal salts the organic coagulants do not consume the wastewater alkalinity and few change the ph for this reason the difference between the final ph is significant only for the metal salts tukey test p 0 05 an important concern about using metals salts in the harvesting process is the residual concentration in the final effluent in determined levels iron and aluminum can promote harmful effects to the environmental and human health 7 41 in this work the use of 500 mg l 1 al2 so4 3 and 1000 mg l 1 fecl3 left a residual concentration of 32 mg al l 1 and 74 mg fe l 1 respectively due to the high concentrations the metal salts are not recommended to be used for microalgae harvesting in this condition considering future studies an in depth investigation is recommended concerning the conditions coagulant concentration microalgae harvesting efficiency and residual metal concentration in which the use of metal salts is safer 4 conclusions based on the results obtained coagulation followed by daf is an effective harvesting method for microalgae cultivated in wastewater all coagulants tested showed high flotation efficiency at different conditions of dosage ph and flotation velocity the optimal doses found were 10 mg l 1 zetag 8185 75 mg l 1 tanfloc sg 500 mg l 1 al2 so4 3 and 1000 mg l 1 fecl3 at ph 7 which showed the maximum efficiency of 98 4 94 5 95 4 96 7 at 8 cm min 1 respectively the coagulation mechanism was identified by the zeta potential analysis for each coagulant the charge neutralization was involved in the coagulation using metal salts while the charge neutralization and polymer bridging acted together in the coagulation using organic coagulants the wastewater quality improved significantly after the harvesting process using the optimal doses high removal was reached for turbidity 93 7 96 2 apparent color 91 7 92 3 tkn 90 2 92 6 total phosphorus

14258,microalgae harvesting is the major bottleneck for biomass production on a large scale in this study coagulation followed by dissolved air flotation daf was used as a harvesting method for chlorella sorokiniana cultivated in wastewater the harvesting performance was evaluated using four coagulants aluminum sulphate ferric chloride tanfloc sg and zetag 8185 usually used in water or wastewater treatment all coagulants tested showed high flotation efficiency at different conditions of dosage ph and flotation velocity the optimal doses were 10 mg l 1 zetag 8185 75 mg l 1 tanfloc sg 500 mg l 1 al2 so4 3 and 1000 mg l 1 fecl3 at ph 7 which showed the maximum efficiency of 98 4 94 5 95 4 96 7 at 8 cm min 1 respectively moreover the photobioreactor effluent quality significantly improved after harvesting tests using the optimal doses high removal was reached for turbidity 93 7 96 2 apparent color 91 7 92 3 tkn 90 2 92 6 total phosphorus 89 4 90 9 and tss 88 6 92 5 the use of metal salts requires caution due to the high residual concentration of iron and aluminum in the final effluent keywords chlorella sorokiniana coagulant dissolved air flotation microalgae wastewater 1 introduction microalgae is an environmental source of added value bioproducts e g pigments protein lipids fatty acids carbohydrates however the high costs associated to the biomass production do not make it commercially viable 1 harvesting microalgae cells is a major bottleneck and accounts for approximately 20 to 60 of the total production costs 2 biomass recovery from the medium is a difficult task due to the low microalgae concentration 0 5 5 0 g l 1 small cell diameter 5 50 Î¼m and negative surface charge 3 many techniques have been used for microalgae harvesting which comprises mainly filtration centrifugation sedimentation and flotation 4 flotation can be considered the most promising method for large scale applications and is the most cost effective for microalgae harvesting 5 moreover flotation is more efficient than sedimentation for microalgae harvesting from water using the same operational parameters for both techniques ph coagulant dose mixing time velocity gradient 6 despite this microalgae flotation is underexplored in terms of microalgae harvesting when compared to sedimentation even knowing its better efficacy for the process dissolved air flotation daf is a traditional type of flotation and has been reported as an efficient microalgae harvesting method 7 10 daf is a method based on the air micro bubble generation to promote the rise of microalgae flocs to the system s surface where the biomass is accumulated and recovered 11 previous to the flotation process microalgae cells must be destabilized which is the main aim of coagulation 12 in this process coagulants are added in the solution aiming to reduce the electrostastic repulsion between the microalgae cells then microalgae flocs are formed and they are able to be recovered by daf to reduce the cost incurred by cultivation various studies have suggested microalgae production coupled with wastewater treatment 13 16 savings in nutrients water and carbon which come from wastewater can lead to major cost reductions 17 however daf studies for biomass harvesting are usually carried out in culture medium 7 9 differently from the culture medium wastewater is a complex matrice which contains various solids and organic and inorganic compounds 21 these compounds may interact with the microalgae cells and coagulant and could interfere in the harvesting efficiency 22 thus studies focusing on the daf application for microalgae production using wastewater are relevant futhermore daf is an efficient treatment for wastewater removing the turbidity chemical oxygen demand suspended solids phosphorus and pathogenic protozoa as well as giardia spp cysts from the wastewater 23 25 therefore an improvement in wastewater quality is also expected after the harvesting process in addition information about the influence of retention time in the flotation tank on the harvesting efficiency and the final effluent quality have not been investigated this information is important to scale up the process and promote an efficient integration of microalgae production coupled with the wastewater treatment in this paper coagulation followed by daf was tested as a harvesting method for chlorella sorokiniana cultivated in wastewater the main aims of this paper are to evaluate 1 the chlorella sorokininana recovery by coagulation daf using four types of coagulants aluminum sulphate ferric chloride tanfloc sg and zetag 8185 2 the influence of retention time on the flotation tank on daf efficiency expressed as flotation velocity and 3 the improvements in wastewater quality after microalgae harvesting 2 materials and methods 2 1 microalgae cultivation chlorella sorokiniana strain 211 8k was cultivated using wastewater mixture previously treated by an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket uasb reactor the untreated wastewater mixture was prepared weekly using 400 l of piggery wastewater and 1200 l of municipal wastewater from a swine farm brotas brazil and a full scale wastewater treatment plant wwtp sÃ£o carlos brazil respectively it was pumped and anaerobically treated by a uasb reactor operating with a volume of 0 65 mÂ³ and hydraulic retention time of 3 days then the treated wastewater mixture was collected to feed three 50 l flat panel photobioreactors for microalgae growth piggery wastewater was used as an additional nutritional source to increase the nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in the wastewater mixture batch cultivation was carried out according to leite et al 13 over 7 days after the cultivation period the photobioreactor effluent pbre was collected homogenized and used for its characterization and flotation tests the ph was measured using a phmeter digimed brazil biomass concentration was determined by absorbance at 680 nm and by dry weight dw dw was determined gravimetrically by filtration of 10 ml of pbre into a 0 45 Î¼m glassmicrofiber membrane macherey nagel germany which was dried for 24 h at 60 c then dw was quantified by the difference of membrane weight before and after drying the pbre used in the coagulation flotation tests had a microalgae concentration expressed as dw of 0 6 g l 1 and a ph of 7 2 2 coagulation daf tests the harvesting experiments on a lab scale were perfomed using coagulation followed by daf to promote the microalgae separation from pbre in general coagulation and flocculation processes are required before the daf process however preliminary tests showed that the floc size achieved in the coagulation process was enough to conduct an efficient daf process it saves time and energy as the flocculation slow mixing duration is usually applied in the order of 15 30 min 24 coagulation is usually induced by adding chemical compounds and rapid mixing which causes the destabilization and aggregation of microalgae and particles in the solution here the coagulation tests were carried out in a traditional jar test apparatus and four coagulants were tested aluminum sulphate al2 so4 3 synth ferric chloride fecl3 qhemis tanfloc sg tanac and zetag 8185 basf two inorganic and two organic coagulants were selected usually applied to water or wastewater treatment the metal salts al2 so4 3 and fecl3 are consolidated and used worldwide tanfloc sg and zetag 8185 are commercial cationic polymers based on tannin and polyacrylamide respectively flotation tests were conducted in a daf unit fig 1 which consisted of an air compressor saturation chamber 900 mm high 75 mm internal diameter and 3 l useful volume and four acrylic columms 750 mm high 60 mm internal diameter 5 mm wall thickness and 2 l useful volume the columms were operated in parallel which were connected directly to the saturation chamber the flow was controlled by needle valves tap water was saturated in the saturation chamber with compressed air for 20 min under a controlled pressure of 500 kpa in the flotation tests air saturated water was injected at a suitable amount in the the column s bottom entrance the average bubble diameter generated was 40 Î¼m at this operational condition 26 due to dilution using tap water for the bubble generation the analysis obtained from the flotation tests was corrected by multiplying the results for 1 2 this correctig factor was determined according to eq 1 1 f c v u v r v u where vu represents the volume of sample used in flotation tests and vr represents the volume of air saturated tap water to promote the bubbles samples of the flotation test effluent fte were collected at different times according to the flotation velocity tested vf the collection point was located at 20 cm from the column s bottom afterwards the fte samples were characterized by absorbance at 680 nm and physico chemical parameters 2 2 1 experimental procedure the coagulation tests were perfomed in a jar test apparatus using 2 l of pbre rapid mixing was carried out at a velocity gradient of 500 s 1 for 30 s after the coagulant dosing then the liquid in the jar was transferred to the flotation column in the daf unit the flotation tests were carried out using 20 of the recirculation rate air saturated water volume initial pbre volume and four different flotation velocities vf 8 12 18 and 24 cm min 1 these velocities correspond to the times of 150 100 67 and 50 s respectively the vf is an important parameter for scale up of the daf process generally the optimal vf found in the batch is used as the hydraulic load in the full scale wastewater treatment plants the experimental procedure was divided into two steps 1 determining the optimal dose for each coagulant the concentrations used were 0 5 1 0 2 5 5 0 7 5 and 10 mg l 1 for zetag 8185 5 0 10 25 50 75 and 100 mg l 1 for tanfloc sg 50 100 250 500 750 and 1000 mg l 1 for al2 so4 3 and fecl3 the tests were performed at an environmental condition ph 7 an optimal dosage was considered the coagulant concentration which reached the best harvesting efficiency considering all the flotation velocities tested 2 determining the optimal ph range for each coagulant the best dose of each coagulant was tested at different ph values ph 5 11 the ph was ajusted using 0 5 n hcl qhemis brazil or 5 n naoh qhemis brazil before the coagulantion all experiments were performed using pbre from one cultivation cycle to ensure the same conditions each condition was tested in triplicate and the maximum experimental error was 4 flotation efficiency fe or the percentage of biomass recovery from the wastewater was calculated according to eq 2 2 f e a i a f a i x 100 where a i and a f are the absorbance values at 680 nm before and after the flotation process respectively 2 3 zeta potential coagulant dosing can affect the flotation efficiency fe influencing the attraction repulsion forces and surface charges in the solution expressed by the zeta potential zp to measure this effect samples were collected immediately after the coagulation process the zp was measured using the zetasizer nano zs malvern uk at 25 c each coagulant dose was measured at least eight times 2 4 wastewater quality the improvement of the wastewater quality was assessed using the optimal dosages previously described in item 2 2 1 coagulation flotation tests were performed at the environmental condition ph 7 using the flotation velocity of 8 cm min 1 physicochemical characteristics of pbre and fte samples were determined by apparent color chemical oxygen demand cod dissolved organic carbon doc soluble cod scod total kjeldahl nitrogen tkn total phosphorus total suspended solids tss true color and turbidity for doc scod and true color analysis the samples were previously filtered in glass microfiber filters of 0 45 Î¼m macherey nagel germany the analyses were performed in triplicate and according to the standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater 27 the concentration of al and fe was determined in fte when al2 so4 3 and fecl3 were used as the coagulant respectively the residual metals were estimated using icp oes varian australia in triplicate 2 5 statistical analyses all results were expressed by mean value standard deviation the two way anova and tukey test were used to compare the flotation efficiencies found using different conditions the tukey test was also used to compare the final wastewater quality reached using each coagulant statistical analyses were performed with a significance level of 0 05 using minitab software version 18 1 minitab llc pa usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 influence of coagulant type and dose the daf performance using the four coagulants at different doses is shown in fig 2 a c e g significant differences in the fe p 0 05 were obtained increasing the coagulant dose all the coagulants reached high fe 90 but used different magnitudes of the doses the optimal doses found were 10 mg l 1 zetag 8185 75 mg l 1 tanfloc sg 500 mg l 1 al2 so4 3 and 1000 mg l 1 fecl3 which showed the maximum fe of 98 4 94 5 95 4 96 7 at 8 cm min 1 respectively this shows the need for an amount of 16 7 mg zetag 8185 125 mg tanfloc sg 833 mg al2 so4 3 and 1666 7 mg fecl3 for each coagulant to recover 1 g of microalgae in these operational conditions in order to understand the effect of the coagulant dose in the electrostatic interactions zp measurements were carried out immediately after the coagulation fig 2b d f h the initial zp was 23 5 mv at ph 7 which is according to the previous study using chlorella sorokiniana 22 the four coagulants tested at different doses significantly increased the zp values p 0 05 the metal salts fig 2f h showed a similar behaviour high fe values were reached using coagulant dosages in which the zp values increased close to neutrality zp 0 this suggests that the main mechanism involved in the coagulation is charge neutralization the addition of al2 so4 3 and fecl3 mainly al 3 and fe 3 ions reduced the repulsive electrostatic forces of the microalgae surface close to neutrality which allowed more microalgae to be agglomerated into flocs 28 however a different zp tendency was found for the organic coagulants fig 2b h besides the zp reduction the highest concentration of 10 mg l 1 zetag 8185 and 75 mg l 1 tanfloc sg reached the zp values of 8 5 and 6 0 mv respectively the same zp pattern was also found using natural and commercial polymers for chlorella vulgaris harvesting 29 this means that another mechanism also contributed to the floc formation cationic polymer with high molecular weight can adsorb more than one negative particle simultaneously to bind them together 30 this mechanism is known as polymer bridging and the effect is usually irreversible 31 it may explain the results found using the organic coagulant as tanfloc sg and zetag 8185 are cationic polymers with a high molecular weight the zp is an important tool and can be used to control the coagulation efficiency for the daf process henderson et al 32 found that the optimal zp range from 8 mv to 2 mv leads to a high fe irrespective of the al2 so4 3 dose or ph the results obtained for the inorganic coagulants are in agreement with this optimal zp range 32 high fe 81 to 95 was achieved at zp values varying from 8 3 to 1 6 mv for al2 so4 3 while fe 90 to 96 was reached at zp values varying from 5 7 to 1 5 mv for fecl3 the vf tested 8 24 cm min 1 are usually in the range applied to full scale daf systems for water and wastewater treatment 12 vf showed a significant influence on fe tukey p 0 05 except when the zetag 8185 was used this may have happened due to the collision between flocs and bubbles which affect the ascending velocity of the floc bubble aggregate it has been reported that the bridging mechanism leads to bigger and stronger flocs than the charge neutralization mechanism 33 considering that the bubbles interact preferentially with flocs equal or larger than their size the coagulation mechanism directly affects the ascending velocity 8 the zetag 8185 showed the strongest bridging mechanism demonstrated by the lowest optimal dose 10 mg l 1 then the formation of few and large flocs is expected which explains the insignificant effect of vf on the harvesting efficiency 3 2 influence of ph the optimal dose of each coagulant 10 mg l 1 zetag 8185 75 mg l 1 tanfloc sg 500 mg l 1 al2 so4 3 and 1000 mg l 1 fecl3 was performed at different ph values 5 11 fig 3 a wide ph range was used to simulate the conditions found in the cultivation system usually the microalgae cultivation effluent shows ph around 6 5 7 5 and 8 5 9 5 for cultivation systems with and without ph control respectively 13 22 the metal salts are known by consuming the alkalinity and consequently reduce the ph in the solution 34 due to this the real ph range tested was 3 4 to 9 2 for fecl3 and the 3 8 to 9 0 for al2 so4 3 considering the initial alkalinity of 150 mg caco3 l 1 however in microalgae harvesting studies the optimal ph range is usually reported by the initial ph of the sample 29 32 35 in this case the optimal ph range is from 5 to 7 for fecl3 and al2 so4 3 which is according to the results obtained from a previous study using metal salts 7 in contrast the organic coagulants did not significantly change the initial ph of the sample the zetag 8185 showed high fe in the whole range studied ph 5 11 even using ph values higher than those recommended by the manufacturer ph 4 9 the tanfloc sg showed high fe in the range of 5 9 which is slightly higher than what is recommended by the manufacturer ph 4 5 8 it has been reported that high ph induces the formation of inorganic precipitates in wastewater e g mg2 ca2 po4 3 which have a positive charge 36 the precipitates may interact with negative microalgae cells by the mechanism of charge neutralization and form microalgae precipitate flocs 37 this phenomenon allows the daf application for microalgae harvesting 9 as the ph adjustment was done before the coagulant addition it could promote a synergic effect to investigate this possibility a blank test was carried out with only ph adjustment fig 3 considerable fe was obtained only with ph modification however no additive or synergistic effects were found at ph 11 the blank tests obtained an fe of 57 while fes of 12 9 19 4 and 25 7 respectively were found for ferric chloride aluminum sulphate and tanfloc sg at 8 cm min 1 in order to understand the ph effect in the electrostatic interactions zp measurements were done immediately after coagulation fig 4 as expected the zp values became more negative when the ph was increased which may explain the lower fe obtained at ph 11 the reduction of zp is attributed to the increase in oh ions concentration in the solution 38 as an exception the zetag 8185 reached a high fe 96 7 at all ph values tested the characteristics of the coagulant high positive charge and high molecular weight may contribute to its resistance to the zp variation for instance the zp variation was from 7 8 mv at ph 7 to 10 2 mv at ph 11 a summary of the conditions which promoted effective microalgae harvesting by coagulation daf is shown in fig 4 a separation was considered effective when fe greater than 80 was obtained in general the organic coagulants performed better than the metal salts while zetag 8185 was the only coagulant with an effective performance in all the ph and vf tested the results found in this work are according to the previous studies using flotation for microalgae harvesting table 1 it is important to note that all harvesting studies shown were carried out in culture medium conditions this fact demonstrates the importance of this study using microalgae cultivated in a wastewater mixture moreover even though the tests were carried out in this complex matrix we found effective harvesting efficiencies 90 at different conditions then the results confirmed the great potential of the coagulation daf application as a harvesting method for microalgae cultivation in wastewater concerning the operation parameters the flotation time used here 2 5 min vf 8 cm min 1 was lower than those studies 5 20 min this fact represents a considerable saving in the process duration 3 3 final effluent quality the selected analyses are widely used for wastewater characterization and quantify the physical apparent color true color turbidity cod scod and tss and chemical ph doc tkn and total phosphorus parameters of the samples the tests were perfomed at 8 cm min 1 to ensure the same conditions for all coagulants the results of pbre and fte for each coagulant are shown in table 2 the

because these parameters were directly associated to the microalgal biomass and wastewater solids removed during the coagulation daf test cassini et al 14 found similar nutrient removal 85 5 to 90 3 of total nitrogen and 85 7 to 86 7 of total phosphorus by microalgae flocculation using tannin and al2 so4 3 low removal was obtained for scod 29 9 to 34 4 doc 0 5 to 33 1 and true color 41 8 to 49 0 this happened due to the low removal capacity of dissolved solids from wastewater by the flotation 24 25 the tukey test was performed to evaluate the fte quality obtained using each coagulant the differences between the results obtained for each treatment are not significant for most of the studied parameters tukey test p 0 05 except for doc and ph the coagulants promoted different magnitudes of doc removal organic coagulants showed lower efficiencies 13 8 for zetag 8185 and 0 5 for tanfloc sg than the metal salts 25 3 for al2 so4 3 and 33 1 for fecl3 this may have occurred due to the presence of organic carbon in these coagulants to confirm this hypothesis a blank test was carried out doc measurements were taken in solutions with the coagulant doses 10 mg l 1 zetag 8185 75 mg l 1 tanfloc sg in deionized water the addition of zetag 8185 and tanfloc sg showed a doc increment in the samples of 3 8 and 18 9 mg l 1 respectively then the low doc removal was due to the presence of organic carbon in the coagulant concentration used for microalgae harvesting table 2 differently from the metal salts the organic coagulants do not consume the wastewater alkalinity and few change the ph for this reason the difference between the final ph is significant only for the metal salts tukey test p 0 05 an important concern about using metals salts in the harvesting process is the residual concentration in the final effluent in determined levels iron and aluminum can promote harmful effects to the environmental and human health 7 41 in this work the use of 500 mg l 1 al2 so4 3 and 1000 mg l 1 fecl3 left a residual concentration of 32 mg al l 1 and 74 mg fe l 1 respectively due to the high concentrations the metal salts are not recommended to be used for microalgae harvesting in this condition considering future studies an in depth investigation is recommended concerning the conditions coagulant concentration microalgae harvesting efficiency and residual metal concentration in which the use of metal salts is safer 4 conclusions based on the results obtained coagulation followed by daf is an effective harvesting method for microalgae cultivated in wastewater all coagulants

the charge neutralization was involved in the coagulation using metal salts while the charge neutralization and polymer bridging acted together in the coagulation using organic coagulants the

14259,diclofenac dcf a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug is known to be degraded by some laccases the degradation mechanisms involved when dcf is oxidized by trametes versicolor laccases was studied with a special focus on the formation of brown colored insoluble byproducts ibs that were suspected to be oligomers a kinetic study of dcf degradation and ibs formation was performed and a phenomenological kinetic model based on radical polymerization was deduced the model was able to accurately describe both dcf degradation and ibs formation as well as the impact of the polymerization reaction on the degradation rate that impact was found to be particularly important at high dcf concentrations abbreviations abts 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid acn acetonitrile

anti inflammatory drug wwtps wastewater treatment plants keywords bioremediation diclofenac laccases model polymerization 1 introduction diclofenac dcf is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid used for human health purposes 1 this nsaid administered topically or orally is one of the most used worldwide 2 its average global consumption exceeds 1400 tons per year 1 in some countries dcf is also used as an all purpose veterinary medicine for domestic livestock 1 while most of dcf is directly washed of after dermal application less than 1 of an orally administered dose is excreted as un metabolized dcf 3 either way an important amount of dcf ends up in wastewater treatment plants wwtps however the removal efficiency of dcf in current wwtps ranges from 0 up to 80 and is mainly in the range between 21 and 40 4 so the high consumption incomplete assimilation and generally poor elimination in wwtps of dcf leads to its continuous release in the aquatic environment nowadays dcf contamination of surface waters groundwaters and drinking waters spreads worldwide in concentrations ranging from ng l to Î¼g l 3 4 as a consequence of the pseudo persistence of dcf in the environment the aquatic organisms are chronically exposed the reported values of lowest observed effect concentration loec 0 01 Î¼g l to 5 Î¼g l are similar to levels observed in wastewater effluents 0 005 Î¼g l to 5 5 Î¼g l 1 3 for example the loec for cytological alterations in rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss liver kidney and gills was determined to be 1 Î¼g l 5 moreover dcf has been shown to bioaccumulate in fish 6 7 and invertebrates 8 at environmentally relevant concentrations which could lead to toxicity in higher trophic level organisms another toxicity issue arises from the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment as multi component mixtures that situation can lead to bigger ecotoxicity issues 9 10 for instance it was reported that a mixture of dcf with ibuprofen naproxen and acetylsalicylic acid had a considerable toxicity to the planktonic crustacean daphnia and to the planktonic green alga scenedesmus subspicatus even at concentrations at which the single substances showed no or only very slight effects 11 an efficient way to treat dcf in water could be the use of laccases laccases are lignin modifying enzymes from the multi copper oxidases family 12 13 laccases are able to oxidize polymerize or transform phenolic and anthropogenic compounds to less toxic derivatives 14 their substrates include a broad range of highly recalcitrant compounds dyes pesticides endocrine disrupters etc that they are able to oxidize into radicals using molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor 14 15 the formed reactive radicals can then undergo non enzymatic reactions including dimerization oligomerization and polymerization 16 these last years several researchers investigated the laccase catalyzed degradation of dcf showing promising results 17 22 in addition some researchers reported qualitatively the formation of insoluble byproducts ibs 23 24 these ibs could give us information about the degradation mechanism of dcf by the laccases moreover the formation of insoluble byproducts is an interesting point to investigate as these ibs could be separated from the water before release in the environment but could also cause clogging issues in reactors used for treatment from a design and scale up perspective it is thus of importance to understand and control such a polymerization in this work the formation kinetics of dcf ibs in a batch reactor and their relation with the laccase catalyzed degradation of dcf were investigated through the evolution of the dry weigh of ibs hplc analyzes of dcf and differential scanning calorimetry dsc of ibs on this basis a phenomenological kinetic model was developed to describe both dcf degradation and ibs formation some important features of the mechanism such as the acceleration of the degradation reaction through polymerization were derived from the model and exploited in perspectives of applications for wwtp effluents and industrial effluents at the best of our knowledge this is the first phenomenological model of dcf degradation to be presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials most chemicals i e dcf 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts nah2po4 2 h2o na2hpo4 7

oxidize 1 Î¼mol of abts in a minute 26 to determine the activity the color change of abts oxidized by laccases in 100 mm na tartrate buffer ph 4 5 was monitored using a hewlett packard 8453 spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 420 nm and in a 3 ml spectrophotometric cuvette at room temperature 27 2 2 2 ibs formation recovery and weighing the protocol described in this section is adapted from one developed to follow the formation of bisphenol a ibs 27 in the present case one experiment consisted in several identical batch reactors in parallel containing a given initial dcf concentration and enzyme activity see table 1 in a total volume of 0 2 l buffered at ph 7 0 as wwtps effluents tend to have a rather neutral ph all batch reactors were incubated at room temperature and under magnetic agitation throughout the reaction each experiment was conducted during 24 h one batch reactor corresponding to one measurement taken at 0 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 6 h 8 h or 24 h of reaction two control reactors were present during each experiment one without dcf and one without laccases under the same conditions than the others these controls are present to confirm that the formation of ibs occurs only if laccases catalyze the dcf reaction precipitates were recovered on filters pre dried under vacuum and weighed by filtration through a sartorius filtration station dried under vacuum at room temperature for at least three days and then weighed the number of assays performed for each conditions set is presented on table 1 the data presented in the results consist in average values with error bars indicating the variation between the maximal minimal values recorded and the average value some of the measured weights were inferior to the weights of the controls those were excluded from the average value as they were not significant regarding ibs formation no formal recovery and weighing of ibs was performed for exp6 and exp7 see table 1 however qualitative observations indicated the formation of ibs after 5 h of reaction in the case of exp6 no ibs formation was observed in the case of exp7 2 2 3 hplc analysis hplc analyzes were performed on samples from separate dcf degradation experiments in that case dcf degradations were performed in a jacketed batch reactor kept at 20 c under magnetic agitation the medium 30 ml consisted of ph 7 0 phosphate buffer with the chosen dcf concentration and laccase activity the reaction was initiated by adding the laccases to the reaction medium samples 2 ml were withdrawn at 0 h 0h30 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 h 6 h 7 h 8 h and 24 h of reaction samples were inactivated by addition of sodium azide before being centrifuged at 3900 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was then diluted with milliq water before performing the hplc analysis analyzes were carried out using a hitachi primaide hplc equipped with a uv detector and a xbridgetm c18 column 4 6 mm 50 mm particle size 3 5 Î¼m waters the column was kept at 35 c the analysis was performed using a 5 min isocratic elution program using a mix of milliq h2o 50 acn 40 and 0 5 h3po4 10 as eluant the injection volume was 90 Î¼l and the flow rate was 3 ml min the detection was performed at 210 nm an example of the obtained chromatograms is presented in appendix a fig a 1 for exp6 and exp7 dcf degradations were performed following a slightly different set up dcf was dissolved in metoh to form a stock solution 5 g l that was diluted in buffer to obtain the wanted dcf concentration rather than direct dissolution of dcf in buffer the proportion of metoh was kept at 6 v v for the two sets of experiments samples were withdrawn at 0 h 0h30 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 h and 6 h of reaction the rest of the analysis was performed as previously described the number of assays performed for each conditions set is presented on table 1 the data presented in the results consist in average values with error bars indicating the variation between the maximal minimal values recorded and the average value 2 2 4 dsc analysis the ibs obtained after 6 h 8 h and 24 h of reaction with exp1 were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry dsc the dsc instrument used was a mettler toledo dsc 1 under nitrogen atmosphere the samples were rapidly heated from 50 c to 200 c kept at 200 c for 15 min and then cooled at 10 c min from 200 c to 50 c the glass transition temperature t g was determined as the temperature of the inflexion point of the glass transition curve obtained during the cooling step 28 29 laccases and dcf alone were analyzed following the same procedure for comparison purpose 2 3 calculation 2 3 1 reaction scheme and assumptions the developed model is based on a classical free radical polymerization 30 with some modifications in a classical free radical polymerization the first step called the initiation consists in the addition of an initiator that decomposes to form free radicals these radicals then react with the monomer to form a free radical that will further react and polymerize 30 in the present case the initiation step is the reaction between the dcf monomer dcf and the laccase e it directly leads to the formation of the free radical r1 reaction 1 the next steps are the propagation of the polymerization reaction 2 leading to radical r i composed of i dcf and the termination reaction 3 that leads to a non reactive polymer pjk 1 dcf k 0 e r 1 2 r i dcf p k r i 1 3 r j r k p k p jk the following assumptions are used in this model the initiation reaction follows a first order kinetic catalyzed by the enzyme the saturation of the reaction rate as expected for michaelian enzymes is neglected the rate constants of propagation and termination are independent of the size of the radicals and are the same for propagation and termination these two steps are not catalyzed by the laccases the termination step leads to the precipitation of the polymer other mechanisms classically considered in radical polymerization transfer of the radical to the solvent transfer to a monomer or transfer to another species are neglected as insoluble byproducts were the only byproducts detected in this work and as there is no consensus in the literature on the products of the laccase catalyzed degradation of dcf 4 2 6 dichlorophenylamino 1 3 benzenedimethanol for 19 decarboxylated compounds for 20 or hydroxylated compounds for 31 insoluble byproducts are considered to be the only final products of the reaction even if this assumption is an oversimplification it allows to evaluate dcf removal over a wide range of initial concentrations 5 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 see section 3 2 1 2 3 2 balance equation and resolution based on the assumptions presented in the previous section the balance equations write 1 ddcf dt k 0 e dcf k p dcf l 1 r l 2 dr 1 dt k 0 e dcf k p dcf r 1 k p r 1 l 1 r l 3 dr i dt k p dcf r i 1 r i k p r i l 1 r l for i 2 4 p dcf 0 l 1 r l dcf where t is the time s dcf is the mass concentration of dcf g l 1 r i is the mass concentration of the radical composed of i units of dcf g l 1 p is the total mass concentration of insoluble polymers g l 1 k 0 is the kinetic constant of the enzymatic reaction of initiation l u 1 s 1 e is the enzymatic activity concentration u l 1 k p is the kinetic constant of propagation and termination l g 1 s 1 and dcf 0 is the initial mass concentration of dcf g l 1 this set of equations can be reformulated by summing eqs 2 and 3 for all the values of i assuming that r 0 and defining the total amount of radicals r 5 r i 1 r i the system of equations then becomes 6 ddcf dt k 0 e dcf k p dcf r 7 dr dt k 0 e dcf k p r 2 8 p dcf 0 r dcf the corresponding initial conditions at t 0 are dcf dcf 0 r 0 and p 0 this set of equations can be solved analytically by further assuming that the total amount of radicals is in pseudo steady state 9 dr dt 0 the solution then writes 10 r k 0 e k p dcf 11 k 0 e t ln dcf dcf 0 2 ln k 0 e k p dcf 0 dcf dcf 0 k 0 e k p dcf 0 1 12 p dcf 0 1 dcf dcf 0 k 0 e k p dcf 0 dcf dcf 0 under this form the model has 2 adjustable kinetic constants k 0 and k p as only parameters of unknown value 2 3 3 non dimensional form the set of eqs 10 11 and 12 can be rewritten in non dimensional form by introducing the dcf conversion x the non dimensional time of reaction Ï and a non dimensional parameter Î¸ 13 x 1 dcf dcf 0 14 Ï k 0 e t 15 Î¸ k 0 e k p dcf 0 the Î¸ parameter is a non dimensional number that compares the order of magnitude of initiation reaction rate and termination reaction rate a large value of Î¸ means that the appearance of ibs is delayed compared to the consumption of dcf the other way around a small value of Î¸ indicates a formation of ibs that is limited by the enzymatic initiation with these definitions the set of eqs 10 11 and 12 can be written 16 r dcf 0 Î¸ 1 x 17 Ï 2 ln Î¸ 1 x Î¸ 1 ln 1 x 18 p dcf 0 x Î¸ 1 x 2 3 4 parameters adjustment the kinetic constants were adjusted step by step first the invariant part of Î¸ which is k 0 k p was adjusted by fitting the p dcf 0 values predicted by eq 18 on experimental values using the least squares method values for x ranging from 0 2 to 0 7 and the corresponding values of p dcf 0 from experiments exp1 and exp2 were used for this adjustment then k 0 value was adjusted by fitting the t values predicted by eq 11 using the determined Î¸ values and experimental values of x and comparing those t values to the experimental ones using the least squares method the data from experiments exp1 and exp2 were used for this adjustment the values corresponding to 24 h of experiment were excluded from the adjustment finally the value of k p was calculated using eq 15 2 3 5 analysis of features of the kinetic model some features of the model can be highlighted by manipulating the different sets of equations in order to simplify the analysis and discuss design rules minimum conversion for ibs formation eq 18 shows that the relationship between the conversion and the fraction of dcf that was insolubilized only depends on Î¸ this equation can also by manipulated to highlight a minimum conversion x min for ibs formation indeed for 0 x x min eq 18 gives a negative value of p dcf 0 which has no physical meaning as long as x x min the assumption of quasi steady state of the total radicals concentration is not valid as too few dcf has reacted to reach the quasi steady state quantity of radicals from eq 18 x min value can be isolated as 19 x min Î¸ 2 2 Î¸ Î¸ 2 4 2 for the time corresponding to 0 x x min no ibs formation is predicted by the model and the experimental amount of ibs should be really limited p is forced to zero in the model this phase is further referred to as a lag phase impact of the polymerization on the reaction time the consumption of dcf by radicals accelerates the reaction rate compared to a situation where only the enzymatic reaction degrades dcf to quantify this impact the reaction time Ï 0 needed to reach the conversion x if dcf was only reacting following reaction 1 can be calculated 20 Ï 0 ln 1 x combining 20 and 17 allows to isolate the acceleration factor due to the polymerization reaction as 21 a Ï 0 Ï 1 2 ln Î¸ 1 x Î¸ 1 ln 1 x 1 further reaction after inactivation of the enzyme the free radical polymerization scheme has for consequence that even if no new radical is produced the polymerization continues until no further reactant is available therefore if enzyme activity stops dcf conversion could keep on enzymatic activity might be suppressed by enzyme inactivation or in continuous reactor because the reaction mix leaves the region where the enzyme is present consider a time t t s when the enzymatic activity is instantaneously switched from its initial value to zero the corresponding conversion x s amount of radicals r s and ibs quantity p s can be calculated at time t s using eqs 16 17 and 18 the evolution of dcf conversion and ibs production over time after t s can be evaluated by manipulating the set of eqs 6 and 7 with e 0 and without assuming a steady state quantity of radical then the analytical solution writes in non dimensional form 22 r dcf 0 Î¸ 2 1 x s Î¸ 1 x s Ï Ï s 23 x 1 Î¸ 1 x s Î¸ 1 x s Ï Ï s where Ï s k 0 et s 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the kinetic constants the values determined for the kinetic constants are presented in table 2 the corresponding values of Î¸ for the different experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 the highest Î¸ value obtained was that of exp7 from a mechanism perspective a high Î¸ value corresponds to an appearance of ibs delayed compared to dcf consumption indeed in exp7 as dcf was consumed no ibs formation was observed during the 6 h reaction for all the other experiments Î¸ values are of the same order of magnitude slightly inferior to 1 see table 1 that range of Î¸ values corresponds to cases allowing to see the competition between the degradation of dcf through laccase catalyzed oxidation reaction 1 and the degradation of dcf through polymerization reaction 2 these are the cases in which the model makes the most sense as all the phenomena considered in the model have a significant impact on the global kinetics 3 2 experimental degradation of dcf and ibs formation 3 2 1 dcf degradation by laccases dcf is removed by laccases and its removal is dependent of time enzymatic activity and the initial concentration of dcf dcf 0 present in solution for a given dcf 0 the dcf removal reached at a given time increases with the enzymatic activity for a given enzymatic activity the dcf removal reached at a given time increases with dcf 0 see fig 1 the dependence of the removal on laccase activity is directly related to reaction 1 more laccases present in solution means more laccase catalyzed oxidation of dcf to form radicals the dependence of the removal on dcf 0 can be explained through the polymerization reaction through polymerization the radical formed from dcf reacts with dcf that reaction is similar to a reaction of the second order whose reaction rate increases with the substrate concentration for a same enzymatic activity a higher dcf 0 means a lower Î¸ value which translates to an increase of the acceleration of the degradation reaction by polymerization see fig 6 the model presented in section 2 3 allows for a good prediction of the removal of dcf even in the case of exp7 for a condition sets presenting a dcf concentration two orders of magnitude lower than those used for the adjustment of parameters see fig 1 3 2 2 relations between dcf degradation and ibs formation the comparison between experimental values of dcf removal and the proportion of dcf turned into ibs shows the presence of a lag phase as described in the model section 2 3 see fig 2 it appears that only a really small amount of dcf is turned into ibs until a dcf degradation of 20 25 is reached which is coherent with the x min values presented in table 1 then the amount of dcf turned into ibs increases rapidly to reach a conversion into ib of 78 for 96 of dcf removal as expected the lag phase corresponds to a limited experimental formation of ibs corresponding to no formation of ibs at all in the model see section 2 3 from a mechanism point of view that would correspond to the fact that for these values of dcf conversion the concentrations of dcf and radicals make the propagation of the polymerization reaction reaction 2 more likely to occur than its termination reaction 3 leading to an increase in dcf degradation without any important ibs formation 3 2 3 kinetics of ibs formation during dcf degradation it was observed that the color of the medium shifted from colorless to yellow then orange and finally brown along with the formation of insoluble byproducts that precipitated that kind of behavior was described in literature while dealing with dcf oxidation see table 3 these color change and ibs formation were observed for all conditions sets with the exception of exp7 the absence of color change and ibs formation in exp7 is probably related to the low dcf 0 used in that case concerning the kinetics of formation of these brown colored precipitates 2 phases are observed see fig 3 first the lag phase detailed in sections 2 3 and 3 2 2 is observed for Ï values ranging from 0 to 0 07 then a phase of fast rise of the proportion of dcf transformed into ibs is observed the model gives a good prediction of ibs formation for exp1 and exp2 the results of the model for exp5 are less convincing and the formation of ibs during exp3 and exp4 is overestimated that difference can be linked to the fact that the masses of ibs experimentally recovered for exp3 exp4 and exp5 were smaller than those recovered during exp1 and exp2 and then more prone to non significant measurements mass value inferior to the controls and to imprecisions in measurement the t min values predicted using eqs 19 and 17 obtained for exp1 and exp2 are in concordance with the experimental results see t min values in table 1 and fig 3 values of t min obtained for the other tests appear quite smaller than what is observed experimentally the explanation is the same than for the difference between measured and modeled amounts of ibs as exp3 exp4 and exp5 were performed using smaller amounts of dcf they were more sensitive to noise during measurement also in the case of exp3 exp4 and exp5 a ibs mass corresponding to 10 of the maximal possible mass dcf 0 is probably still under the sensitivity limit of the measurement 3 2 4 ibs characterization the dsc analyzes performed on some of the formed ibs showed the presence of a slight glass transition between 120 c and 160 c see fig 4 as no glass transition is observed in the dcf and laccases alone analyzes this transition is characteristic of the ibs polymers can be characterized using their temperature of glass transition t g so the fact that the formed ibs present a glass transition suggests that they are of polymeric nature which agrees with literature see table 3 there seems to be no real evolution of t g through time see table 4 that suggests that the ibs composition is such that their average t g is constant 3 3 features of the model 3 3 1 minimum conversion for ibs formation the minimum conversion for ibs formation x min presented in eq 19 represents the dcf conversion that has to be reached for the assumption of quasi steady state of the total radicals concentration to be valid the value of x min is only depending on the value of Î¸ see fig 5 x min increases with the increase of the value of Î¸ for Î¸ 0 01 x min is close to zero expressing the direct precipitation of polymers when dcf is consumed for Î¸ 10 x min is close to one meaning no ibs formation will be observed during the course of the reaction so if one of the objectives while dimensioning a bioreactor is to avoid clogging it can be interesting to target high Î¸ values 3 3 2 acceleration factor the acceleration factor a represents how much the consumption of dcf by radicals accelerates the reaction rate compared to a situation where only the enzymatic reaction degrades dcf it is at the start of the reaction when x values are small that the value of a is maximum however the a value can remain quite high for most of the reaction see fig 6 at the end of the reaction when x value tends to 1 the a value decreases strongly to reach 1 as well this represents the fact that at this point too few dcf remains in solution for the polymerization to occur the a value is shown to strongly depends on the Î¸ value as the consumption of dcf by radicals accelerates more than ten times the reaction rate for a Î¸ value of 0 1 but a Î¸ value of 100 corresponds to no significant acceleration a 1 01 see fig 6 thus a small value of Î¸ allows for a greater acceleration 3 3 3 further reaction after inactivation of the enzyme after the inactivation of the enzyme that stops reaction 1 the reactions of propagation reaction 2 and termination reaction 3 of the polymerization can still occur while there are enough radicals in solution through reaction 2 the conversion of dcf can keep going even if the enzyme is not active anymore the conversion that can be reached after the inactivation of the enzyme depends of Î¸ and x s the value of conversion already reached when the enzyme is inactivated indeed the rate of this reaction decreases when Î¸ and x s values increase see fig 7 for low Î¸ values typically as the case of Î¸ 0 25 on fig 7 dcf degradation keeps going after enzyme inactivation however for high Î¸ values Î¸ 15 no substantial degradation will occur once the enzyme is inactivated this effect can be responsible for some noise on the conversions that we measured experimentally however given the Î¸ values with which we worked and the short time between the inactivation of the enzyme and the hplc analyzes that noise could have generated an error of no more than 1 on the measured conversions 3 4 information for design and scale up two parameters have to be taken into account regarding the reaction time needed to attain a given conversion and the possibility of ibs formation k 0 e and Î¸ to reduce the reaction time needed to reach a given conversion the key is to increase the value of k 0 e the value of k 0 depends on the enzyme and other parameters as the temperature of the medium so for a given enzyme in given reaction conditions that translates to increase e increasing e will make the reaction faster but also increase the Î¸ value which will in turn increase x min value these increases in Î¸ and x min values mean that the formation of ibs will be improbable meaning that there will be no substantial gain of removal through polymerization but that no formation of ibs will impair the process by clogging the reactor for instance another case to consider is when a small amount of enzyme is used in this case the e value will probably be quite smaller resulting in a small value of Î¸ and the possibility for the polymerization reaction to play a more important role in dcf removal see the acceleration factors in fig 6 in real conditions the highest concentration of dcf measured in wwtp effluents is 5 5 Î¼g l 1 3 considering an hypothetical use of 3000 u l of the same laccases that those studied here t versicolor such a value of dcf 0 would give a Î¸ value of 77 meaning that the impact of the polymerization on dcf removal would be negligible see fig 6 using a lower enzymatic activity 3 u l for instance would lead to a lower Î¸ value 2 4 allowing for an higher acceleration of the reaction and for the reaction to keep going when dcf is not in contact with the enzyme anymore however such a low enzymatic activity would cause a really slow reaction considering dcf alone the conditions present in wwtps would not allow to benefit from the acceleration of the degradation through polymerization however the acceleration of dcf removal generated by the polymerization could be interesting in more concentrated streams such as industrial effluents variations of ph and temperature were not investigated in this work it is assumed that moderate variations of ph and temperature would likely affect the reaction rates but not the described mechanism radical polymerization the model could then still be applicable with adapted values of k 0 and Î¸ increasing the temperature would increase the rate of the enzymatic reaction however a too high temperature would lead to denaturation of the enzyme for instance margot et al 32 found that t versicolor laccases showed maximal activity using abts at ph 4 5 at 50 c but that their activity decreased sharply over 70 c due to heat denaturation changing the ph would change laccases activity as laccases were found to display a bigger activity in acidic medium around ph 4 5 5 but to show a very low activity in alkaline conditions 32 moreover working at a ph lower than 4 15 which is the pka of dcf would possibly modify the reactions as dcf would then be in a protonated state changing its reactivity finally it should be noted that even if the mechanism proposed here radical polymerization allows to describe the observed dcf degradation and ibs formation it cannot be excluded that other mechanisms could also take place and that they could become more prevalent and more visible with reaction rates being modified by changing ph or temperature 4 conclusion the degradation of dcf by t versicolor laccases leads to the formation of brown colored ibs these ibs are probably formed through a form of free radical polymerization with the enzymatically formed free radicals of dcf reacting with each other given the fact that they present a glass transition and according to results found in literature these ibs are probably small oligomers also the ibs formation seems to need a minimum conversion of dcf to occur the model based on a radical polymerization mechanism allows to accurately predict dcf degradation over a range of dcf 0 of several orders of magnitude and gives a qualitative idea of ibs formation even if contrary to what is assumed in this model it is unlikely that the ibs are the only products formed in the studied case the radical polymerization is shown to be characterized by the non dimensional parameter Î¸ the impact of the Î¸ value on several features acceleration of the degradation ability of the degradation to keep going after enzyme inactivation etc is demonstrated more importantly polymerization is shown to play an important part on dcf degradation for concentrated solutions but to have no significant impact in wwtps conditions when dcf is considered to be alone in solution for

14259,diclofenac dcf a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug is known to be degraded by some laccases the degradation mechanisms involved when dcf is oxidized by trametes versicolor laccases was studied with a special focus on the formation of brown colored insoluble byproducts ibs that were suspected to be oligomers a kinetic study of dcf degradation and ibs formation was performed and a phenomenological kinetic model based on radical polymerization was deduced the model was able to accurately describe both dcf degradation and ibs formation as well as the impact of the polymerization

anti inflammatory drug wwtps wastewater treatment plants keywords bioremediation diclofenac laccases model polymerization 1 introduction diclofenac dcf is a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid used for human health purposes 1 this nsaid administered topically or orally is one of the most used worldwide 2 its average global consumption exceeds 1400 tons per year 1 in some countries dcf is also used as an all purpose veterinary medicine for domestic livestock 1 while most of dcf is directly washed of after dermal application less than 1 of an orally administered dose is excreted as un metabolized dcf 3 either way an important amount of dcf ends up in wastewater treatment plants wwtps however the removal efficiency of dcf in current wwtps ranges from 0 up to 80 and is mainly in the range between 21 and 40 4 so the high consumption incomplete assimilation and generally poor elimination in wwtps of dcf leads to its continuous release in the aquatic environment nowadays dcf contamination of surface waters groundwaters and drinking waters spreads worldwide in concentrations ranging from ng l to Î¼g l 3 4 as a consequence of the pseudo persistence of dcf in the environment the aquatic organisms are chronically exposed the reported values of lowest observed effect concentration loec 0 01 Î¼g l to 5 Î¼g l are similar to levels observed in wastewater effluents 0 005 Î¼g l to 5 5 Î¼g l 1 3 for example the loec for cytological alterations in rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss liver kidney and gills was determined to be 1 Î¼g l 5 moreover dcf has been shown to bioaccumulate in fish 6 7 and invertebrates 8 at environmentally relevant concentrations which could lead to toxicity in higher trophic level organisms another toxicity issue arises from the presence of pharmaceuticals in the environment as multi component mixtures that situation can lead to bigger ecotoxicity issues 9 10 for instance it was reported that a mixture of dcf with ibuprofen naproxen and acetylsalicylic acid had a considerable toxicity to the planktonic crustacean daphnia and to the planktonic green alga scenedesmus subspicatus even at concentrations at which the single substances showed no or only very slight effects 11 an efficient way to treat dcf in water could be the use of laccases laccases are lignin modifying enzymes from the multi copper oxidases family 12 13 laccases are able to oxidize polymerize or transform phenolic and anthropogenic compounds to less toxic derivatives 14 their substrates include a broad range of highly recalcitrant compounds dyes pesticides endocrine disrupters etc that they are able to oxidize into radicals using molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor 14 15 the formed reactive radicals can then undergo non enzymatic reactions including dimerization oligomerization and polymerization 16 these last years several researchers investigated the laccase catalyzed degradation of dcf showing promising results 17 22 in addition some researchers reported qualitatively the formation of insoluble byproducts ibs 23 24 these ibs could give us information about the degradation mechanism of dcf by the laccases moreover the formation of insoluble byproducts is an interesting point to investigate as these ibs could be separated from the water before release in the environment but could also cause clogging issues in reactors used for treatment from a design and scale up perspective it is thus of importance to understand and control such a polymerization in this work the formation kinetics of dcf ibs in a batch reactor and their relation with the laccase catalyzed degradation of dcf were investigated through the evolution of the dry weigh of ibs hplc analyzes of dcf and differential scanning calorimetry dsc of ibs on this basis a phenomenological kinetic model was developed to describe both dcf degradation and ibs formation some important features of the mechanism such as the acceleration of the degradation reaction through polymerization were derived from the model and exploited in perspectives of applications for wwtp effluents and industrial effluents at the best of our knowledge this is the first phenomenological model of dcf degradation to be presented 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials most chemicals i e dcf 2 2 azino bis 3 ethylbenzothiazoline 6 sulfonic acid abts nah2po4 2 h2o na2hpo4 7

activity assays the whatman filters used to recover insoluble particles were of grade 589 3 2 2 methods 2 2 1 laccase activity assays laccase activity is defined as the amount of laccases able to oxidize 1 Î¼mol of abts in a minute 26 to determine the activity the color change of abts oxidized by laccases in 100 mm na tartrate buffer ph 4 5 was monitored using a hewlett packard 8453 spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 420 nm and in a 3 ml spectrophotometric cuvette at room temperature 27 2 2 2 ibs formation recovery and weighing the protocol described in this section is adapted from one developed to follow the formation of bisphenol a ibs 27 in the present case one experiment consisted in several identical batch reactors in parallel containing a given initial dcf concentration and enzyme activity see table 1 in a total volume of 0 2 l buffered at ph 7 0 as wwtps effluents tend to have a rather neutral ph all batch reactors were incubated at room temperature and under magnetic agitation throughout the reaction each experiment was conducted during 24 h one batch reactor corresponding to one measurement taken at 0 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 6 h 8 h or 24 h of reaction two control reactors were present during each experiment one without dcf and one without laccases under the same conditions than the others these controls are present to confirm that the formation of ibs occurs only if laccases catalyze the dcf reaction precipitates were recovered on filters pre dried under vacuum and weighed by filtration through a sartorius filtration station dried under vacuum at room temperature for at least three days and then weighed the number of assays performed for each conditions set is presented on table 1 the data presented in the results consist in average values with error bars indicating the variation between the maximal minimal values recorded and the average value some of the measured weights were inferior to the weights of the controls those were excluded from the average value as they were not significant regarding ibs formation no formal recovery and weighing of ibs was performed for exp6 and exp7 see table 1 however qualitative observations indicated the formation of ibs after 5 h of reaction in the case of exp6 no ibs formation was observed in the case of exp7 2 2 3 hplc analysis hplc analyzes were performed on samples from separate dcf degradation experiments in that case dcf degradations were performed in a jacketed batch reactor kept at 20 c under magnetic agitation the medium 30 ml consisted of ph 7 0 phosphate buffer with the chosen dcf concentration and laccase activity the reaction was initiated by adding the laccases to the reaction medium samples 2 ml were withdrawn at 0 h 0h30 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 h 6 h 7 h 8 h and 24 h of reaction samples were inactivated by addition of sodium azide before being centrifuged at 3900 rpm for 10 min the supernatant was then diluted with milliq water before performing the hplc analysis analyzes were carried out using a hitachi primaide hplc equipped with a uv detector and a xbridgetm c18 column 4 6 mm 50 mm particle size 3 5 Î¼m waters the column was kept at 35 c the analysis was performed using a 5 min isocratic elution program using a mix of milliq h2o 50 acn 40 and 0 5 h3po4 10 as eluant the injection volume was 90 Î¼l and the flow rate was 3 ml min the detection was performed at 210 nm an example of the obtained chromatograms is presented in appendix a fig a 1 for exp6 and exp7 dcf degradations were performed following a slightly different set up dcf was dissolved in metoh to form a stock solution 5 g l that was diluted in buffer to obtain the wanted dcf concentration rather than direct dissolution of dcf in buffer the proportion of metoh was kept at 6 v v for the two sets of experiments samples were withdrawn at 0 h 0h30 1 h 2 h 3 h 4 h 5 h and 6 h of reaction the rest of the analysis was performed as previously described the number of assays performed for each conditions set is presented on table 1 the data presented in the results consist in average values with error bars indicating the variation between the maximal minimal values recorded and the average value 2 2 4 dsc analysis the ibs obtained after 6 h 8 h and 24 h of reaction with exp1 were analyzed using differential scanning calorimetry dsc the dsc instrument used was a mettler toledo dsc 1 under nitrogen atmosphere the samples were rapidly heated from 50 c to 200 c kept at 200 c for 15 min and then cooled at 10 c min from 200 c to 50 c the glass transition temperature t g was determined as the temperature of the inflexion point of the glass transition curve obtained during the cooling step 28 29 laccases and dcf alone were analyzed following the same procedure for comparison purpose 2 3 calculation 2 3 1 reaction scheme and assumptions the developed model is based on a classical free radical polymerization 30 with some modifications in a classical free radical polymerization the first step called the initiation consists in the addition of an initiator that decomposes to form free radicals these radicals then react with the monomer to form a free radical that will further react and polymerize 30 in the present case the initiation step is the reaction between the dcf monomer dcf and the laccase e it directly leads to the formation of the free radical r1 reaction 1 the next steps are the propagation of the polymerization reaction 2 leading to radical r i composed of i dcf and the termination reaction 3 that leads to a non reactive polymer pjk 1 dcf k 0 e r 1 2 r i dcf p k r i 1 3 r j r k p k p jk the following assumptions are used in this model the initiation reaction follows a first order kinetic catalyzed by the enzyme the saturation of the reaction rate as expected for michaelian enzymes is neglected the rate constants of propagation and termination are independent of the size of the radicals and are the same for propagation and termination these two steps are not catalyzed by the laccases the termination step leads to the precipitation of the polymer other mechanisms classically considered in radical polymerization transfer of the radical to the solvent transfer to a monomer or transfer to another species are neglected as insoluble byproducts were the only byproducts detected in this work and as there is no consensus in the literature on the products of the laccase catalyzed degradation of dcf 4 2 6 dichlorophenylamino 1 3 benzenedimethanol for 19 decarboxylated compounds for 20 or hydroxylated compounds for 31 insoluble byproducts are considered to be the only final products of the reaction even if this assumption is an oversimplification it allows to evaluate dcf removal over a wide range of initial concentrations 5 mg l 1 to 500 mg l 1 see section 3 2 1 2 3 2 balance equation and resolution based on the assumptions presented in the previous section the balance equations write 1 ddcf dt k 0 e dcf k p dcf l 1 r l 2 dr 1 dt k 0 e dcf k p dcf r 1 k p r 1 l 1 r l 3 dr i dt k p dcf r i 1 r i k p r i l 1 r l for i 2 4 p dcf 0 l 1 r l dcf where t is the time s dcf is the mass concentration of dcf g l 1 r i is the mass concentration of the radical composed of i units of dcf g l 1 p is the total mass concentration of insoluble polymers g l 1 k 0 is the kinetic constant of the enzymatic reaction of initiation l u 1 s 1 e is the enzymatic activity concentration u l 1 k p is the kinetic constant of propagation and termination l g 1 s 1 and dcf 0 is the initial mass concentration of dcf g l 1 this set of equations can be reformulated by summing eqs 2 and 3 for all the values of i assuming that r 0 and defining the total amount of radicals r 5 r i 1 r i the system of equations then becomes 6 ddcf dt k 0 e dcf k p dcf r 7 dr dt k 0 e dcf k p r 2 8 p dcf 0 r dcf the corresponding initial conditions at t 0 are dcf dcf 0 r 0 and p 0 this set of equations can be solved analytically by further assuming that the total amount of radicals is in pseudo steady state 9 dr dt 0 the solution then writes 10 r k 0 e k p dcf 11 k 0 e t ln dcf dcf 0 2 ln k 0 e k p dcf 0 dcf dcf 0 k 0 e k p dcf 0 1 12 p dcf 0 1 dcf dcf 0 k 0 e k p dcf 0 dcf dcf 0 under this form the model has 2 adjustable kinetic constants k 0 and k p as only parameters of unknown value 2 3 3 non dimensional form the set of eqs 10 11 and 12 can be rewritten in non dimensional form by introducing the dcf conversion x the non dimensional time of reaction Ï and a non dimensional parameter Î¸ 13 x 1 dcf dcf 0 14 Ï k 0 e t 15 Î¸ k 0 e k p dcf 0 the Î¸ parameter is a non dimensional number that compares the order of magnitude of initiation reaction rate and termination reaction rate a large value of Î¸ means that the appearance of ibs is delayed compared to the consumption of dcf the other way around a small value of Î¸ indicates a formation of ibs that is limited by the enzymatic initiation with these definitions the set of eqs 10 11 and 12 can be written 16 r dcf 0 Î¸ 1 x 17 Ï 2 ln Î¸ 1 x Î¸ 1 ln 1 x 18 p dcf 0 x Î¸ 1 x 2 3 4 parameters adjustment the kinetic constants were adjusted step by step first the invariant part of Î¸ which is k 0 k p was adjusted by fitting the p dcf 0 values predicted by eq 18 on experimental values using the least squares method values for x ranging from 0 2 to 0 7 and the corresponding values of p dcf 0 from experiments exp1 and exp2 were used for this adjustment then k 0 value was adjusted by fitting the t values predicted by eq 11 using the determined Î¸ values and experimental values of x and comparing those t values to the experimental ones using the least squares method the data from experiments exp1 and exp2 were used for this adjustment the values corresponding to 24 h of experiment were excluded from the adjustment finally the value of k p was calculated using eq 15 2 3 5 analysis of features of the kinetic model some features of the model can be highlighted by manipulating the different sets of equations in order to simplify the analysis and discuss design rules minimum conversion for ibs formation eq 18 shows that the relationship between the conversion and the fraction of dcf that was insolubilized only depends on Î¸ this equation can also by manipulated to highlight a minimum conversion x min for ibs formation indeed for 0 x x min eq 18 gives a negative value of p dcf 0 which has no physical meaning as long as x x min the assumption of quasi steady state of the total radicals concentration is not valid as too few dcf has reacted to reach the quasi steady state quantity of radicals from eq 18 x min value can be isolated as 19 x min Î¸ 2 2 Î¸ Î¸ 2 4 2 for the time corresponding to 0 x x min no ibs formation is predicted by the model and the experimental amount of ibs should be really limited p is forced to zero in the model this phase is further referred to as a lag phase impact of the polymerization on the reaction time the consumption of dcf by radicals accelerates the reaction rate compared to a situation where only the enzymatic reaction degrades dcf to quantify this impact the reaction time Ï 0 needed to reach the conversion x if dcf was only reacting following reaction 1 can be calculated 20 Ï 0 ln 1 x combining 20 and 17 allows to isolate the acceleration factor due to the polymerization reaction as 21 a Ï 0 Ï 1 2 ln Î¸ 1 x Î¸ 1 ln 1 x 1 further reaction after inactivation of the enzyme the free radical polymerization scheme has for consequence that even if no new radical is produced the polymerization continues until no further reactant is available therefore if enzyme activity stops dcf conversion could keep on enzymatic activity might be suppressed by enzyme inactivation or in continuous reactor because the reaction mix leaves the region where the enzyme is present consider a time t t s when the enzymatic activity is instantaneously switched from its initial value to zero the corresponding conversion x s amount of radicals r s and ibs quantity p s can be calculated at time t s using eqs 16 17 and 18 the evolution of dcf conversion and ibs production over time after t s can be evaluated by manipulating the set of eqs 6 and 7 with e 0 and without assuming a steady state quantity of radical then the analytical solution writes in non dimensional form 22 r dcf 0 Î¸ 2 1 x s Î¸ 1 x s Ï Ï s 23 x 1 Î¸ 1 x s Î¸ 1 x s Ï Ï s where Ï s k 0 et s 3 results and discussion 3 1 determination of the kinetic constants the values determined for the kinetic constants are presented in table 2 the corresponding values of Î¸ for the different experimental conditions are summarized in table 1 the highest Î¸ value obtained was that of exp7 from a mechanism perspective a high Î¸ value corresponds to an appearance of ibs delayed compared to dcf consumption indeed in exp7 as dcf was consumed no ibs formation was observed during the 6 h reaction for all the other experiments Î¸ values are of the same order of magnitude slightly inferior to 1 see table 1 that range of Î¸ values corresponds to cases allowing to see the competition between the degradation of dcf through laccase catalyzed oxidation reaction 1 and the degradation of dcf through polymerization reaction 2 these are the cases in which the model makes the most sense as all the phenomena considered in the model have a significant impact on the global kinetics 3 2 experimental degradation of dcf and ibs formation 3 2 1 dcf degradation by laccases dcf is removed by laccases and its removal is dependent of time enzymatic activity and the initial concentration of dcf dcf 0 present in solution for a given dcf 0 the dcf removal reached at a given time increases with the enzymatic activity for a given enzymatic activity the dcf removal reached at a given time increases with dcf 0 see fig 1 the dependence of the removal on laccase activity is directly related to reaction 1 more laccases present in solution means more laccase catalyzed oxidation of dcf to form radicals the dependence of the removal on dcf 0 can be explained through the polymerization reaction through polymerization the radical formed from dcf reacts with dcf that reaction is similar to a reaction of the second order whose reaction rate increases with the substrate concentration for a same enzymatic activity a higher dcf 0 means a lower Î¸ value which translates to an increase of the acceleration of the degradation reaction by polymerization see fig 6 the model presented in section 2 3 allows for a good prediction of the removal of dcf even in the case of exp7 for a condition sets presenting a dcf concentration two orders of magnitude lower than those used for the adjustment of parameters see fig 1 3 2 2 relations between dcf degradation and ibs formation the comparison between experimental values of dcf removal and the proportion of dcf turned into ibs shows the presence of a lag phase as described in the model section 2 3 see fig 2 it appears that only a really small amount of dcf is turned into ibs until a dcf degradation of 20 25 is reached which is coherent with the x min values presented in table 1 then the amount of dcf turned into ibs increases rapidly to reach a conversion into ib of 78 for 96 of dcf removal as expected the lag phase corresponds to a limited experimental formation of ibs corresponding to no formation of ibs at all in the model see section 2 3 from a mechanism point of view that would correspond to the fact that for these values of dcf conversion the concentrations of dcf and radicals make the propagation of the polymerization reaction reaction 2 more likely to occur than its termination reaction 3 leading to an increase in dcf degradation without any important ibs formation 3 2 3 kinetics of ibs formation during dcf degradation it was observed that the color of the medium shifted from colorless to yellow then orange and finally brown along with the formation of insoluble byproducts that precipitated that kind of behavior was described in literature while dealing with dcf oxidation see table 3 these color change and ibs formation were observed for all conditions sets with the exception of exp7 the absence of color change and ibs formation in exp7 is probably related to the low dcf 0 used in that case concerning the kinetics of formation of these brown colored precipitates 2 phases are observed see fig 3 first the lag phase detailed in sections 2 3 and 3 2 2 is observed for Ï values ranging from 0 to 0 07 then a phase of fast rise of the proportion of dcf transformed into ibs is observed the model gives a good prediction of ibs formation for exp1 and exp2 the results of the model for exp5 are less convincing and the formation of ibs during exp3 and exp4 is overestimated that difference can be linked to the fact that the masses of ibs experimentally recovered for exp3 exp4 and exp5 were smaller than those recovered during exp1 and exp2 and then more prone to non significant measurements mass value inferior to the controls and to imprecisions in measurement the t min values predicted using eqs 19 and 17 obtained for exp1 and exp2 are in concordance with the experimental results see t min values in table 1 and fig 3 values of t min obtained for the other tests appear quite smaller than what is observed experimentally the explanation is the same than for the difference between measured and modeled amounts of ibs as exp3 exp4 and exp5 were performed using smaller amounts of dcf they were more sensitive to noise during measurement also in the case of exp3 exp4 and exp5 a ibs mass corresponding to 10 of the maximal possible mass dcf 0 is probably still under the sensitivity limit of the measurement 3 2 4 ibs characterization the dsc analyzes performed on some of the formed ibs showed the presence of a slight glass transition between 120 c and 160 c see fig 4 as no glass transition is observed in the dcf and laccases alone analyzes this transition is characteristic of the ibs polymers can be characterized using their temperature of glass transition t g so the fact that the formed ibs present a glass transition suggests that they are of polymeric nature which agrees with literature see table 3 there seems to be no real evolution of t g through time see table 4 that suggests that the ibs composition is such that their average t g is constant 3 3 features of the model 3 3 1 minimum conversion for ibs formation the minimum conversion for ibs formation x min presented in eq 19 represents the dcf conversion that has to be reached for the assumption of quasi steady state of the total radicals concentration to be valid the value of x min is only depending on the value of Î¸ see fig 5 x min increases with the increase of the value of Î¸ for Î¸ 0 01 x min is close to zero expressing the direct precipitation of polymers when dcf is consumed for Î¸ 10 x min is close to one meaning no ibs formation will be observed during the course of the reaction so if one of the objectives while dimensioning a bioreactor is to avoid clogging it can be interesting to target high Î¸ values 3 3 2 acceleration factor the acceleration factor a represents how much the consumption of dcf by radicals accelerates the reaction rate compared to a situation where only the enzymatic reaction degrades dcf it is at the start of the reaction when x values are small that the value of a is maximum however the a value can remain quite high for most of the reaction see fig 6 at the end of the reaction when x value tends to 1 the a value decreases strongly to reach 1 as well this represents the fact that at this point too few dcf remains in solution for the polymerization to occur the a value is shown to strongly depends on the Î¸ value as the consumption of dcf by radicals accelerates more than ten times the reaction rate for a Î¸ value of 0 1 but a Î¸ value of 100 corresponds to no significant acceleration a 1 01 see fig 6 thus a small value of Î¸ allows for a greater acceleration 3 3 3 further reaction after inactivation of the enzyme after the inactivation of the enzyme that stops reaction 1 the reactions of propagation reaction 2 and termination reaction 3 of the polymerization can still occur while there are enough radicals in solution through reaction 2 the conversion of dcf can keep going even if the enzyme is not active anymore the conversion that can be reached after the inactivation of the enzyme depends of Î¸ and x s the value of conversion already reached when the enzyme is inactivated indeed the rate of this reaction decreases when Î¸ and x s values increase see fig 7 for low Î¸ values typically as the case of Î¸ 0 25 on fig 7 dcf degradation keeps going after enzyme inactivation however for high Î¸ values Î¸ 15 no substantial degradation will occur once the enzyme is inactivated this effect can be responsible for some noise on the conversions that we measured experimentally however given the Î¸ values with which we worked and the short time between the inactivation of the enzyme and the hplc analyzes that noise could have generated an error of no more than 1 on the measured conversions 3 4 information for design and scale up two parameters have to be taken into account regarding the reaction time needed to attain a given conversion and the possibility of ibs formation k 0 e and Î¸ to reduce the reaction time needed to reach a given conversion the key is to increase the value of k 0 e the value of k 0 depends on the enzyme and other parameters as the temperature of the medium so for a given enzyme in given reaction conditions that translates to increase e increasing e will make the reaction faster but also increase the Î¸ value which will in turn increase x min value these increases in Î¸ and x min values mean that the formation of ibs will be improbable meaning that there will be no substantial gain of removal through polymerization but that no formation of ibs will impair the process by clogging the reactor for instance another case to consider is when a small amount of enzyme is used in this case the e value will probably be quite smaller resulting in a small value of Î¸ and the possibility for the polymerization reaction to play a more important role in dcf removal see the acceleration factors in fig 6 in real conditions the highest concentration of dcf measured in wwtp effluents is 5 5 Î¼g l 1 3 considering an hypothetical use of 3000 u l of the same laccases that those studied here t versicolor such a value of dcf 0 would give a Î¸ value of 77 meaning that the impact of the polymerization on dcf removal would be negligible see fig 6 using a lower enzymatic activity 3 u l for instance would lead to a lower Î¸ value 2 4 allowing for an higher acceleration of the reaction and for the reaction to keep going when dcf is not in contact with the enzyme anymore however such a low enzymatic activity would cause a really slow reaction considering dcf alone the conditions present in wwtps would not allow to benefit from the acceleration of the degradation through polymerization however the acceleration of dcf removal generated by the polymerization could be interesting in more concentrated streams such as industrial effluents variations of ph and temperature were not investigated in this work it is assumed that moderate variations of ph and temperature would likely affect the reaction rates but not the described mechanism radical polymerization the model could then still be applicable with adapted values of k 0 and Î¸ increasing the temperature would increase the rate of the enzymatic reaction however a too high temperature would lead to denaturation of the enzyme for instance margot et al 32 found that t versicolor laccases showed maximal activity using abts at ph 4 5 at 50 c but that their activity decreased sharply over 70 c due to heat denaturation changing the ph would change laccases activity as laccases were found to display a bigger activity in acidic medium around ph 4 5 5 but to show a very low activity in alkaline conditions 32 moreover working at a ph lower than 4 15 which is the pka of dcf would possibly modify the reactions as dcf would then be in a protonated state changing its reactivity finally it should be noted that even if the mechanism proposed here radical polymerization allows to describe the observed dcf degradation and ibs formation it cannot be excluded that other mechanisms could also take place and that they could become more prevalent and more visible with reaction rates being modified by changing ph or temperature 4 conclusion the degradation of dcf by t versicolor laccases leads to the formation of brown colored ibs these ibs are probably formed through a form of free radical polymerization with the enzymatically formed free radicals of dcf reacting with each other given the fact that they present a glass transition and according to results found in literature these ibs are probably small oligomers also the ibs formation seems to need a minimum conversion of dcf to occur the model based on a radical polymerization mechanism allows to accurately predict dcf degradation over a range of dcf 0 of several orders of magnitude and gives a qualitative idea of ibs formation even if contrary to what is assumed in this model it is unlikely that the ibs are the only products formed in the studied case the radical polymerization is shown to be characterized by the non dimensional parameter Î¸ the impact of the Î¸ value on several features acceleration of the degradation ability of the degradation to keep going after enzyme inactivation etc is demonstrated more importantly polymerization is shown to play an important part on dcf degradation for concentrated solutions but to have no significant impact in wwtps conditions when dcf is considered to be alone in solution for the refinement of the model taking other byproducts into account could be of interest yet it would be necessary to study the structure of the byproducts to identify them something to keep in mind is that a real wwtp effluent represents a mix of various compounds not just dcf so dcf radicals would be likely to react with compounds other than dcf because of these potential complications in more complex solutions it is interesting to already have an idea of dcf behavior when alone in solution conflicts of interest the authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest acknowledgments
