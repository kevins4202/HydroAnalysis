25230,climate change is widely expected to pose a threat to many of earth s plant and animal species based on climate models a multitude of studies project that certain species will not be able to migrate fast enough to keep up with changing environmental conditions presenting a greater risk of their possible extinction however many of these studies are based on correlative climate niche models that represent the current living conditions of species and may not consider their ability to tolerate projected changes in future climate including the stimulative effects of rising co2 for plant growth and drought tolerance sdms also are not usually run with sufficiently detailed spatial data to account for refugia these and other aspects of model based niche studies can potentially combine to mischaracterize the risk to species due to climate change even a sdm that perfectly predicts future equilibrium geographic range following climate change however does not yield a direct estimate of extinction risk the key question is what is the transient response to a climate disequilibrium situation the concept of relaxation is introduced to evaluate time scales for responses at the trailing edge of species ranges simulation of relaxation at a forest ecotone shows the relaxation response in some cases can be hundreds of years a classification of relaxation responses based on tolerance and

niche and is what sdms capture while a few studies have evaluated both e g booth et al 1988 briscoe et al 2016 tingley et al 2014 most have not booth 2017 thus bioclimatic models may underestimate

peterson 2012 extinction risk is not an explicit target of the sdm modeling approach that is an sdm analysis applied to future climates only predicts future equilibrium conditions and says nothing about what will happen between now and the achievement of equilibrium if at the trailing edge a species can tolerate the new climate while it migrates to the new zone then the distribution shift does not represent an increased risk of extinction while it is known that the models are explicitly equilibrium analyses araújo and peterson 2012 pearson and dawson 2003 the cautions about dynamics and tolerance of new conditions are often ignored pearson and dawson 2003 even in the most recent studies booth 2017 the problem here is not that sdms are unrealistic though they may be even a perfect future forecast does not inform us about transient responses another way to put this is that it is implicitly assumed that any no overlap zone by some date say 2100 implies reduced abundance or local extinction in that zone this implicit response is illustrated in fig 3a growth is assumed to decline until the species cannot persist below the coldest or above the warmest temperatures n and s respectively in the figure implied by the current range thus as soon as the temperature shifts geographically species are assumed to find themselves in a lethal zone and quickly perish however this approach represents a conflation of the fundamental and realized niches the growth response implied by fig 3a is not observed in nature except perhaps at the coldest and driest extremes for life where competition is minimal everywhere else a species will encounter competitors long before it has a growth rate near zero n or s in fig 3a interestingly trailing edge retreat due to warming has so far been difficult to document especially for plants intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 lenoir and svenning 2015 loehle 2018 this suggests that inertia might exist due to species tolerances of altered climate and other factors 1 1 mechanisms for disequilibrium the dynamics of response to a change in climate should be considered when estimating extinction risk jackson and sax 2010 the time required to return from disequilibrium to a new equilibrium relaxation time can be prolonged cole 1985 2009 jackson and sax 2010 loehle 2000a loehle and leblanc 1996 due to environmental tolerance in addition habitat complexity can create microclimatic refugia austin and van niel 2010 dobrowski 2011 scherrer and körner 2010 which typically are not accounted for in niche models for example alpine plants found refugia during past warmer interglacials gentili et al 2015 which allowed a rare endemic plant in the alps to persist over the past 21 000 years patsiou et al 2014 lenoir et al 2013 documented the extent to which topography creates strong spatial buffering refugia for plants in northern europe keppel et al 2012 summarized over 2000 studies on refugia growth models have been used to predict effects of climate change on ecosystems and provide a test of the range shrinkage prediction while these models do not have the status of experiments they are based on mechanisms of plant growth growth models can incorporate effects of future increases in co2 which are likely to increase growth rates decrease water stress and increase the optimum temperature for photosynthesis tian et al 2010 wertin et al 2010 these models generally predict enhanced growth over the coming century especially if elevated co2 growth enhancements are included in the model loehle 2011 2014 keenan et al 2011 cheaib et al 2012 kearney et al 2010 morin and thuiller 2009 thus rising co2 could also increase inertia for plants 1 2 historical evidence for climate tolerance tolerance of fluctuating climate as well as sdm reliability can be tested using historical data the bioclimatic niche equilibrium assumption leads to predictions that 1 rapid past climate shifts should have caused extinctions and 2 very warm past conditions should have had reduced biodiversity and caused extinctions due to the exceedance of species thermal tolerances especially in the tropics neither of these two predictions however appears to have much support in the paleo literature a hind cast of the location of five mammalian species glacial refugia in north america based on current bioclimatic niche relations davis et al 2014 found that the models predicted refugia far south of the actual fossil locations for all five species this is either due to the climate envelope models or the simulated climates similarly tyrberg 2010 showed that during the last interglacial period multiple sites that were 2 c warmer than present had the same avifaunal assemblages as today rather than something radically different as implied by some models toward the end of the last glacial period rapid warming occurred multiple times including rates much larger than has been observed over the past 100 years hof et al 2011 yet few extinctions have been identified in these periods hof et al 2011 especially for plants such as trees in particular loehle 2006 2007 while some end pleistocene extinctions are known they appear to have been largely precipitated by human hunting pressure hof et al 2011 because their timing coincided with human arrival in each location and fossils show evidence of hunting see citations in loehle and eschenbach 2011 this evidence lends support to the hypothesis that species can be in climatic disequilibrium without extinction another line of evidence for potential climate tolerance consists of the historical biogeography of endemics in eastern north america there are almost no endemic plants in glaciated regions due to a lack of sufficient time for endemics to have evolved since ice retreat yet endemics can be found within a few miles of the historic ice sheet margin davis and shaw 2001 loehle 2006 2007 consequently the hundreds of narrow endemic plants in this ice margin region likely survived the huge climatic swings of the last glacial period or periods this suggests considerable tolerance of climatic shifts across many species the gradual shift of plants to new geographic zones during past warming episodes is further evidence of their warming tolerance cole 1985 2009 cwynar and spear 1991 and tinner et al 2007 showed that loss of plant species in an area for the warm margin of shifting species due to past increasing temperatures took one to several thousand years whereas a somewhat faster boreal retreat occurred following cooling conditions jaramillo et al 2010 in a study of the paleocene eocene thermal maximum petm 56 3 million years ago when global temperatures were elevated about 5 c for 100 000 200 000 years found that tropical plant speciation rates and diversity increased during this period yet extinctions were not elevated willis et al 2010 found that the eocene climatic optimum 53 51 million years ago was one of the most biodiverse times for the neotropics during this period the atmosphere s co2 was 1200 ppmv greater and tropical temperatures were 5 10 c higher than today collectively such findings run counter to climate envelope model assumptions that species are intolerant of warming or rapid temperature change 1 3 implications of environmental tolerance extensive data show that species can survive and prosper far outside their usual climate conditions especially on the warm end booth 2017 loehle 2014 and loehle and leblanc 1996 showed that trees can grow in far warmer climates than might be suggested by analyses of their current natural distributions most canadian trees can be found growing in botanical gardens in australia for example loehle 2014 while botanical gardens may be but are not necessarily irrigated and competition is minimized temperature is not controllable booth et al 2015 found that for many eucalyptus species climatic tolerance inferred from plantings outside australia is much broader than implied by species distribution models based on their native range an indicator of the need to consider if possible results from trials outside species natural distributions e g booth 2017 way and oren 2010 found that up to a 13 c increase in growing season temperature led to increased growth for multiple temperate and boreal trees and little change for tropical trees pearce higgins et al 2015 found that plants had the most pronounced positive responses to warming above their normal conditions followed by invertebrates then birds then mammals amphibians showed no response and fish a negative response it also has been shown that urban trees due to elevated co2 in urban areas and the urban heat island effect are growing faster than rural trees at high latitudes pretzsch et al 2017 in spite of urban pollution these authors also found increased growth for both urban and rural trees post 1960 worldwide trees sampled were dominant healthy and open growing these results suggest not merely tolerance for warming but growth enhancement these positive growth study results combined with modeling results noted above contradict sdm studies claiming that rapid extinctions are likely at least for plants cold appears to be more limiting for many species than high temperatures szabo et al 2009 found that for widespread animal species of north and south america regional biodiversity was strongly reduced by the coldest minimum temperatures with only a small reduction at the warmest minimum temperatures range restricted species were less common in colder climates and enhanced by mountainous terrain thus for this entire study group over the whole of the western hemisphere cold appeared to be more limiting than heat this conclusion is further supported by davies et al 2009 who showed that mammal species from areas with the greatest temperature increase since the last glacial maximum had the largest geographic ranges geographically high northern latitude species had the largest ranges what do such tolerances imply for species persistence as climate warms in the currently occupied range the organisms in that zone may well persist until more competitive species already within the zone or immigrating from a warmer climate out compete them the displacement process can take hundreds of years loehle 2000a 2014 loehle and leblanc 1996 a study of island archipelagoes led heaney 2000 to conclude that these and other habitats are likely in a continual state of dynamic disequilibrium due to constantly changing conditions and that such disequilibrium likely persists for prolonged periods brown and lomolino 1998 further documented that many species can be found persisting within very small geographic ranges as also noted by loehle and eschenbach 2011 critically if a species can persist for a long time in its current range then the opportunity to migrate to a new zone may be greater than assumed by some extinction assessments furthermore this means that reduced abundance at trailing edges is not an inevitable result of a climate shift many attempts have been made to increase sdm realism by incorporating dispersal e g holloway and miller 2017 usually models consider no dispersal or unlimited dispersal as two bounding cases while the inclusion of dispersal is good and i also consider it here it does not alleviate the reliance on assumptions that species necessarily rapidly succumb in the non overlapping climate zone trailing edge the ability of species to tolerate a wider range of conditions than indicated by their current range is their environmental tolerance the metric of concern here is how long a species can persist in an area following a climatic shift the path followed by a population after such a change is called the transient or transient dynamics because of my focus on time i here make use of the concept of relaxation time which specifically refers to time required to relax back to a new equilibrium which includes ecotone locations geographic range and stable patch dynamics anderson 2013 and morin and lechowicz 2008 argued that bioclimatic niche analyses need a better focus on the biology of the fundamental niche and that mechanistic models might provide more reliable forecasts similarly yackulic et al 2015 suggested that explicit simulation of colonization and local extinction processes is needed the recommendation to adopt a mechanistic modeling approach seems fundamentally sound as an example deutsch et al 2008 used experimental population growth rates in response to temperature a measure of fitness for 38 insect species others have incorporated bioenergetics briscoe et al 2016 bioenergetics plus behavior kearney et al 2009 physiology and population biology fordham et al 2013 and plant growth hijmans and graham 2006 anderson 2013 provides a coherent set of suggestions for improving model forecasts he shows how niche models can be built calibrated and tested to better represent the fundamental niche and suggests that niche model analyses be followed by a dispersal analysis as santini et al 2016 although dispersal analyses often still assume that the species will perish if it cannot disperse fast enough finer resolution spatial data e g araújo et al 2005 wiens et al 2009 would probably improve models as well by allowing for microsite refugia while these suggestions for improving niche models to be more mechanistic are sensible they are labor intensive and sufficient data are often not available singer et al 2016 it is therefore suggested that relaxation per se be more explicitly studied to provide a context for range change studies a framework for relaxation is provided in fig 2 the key factors are environmental tolerance and dispersal ability environmental tolerance in plants is enhanced by factors such as competitive ability physiological phenological and morphological plasticity genetic heterogeneity and response rapid evolution long lifespan root sprouting seed banks and tolerance of disturbance e g fire loehle 2000b for animals tolerance is enhanced by migration and thermoregulatory behaviors in the graph trees and other plants are common in the upper left which implies a prolonged relaxation time species in the upper right can both tolerate change and disperse which implies both long relaxation times at the trailing edge and tracking change at the leading edge giving short term range expansion in the lower right species are not tolerant of change but can track their preferred climate the lower left shaded box contains species that lack mobility and are sensitive to change poor dispersers include species such as earthworms and salamanders which are unable to move long distances or cross barriers for example endemics do not necessarily fall into the lower left region of fig 2 as noted previously many endemics appear to have tolerated large historical climatic swings in which case they would fall into the upper left low risk region not the lower left of fig 2 the size of the risk zone in the lower left of fig 2 will be related to the magnitude and nature of the climate change event for a small change the shaded high risk box might be very small the dispersal ability of categories of species e g birds trees is not difficult to establish in general several sources of information exist to document environmental tolerance direct experimental studies e g pearce higgins et al 2015 are particularly useful if available plantings outside their native range exist for many trees booth 2017 booth et al 2015 loehle 2014 and can provide valuable evidence of tolerance a physiologically based index of climate tolerance has been developed for trees liénard et al 2016 lifespan and disturbance resistance are often known and are useful indices of tolerance the approach of smith et al 2009 could be useful for more detailed assessments paleo or recent studies of species shifts cited above also blarquez and aleman 2016 can provide valuable insights north south geographic range also provides good evidence for niche breadth for example in the eastern united states many plants and animals can be found from florida to the region around the great lakes a very wide climatic zone in very cold zones we can predict that the response to warming should be slow due to slow plant growth e g caccianiga and payette 2006 likewise at dry ecotones responses should be slow except that drought could cause more rapid shifts via plant death for certain animals what may limit them geographically is not climate per se but their preferred vegetation composition or structure e g trees for tree nesting birds in which case they would tolerate climate change and track the slower lagged response of the vegetation given this type of information general simulations such as conducted here could provide time scales for relaxation responses for niche based climate change studies based on general species responses at this stage what can be said is that four outcomes are likely prolonged relaxation no reduction in abundance prolonged relaxation plus dispersal range expansion rapid dispersal climate tracking and poor dispersal plus intolerance only the last case represents species at risk at this point it is useful to illustrate how relaxation times can be estimated from models these relaxation times can inform the analysis in fig 2 without needing to be exact for example if a simple model shows a relaxation time for local extinction of hundreds of years then concern about that species over the next few decades can probably be put aside 2 methods i modeled responses of two tree species to temperature along an elevational ecotone using mathematica with competition based on height growth maximum annual height growth was based on temperature fig 3 b with the prediction that abundance would differ across the ecotone defined by the intersection of their growth curves note that across the entire range of temperature both species grow better with warmer conditions the tradeoff of growth rate vs cold tolerance was based on loehle 1998 and pearce higgins et al 2015 who showed that plants generally respond positively to warming the height growth response to temperature is given by eqs 1 and 2 1 g g max a t b 2 2 t 8 i 5 where i is the elevational grid square or cell t is temperature ºc g is height growth per year gmax is maximum height growth per year m and a b are shape parameters values for parameters were chosen to represent typical tree responses loehle 1998 loehle and leblanc 1996 with g max a and b 0 5 0 001 24 for the upper elevation species and 1 0 0 004 28 for the lower elevational species respectively this is a deliberately simplistic model for illustrative purposes only the elevational ecotone was modeled on a one year time step using a 100 100 cell grid of 10 10 m cells each cell was assumed to support one adult tree age 15 tree death occurred randomly on cells with a probability of 0 02 yr to produce a mean lifespan of about 50 years trees colonized vacant cells no adult trees from the four cardinal locations with probability 0 2 year grid until year 15 when the tallest tree in the cell dominated and the others died colonization wrapped on a torus across the elevations horizontally the first tree to colonize did not necessarily occupy the site at year 15 if the other species grew better at that temperature and overtook it the elevational lapse rate was 20⁰c 1000 m this high lapse rate was chosen to allow an ecotone to develop in a reasonable sized grid the site was initialized by assigning each cell randomly to one of the two species with an initial age of 100 years and was then run to equilibrium to verify the ecotone location itself a relaxation response once equilibrium was established i conducted a warming experiment by adding 2 c to the elevational temperature gradient eq 2 and evaluated the rate of ecotone shift a second model was chosen to represent conditions away from an ecotone a metapopulation approach see talluto et al 2017 was used each of 1000 cells was initially occupied colonization and dispersal were modeled with universal dispersal not neighborhood within the simulated area which was not large parameters were changed at time 0 to colonization 0 02 and extinction 0 022 per cell per year again this is a deliberately simplistic model simply for illustration 3 results due to the long lifespan of trees it required almost 500 years for equilibrium to be reached from the initial random state fig 4 a at equilibrium average age of adult trees above the age 15 cutoff was approximately 50 years representing a young forest with high turnover for long lived trees the transient response can be much longer loehle 2000a adding disturbance or using other parameters would alter results after the step warming of 2 c the ecotone shifted smoothly over a 500 yr period fig 4b ecotone locations and shapes after 500 years were visually similar to the 500 year curve there was no sudden reduction in abundance or dieback at the trailing edge multiple repetitions of the simulation yielded results visually the same as fig 4 because the results are for purposes of illustration i did not calculate or present a measure of variance in time or in ecotone shape the point is that transition times are prolonged not sudden the metapopulation results are shown in fig 5 relaxation to the new stable state is clearly shown with a new equilibrium being reached in about 60 years this result is specific to the parameters chosen 4 discussion the ecotone simulations figs 4 5 illustrate two key facts about geographic ranges first a range boundary or ecotone can be governed by competition even when both species respond positively to warming even if the species grows better outside its current range in the absence of competition it will have a smaller realized niche due to the existence of competitors the existence of evolutionary growth tradeoffs loehle 1998 makes this likely in general this is the sdm paradox bioclimatic niche models can make correct range predictions both in the present and at future equilibrium without being correct about risk during transients second the relaxation response can be prolonged in the case simulated it took 500 years in spite of a clear competitive advantage for the warm habitat species either to relax from random to an ecotone or for the ecotone to respond after warming for longer lived species it would take even longer loehle 2000a in the metapopulation case relaxation took 60 years it is critical to explicitly state assumptions in climate change impact studies and assumptions that species must migrate to their new ideal range or perish may not be valid when studying transient response to change it is important to consider relaxation times at the trailing edge not just migration rates at the leading edge this study provides a framework for such analyses it is therefore suggested that following an equilibrium sdm or other analysis a relaxation analysis be applied to bridge the causal gap to infer risk to species otherwise projections of risk e g urban 2015 may suffer from an unrecognized bias funding all work was funded by national council

evolved since ice retreat yet endemics can be found within a few miles of the historic ice sheet margin davis and shaw 2001 loehle 2006 2007 consequently the hundreds of narrow endemic plants in this ice margin region likely survived the huge climatic swings of the last glacial period or periods this suggests considerable tolerance of climatic shifts across many species the gradual shift of plants to new geographic zones during past warming episodes is further evidence of their warming tolerance cole 1985 2009 cwynar and spear 1991 and tinner et al 2007 showed that loss of plant species in an area for the warm margin of shifting species due to past increasing temperatures took one to several thousand years whereas a somewhat faster boreal retreat occurred following cooling conditions jaramillo et al 2010 in a study of the paleocene eocene thermal maximum petm 56 3 million years ago when global temperatures were elevated about 5 c for 100 000 200 000 years found that tropical plant speciation rates and diversity increased during this period yet extinctions were not elevated willis et al 2010 found that the eocene climatic optimum 53 51 million years ago was one of the most biodiverse times for the neotropics during this period the atmosphere s co2 was 1200 ppmv greater and tropical temperatures were 5 10 c higher than today collectively such findings run counter to climate envelope model assumptions that species are intolerant of warming or rapid temperature change 1 3 implications of environmental tolerance extensive data show that species can survive and prosper far outside their usual climate conditions especially on the warm end booth 2017 loehle 2014 and loehle and leblanc 1996 showed that trees can grow in far warmer climates than might be suggested by analyses of their current natural distributions most canadian trees can be found growing in botanical gardens in australia for example loehle 2014 while botanical gardens may be but are not necessarily irrigated and competition is minimized temperature is not controllable booth et al 2015 found that for many eucalyptus species climatic tolerance inferred from plantings outside australia is much broader than implied by species distribution models based on their native range an indicator of the need to consider if possible results from trials outside species natural distributions e g booth 2017 way and oren 2010 found that up to a 13 c increase in growing season temperature led to increased growth for multiple temperate and boreal trees and little change for tropical trees pearce higgins et al 2015 found that plants had the most pronounced positive responses to warming above their normal conditions followed by invertebrates then birds then mammals amphibians showed no response and fish a negative response it also has been shown that urban trees due to elevated co2 in urban areas and the urban heat island effect are growing faster than rural trees at high latitudes pretzsch et al 2017 in spite of urban pollution these authors also found increased growth for both urban and rural trees post 1960 worldwide trees sampled were dominant healthy and open growing these results suggest not merely tolerance for warming but growth enhancement these positive growth study results combined with modeling results noted above contradict sdm studies claiming that rapid extinctions are likely at least for plants cold appears to be more limiting for many species than high temperatures szabo et al 2009 found that for widespread animal species of north and south america regional biodiversity was strongly reduced by the coldest minimum temperatures with only a small reduction at the warmest minimum temperatures range restricted species were less common in colder climates and enhanced by mountainous terrain thus for this entire study group over the whole of the western hemisphere cold appeared to be more limiting than heat this conclusion is further supported by davies et al 2009 who showed that mammal species from areas with the greatest temperature increase since the last glacial maximum had the largest geographic ranges geographically high northern latitude species had the largest ranges what do such tolerances imply for species persistence as climate warms in the currently occupied range the organisms in that zone may well persist until more competitive species already within the zone or immigrating from a warmer climate out compete them the displacement process can take hundreds of years loehle 2000a 2014 loehle and leblanc 1996 a study of island archipelagoes led heaney 2000 to conclude that these and other habitats are likely in a continual state of dynamic disequilibrium due to constantly changing conditions and that such disequilibrium likely persists for prolonged periods brown and lomolino 1998 further documented that many species can be found persisting within very small geographic ranges as also noted by loehle and eschenbach 2011 critically if a species can persist for a long time in its current range then the opportunity to migrate to a new zone may be greater than assumed by some extinction assessments furthermore this means that reduced abundance at trailing edges is not an inevitable result of a climate shift many attempts have been made to increase sdm realism by incorporating dispersal e g holloway and miller 2017 usually models consider no dispersal or unlimited dispersal as two bounding cases while the inclusion of dispersal is good and i also consider it here it does not alleviate the reliance on assumptions that species necessarily rapidly succumb in the non overlapping climate zone trailing edge the ability of species to tolerate a wider range of conditions than indicated by their current range is their environmental tolerance the metric of concern here is how long a species can persist in an area following a climatic shift the path followed by a population after such a change is called the transient or transient dynamics because of my focus on time i here make use of the concept of relaxation time which specifically refers to time required to relax back to a new equilibrium which includes ecotone locations geographic range and stable patch dynamics anderson 2013 and morin and lechowicz 2008 argued that bioclimatic niche analyses need a better focus on the biology of the fundamental niche and that mechanistic models might provide more reliable forecasts similarly yackulic et al 2015 suggested that explicit simulation of colonization and local extinction processes is needed the recommendation to adopt a mechanistic modeling approach seems fundamentally sound as an example deutsch et al 2008 used experimental population growth rates in response to temperature a measure of fitness for 38 insect species others have incorporated bioenergetics briscoe et al 2016 bioenergetics plus behavior kearney et al 2009 physiology and population biology fordham et al 2013 and plant growth hijmans and graham 2006 anderson 2013 provides a coherent set of suggestions for improving model forecasts he shows how niche models can be built calibrated and tested to better represent the fundamental niche and suggests that niche model analyses be followed by a dispersal analysis as santini et al 2016 although dispersal analyses often still assume that the species will perish if it cannot disperse fast enough finer resolution spatial data e g araújo et al 2005 wiens et al 2009 would probably improve models as well by allowing for microsite refugia while these suggestions for improving niche models to be more mechanistic are sensible they are labor intensive and sufficient data are often not available singer et al 2016 it is therefore suggested that relaxation per se be more explicitly studied to provide a context for range change studies a framework for relaxation is provided in fig 2 the key factors are environmental tolerance and dispersal ability environmental tolerance in plants is enhanced by factors such as competitive ability physiological phenological and morphological plasticity genetic heterogeneity and response rapid evolution long lifespan root sprouting seed banks and tolerance of disturbance e g fire loehle 2000b for animals tolerance is enhanced by migration and thermoregulatory behaviors in the graph trees and other plants are common in the upper left which implies a prolonged relaxation time species in the upper right can both tolerate change and disperse which implies both long relaxation times at the trailing edge and tracking change at the leading edge giving short term range expansion in the lower right species are not tolerant of change but can track their preferred climate the lower left shaded box contains species that lack mobility and are sensitive to change poor dispersers include species such as earthworms and salamanders which are unable to move long distances or cross barriers for example endemics do not necessarily fall into the lower left region of fig 2 as noted previously many endemics appear to have tolerated large historical climatic swings in which case they would fall into the upper left low risk region not the lower left of fig 2 the size of the risk zone in the lower left of fig 2 will be related to the magnitude and nature of the climate change event for a small change the shaded high risk box might be very small the dispersal ability of categories of species e g birds trees is not difficult to establish in general several sources of information exist to document environmental tolerance direct experimental studies e g pearce higgins et al 2015 are particularly useful if available plantings outside their native range exist for many trees booth 2017 booth et al 2015 loehle 2014 and can provide valuable evidence of tolerance a physiologically based index of climate tolerance has been developed for trees liénard et al 2016 lifespan and disturbance resistance are often known and are useful indices of tolerance the approach of smith et al 2009 could be useful for more detailed assessments paleo or recent studies of species shifts cited above also blarquez and aleman 2016 can provide valuable insights north south geographic range also provides good evidence for niche breadth for example in the eastern united states many plants and animals can be found from florida to the region around the great lakes a very wide climatic zone in very cold zones we can predict that the response to warming should be slow due to slow plant growth e g caccianiga and payette 2006 likewise at dry ecotones responses should be slow except that drought could cause more rapid shifts via plant death for certain animals what may limit them geographically is not climate per se but their preferred vegetation composition or structure e g trees for tree nesting birds in which case they would tolerate climate change and track the slower lagged response of the vegetation given this type of information general simulations such as conducted here could provide time scales for relaxation responses for niche based climate change studies based on general species responses at this stage what can be said is that four outcomes are likely prolonged relaxation no reduction in abundance prolonged relaxation plus dispersal range expansion rapid dispersal climate tracking and poor dispersal plus intolerance only the last case represents species at risk at this point it is useful to illustrate how relaxation times can be estimated from models these relaxation times can inform the analysis in fig 2 without needing to be exact for example if a simple model shows a relaxation time for local extinction of hundreds of years then concern about that species over the next few decades can probably be put aside 2 methods i modeled responses of two tree species to temperature along an elevational ecotone using mathematica with competition based on height growth maximum annual height growth was based on temperature fig 3 b with the prediction that abundance would differ across the ecotone defined by the intersection of their growth curves note that across the entire range of temperature both species grow better with warmer conditions the tradeoff of growth rate vs cold tolerance was based on loehle 1998 and pearce higgins et al 2015 who showed that plants generally respond positively to warming the height growth response to temperature is given by eqs 1 and 2 1 g g max a t b 2 2 t 8 i 5 where i is the elevational grid square or cell t is temperature ºc g is height growth per year gmax is maximum height growth per year m and a b are shape parameters values for parameters were chosen to represent typical tree responses loehle 1998 loehle and leblanc 1996 with g max a and b 0 5 0 001 24 for the upper elevation species and 1 0 0 004 28 for the lower elevational species respectively this is a deliberately simplistic model for illustrative purposes only the elevational ecotone was modeled on a one year time step using a 100 100 cell grid of 10 10 m cells each cell was assumed to support one adult tree age 15 tree death occurred randomly on cells with a probability of 0 02 yr to produce a mean lifespan of about 50 years trees colonized vacant cells no adult trees from the four cardinal locations with probability 0 2 year grid until year 15 when the tallest tree in the cell dominated and the others died colonization wrapped on a torus across the elevations horizontally the first tree to colonize did not necessarily occupy the site at year 15 if the other species grew better at that temperature and overtook it the elevational lapse rate was 20⁰c 1000 m this high lapse rate was chosen to allow an ecotone to develop in a reasonable sized grid the site was initialized by assigning each cell randomly to one of the two species with an initial age of 100 years and was then run to equilibrium to verify the ecotone location itself a relaxation response once equilibrium was established i conducted a warming experiment by adding 2 c to the elevational temperature gradient eq 2 and evaluated the rate of ecotone shift a second model was chosen to represent conditions away from an ecotone a metapopulation approach see talluto et al 2017 was used each of 1000 cells was initially occupied colonization and dispersal were modeled with universal dispersal not neighborhood within the simulated area which was not large parameters were changed at time 0 to colonization 0 02 and extinction 0 022 per cell per year again this is a deliberately simplistic model simply for illustration 3 results due to the long lifespan of trees it required almost 500 years for equilibrium to be reached from the initial random state fig 4 a at equilibrium average age of adult trees above the age 15 cutoff was approximately 50 years representing a young forest with high turnover for long lived trees the transient response can be much longer loehle 2000a adding disturbance or using other parameters would alter results after the step warming of 2 c the ecotone shifted smoothly over a 500 yr period fig 4b ecotone locations and shapes after 500 years were visually similar to the 500 year curve there was no sudden reduction in abundance or dieback at the trailing edge multiple repetitions of the simulation yielded results visually the same as fig 4 because the results are for purposes of illustration i did not calculate or present a measure of variance in time or in ecotone shape the point is that transition times are prolonged not sudden the metapopulation results are shown in fig 5 relaxation to the new stable state is clearly shown with a new equilibrium being reached in about 60 years this result is specific to the parameters chosen 4 discussion the ecotone simulations figs 4 5 illustrate two key facts about geographic ranges first a range boundary or ecotone can be governed by competition even when both species respond positively to warming even if the species grows better outside its current range in the absence of competition it will have a smaller realized niche due to the existence of competitors the existence of evolutionary growth tradeoffs loehle 1998 makes this likely in general this is the sdm paradox bioclimatic niche models can make correct range predictions both in the present and at future equilibrium without being correct about risk during transients second the relaxation response can be prolonged in the case simulated it took 500 years in spite of a clear competitive advantage for the warm habitat species either to relax from random to an ecotone or for the ecotone to respond after warming for longer lived species it would take even longer loehle 2000a in the metapopulation case relaxation took 60 years it is critical to explicitly state assumptions in climate change impact studies and assumptions that species must migrate to their new ideal range or perish may not be valid when studying transient response to change it is important to consider relaxation times at the trailing edge not just migration rates at the leading edge this study provides a framework for such analyses it is therefore suggested that following an equilibrium sdm or other analysis a relaxation analysis be applied to bridge the causal gap to infer risk to species otherwise projections of risk e g urban 2015 may suffer from an unrecognized bias funding all work was funded by national council

becomes related to generic social accords against industry overexploitation it is a rate measuring the physical advance of protected zones in contrast the rate α refers to industry annexation of zones for over exploitation concerning eq 2 there is a public attitude related to protection and on the other hand human requirements associated with depredation namely there are social pressures on both types of organizations connected to p and r in this sense dynamical scaling law eq 2 assumes that these pressures are in absolute terms equivalents as an example of such structures consider the coupled system of differential equations d p d t r p u g p r d u d t r p α r u g p r d r d t α r u g p r where g p r is a regular generic function the above set satisfies requirements 1 and 2 finally the technical analysis carried out in this paper also applies when equality in eq 2 is relaxed to be an approximation soft scaling finally other fixed points u 0 could be considered as attractors by relaxing eq 1 as p u r 1 or by putting a different initial condition formally on p containing the new value of u in any case only by simplicity in this article the asymptotic extreme case u 0 is

oceanic ranges for a practical example see mouillot and viale 2001 in this work we consider explicitly the oceanic surface case where dimensions x and y are not larger than two 3 oceanic parameter

sensitive to the number of spots provided that n 1 on the graph note that for x and y the maximal dimension value is d 2 it is a theoretical value since no vessel or animal reach these extreme patterns in fact fig 1 describes the worse scenario for wildlife the red hatched region between the curves represents the significant risk for wildlife where the fractional dimension of the depredation zone is larger than the protected one x y or p r corresponding to the well known tragedy of the commons de young and kaplan 1988 edney and harper 1978 hardin 1968 the green hatched region is the most appropriate for safety y x or r p note that formally the third dimension ocean depth is included in fig 1 assuming by the simplicity that it remains unaffected by industry depredation and prey do not hide there globally from 1990 to 2014 marine areas within national jurisdiction grew from 1 to 8 4 of the global ocean area unep wcmc at 2014 as an example more than 463 000 km2 of marine zones are today protected in chile petit et al 2018 thus a global value r 8 4 1 8 4 24 0 036 1 yr seems acceptable in contrast in the last 50 years the big animal populations of the world s oceans have been reduced by around 90 jackson 2008 myers and worm 2003 2005 assuming that the removed zone grows exponentially the corresponding estimate of the industry annexation rate is thus α 1 0 046 1 yr darimont et al 2015 gave a value for recent years of α 2 0 17 1 yr consequently an intermediate estimate of α 0 1 seems acceptable accordingly the annexations ratio can be obtained 7 α r 2 7 corresponding to the horizontal dashed blue line in fig 1 this sensible value can change because of other estimations for the annexation parameters or fluctuations nevertheless the conclusions do not differ significantly providing α r in accord with the current decimation context darimont et al 2015 isbell et al 2015 consider the case of narwhals monodon monoceros in west greenland and the eastern canadian high arctic kristin et al 2004 calculated the fractal dimensions for groups of narwhals using satellite tracking they found that fractal dimension is seasonal with mean average values of 1 61 in summer 1 69 in winter and 1 34 when narwhals are migrating black dots in fig 1 this result corresponds to a two phase scheme called exploitation relocation bénichou et al 2011 flores 2013 assigning

and 2 or equivalently eq 4 facing depredation machinery wildlife has more options when the entire overexploitation zone red is reduced or correctly shifted to this end two approaches exist strategy a is the conventional one strategy b is innovative a to diminish the ratio α r horizontal blue line in fig 1 requires enhancing the protection zones currently 8 4 for marine areas by sustained growth of the rate r alternatively reduction of the depredation rate α requires substantial international agreements donohue et al 2016 b a novel strategy is to reduce the fractional dimension associated with industry exploitation patterns hunter trajectories in fact for the industry the maximal fractional dimension allowed in the solution of eqs 1 and 2 is y d assuming d 2 for ocean surfaces in fig 1 consider that industry depredation is forced to a maximal fractional dimension d smaller than d in this case the first equation in 4 changes to 8 n x n d n y n d 1 fig 2 represents the case where the industry is compelled to maintain an oceanographic pattern hunter paths with for example maximum dimension d 1 5 intermediate between 1 a line and 2 the entire surface providing trajectories of dimension two are impracticable for vessels accordingly fig 2 is more realistic than fig 1 note that fishing vessels with fractal trajectories larger than dimension 1 35 are common in oceans enguehard et al 2012 consequently the curve associated with industry depredation red dots shifts to the left red curve red arrow in particular the black dashed rectangle related to narwhal patterns discussed above now falls partially out of the danger region this type of wildlife preservation mechanism is also expected to apply to other species 5 conclusions and outlooks global biodiversity decimation has been discussed in the literature darimont et al 2015 isbell et al 2015 suggesting alternative approaches to wildlife protection in the oceans as shown in this work if the industry machinery has to respect a suitable fractional dimension for hunting patterns then wildlife would obtain improved survival prospects crucially the above proposition does not inhibit depredation but gives wildlife better chances additionally at present low cost technologies to track ships telemetrically recording their trajectories exist making this proposal feasible as a simple proposed protocol general steps are a telemetric monitoring of vessel s paths b real time calculations of fractional trajectories dimension by an algorithm using for instance box counting procedure c alert to vessels violating maximal allowed fractional dimension generic dynamical system models support these conclusions eqs 1 and 2 or 4 including numerical solutions and a case study of narwhals in the high arctic this proposition involving fractional dimensions applies as well to other ecosystems in need of protection such as land vertebrates or amphibians note that i used an oceanic surface dimension of d 2 but the calculations are not restricted they could eventually be applied to wildlife with 0 d 3 and for industry 0 d 3 in eq 8 today protected uniform oceanic areas exist unep wcmc 2014 and wildlife can partially penetrate these regions therefore a mixed model fractional dimension and uniform regions seems realistic for practical applications of the proposed schema for wildlife conservation accurate estimations of parameters like the protection rate r or the overexploitation α must be still followed it also includes their respective probabilistic fluctuations and evolutions due to news technologies weinberger et al 2017 as long as there is human food demand resource exploitation continues then to protect wildlife what are the optimal entangled patterns described by x and y the oceanic intersection dimension between both patterns is d x y 2 and possibly any optimization strategy for protection exploitation becomes related to a reasonable choice for d in another context today monocrops occupy vast land areas frequently pollinators require a habitat with diverse flora so the decline of bees might partially stem from the loss of diversity kennedy et al 2013 the migratory relocation dimension for honey bees has been estimated to be 1 2 reynold et al 2007 thus inserting adequate flora patterns in crops with a suitable fractal dimension can help bee populations to

prey do not hide there globally from 1990 to 2014 marine areas within national jurisdiction grew from 1 to 8 4 of the global ocean area unep wcmc at 2014 as an example more than 463 000 km2 of marine zones are today protected in chile petit et al 2018 thus a global value r 8 4 1 8 4 24 0 036 1 yr seems acceptable in contrast in the last 50 years the big animal populations of the world s oceans have been reduced by around 90 jackson 2008 myers and worm 2003 2005 assuming that the removed zone grows exponentially the corresponding estimate of the industry annexation rate is thus α 1 0 046 1

corresponding to the horizontal dashed blue line in fig 1 this sensible value can change because of other estimations for the annexation parameters or fluctuations nevertheless the conclusions do not differ significantly providing α r in accord with the current decimation context darimont et al 2015 isbell et al 2015 consider the case of narwhals monodon monoceros in west greenland and the eastern canadian high arctic kristin et al 2004 calculated the fractal dimensions for groups of narwhals using satellite tracking they found that fractal dimension is seasonal with mean average values of 1 61 in summer 1 69 in winter and 1 34 when narwhals are migrating black dots in fig 1 this result corresponds to a two phase scheme called exploitation relocation bénichou et al 2011 flores 2013 assigning

the rate r alternatively reduction of the depredation rate α requires substantial international agreements donohue et al 2016 b a novel strategy is to reduce the fractional dimension associated with industry exploitation patterns hunter trajectories in fact for the industry the maximal fractional dimension allowed in the solution of eqs 1 and 2 is y d assuming d 2 for ocean surfaces in fig 1 consider that industry depredation is forced to a maximal fractional dimension d smaller than d in this case the first equation in 4 changes to 8 n x n d n y n d 1 fig 2 represents the case where the industry is compelled to maintain an oceanographic pattern hunter paths with for example maximum dimension d 1 5 intermediate between 1 a line and 2 the entire surface providing trajectories of dimension two are impracticable for vessels accordingly fig 2 is more realistic than fig 1 note that fishing vessels with fractal trajectories larger than dimension 1 35 are common in oceans enguehard et al 2012 consequently the curve associated with industry depredation red dots shifts to the left red curve red arrow in particular the black dashed rectangle related to narwhal patterns discussed above now falls partially out of the danger region this type of wildlife preservation mechanism is also expected to apply to other species 5 conclusions and outlooks global biodiversity decimation has been discussed in the literature darimont et al 2015 isbell et al 2015 suggesting alternative approaches to wildlife protection in the oceans as shown in this work if the industry machinery has to respect a suitable fractional dimension for hunting patterns then wildlife would obtain improved survival prospects crucially the above proposition does not inhibit depredation but gives wildlife better chances additionally at present low cost technologies to track ships telemetrically recording their trajectories exist making this proposal feasible as a simple proposed protocol general steps are a telemetric monitoring of vessel s paths b real time calculations of fractional trajectories dimension by an algorithm using for instance box counting procedure c alert to vessels violating maximal allowed fractional dimension generic dynamical system models support these conclusions eqs 1 and 2 or 4 including numerical solutions and a case study of narwhals in the high arctic this proposition involving fractional dimensions applies as well to other ecosystems in need of protection such as land vertebrates or amphibians note that i used an oceanic surface dimension of d 2 but the calculations are not restricted they could eventually be applied to wildlife with 0 d 3 and for industry 0 d 3 in eq 8 today protected uniform oceanic areas exist unep wcmc 2014 and wildlife can partially penetrate these regions therefore a mixed model fractional dimension and uniform regions seems realistic for practical applications of the proposed schema for wildlife conservation accurate estimations of parameters like the protection rate r or the overexploitation α must be still followed it also includes their respective probabilistic fluctuations and evolutions due to news technologies weinberger et al 2017 as long as there is human food demand resource exploitation continues then to protect wildlife what are the optimal entangled patterns described by x and y the oceanic intersection dimension between both patterns is d x y 2 and possibly any optimization strategy for protection exploitation becomes related to a reasonable choice for d in another context today monocrops occupy vast land areas frequently pollinators require a habitat with diverse flora so the decline of bees might partially stem from the loss of diversity kennedy et al 2013 the migratory relocation dimension for honey bees has been estimated to be 1 2 reynold et al 2007 thus inserting adequate flora patterns in crops with a suitable fractal dimension can help bee populations to

25232,the incorporation of the spatial heterogeneity of real landscapes into population dynamics remains extremely difficult we propose combining equation based modelling ebm and agent based modelling abm to overcome the difficulties classically encountered abm facilitates the description of entities that act according to specific rules evolving on various scales however a large number of entities may lead to computational difficulties e g for populations of small mammals such as voles that can exceed millions of individuals here ebm handles age structured population growth and abm represents the spreading of voles on large scales simulations applied to the spreading of a montane water vole population demonstrated that our model is quite efficient in representing the pattern observed and might help to highlight some key parameters during population expansion this method paves the way for further developments including the introduction of density dependent parameters predation diseases etc capable of triggering population declines in an explicitly spatial context keywords arvicola hybrid model dispersal travelling wave 1 introduction rodent populations are keystone species in most temperate ecosystems sustaining a large diversity of carnivores and other species benefiting from the role of rodents as ecosystem engineers delibes mateos et al 2011 rodents have been the focus of interest for humanity through history given the diseases they carry and their impact as pests in farmland forest and stored products buckle and smith 1994 vole population fluctuations of abundance in space and time have however evaded consistent explanations to date krebs 2013 because they are part of multifactorial socio ecological complex systems where multiscale spatial processes are crucial lidicker 2000 numerous processes can concurrently or synergistically shape patterns of population variations and spread on various spatial and temporal scales these processes include the impacts of weather and climate change johnson et al 2010 and resource depletion on mortality and or reproductive success as well as the effect of dispersion sherratt et al 2000 and density dependent factors such as prey predator and host parasite interactions ims and andreassen 2000 or sociality andreassen et al 2013 moreover mortality reproduction and dispersal are most often age specific furthermore rare events difficult to quantify in nature such as long distance dispersal can be critical in colonizing habitats far away from the average dispersal distance of the population and may explain why colonization fronts are often patchy and population spread appears saltatory a large number of studies have noted the role of landscape in shaping population dynamics in space and time e g lidicker 1995 delattre et al 1992 1999 giraudoux et al 1997 etc however the numerous factors and processes involved vary on multiple space scales and over the long term which is ill suited to most research programs phd level etc krebs 2013 as a consequence the lack of adaptable and realistic models able to be fitted to real landscapes prevents the development of tools that could be used to help make decisions on many issues for example rodent management and control delattre and giraudoux 2009 understanding the spatial dimensions of population dynamics is an endeavour in which the dialogue between theoretical and empirical studies has been particularly intense berthier et al 2014 one particular aspect of the spatial dimensions of population dynamics is dispersal the process by which organisms move settle and reproduce away from their birthplace when the environment is relatively homogeneous and the drivers and population structure are relatively simple models based on reaction diffusion equations have provided good descriptions of simple population spread driven e g by prey predator or host parasite relationships for instance reaction diffusion equations have been successfully used to explain complex patterns of populations fluctuating in synchrony but with a phase shift in space combining spatial temporal oscillations gives the appearance of a wave in population density called a traveling wave sherratt et al 2002 in this case landscape features seem instrumental in generating traveling waves sherratt et al 2002 2003 johnson and collinge 2004 when spatial heterogeneity rare individual events population structure and the different scales of factors occurring at different trophic levels are collectively important purely mathematical techniques equation based models ebm are overcome thus no general model has emerged to date that permits the forecasting of variations of small mammal population densities in a real landscape agent based modelling abm is a spatially explicit paradigm that models space as a heterogeneous environment e g crops grassland and forest patches in which individuals e g predators preys etc move and are represented as agents the latter are autonomous entities that move in the virtual space and interact with each other and environmental patches during the simulation dynamics emerge and can be observed and quantified abm is versatile and has the following advantages i data provided by a geographic information system gis are easily included ii model architecture is close to the ecological expert knowledge and iii operational outputs can be tracked and explored in various manners for example for decision making abm permits producing large scale models composed of several hundreds of thousands of interacting agents for instance a first object oriented simulation modelling system was proposed by westervelt and hopkins 1999 for the simulation of mobile individuals in landscapes furthermore using the almass system dalkvist et al 2011 investigated the joint effect of predation specialist versus generalist landscape fragmentation and breeding season using an agent based simulation model based on 4 types of regular fragmentation patterns and two habitats optimal and suboptimal in theoretical landscapes the study aimed to examine three descriptive endpoints including mean population size cycle length and amplitude and two mechanistic endpoints including direct and delayed density dependence but the pattern of population spreading in space was not assessed in agreement with the literature specialist predators generated delayed density dependence and vole population cycles whereas fragmentation and generalist predators dampened these effects furthermore using netlogo radchuk et al 2016 investigated the effect of predation only predation and sociality predation and dispersal and predation and both sociality and dispersal on the long term population dynamics of vole populations only the full model which included both intrinsic factors and predation yielded cycle periods amplitudes and autumn population sizes closest to those observed in nature suggesting that the individual based approach is useful for addressing the effects of social mechanisms on rodent populations at fine temporal and spatial scales however radchuk et al 2016 were mostly interested in the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on time processes and less interested in integrating real landscapes on a large range and in the spatial patterns potentially generated by population spreading these models bring to light microscopic and spatially complex dynamics that could not be modelled with ebm nevertheless computational limits are often exceeded with abm this problem frequently occurs in ecological studies where giant populations e g hundreds of thousands or millions of individuals here termed a megapopulation are at stake such as in small mammal populations on the other hand ebms allow for the quantification of the growth of such a large population but cannot easily integrate spatial e g land use soil and elevation and temporal e g seasonal variations heterogeneities subsequent changes in population age structure parameters and rare events such as individual long distance dispersal ebm and abm are top down and bottom up techniques that promote aggregative and descriptive methods edmonds and moss 2004 varenne and silberstein 2013 to model a complex system respectively models reproducing real phenomena deffuant et al 2015 franck 2012 developing at different scales are often constructed macroscopic models based on ebm are often opposite to microscopic models based on abm whereas the scale indicates only the perspective on the phenomena for example an abm provides a macroscopic perspective on a complex system whereas an ebm describes a part of this system e g mior masse et al 2007 vs momos pansu et al 2009 the observed boundaries that have been defended in past decades by scientific communities have been trimmed back in favour of coupling several modelling techniques into hybrid models osgood 2007 coupling ebm and abm provides the advantages of each approach spatial heterogeneity and individual dynamics for abm and population size and analytical solution for ebm while reducing their limitations limited population size for abm and spatial homogeneity for ebm banos et al 2017 in ecology the combined use of system dynamics and individual based modelling has been proposed by vincenot et al 2011 in cases where classes of systems are difficult or in some cases impossible to model dynamically using any of these approaches alone furthermore the implementation of a behavioural ecology case was achieved in theoretical landscapes of various patchiness vincenot et al 2015 and bradhurst et al 2015 developed a hybrid model employing ebm to model within herd spread of foot and mouth disease and a stochastic spatially explicit abm to model between herd spread and control in a number of farms here we propose coupling abm and ebm in a multiscale model to overcome these limits and as an example we seek to build a model to simulate the spread of a montane water vole arvicola scherman population in the haute romanche valley france the population surges of montane water voles have been studied in a number of mountain ranges in france giraudoux et al 1997 fichet calvet et al 2000 delattre and giraudoux 2009 berthier et al 2014 michelin et al 2014 halliez et al 2015 this work provides basic knowledge on the ecology of this species and its population dynamics the colonization of an alpine valley where the species was absent previously was observed from 1998 to 2010 halliez et al 2015 reaching peaks of 500 1000 voles ha and a total population of several hundreds of thousands to millions of individuals 2 study case observation and analysis 2 1 study case observation the empirical data were obtained from the hautes alpes in the subalpine and alpine zones of the upper romanche river valley and its tributaries until the occurrence of the first vole colony in 1998 at the end of the buffe valley 6 25e 45 08n the species was unknown in the romanche valley and the connected tributaries halliez et al 2015 given the proximity of the parc national des écrins and considering the potential risk to wildlife posed by the side effects of vole control the staff of the park carefully mapped the annual progress of the colonization from 1998 to 2010 until it reached the col du lautaret and stopped in the 13th year mapping was based on the observation of surface activity indices after the snowmelt which is a reliable indicator of variations in vole abundance giraudoux et al 1995 1997 berthier et al 2014 this unique situation of primary colonization made it possible to know the characteristics of an invasion pattern of a valley from a known starting point the end of the buffe valley over a surface area of approximately 2500 ha constrained by the relief of valleys 2 1 1 population characteristics age categories and reproductive status are derived from quéré and le louarn 2011 pascal and boujard 1987 cerqueira et al 2006 quéré unpublished based on breedings and villette unpublished based on captures in nature young voles become juveniles after 18 days and juveniles become adults at 56 days post birth adults and juveniles reproduce if they are not dispersing the sex ratio in the arvicola terrestris population is 1 1 pascal and boujard 1987 cerqueira et al 2006 reproductive females defend territory and organize in family groups among which males roam quéré and le louarn 2011 population spreading is obviously dependent on the settlement of at least one pregnant female able to grow a population here we modelled only the female population assuming that the number of males is never a limiting factor for reproduction under natural conditions 2 1 2 population growth dynamics the basic reproduction number r 0 is 0 0165 females per female day during the reproduction season april october and is based on typical reproduction rates observed in natural populations quéré and le louarn 2011 after krebs 2013 vole mortality is between 0 04 and 0 6 per 2 weeks and juvenile and young mortality is 1 3 times larger than that for adults when the population peaks vole population density can reach hundreds of individuals ha 2 1 3 spatial dynamics and short long distance dispersal most vole individuals range within an approximately 100 m2 area to feed and reproduce when the population reaches a threshold defined as a fraction of the carrying capacity stress can lead to long distance dispersal for a fraction of the vole population saucy and schneiter 1998 fisher et al 2009 via two mechanisms namely i over a short distance and ii over a long distance for a fraction of vole agents on this scale vole dispersal is channelized by topography berthier et al 2005 2014 vole mortality is high during this life phase the vole population discovered in 1998 at its initial stage of colonization already covered a 6 6 ha area 2 2 modelling assumptions in natural conditions population dynamics are the result of numerous interactions among voles predators diseases weather etc to be understandable and computable these interactions must be simplified but simplification must be kept as close as possible to the real processes involved considering the ecological parameters described above and the research goals we made the following assumptions the landscape was assumed to be homogeneous and divided into 100 m 100 m cells each with a maximum carrying capacity of 500 females we will introduce heterogeneous space loaded from a gis in further studies topography here slope constrains vole movements mobility within a cell is the result of foraging activity and has no impact on territory colonization only inter cell mobilities were taken into account in the model at the individual scale and above a population density threshold the age distribution of voles impacts territory colonization dynamics because juveniles are the only voles dispersing over long distances the age distribution of voles impacts population growth because juveniles and adults are the only voles reproducing in this project the main difficulties included describing both the population behaviour namely vole population growth dynamics and individual behaviour namely vole movements of a megapopulation thus an ebm was combined with an abm by using coupling based techniques ebm permits the use of the commonly used logistic demographic model for population growth and abm focuses on individual vole movements across the landscape a small fraction of the juvenile vole population disperses over long distances thus requiring individual based modelling we designed a novel scale transfer modelling approach that permits i the disaggregation of this population fraction into individuals to model long distance mobilities and ii the aggregation of juvenile individuals into a population when they find a suitable place for settlement this strategy permits tremendous savings of computational resources and the ability to take advantage of available ecological models and data 3 odd description of the model in this section the model is described following the overview design concepts and details odd protocol described by grimm et al 2010 3 1 overview 3 1 1 purpose the model intends to simulate and represent the colonization of a large area an alpine valley by a vole population 3 1 2 entities state variables and scales the model is based on coupling agent based techniques as promoted in hassoumi et al 2012 and banos et al 2017 the logistic demographic model and model of individual vole movements are also introduced as two types of agents called cell agents and vole agents respectively cell agent the model space is a grid of 100 m 100 m cells 3115 cells in total that functions as a trade off among ecological knowledge computational performance and model processing each cell is an agent that handles both the vole populations living in it and the map features e g altitude and habitat the population living inside a cell is partitioned into three compartments young individuals juveniles and adults given the age structure of the population i young corresponding to an age of 1 18 days ii juvenile corresponding to an age of 19 days to 56 days and iii adult after 56 days the young and juvenile compartments are arrays representing each one day age class of the compartment for example the young vole population is distributed in an array of eighteen elements young individuals become juveniles after 18 days each corresponding to an age 1 18 days fig 1 provides an overview of the architecture of cell agents vole agent this agent type models vole dispersal i e individuals moving in space to settle those individuals move on the ground and are caught easily by predators therefore voles are modelled by agents that are driven by moving behaviours and mortality 3 1 3 process overview and scheduling one simulation step represents one day in the real system the scheduling of agent execution is shuffled at each simulation step cell agent given the carrying capacity of a cell k the two reproducing populations j juvenile and a adult and the young population y a logistic equation based model determines the growth of the young population for each new simulated day each population of a given age is pushed from one array category to the following upper category in the array see fig 1 the mortality rate includes both predation and disease this is a simulation parameter so one can change it to observe its impact population growth leads to competition for space when the population reaches a threshold the voles are stressed and a fraction of the juvenile population disperses this dispersing population develops according to individual behaviours which explains why this population is disaggregated into a set of vole agents a fraction of those agents are long distance dispersers and the others are short distance dispersers 3 2 design concepts 3 2 1 emergence we observe a colonisation constrained by space elevation and carrying capacity and driven by population growth and individual movements 3 2 2 sensing cell agents perceive their internal vole population to i create vole agents when the stock approaches a given threshold and ii apply the internal population growth vole agents perceive whether free space exists in the current cell to settle down if space is available the voles integrate in the population 3 2 3 interaction an indirect interaction exists between vole agents resulting in spatial competition when an agent integrates the population in a cell it fills a room that is no longer available for another mobile agent moreover by increasing the size of the population in the cell the growth of the population is modified 3 2 4 stochasticity cell agent behaviour is stochastic for creating long distance short distance vole agents according to a given rate vole agent behaviour is stochastic for moving behaviour a stochastic rule that takes the space elevation into account permitting the selection of the direction of the motion the scheduling of agent execution is shuffled at each simulation step 3 2 5 observation model outputs were chosen to allow for calibration against observed patterns and compute unknown parameters table 1 to visualize vole population dynamics our model produces bitmaps and esri shapefiles with the parameters of each cell and the location of each vole dispersing at a given time numerical outputs provide information on population including population size in each age class and colonization speed 3 3 details model parameters and model outputs were chosen both i to understand vole population dynamics by fitting them to variable estimates observed in empirical studies and ii to evaluate strategies as a response to stakeholder problems vole control etc 3 3 1 initialization table 2 presents the model initialization parameters a number of ecological factors are derived from data in the literature or from expert knowledge beliefs about the real system reproduction season population age classes population growth rates mortality rates and carrying capacity other factors are calibrated secondarily by model exploration dispersal threshold and long distance dispersal 3 3 2 input data vole colonization maps were provided as shapefiles by the parc naturel national des écrins and the communauté de communes du briançonnais whose staff monitor vole populations according to protocols designed with one of the authors pg and described in halliez et al 2015 altitudes were derived from the aster global digital elevation model v2 30 m resolution https lpdaac usgs gov node 1079 vole life history traits were issued from various sources described in sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 and summarized in table 2 3 3 3 submodels cell agent a logistic equation based model determines the growth of the young population for each cell agent 1 dy dt α 1 j a y k j a with α the population growth rate new individual per day per parent individual y the number of young voles inside the current cell agent j the number of juvenile voles inside the current cell agent a the number of adult voles inside the current cell agent k the carrying capacity vole agent the dispersing population is subtracted from the juvenile population of the current cell and transformed to a set of vole individuals moving independently where and when a vole agent identified a place to settle where and when the carrying capacity of the overlapping cell is less than the threshold the agent is aggregated into the juvenile population of the cell two different dispersal behaviours are identified short distance dispersal a brownian random walk constrained by space topology see fig 2 the vole agent moves cell by cell from a cell the agent randomly chooses the next neighbouring cells according to their elevation the probability of moving to an equal or lower elevation is 2 3 this behaviour is applied to each vole agent at each step long distance dispersal a random movement to a large ring see fig 3 the vole agent makes a random selection of a cell inside a ring e g default radii 160 m internal and 6 km external cantered on its current cell and moves to the selected cell this behaviour is applied at the vole agent creation step predation behaviour is quantified as mortality specific to moving voles voles move for one or a few days to settle for the sake of simplicity other sources of mortality are assumed to be negligible here vole agents are randomly destroyed according to a fixed rate of 50 daily 4 experiments and results an exploration was conducted first to assess the stability of the model and then to obtain the ecological results this exploration was performed using quantum gis 2 18 7 to manage the spatial databases the gama 1 7 0 platform to develop the agent based simulator r 3 3 0 and the package gamar https github com choisy gamar to generate the experiment plan and the cluster of the mesocentre de calcul of franche comté university to execute the simulation batches 4 1 experimental design here the aim was to run simulations to identify which combination of parameter values can lead to the observed colonization patterns speed of population spread population densities and age structure in total 6059 simulations each for a simulated duration of 14 years 5110 steps were prepared combining random parameter values in their respective ranges table 2 thirty cores in the cluster were dedicated to the experiment the results were obtained after 4 6 days one complete simulation was computed in 33 minutes on average model implementation data and experiments are available at https github com gnoubi votrawa releases 4 2 ecological results analysis in total 95 of the 6059 random simulations led to population extinction or an extremely slow spread 50 ha year in addition 0 5 exceeded 230 ha year twenty seven simulations exhibited a population spreading speed ranging between 190 and 230 ha year which is compatible with reaching the col du lautaret on the 13th year fig 4 frequently colonization speed varied alternating between slow down and acceleration periods fig 5 presents a map that demonstrates the colonization pattern obtained the maximum population size per cell completely correlated to the dispersal threshold r 0 99 p 0 001 indicating that dispersal and the large mortality of dispersers 0 5 per day compensated for any population increase greater than this threshold subsequently the 27 simulations yielded maximum population densities bracketed between 125 and 596 ind ha fig 6 a generally realistic figure compared with field observations population densities during outbreak can reach 1000 ind ha hence 500 females and noticeable damage in grassland occurs when population exceeds 100 200 ind ha giraudoux et al 1995 those densities correspond to the populations scores recorded in the upper romanche valley halliez et al 2015 the parameter values are presented in fig 7 no simple single combination of parameter values provides the expected spreading speed a number of simulations have younger and juvenile mortality values that fall within the first half of their possible ranges suggesting that these mortality categories can represent limiting factors to dispersal moreover no simulation with a maximum long distance dispersal less than 1105 m achieved the expected population spreading speed indicating the importance of this parameter in population dynamics and colonization to understand how parameter values combine and determine the speed of population spread the speed of population spread was modelled against the 6 parameters of fig 7 and their interactions using a general linear model with a gaussian link function then an optimal model was searched by backward and forward stepwise selection using the akaike information criterion no variables or interactions could be excluded and no model simplification was obtained the full model explained 74 of the total deviance and the model with no interactions explained less than 20 these results clearly demonstrated that population spread speed is determined by complex multiplicative effects between parameters in our model fig 8 presents an example of age structure variations and population growth over time seasonal population decreases can be observed each winter corresponding to reproduction cessation from november to march this result is consistent with that actually observed in natural populations the proportion of short distance dispersers never exceeded 0 5 of the total population or 0 1 of long distance dispersers given that the population in cells n 3115 peaked at 675 922 individuals the total number of disperser agents only peaked at 3662 this is a critical advantage of this model from a computational viewpoint 4 3 model stability analysis model stability was assessed by using 100 different random seeds on experiment 72 one of the twenty seven experiments yielding a speed of population spread compatible with the observed pattern see supplementary material for parameter values post hoc resampling with replacement revealed that the variance of the speed of population spread stabilized using a minimum of 30 samples fig 9 for a mean speed of 224 ha year the standard deviation was 1 9 hence the speed of population spread remains in the range of 190 230 ha year regardless of the seed value indicating very good model robustness for stochasticity 5 discussion our model combines mathematical equations for the management of populations in cells and multi agent systems for the management of dispersing individuals this model outlines a promising method to model large scale systems by engaging various dynamics at different scales the combination of ebm and abm has many advantages i a modelling advantage resulting from easing dynamic representation incorporating different types of data and model entities at different scales e g landscape population and life history traits individuals and ii a computer processing advantage resulting from reducing the number of agents and increasing model velocity compared to earlier attempts of modelling vole population dynamics our model overcomes the following the computational difficulty of modelling vole megapopulations millions of individuals using abm which is necessary over large areas of interest e g farmland landscapes in which populations should be managed the difficulty of modelling population spread using ebm in real landscapes where i landscape heterogeneity ii rare events iii population structure and iv processes occurring at various scales must be altogether taken into account it would be interesting to compare the results obtained in the present study with those produced by a full abm however this comparison cannot be performed on the actual scale at which populations are observed several hundreds of square kilometres we assume that the results should be globally similar but perhaps exhibit some differences in terms of development cost in favour of the coupled model and accuracy in favour of an abm thierry et al 2015 if necessary other equations could be introduced e g to take into account other phenomena that might drive vole dispersal for example we should model weather storms are more likely to trigger massive dispersal events saucy and schneiter 1998 or microscopic entities that have an influence on soil e g resistance to digging tunnels pathogens and pre existing mole tunnels delattre et al 2006 in this case the model would include even more scales and would call for a specific organization of calculations and links between different scales explicit social rules are lacking in our model however this is an active research area in abm tampuu et al 2017 lucien et al 2016 golpayegani et al 2016 radchuk et al 2016 demonstrated that incorporating sociality with predation and dispersal can improve model fitness to observed data for a number of vole population dynamics sociality was not necessary in our model considering current knowledge about arvicola scherman giraudoux et al 2017 however the addition of social classes and sex categories andreassen et al 2013 with specific processes in a cell agent would be quite easy using the same population partitioning method employed for age classes in the present work in reality most social rules are expected to be applicable to settled and just settling individuals and these rules are implicitly integrated in cell population growth in our model various behaviours resulting from social interactions among voles can also be easily added to vole agents however in this case these behaviours would exclusively concern the dispersal fraction of the population which would poorly reflect reality here for the sake of simplicity we considered a homogeneous habitat with the exception of slope but importing a shapefile describing habitats with specific attributes such as various values of k dispersal thresholds and mortality is possible e g to account for the differences between optimal and suboptimal habitats tilled plots versus meadows high versus low plant productivity altitude the length of reproduction season etc the model does not take into account the fact that mortality is generally density dependent this limitation leads to every cell saturating to a maximum level derived from k dispersal threshold and mortality with no population decrease we plan to add a predation agent moving on a large scale and or a density dependent contagious disease to produce realistic population declines and determine how these factors can create traveling waves or cyclicity as observed in natural conditions such an endeavour may help to provide models for research that address the question of how landscapes can impact population dynamic processes in space and time based on real landscape data these models can help farmers to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of population surges and simulate the impacts of landscape changes or direct control e g chemical on small mammal populations interestingly among thousands of random simulations it appears that very few less than 5 lead to the observed population propagation speed all of the simulations that achieve this goal result from parameter configurations that can be fitted using general linear models indicating that the speed of population spread can be modelled as complex non linear relationships between parameters moreover our results indicate the importance of a small fraction of long distance dispersers in population spread and that different configurations can lead to the same effect for the other parameters this approach might help field ecologists determine which parameter configuration corresponds to what actually occurs in the field by developing hypothesis driven observations experiments in an explicitly spatial and temporal context such a method is of prime importance in for

25232,the incorporation of the spatial heterogeneity of real landscapes into population dynamics remains extremely difficult we propose combining equation based modelling ebm and agent based modelling abm to overcome the difficulties classically encountered abm facilitates the description of entities that act according to specific rules evolving on various scales however a large number of entities may lead to computational difficulties e g for populations of small mammals such as voles that can exceed millions of individuals here ebm handles age structured population growth and abm represents the spreading of voles on large scales simulations applied to the spreading of a montane water vole population demonstrated that our model is quite efficient in representing the pattern observed and might help to highlight some key parameters during population expansion this method paves the way for further developments including the introduction of density dependent parameters predation diseases etc capable of triggering population declines in an explicitly spatial context keywords arvicola hybrid model dispersal travelling wave 1 introduction rodent populations are keystone species in most temperate ecosystems sustaining a large diversity of carnivores and other species benefiting from the role of rodents as ecosystem engineers delibes mateos et al 2011 rodents have been the focus of interest for humanity through history given the diseases they carry and their impact as pests in farmland forest and stored products buckle and smith 1994 vole population fluctuations of abundance in space and time have however evaded consistent explanations to date krebs 2013 because they are part of multifactorial socio ecological complex systems where multiscale spatial processes are crucial lidicker 2000 numerous processes can concurrently or synergistically shape patterns of population variations and spread on various spatial and temporal scales these processes include the impacts of weather and climate change johnson et al 2010 and resource depletion on mortality and or reproductive success as well as the effect of dispersion sherratt et al 2000 and density dependent factors such as prey predator and host parasite interactions ims and andreassen 2000 or sociality andreassen et al 2013 moreover mortality reproduction and dispersal are most often age specific furthermore rare events difficult to quantify in nature such as long distance dispersal can be critical in colonizing habitats far away from the average dispersal distance of the population and may explain why colonization fronts are often patchy and population spread appears saltatory a large number of studies have noted the role of landscape in shaping population dynamics in space and time e g lidicker 1995 delattre et al 1992 1999 giraudoux et al 1997 etc however the numerous factors and processes involved vary on multiple space scales and over the long term which is ill suited to most research programs phd level etc krebs 2013 as a consequence the lack of adaptable and realistic models able to be fitted to real landscapes prevents the development of tools that could be used to help make decisions on many issues for example rodent management and control delattre and giraudoux 2009 understanding the spatial dimensions of population dynamics is an endeavour in which the dialogue between theoretical and empirical studies has been particularly intense berthier et al 2014 one particular aspect of the spatial dimensions of population dynamics is dispersal the process by which organisms move settle and reproduce away from their birthplace when the environment is relatively homogeneous and the drivers and population structure are relatively simple models based on reaction diffusion equations have provided good descriptions of simple population spread driven e g by prey predator or host parasite relationships for instance reaction diffusion equations have been successfully used to explain complex patterns of populations fluctuating in synchrony but with a phase shift in space combining spatial temporal oscillations gives the appearance of a wave in population density called a traveling wave sherratt et al 2002 in this case landscape features seem instrumental in generating traveling waves sherratt et al 2002 2003 johnson and collinge 2004 when spatial heterogeneity rare individual events population structure and the different scales of factors occurring at different trophic levels are collectively important purely mathematical techniques equation based models ebm are overcome thus no general model has emerged to date that permits the forecasting of variations of small mammal population densities in a real landscape agent based modelling abm is a spatially explicit paradigm that models space as a heterogeneous environment e g crops grassland and forest patches in which individuals e g predators preys etc move and are represented as agents the latter are autonomous entities that move in the virtual space and interact with each other and environmental patches during the simulation dynamics emerge and can be observed and quantified abm is versatile and has the following advantages i data provided by a geographic information system gis are easily included ii model architecture is close to the ecological expert knowledge and iii operational outputs can be tracked and explored in various manners for example for decision making abm permits producing large scale models composed of several hundreds of thousands of interacting agents for instance a first object oriented simulation modelling system was proposed by westervelt and hopkins 1999 for the simulation of mobile individuals in landscapes furthermore using the almass system dalkvist et al 2011 investigated the joint effect of predation specialist versus generalist landscape fragmentation and breeding season using an agent based simulation model based on 4 types of regular fragmentation patterns and two habitats optimal and suboptimal in theoretical landscapes the study aimed to examine three descriptive endpoints including mean population size cycle length and amplitude and two mechanistic endpoints including direct and delayed density dependence but the pattern of population spreading in space was not assessed in agreement with the literature specialist predators generated delayed density dependence and vole population cycles whereas fragmentation and generalist predators dampened these effects furthermore using netlogo radchuk et al 2016 investigated the effect of predation only predation and sociality predation and dispersal and predation and both sociality and dispersal on the long term population dynamics of vole populations only the full model which included both intrinsic factors and predation yielded cycle periods amplitudes and autumn population sizes closest to those observed in nature suggesting that the individual based approach is useful for addressing the effects of social mechanisms on rodent populations at fine temporal and spatial scales however radchuk et al 2016 were mostly interested in the effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on time processes and less interested in integrating real landscapes on a large range and in the spatial patterns potentially generated by population spreading these models bring to light microscopic and spatially complex dynamics that could not be modelled with ebm nevertheless computational limits are often exceeded with abm this problem frequently occurs in ecological studies where giant populations e g hundreds of thousands or millions of individuals here termed a megapopulation are at stake such as in small mammal populations on the other hand ebms allow for the quantification of the growth of such a large population but cannot easily integrate spatial e g land use soil and elevation and temporal e g seasonal variations heterogeneities subsequent changes in population age structure parameters and rare events such as individual long distance dispersal ebm and abm are top down and bottom up techniques that promote aggregative and descriptive methods edmonds and moss 2004 varenne and silberstein 2013 to model a complex system respectively models reproducing real phenomena deffuant et al 2015 franck 2012 developing at different scales are often constructed macroscopic models based on ebm are often opposite to microscopic models based on abm whereas the scale indicates only the perspective on the phenomena for example an abm provides a macroscopic perspective on a complex system whereas an ebm describes a part of this system e g mior masse et al 2007 vs momos pansu et al 2009 the observed boundaries that have been defended in past decades by scientific communities have been trimmed back in favour of coupling several modelling techniques into hybrid models osgood 2007 coupling ebm and abm provides the advantages of each approach spatial heterogeneity and individual dynamics for abm and population size and analytical solution for ebm while reducing their limitations limited population size for abm and spatial homogeneity for ebm banos et al 2017 in ecology the combined use of system dynamics and individual based modelling has been proposed by vincenot et al 2011 in cases where classes of systems are difficult or in some cases impossible to model dynamically using any of these approaches alone furthermore the implementation of a behavioural ecology case was achieved in theoretical landscapes of various patchiness vincenot et al 2015 and bradhurst et al 2015 developed a hybrid model employing ebm to model within herd spread of foot and mouth disease and a stochastic spatially explicit abm to model between herd spread and control in a number of farms here we propose coupling abm and ebm in a multiscale model to overcome these limits and as an example we seek to build a model to simulate the spread of a montane water vole arvicola scherman population in the haute romanche valley france the population surges of montane water voles have been studied in a number of mountain ranges in france giraudoux et al 1997 fichet calvet et al 2000 delattre and giraudoux 2009 berthier et al 2014 michelin et al 2014 halliez et al 2015 this work provides basic knowledge on the ecology of this species and its population dynamics the colonization of an alpine valley where the species was absent previously was observed from 1998 to 2010 halliez et al 2015 reaching peaks of 500 1000 voles ha and a total population of several hundreds of thousands to millions of individuals 2 study case observation and analysis 2 1 study case observation the empirical data were obtained from the hautes alpes in the subalpine and alpine zones of the upper romanche river valley and its tributaries until the occurrence of the first vole colony in 1998 at the end of the buffe valley 6 25e 45 08n the species was unknown in the romanche valley and the connected tributaries halliez et al 2015 given the proximity of the parc national des écrins and considering the potential risk to wildlife posed by the side effects of vole control the staff of the park carefully mapped the annual progress of the colonization from 1998 to 2010 until it reached the col du lautaret and stopped in the 13th year mapping was based on the observation of surface activity indices after the snowmelt which is a reliable indicator of variations in vole abundance giraudoux et al 1995 1997 berthier et al 2014 this unique situation of primary colonization made it possible to know the characteristics of an invasion pattern of a valley from a known starting point the end of the buffe valley over a surface area of approximately 2500 ha constrained by the relief of valleys 2 1 1 population characteristics age categories and reproductive status are derived from quéré and le louarn 2011 pascal and boujard 1987 cerqueira et al 2006 quéré unpublished based on breedings and villette unpublished based on captures in nature young voles become juveniles after 18 days and juveniles become adults at 56 days post birth adults and juveniles reproduce if they are not dispersing the sex ratio in the arvicola terrestris population is 1 1 pascal and boujard 1987 cerqueira et al 2006 reproductive females defend territory and organize in family groups among which males roam quéré and le louarn 2011 population spreading is obviously dependent on the settlement of at least one pregnant female able to grow a population here we modelled only the female population assuming that the number of males is never a limiting factor for reproduction under natural conditions 2 1 2 population growth dynamics the basic reproduction number r 0 is 0 0165 females per female day during the reproduction season april october and is based on typical reproduction rates observed in natural populations quéré and le louarn 2011 after krebs 2013 vole mortality is between 0 04 and 0 6 per 2 weeks and juvenile and young mortality is 1 3 times larger than that for adults when the population peaks vole population density can reach hundreds of individuals ha 2 1 3 spatial dynamics and short long distance dispersal most vole individuals range within an approximately 100 m2 area to feed and reproduce when the population reaches a threshold defined as a fraction of the carrying capacity stress can lead to long distance dispersal for a fraction of the vole population saucy and schneiter 1998 fisher et al 2009 via two mechanisms namely i over a short distance and ii over a long distance for a fraction of vole agents on this scale vole dispersal is channelized by topography berthier et al 2005 2014 vole mortality is high during this life phase the vole population discovered in 1998 at its initial stage of colonization already covered a 6 6 ha area 2 2 modelling assumptions in natural conditions population dynamics are the result of numerous interactions among voles predators diseases weather etc to be understandable and computable these interactions must be simplified but simplification must be kept as close as possible to the real processes involved considering the ecological parameters described above and the research goals we made the following assumptions the landscape was assumed to be homogeneous and divided into 100 m 100 m cells each with a maximum carrying capacity of 500 females we will introduce heterogeneous space loaded from a gis in further studies topography here slope constrains vole movements mobility within a cell is the result of foraging activity and has no impact on territory colonization only inter cell mobilities were taken into account in the model at the individual scale and above a population density threshold the age distribution of voles impacts territory colonization dynamics because juveniles are the only voles dispersing over long distances the age distribution of voles impacts population growth because juveniles and adults are the only voles reproducing in this project the main difficulties included describing both the population behaviour namely vole population growth dynamics and individual behaviour namely vole movements of a megapopulation thus an ebm was combined with an abm by using coupling based techniques ebm permits the use of the commonly used logistic demographic model for population growth and abm focuses on individual vole movements across the landscape a small fraction of the juvenile vole population disperses over long distances thus requiring individual based modelling we designed a novel scale transfer modelling approach that permits i the disaggregation of this population fraction into individuals to model long distance mobilities and ii the aggregation of juvenile individuals into a population when they find a suitable place for settlement this strategy permits tremendous savings of computational resources and the ability to take advantage of available ecological models and data 3 odd description of the model in this section the model is described following the overview design concepts and details odd protocol described by grimm et al 2010 3 1 overview 3 1 1 purpose the model intends to simulate and represent the colonization of a large area an alpine valley by a vole population 3 1 2 entities state variables and scales the model is based on coupling agent based techniques as promoted in hassoumi et al 2012 and banos et al 2017 the logistic demographic model and model of individual vole movements are also introduced as two types of agents called cell agents and vole agents respectively cell agent the model space is a grid of 100 m 100 m cells 3115 cells in total that functions as a trade off among ecological knowledge computational performance and model processing each cell is an agent that handles both the vole populations living in it and the map features e g altitude and habitat the population living inside a cell is partitioned into three compartments young individuals juveniles and adults given the age structure of the population i young corresponding to an age of 1 18 days ii juvenile corresponding to an age of 19 days to 56 days and iii adult after 56 days the young and juvenile compartments are arrays representing each one day age class of the compartment for example the young vole population is distributed in an array of eighteen elements young individuals become juveniles after 18 days each corresponding to an age 1 18 days fig 1 provides an overview of the architecture of cell agents vole agent this agent type models vole dispersal i e individuals moving in space to settle those individuals move on the ground and are caught easily by predators therefore voles are modelled by agents that are driven by moving behaviours and mortality 3 1 3 process overview and scheduling one simulation step represents one day in the real system the scheduling of agent execution is shuffled at each simulation step cell agent given the carrying capacity of a cell k the two reproducing populations j juvenile and a adult and the young population y a logistic equation based model determines the growth of the young population for each new simulated day each population of a given age is pushed from one array category to the following upper category in the array see fig 1 the mortality rate includes both predation and disease this is a simulation parameter so one can change it to observe its impact population growth leads to competition for space when the population reaches a threshold the voles are stressed and a fraction of the juvenile population disperses this dispersing population develops according to individual behaviours which explains why this population is disaggregated into a set of vole agents a fraction of those agents are long distance dispersers and the others are short distance dispersers 3 2 design concepts 3 2 1 emergence we observe a colonisation constrained by space elevation and carrying capacity and driven by population growth and individual movements 3 2 2 sensing cell agents perceive their internal vole population to i create vole agents when the stock approaches a given threshold and ii apply the internal population growth vole agents perceive whether free space exists in the current cell to settle down if space is available the voles integrate in the population 3 2 3 interaction an indirect interaction exists between vole agents resulting in spatial competition when an agent integrates the population in a cell it fills a room that is no longer available for another mobile agent moreover by increasing the size of the population in the cell the growth of the population is modified 3 2 4 stochasticity cell agent behaviour is stochastic for creating long distance short distance vole agents according to a given rate vole agent behaviour is stochastic for moving behaviour a stochastic rule that takes the space elevation into account permitting the selection of the direction of the motion the scheduling of agent execution is shuffled at each simulation step 3 2 5 observation model outputs were chosen to allow for calibration against observed patterns and compute unknown parameters table 1 to visualize vole population dynamics our model produces bitmaps and esri shapefiles with the parameters of each cell and the location of each vole dispersing at a given time numerical outputs provide information on population including population size in each age class and colonization speed 3 3 details model parameters and model outputs were chosen both i to understand vole population dynamics by fitting them to variable estimates observed in empirical studies and ii to evaluate strategies as a response to stakeholder problems vole control etc 3 3 1 initialization table 2 presents the model initialization parameters a number of ecological factors are derived from data in the literature or from expert knowledge beliefs about the real system reproduction season population age classes population growth rates mortality rates and carrying capacity other factors are calibrated secondarily by model exploration dispersal threshold and long distance dispersal 3 3 2 input data vole colonization maps were provided as shapefiles by the parc naturel national des écrins and the communauté de communes du briançonnais whose staff monitor vole populations according to protocols designed with one of the authors pg and described in halliez et al 2015 altitudes were derived from the aster global digital elevation model v2 30 m resolution https lpdaac usgs gov node 1079 vole life history traits were issued from various sources described in sections 2 1 1 and 2 1 2 and summarized in table 2 3 3 3 submodels cell agent a logistic equation based model determines the growth of the young population for each cell agent 1 dy dt α 1 j a y k j a with α the population growth rate new individual per day per parent individual y the number of young voles inside the current cell agent j the number of juvenile voles inside the current cell agent a the number of adult voles inside the current cell agent k the carrying capacity vole agent the dispersing population is subtracted from the juvenile population of the current cell and transformed to a set of vole individuals moving independently where and when a vole agent identified a place to settle where and when the carrying capacity of the overlapping cell is less than the threshold the agent is aggregated into the juvenile population of the cell two different dispersal behaviours are identified short distance dispersal a brownian random walk constrained by space topology see fig 2 the vole agent moves cell by cell from a cell the agent randomly chooses the next neighbouring cells according to their elevation the probability of moving to an equal or lower elevation is 2 3 this behaviour is applied to each vole agent at each step long distance dispersal a random movement to a large ring see fig 3 the vole agent makes a random selection of a cell inside a ring e g default radii 160 m internal and 6 km external cantered on its current cell and moves to the selected cell this behaviour is applied at the vole agent creation step predation behaviour is quantified as mortality specific to moving voles voles move for one or a few days to settle for the sake of simplicity other sources of mortality are assumed to be negligible here vole agents are randomly destroyed according to a fixed rate of 50 daily 4 experiments and results an exploration was conducted first to assess the stability of the model and then to obtain the ecological results this exploration was performed using quantum gis 2 18 7 to manage the spatial databases the gama 1 7 0 platform to develop the agent based simulator r 3 3 0 and the package gamar https github com choisy gamar to generate the experiment plan and the cluster of the mesocentre de calcul of franche comté university to execute the simulation batches 4 1 experimental design here the aim was to run simulations to identify which combination of parameter values can lead to the observed colonization patterns speed of population spread population densities and age structure in total 6059 simulations each for a simulated duration of 14 years 5110 steps were prepared combining random parameter values in their respective ranges table 2 thirty cores in the cluster were dedicated to the experiment the results were obtained after 4 6 days one complete simulation was computed in 33 minutes on average model implementation data and experiments are available at https github com gnoubi votrawa releases 4 2 ecological results analysis in total 95 of the 6059 random simulations led to population extinction or an extremely slow spread 50 ha year in addition 0 5 exceeded 230 ha year twenty seven simulations exhibited a population spreading speed ranging between 190 and 230 ha year which is compatible with reaching the col du lautaret on the 13th year fig 4 frequently colonization speed varied alternating between slow down and acceleration periods fig 5 presents a map that demonstrates the colonization pattern obtained the maximum population size per cell completely correlated to the dispersal threshold r 0 99 p 0 001 indicating that dispersal and the large mortality of dispersers 0 5 per day compensated for any population increase greater than this threshold subsequently the 27 simulations yielded maximum population densities bracketed between 125 and 596 ind ha fig 6 a generally realistic figure compared with field observations population densities during outbreak can reach 1000 ind ha hence 500 females and noticeable damage in grassland occurs when population exceeds 100 200 ind ha giraudoux et al 1995 those densities correspond to the populations scores recorded in the upper romanche valley halliez et al 2015 the parameter values are presented in fig 7 no simple single combination of parameter values provides the expected spreading speed a number of simulations have younger and juvenile mortality values that fall within the first half of their possible ranges suggesting that these mortality categories can represent limiting factors to dispersal moreover no simulation with a maximum long distance dispersal less than 1105 m achieved the expected population spreading speed indicating the importance of this parameter in population dynamics and colonization to understand how parameter values combine and determine the speed of population spread the speed of population spread was modelled against the 6 parameters of fig 7 and their interactions using a general linear model with a gaussian link function then an optimal model was searched by backward and forward stepwise selection using the akaike information criterion no variables or interactions could be excluded and no model simplification was obtained the full model explained 74 of the total deviance and the model with no interactions explained less than 20 these results clearly demonstrated that population spread speed is determined by complex multiplicative effects between parameters in our model fig 8 presents an example of age structure variations and population growth over time seasonal population decreases can be observed each winter corresponding to reproduction cessation from november to march this result is consistent with that actually observed in natural populations the proportion of short distance dispersers never exceeded 0 5 of the total population or 0 1 of long distance dispersers given that the population in cells n 3115 peaked at 675 922 individuals the total number of disperser agents only peaked at 3662 this is a critical advantage of this model from a computational viewpoint 4 3 model stability analysis model stability was assessed by using 100 different random seeds on experiment 72 one of the twenty seven experiments yielding a speed of population spread compatible with the observed pattern see supplementary material for parameter values post hoc resampling with replacement revealed that the variance of the speed of population spread stabilized using a minimum of 30 samples fig 9 for a mean speed of 224 ha year the standard deviation was 1 9 hence the speed of population spread remains in the range of 190 230 ha year regardless of the seed value indicating very good model robustness for stochasticity 5 discussion our model combines mathematical equations for the management of populations in cells and multi agent systems for the management of dispersing individuals this model outlines a promising method to model large scale systems by engaging various dynamics at different scales the combination of ebm and abm has many advantages i a modelling advantage resulting from easing dynamic representation incorporating different types of data and model entities at different scales e g landscape population and life history traits individuals and ii a computer processing advantage resulting from reducing the number of agents and increasing model velocity compared to earlier attempts of modelling vole population dynamics our model overcomes the following the computational difficulty of modelling vole megapopulations millions of individuals using abm which is necessary over large areas of interest e g farmland landscapes in which populations should be managed the difficulty of modelling population spread using ebm in real landscapes where i landscape heterogeneity ii rare events iii population structure and iv processes occurring at various scales must be altogether taken into account it would be interesting to compare the results obtained in the present study with those produced by a full abm however this comparison cannot be performed on the actual scale at which populations are observed several hundreds of square kilometres we assume that the results should be globally similar but perhaps exhibit some differences in terms of development cost in favour of the coupled model and accuracy in favour of an abm thierry et al 2015 if necessary other equations could be introduced e g to take into account other phenomena that might drive vole dispersal for example we should model weather storms are more likely to trigger massive dispersal events saucy and schneiter 1998 or microscopic entities that have an influence on soil e g resistance to digging tunnels pathogens and pre existing mole tunnels delattre et al 2006 in this case the model would include even more scales and would call for a specific organization of calculations and links between different scales explicit social rules are lacking in our model however this is an active research area in abm tampuu et al 2017 lucien et al 2016 golpayegani et al 2016 radchuk et al 2016 demonstrated that incorporating sociality with predation and dispersal can improve model fitness to observed data for a number of vole population dynamics sociality was not necessary in our model considering current knowledge about arvicola scherman giraudoux et al 2017 however the addition of social classes and sex categories andreassen et al 2013 with specific processes in a cell agent would be quite easy using the same population partitioning method employed for age classes in the present work in reality most social rules are expected to be applicable to settled and just settling individuals and these rules are implicitly integrated in cell population growth in our model various behaviours resulting from social interactions among voles can also be easily added to vole agents however in this case these behaviours would exclusively concern the dispersal fraction of the population which would poorly reflect reality here for the sake of simplicity we considered a homogeneous habitat with the exception of slope but importing a shapefile describing habitats with specific attributes such as various values of k dispersal thresholds and mortality is possible e g to account for the differences between optimal and suboptimal habitats tilled plots versus meadows high versus low plant productivity altitude the length of reproduction season etc the model does not take into account the fact that mortality is generally density dependent this limitation leads to every cell saturating to a maximum level derived from k dispersal threshold and mortality with no population decrease we plan to add a predation agent moving on a large scale and or a density dependent contagious disease to produce realistic population declines and determine how these factors can create traveling waves or cyclicity as observed in natural conditions such an endeavour may help to provide models for research that address the question of how landscapes can impact population dynamic processes in space and time based on real landscape data these models can help farmers to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of population surges and simulate the impacts of landscape changes or direct control e g chemical on small mammal populations interestingly among thousands of random simulations it appears that very few less than 5 lead to the observed population propagation speed all of the simulations that achieve this goal result from parameter configurations that can be fitted using general linear models indicating that the speed of population spread can be modelled as complex non linear relationships between parameters moreover our results indicate the importance of a small fraction of long distance dispersers in population spread and that different configurations can lead to the same effect for the other parameters this approach might help field ecologists determine which parameter configuration corresponds to what actually occurs in the field by developing hypothesis driven observations experiments in an explicitly spatial and temporal context such a method is of prime importance in for example landscape ecology where one of the main direct and indirect drivers of population dynamics is the spatial arrangements of species habitats delattre et al 1992 1999 giraudoux et al 1997

25233,the link between under ice processes and open water eutrophication dynamics has been proven in the field water quality models still lack the capability to capture the connection between both environments the hydrodynamic ecological model ce qual w2 is being applied to a eutrophic drinking water reservoir on the canadian prairies as part of larger collaborative research project ce qual w2 is one of the few water quality models that includes an ice algorithm yet is restricted by a fixed albedo coefficient field studies have shown albedo to change through the ice cover season varying the solar radiation that reaches the ice water interface as a result in order to better represent the light and heat environment during the under ice periods we modify the ice algorithm to incorporate a variable albedo rate while assessing the modified version of ce qual w2 on the reservoir we encounter a number of challenges during the calibration process these challenges pertain to difficulties with modelling the under ice environment and with modelling shallow lakes and reservoirs we recommend a targeted monitoring program to supplement available data that will reduce the uncertainty associated with the results of the reservoir model keywords ce qual w2 shallow lake modelling ice cover albedo water quality 1 introduction buffalo pound lake bpl is a shallow eutrophic impounded natural lake bpl has a history of water quality challenges and algal blooms e g kehoe et al 2015 slater and blok 1983 and treatment and processing costs are high for the on site buffalo pound water treatment plant bpwtp of key importance are the winter processes under ice cover range of 4 5 months to more than 6 months over a 39 year period salonen et al 2009 argue that winter should be considered a fundamental part of summer lake functioning and lake annual succession stating that an often misconception is that biological activities cease in this period due to low light and cold water heterotrophic growth instead provides competitive advantage for heterotrophic and mixotrophic species during ice cover conditions e g wetzel 2001 as winter comes to an end the shorter the duration of ice coverage before ice off the earlier water temperatures in bpl will start to rise as incoming heat starts warming waters below after melting the ice and the earlier light becomes available for phototrophic productivity triggering spring blooms algae may grow in an under ice layer vehmaa and salonen 2009 kelley 1997 and within certain forms of lake ice leppäranta 2010 when snow cover is minimal and light can still penetrate with ice melt any impurities or algae confined in the different layers of ice will be released into bpl algal succession is therefore influenced by ice cover duration and winter snowfall quantity leppäranta 2014 algal blooms require high water treatment costs for removal particularly in waterbodies used for drinking water nonetheless the relationship between ice cover and algal dynamics in bpl remains unexplored canada has seen a trend in earlier lake ice break up dates attributed to warming spring air temperatures duguay et al 2006 for the bpwtp to mitigate against bloom induced water restrictions and processing costs the influence of the under ice environment must be incorporated into management planning the growing evidence that lake dynamics during the open water season are connected to winter processes reviewed in sommer et al 2012 and hampton et al 2017 suggests it may even be possible to anticipate bloom occurrence on ice off by monitoring the preceding winter conditions to do this winter water temperature nutrients ice characteristics and light penetration estimates would be vital information to collect due to their respective stimuli on phototrophic processes bertilsson et al 2013 bpl is the focus of a team of researchers investigating how temporal changes within the reservoir affect water chemistry and lead to algal blooms part of the objectives include the first application of a coupled hydrodynamic ecological model to the system for long term scenario development this type of model has not been previously applied in saskatchewan in part due to a history of very limited monitoring traditionally these more complex coupled water quality wq models have treated open water and under ice periods in seasonally frozen waterbodies separately wq models have generally been applied to spring summer eutrophication problems and any complex winter modelling has tended to focus on hydrodynamics ice characteristics and temperature research that explores the link between the under ice environment and spring algae and nutrient dynamics has so far been based around field sampling studies and theoretical discussions wq models have yet to capture under ice chemical and biological feedback mechanisms and are essentially simulating spring and summer processes without factoring for antecedent winter conditions this limits the predictive capability of the model somewhat for a multi year simulation in earlier work a dissolved oxygen and sediment oxygen demand model was applied to bpl see terry et al 2017 for a seven year continuous simulation using ce qual w2 w2 portland or usa w2 is a public domain two dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic and wq model suitable for long narrow waterbodies and incorporating an ice model component w2 is a complex model that has been applied to numerous lake systems worldwide gelda et al 1998 martin 1988 deliman and gerald 2002 boegman et al 2001 and is capable of investigating the wq issues and algal bloom dynamics of bpl studies on the application of w2 to simulate ice cover and under ice processes are much less available w2 like many wq models is set up for more temperate climates than the canadian prairies in terry et al 2017 the authors discuss how w2 does not account for snow on top of the ice snow depth at bpl is generally between 0 1 to 0 3 m based on 99 snow depth measurements recorded by the water security agency wsa for sites across the reservoir between 1975 and 1996 ice thickness growth is slowed down by early snow cover as conduction of heat fluxes is reduced due to the low conductivity of snow leppäranta 2015 w2 may over estimate the ice thickness in years with early snow events this in turn may delay breakup of ice in the model on the other hand ice melting is strongly influenced by surface albedo and snow thickness kirillin et al 2012 and w2 has the potential to simulate earlier breakup dates by absorbing extra solar radiation due to the perceived lack of snow cover to test the influence of a variable albedo on ice duration and wq we develop a full wq model for bpl we modify the ice algorithm to include our variable albedo function a number of challenges present themselves during model setup and calibration these include difficulties in parameterising the reservoir in w2 and challenges pertaining to bpl reservoir itself many of the issues represent difficulties that can be faced when modelling any shallow prairie lake in canada other issues characterise complications in modelling the wq of cold polymictic lakes here we present our findings to our current knowledge we are the first to attempt to properly parameterise the ice algorithm of a popular off the shelf complex dynamic water quality model to better represent winter under ice conditions previous work by sadeghian 2015 and terry 2017 added two empirical coefficients to fix the ice cover prediction errors the end objectives of this research are to better understand the factors limiting the ability to reproduce the under ice environment of bpl in a wq model and to make recommendations for future wq monitoring of the reservoir 2 methods and model description 2 1 site description bpl is situated on the rural prairies of saskatchewan canada along the upper qu appelle river system bpl forms part of a landscape of lakes along a glacially formed hammer 1971 river basin residence time is highly variable at approximately 6 36 months buffalo pound water administration board 2015 the main inflows into bpl are through controlled releases from the upstream lake diefenbaker the upper qu appelle river channel between the two reservoirs is a combination of improved channelized river 35 km and meandering natural river channel 62 km soil type along the channel is mostly fine grained alluvium acharya and kells 2005 and the channel suffers erosion sedimentation and macrophyte growth clifton associates ltd 2012 the upper qu appelle drainage basin is primarily agricultural and the prairies have a high incidence of soil erosion and nutrient cycling meding and jackson 2003 the climate of the canadian prairies is extreme wheater and gober 2015 daily air temperatures range from 17 7 c to 26 2 c and approximately 30 of an annual mean precipitation of 365 3 mm falls as snowfall environment canada of key importance are the winter processes under ice cover range of 4 5 months to more than 6 months over a 39 year period bpl is a cold polymictic lake that mixes frequently through the open water season the morphology of bpl is unique being a long narrow reservoir with a relatively high throughflow fig 1 the reservoir is essentially split into two waterbodies at the upstream end by highway 2 which reaches down to the reservoir bed inflowing waters are first directed through an opening in a wave break built to protect the highway the flows are then pushed through a 45 m wide gap consisting of three connected 15 m sections under the highway and into the main body of the reservoir the upper section of the reservoir is weed choked and extremely shallow 2 2 available data gauged daily averaged inflows are provided by environment canada ec for marquis bridge approximately 3 km upstream of the top section of reservoir inflow temperatures are estimated by regression from long term historical spot sample data at marquis bridge and weekly in reservoir temperature measurements see terry et al 2017 inflow constituent data are from a monthly dataset belonging to the wsa for a site near the highway 2 underpass the wsa also provide monthly mean estimates for ungauged inflows for outflows dam releases are derived using two downstream ec flow gauges piped withdrawal volumes are provided by the bpwtp and by saskwater daily averaged water level measurements are provided by the wsa for an onsite gauge hourly meteorological data are from an ec station located approximately 30 km south of bpl the hourly data includes a description of the weather condition which is used to estimate cloud cover based on ec guidelines environment canada 2015 solar radiation is calculated by the model based on the estimated cloud cover air temperature longwave and w2 s computed angle of the sun s inclination shortwave precipitation rates are from a station at bpl and precipitation temperatures are set using dew point temperature historical records of the ice on and ice off dates for the reservoir over a 39 year period are provided by the bpwtp for the in reservoir observed data the bpwtp have a substantial long term data set of physicochemical variables and major constituents processed by the onsite laboratory the data spans between 10 30 years depending on the parameter and are sampled weekly throughout the year around 07 20 a m data pass a rigorous quality control sample procedure the sample site is located approximately four kilometres from the downstream end of the reservoir midway between the north and south shorelines and approximately one meter off the reservoir bed fig 1 water is withdrawn through an intake pipe to the south shore pumping house and samples are taken there before the water is drawn into the plant itself initial conditions for water temperature and constituents are from this long term database sediment temperature is set as the mean annual air temperature as per w2 recommendations cole and wells 2016 2 3 model set up our wq model is built on the temperature model presented in fig 2 of terry et al 2017 for a continuous seven year simulation period 1 april 1986 31 march 1993 in the earlier work the temperature model included an extended ice melt equation to account for the lack of snow in w2 s own ice model algorithm the simulation period was initially chosen due to the availability of ec flow data for gauges just above and below the reservoir we use the same bathymetric map that covers the reservoir downstream of highway 2 for our wq model we split the numerical grid into longitudinal segments of approximately 300 m with a total length of 25 834 m for 87 segments vertical layer depth is 0 75 m bounding layers are 0 25 m with a maximum depth of 10 layers in the reservoir s deepest section note that w2 s built in bounding layers and segments are included in these totals 2 4 model customization ice model in w2 s ice model albedo is a user defined constant rate that forms part of the equation for calculating the amount of solar radiation penetrating the ice see cole and wells 2016 the absorbance of solar radiation by the ice sheet and the water below it acts as the primary catalyst for the ice melt process and melt events are thus strongly dependent on the albedo value kirillin et al 2012 fig 2 illustrates the basic premise of the built in w2 ice model in the original w2 ice model the model reads a single albedo value at the onset of the simulation and uses this same value until the end of the run we have customised the ice algorithm in w2 to read the ice albedo as a time varying input file the modified ice algorithm now checks for a new albedo value during each iteration of the simulation we use w2 version 4 0 solar radiation is used in two ways in the wq model solar energy as heat and solar energy as light solar energy as heat is used to heat the water column and controls the kinetic rates of the wq constituents w2 includes a temperature rate multiplier in the equations of each constituent solar energy as light is used in the growth equations of algae w2 uses solar radiation to calculate available light for simulation of photosynthesis photoinhibition and light limitation 3 model calibration 3 1 ice model calibration the first step is testing the ice model s sensitivity to changes in albedo rates during the simulation albedo rates for lake snow and ice are highly variable and site specific e g svacina et al 2014 semmler et al 2012 vavrus et al 1996 svacina et al 2014 find lake ice and snow albedo values progressively increase through winter at three sample sites with different types of snow and ice cover each site has a total of 70 albedo measurements over the winter field season with snowfall events precipitating the greatest increases in value based on the authors findings for our sensitivity test we randomly generate 100 seven year time variable albedo files using matlab constraining the starting i e at ice on albedo values between 0 25 and 0 55 and ending at ice off albedo values between 0 65 and 0 95 we run 100 simulations using a different albedo file each time and plot the difference in days between the predicted and observed ice on and ice off dates for testing the connection between the ice model and the wq model we create an additional non randomised variable albedo file where we control the albedo rates for the initial simulations we assume an average starting albedo of 0 4 and an ending albedo value of 0 9 for all seven years we use matlab to linearly interpret between the values each winter based on the number of ice cover days for that year a more detailed year by year analysis of albedo rates will be made when the wq model is fully parameterised 3 2 water quality model calibration our model uses five wq constituents to represent eutrophication in bpl chlorophyll a chla orthophosphate po4 ammonia nh4 nitrate nitrite no3 and dissolved oxygen do parameter coefficients are set according to known lake processes literature reviews or default values recommended in the w2 manual table 1 the w2 equations for each constituent can be found in the w2 user manual cole and wells 2016 chla is calibrated based on three algal groups a fast growing low temperature group able to take advantage of spring conditions on ice off group 1 e g diatoms a fast growing but highly edible group group 2 e g green algae and a warm temperature adapted summer bloom group group 3 e g cyanobacteria algal rates are set as before based on data literature or w2 default values table 2 for this initial wq comparison we run three simulations using the same wq model parameters for everything other than the ice model albedo rates we first run two simulations using the original w2 ice model with fixed albedo rates of 0 5 and 0 8 respectively we then run the model again using our modified ice model and the variable albedo file 4 results 4 1 ice model sensitivity test we find the simulated ice on dates to be insensitive to changes in both the starting and ending albedo values there appears to be no connection between the albedo rates used and the date the model begins simulating ice cover the lack of dependence of ice on dates to albedo is found in other lake models martynov et al 2010 the simulated ice off dates are also found to be insensitive to the starting albedo values with no apparent relationship between the two variables the ice cover periods at bpl are lengthy and the influence of the starting albedo on the ice characteristics will be dominated by the time of ice breakup the simulated ice off dates however are shown to be highly sensitive to the ending albedo value fig 3 in both 1986 and 1987 the simulated ice off date improves at the top end of our chosen ending albedo range in 1988 and 1989 an ending albedo in the region of 0 75 0 8 simulates an ice off date closest to the observed what is interesting to see in1989 is that ice melt in w2 can occur more than 15 days in advance of the actual ice breakup date depending on the albedo value chosen 4 2 water quality simulation from a visual inspection of the fixed albedo results the model appears to capture spring and summer increases in chla that would relate to algal blooms in the reservoir fig 4 the model predictions for the timing of the blooms however are poor with most simulated spring blooms occurring too late in the season conversely the model is simulating the summer blooms mostly in advance of the observed dates switching to the variable albedo ice algorithm delays the timing of the simulated spring blooms this result is to be expected as the ice thickness is greater with the variable albedo just before ice off ice off is also delayed unfortunately as the fixed albedo model is already simulating the spring blooms too late in the season the variable albedo does not help with the chla calibration the effect of the variable albedo on the summer bloom predictions is mixed with four of the years showing no apparent difference in results and the remaining three years all responding differently po4 concentrations are slightly overestimated throughout the year and neither model captures the 1987 summer peak likewise both models miss certain autumn and winter concentrations in nh4 no3 predictions are within range autumn through spring but are overestimated before the onset of the summer blooms both models are able to capture summer do dynamics but not the depletion of oxygen in late winter overall the wq model we used for this study does perform reasonably well in light of the number of uncertainties encountered during calibration 5 discussion as a shallow reservoir on the canadian prairies bpl presents some unique modelling challenges a great source of uncertainty for the wq model has been capturing the timing and magnitude of water movement in bpl we have wind speed estimates on the lake surface based on a comparison of more recent data yet wind direction remains for the station 30 km south w2 may incorrectly measure fetch in wind induced motions such as shear stresses for flows the inflow gauge is upstream of ungauged tributaries draining into the river channel in addition we have no data to determine the impact of the shallow upper reservoir section wave breaker and highway 2 underpass on the flow velocities as the inflow constituents are measured at highway 2 which acts as the upstream boundary of our dem there is a timing disparity between the inflows and corresponding inflow constituents small or shallow lakes have a low buffer for inaccuracies in input data which makes a wq model sensitive to small amounts of error with bpl there is the extra complication that the reservoir receives backflows from downstream moose jaw river see fig 1 when flood waters at the confluence back up the qu appelle river and flow back over the dam into bpl the moose jaw river waters are a poorer quality than bpl and the contributions to constituent concentrations during flood events are challenging to calculate based on the two downstream flow gauges backflows into bpl were calculated on 12 days over the modelled period reaching a daily average high of 3 14 m3 s during july 1991 simple assumptions for wq variables may be complicated in these wet periods shallow lakes also react quickly to changes in meteorological conditions and variable weather patterns from year to year can increase the complexity of nutrient patterns and productivity taranu et al 2010 another sizable source of uncertainty is the wq boundary data inflow constituents are interpolated in w2 from monthly records provided by the wsa monthly samples are an extremely coarse frequency for wq constituents that can fluctuate greatly in just a matter of hours the performance of a wq model is restricted by the quality of its input and boundary data sadeghian et al 2018 hosseini et al 2017 and w2 has shown poor wq results due to boundary data limitations previously debele et al 2008 deliman and gerald 2002 inflow constituents can be interpolated or stepped between sample dates in w2 yet neither method will accurately describe the dynamics over our simulation period we are also unable to validate our simulated spatial and temporal distribution of constituents due to limited profile data for earlier years the weekly dataset of the bpwtp originates from sampling the plant s water withdrawals at the pumping house the very action of withdrawing a large quantity of water through a pipe close to the reservoir bed may distort the nearby hydrodynamics and potentially the observed constituent data the intake pipe is approximately 300 m to the sample point in the pumping house 3000 m in total to the bpwtp and data may begin to change as water is withdrawn from the reservoir the segment we are trying to calibrate is therefore a difficult one one of the most challenging aspects of modelling shallow lakes is correctly identifying sediment oxygen demand sod and the contribution of internal loading from the sediments to constituent concentrations due to their volume to sediment ratios shallow lakes have a relatively strong relationship with bottom decomposition chapra 1997 this is especially true under ice where shallow productive lakes become oxygen depleted due to high sod levels terry et al 2017 and the lower oxygen carrying capacity of a smaller volume of water the correct representation of sod is paramount and yet data is rarely available to parameterise a comprehensive sediment diagenesis module included in wq models such as w2 mooij et al 2010 likewise internal loading of nutrients can be substantially greater than external sources taranu et al 2010 our lack of understanding of the lagged response of internal loading in polymictic lakes to changes in external nutrient loads taranu et al 2010 makes shallow lake models susceptible to substantial error when internal loading data are missing for bpl phosphorus internal loading p flux data are available for the years 2014 and 2015 for three sites in the main reservoir body d silva et al unpublished data there are no data for other fluxes such as ammonia as we have insufficient data to run the sediment diagenesis model we use the zero order sediment compartment in our wq model in this compartment w2 calculates internal loading with a user defined flux coefficient that represents the fraction of the sod rate that is released under anoxic conditions coefficient sod flux as we have no spatial profile data for almost all of our variables the sod rate we use is the same throughout the model grid this means w2 would calculate the p flux as being the same over the reservoir and when under anoxic conditions the actual internal loading data show that the p flux rates vary spatially with the greatest flux occuring approximately two thirds of the way into the reservoir from the upstream direction the data also show that the p flux is high and occurs in substantial amounts in both summer and winter and in both anoxic and oxic conditions some of our uncertainty stems from assumptions and calculations in the w2 model w2 uses labile and refractory dissolved organic matter ldom and rdom and labile and refractory particulate organic matter lpom and rpom to account for organic phosphorus p nitrogen n carbon c and silica si cycling through the system the only inflow and in reservoir data we have available to us is dissolved organic carbon doc if error exists in our conversion of doc to the doms and poms then that error will be propagated through the model results uncertainty and error resulting from using organic matter pools in w2 have been discussed by other authors debele et al 2008 in general we find our model to be highly sensitive to slight adjustments in algae and nutrient coefficients the model results tend to rotate between high and low po4 no3 nh4 and chla concentrations making calibration difficult the bpwtp have collected algal count data since 1996 on review we see that the behaviour of the taxonomic groups can vary considerably from year to year we note that w2 s algal productivity equations have no connection with water movement other than the algae settling rates algal dynamics are quite unique in shallow well mixed lakes non motile species can remain suspended in the water column through wind stress turbulence upwelling and langmuir circulation for example kelley 1997 competitive advantage may then shift between species in respect to nutrients temperature light and water column stability yang et al 2016 taranu et al 2012 non motile species can still be at the mercy of turbulent vertical mixing that cycles them through the eutrophic zone and dictates their available light for photosynthesis jewson et al 2009 folkard et al 2007 this is also true of some motile species that can only retain their position up to a particular turbulence threshold huber et al 2012 with strong prairie winds blowing over the surface and high throughflow bpl likely owes part of the observed variability of algae to water movement the greatest challenge is attempting to resolve these uncertainties while modelling up to six months per year under ice cover knowledge of under ice processes in lakes is still relatively new and wq models are often based on open water limnology the denitrification rate in w2 for example is corrected with a temperature rate multiplier with default fractions being 1 denitrification at the lower temperature and 99 denitrification at the higher temperature recent work on bpl and other prairie lakes has found that despite large water temperature differences denitrification rates were similar in both summer and under ice cavaliere and baulch 2018 both ice and snow cover on lakes have a dynamic complex nature with little uniformity on which to estimate the constant coefficient values such as albedo that must be specified in w2 seasonal ice cover shows large variability and may be comprised of a transparent congelation ice black ice or white snow ice leppäranta 2015 snow may accumulate on top of the ice and be pushed into patchy drifts depending on wind strength and direction ice can melt partially in spring forming slush and then refreeze with new melt water into new ice formations flooding can occur when ice is pushed under the surface by the weight of snow when snow thickness 1 3 of ice thickness kirillin et al 2012 as a further complication ice breaks up first along the shoreline due to its shallower depth with the released ice then free to move around the lake and break up further as a function of wind and water movements leppäranta 2015 most wq models do not have the capacity to parameterise ice dynamics over a multi year run the ice formation and breakup dates provided by the bpwtp are for the portion of lake directly in front and thus visible of the shoreside pumping station ice on is defined to be the date when the visible portion of the reservoir is continuously ice covered and ice off the date when half of the visible portion is clear of ice total melting in front of the pumping station is rapid with only 1 or 2 days before the visible section of reservoir is clear of ice dan conrad personal communication recent landsat imagery indicates that this visible area becomes ice free well in advance of the rest of the reservoir ice cover could still be seen on most of the reservoir weeks after the ice off date provided by the bpwtp the observed area is also the location of the bpwtp intake pipe and we suggest that the altered hydrodynamics in the immediate surroundings of the pipe are causing the ice cover to melt more rapidly although the inclusion of a variable albedo rate improves the ice cover duration at our sample location it seems to have little influence on the main wq model on plotting the model s heat budget we can see that adding a variable albedo also has negligible impact on water temperature fig 5 the greatest effect is at the ice water interface although the temperature scale indicates just how little difference is made in summer solar radiation is a primary source of thermal energy reaching the water column sadeghian et al 2015 this energy gradually attenuates at depth dependent on the light extinction coefficient and the temperature rate multipliers in the kinetic equations of the wq constituents are affected over multiple layers when ice cover is present the solar radiation is attenuated by the ice extinction coefficient and a much reduced amount of thermal energy reaches the top surface layer of the water column much of this thermal energy is then used within the w2 ice melt equations the result is that very little changes in the temperature component of the wq constituent calculations the algae in bpl are driven by temperature water movement and light as nutrients are widely available michael kehoe personal communication on examination of the ice equations in w2 we see albedo has no connection to a light extinction coefficient the coefficient betai sets the fraction of light absorbed in the ice surface and gammai is the light decay through the ice using a variable albedo it is only possible to change the heat budget under ice but not the light environment to change both heat and light then the three coefficients albedo gammai betai must be calibrated individually within the ice model it would appear no matter how much we change the albedo it will have little impact on the modelled wq 6 recommendations model simulations are greatly influenced by the upstream boundary conditions hosseini et al 2017 high frequency wq sampling is required at marquis bridge immediately upstream of the top section of the reservoir and near highway 2 it is highly recommended that the marquis bridge flow gauge be reinstated manual flow measurements should be taken at the inflow to the top shallow section of reservoir and near highway 2 the combination of wq and flow data at marquis bridge and top section inflow will provide upper qu appelle river contributions and the ungauged inflows and nutrient run off in the remaining 3 km of river channel the wq and flow data from highway 2 will act as boundary data and reveal the buffering capacity of the top section of reservoir spot sample flow and constituent measurements are advised at the dam wall when moose jaw river waters are back flowing into bpl finally it is useful to monitor inflowing ephemeral streams around the reservoir perimeter during spring melt to consider nutrient run off from surrounding agricultural fields in addition to boundary data profile data of the reservoir is needed it is recommended that a sampling strategy is in place to map the spatial location of constituents in a range of environmental conditions ideally one sample location should be close to the current bpwtp sample site although outside the influence of the intake pipe for comparison spatial profiling of sediment nitrogen fluxes and sediment oxygen demand is particularly encouraged other research groups are studying the sediments in greater detail and there is an opportunity for data collaboration between institutions groundwater is not considered to be a significant contribution to the water balance however there are several small communities surrounding the reservoir that use septic tanks for domestic waste the potential for seepage and point source pollution should be re evaluated periodically in winter we advise that the bpwtp make note of ice type e g clear ice frazzle ice when they record the ice on date to assist the ice model parameterisation albedo measurements should be taken as often as logistically possible from various locations around the lake along with snow depth and ice thickness the entire reservoir ice formation should ideally be monitored in some form and not just the visible area in front of the pumping house since 2014 there has been an in reservoir data collecting buoy in the open water seasons the buoy includes a weather station and the relationship between wind direction at the reservoir surface and the ec weather station data should become clearer over time to protect the equipment the buoy is removed from the reservoir during ice cover periods it would be useful to have a weather station placed on top of the pumping house over winter 7 conclusions in seasonally ice covered lakes and reservoirs the connection between under ice processes and spring summer wq dynamics is becoming ever more important in response to changing ice phenology drinking water reservoirs are particularly at risk as unforeseen wq troubles can lead to expensive treatment costs and water restrictions wq models have yet to successfully model uninterrupted open water and under ice periods during multi year simulations the current stop start method of summer eutrophication and winter ice modelling leads to inaccurate assumptions during calibration efforts and models lose predictive capabilities as a result yet the solution is not simple here our attempt to improve the ice model of w2 with a variable albedo rate highlights challenges faced when modelling interannual dynamics in a cold polymictic shallow reservoir although the w2 model includes an ice algorithm of its own to represent ice cover the inflexibility of the coefficients and the under laying assumptions of the algorithm mean the under ice conditions in the model are not representative of the actual waterbody environment this means model calibration is somewhat of an exercise and limits the accuracy of multi year simulations our work is made the more difficult by the extreme variability in response mechanisms of shallow lakes and reservoirs to eutrophication problems scheffer 2004 most of the challenges stem from insufficient data to fully parameterise the model during calibration in conclusion a targeted monitoring program will go a long

25233,the link between under ice processes and open water eutrophication dynamics has been proven in the field water quality models still lack the capability to capture the connection between both environments the hydrodynamic ecological model ce qual w2 is being applied to a eutrophic drinking water reservoir on the canadian prairies as part of larger collaborative research project ce qual w2 is one of the few water quality models that includes an ice algorithm yet is restricted by a fixed albedo coefficient field studies have shown albedo to change through the ice cover season varying the solar radiation that reaches the ice water interface as a result in order to better represent the light and heat environment during the under ice periods we modify the ice algorithm to incorporate a variable albedo rate while assessing the modified version of ce qual w2 on the reservoir we encounter a number of challenges during the calibration process these challenges pertain to difficulties with modelling the under ice environment and with modelling shallow lakes and reservoirs we recommend a targeted monitoring program to supplement available data that will reduce the uncertainty associated with the results of the reservoir model keywords ce qual w2 shallow lake modelling ice cover albedo water quality 1 introduction buffalo pound lake bpl is a shallow eutrophic impounded natural lake bpl has a history of water quality challenges and algal blooms e g kehoe et al 2015 slater and blok 1983 and treatment and processing costs are high for the on site buffalo pound water treatment plant bpwtp of key importance are the winter processes under ice cover range of 4 5 months to more than 6 months over a 39 year period salonen et al 2009 argue that winter should be considered a fundamental part of summer lake functioning and lake annual succession stating that an often misconception is that biological activities cease in this period due to low light and cold water heterotrophic growth instead provides competitive advantage for heterotrophic and mixotrophic species during ice cover conditions e g wetzel 2001 as winter comes to an end the shorter the duration of ice coverage before ice off the earlier water temperatures in bpl will start to rise as incoming heat starts warming waters below after melting the ice and the earlier light becomes available for phototrophic productivity triggering spring blooms algae may grow in an under ice layer vehmaa and salonen 2009 kelley 1997 and within certain forms of lake ice leppäranta 2010 when snow cover is minimal and light can still penetrate with ice melt any impurities or algae confined in the different layers of ice will be released into bpl algal succession is therefore influenced by ice cover duration and winter snowfall quantity leppäranta 2014 algal blooms require high water treatment costs for removal particularly in waterbodies used for drinking water nonetheless the relationship between ice cover and algal dynamics in bpl remains unexplored canada has seen a trend in earlier lake ice break up dates attributed to warming spring air temperatures duguay et al 2006 for the bpwtp to mitigate against bloom induced water restrictions and processing costs the influence of the under ice environment must be incorporated into management planning the growing evidence that lake dynamics during the open water season are connected to winter processes reviewed in sommer et al 2012 and hampton et al 2017 suggests it may even be possible to anticipate bloom occurrence on ice off by monitoring the preceding winter conditions to do this winter water temperature nutrients ice characteristics and light penetration estimates would be vital information to collect due to their respective stimuli on phototrophic processes bertilsson et al 2013 bpl is the focus of a team of researchers investigating how temporal changes within the reservoir affect water chemistry and lead to algal blooms part of the objectives include the first application of a coupled hydrodynamic ecological model to the system for long term scenario development this type of model has not been previously applied in saskatchewan in part due to a history of very limited monitoring traditionally these more complex coupled water quality wq models have treated open water and under ice periods in seasonally frozen waterbodies separately wq models have generally been applied to spring summer eutrophication problems and any complex winter modelling has tended to focus on hydrodynamics ice characteristics and temperature research that explores the link between the under ice environment and spring algae and nutrient dynamics has so far been based around field sampling studies and theoretical discussions wq models have yet to capture under ice chemical and biological feedback mechanisms and are essentially simulating spring and summer processes without factoring for antecedent winter conditions this limits the predictive capability of the model somewhat for a multi year simulation in earlier work a dissolved oxygen and sediment oxygen demand model was applied to bpl see terry et al 2017 for a seven year continuous simulation using ce qual w2 w2 portland or usa w2 is a public domain two dimensional laterally averaged hydrodynamic and wq model suitable for long narrow waterbodies and incorporating an ice model component w2 is a complex model that has been applied to numerous lake systems worldwide gelda et al 1998 martin 1988 deliman and gerald 2002 boegman et al 2001 and is capable of investigating the wq issues and algal bloom dynamics of bpl studies on the application of w2 to simulate ice cover and under ice processes are much less available w2 like many wq models is set up for more temperate climates than the canadian prairies in terry et al 2017 the authors discuss how w2 does not account for snow on top of the ice snow depth at bpl is generally between 0 1 to 0 3 m based on 99 snow depth measurements recorded by the water security agency wsa for sites across the reservoir between 1975 and 1996 ice thickness growth is slowed down by early snow cover as conduction of heat fluxes is reduced due to the low conductivity of snow leppäranta 2015 w2 may over estimate the ice thickness in years with early snow events this in turn may delay breakup of ice in the model on the other hand ice melting is strongly influenced by surface albedo and snow thickness kirillin et al 2012 and w2 has the potential to simulate earlier breakup dates by absorbing extra solar radiation due to the perceived lack of snow cover to test the influence of a variable albedo on ice duration and wq we develop a full wq model for bpl we modify the ice algorithm to include our variable albedo function a number of challenges present themselves during model setup and calibration these include difficulties in parameterising the reservoir in w2 and challenges pertaining to bpl reservoir itself many of the issues represent difficulties that can be faced when modelling any shallow prairie lake in canada other issues characterise complications in modelling the wq of cold polymictic lakes here we present our findings to our current knowledge we are the first to attempt to properly parameterise the ice algorithm of a popular off the shelf complex dynamic water quality model to better represent winter under ice conditions previous work by sadeghian 2015 and terry 2017 added two empirical coefficients to fix the ice cover prediction errors the end objectives of this research are to better understand the factors limiting the ability to reproduce the under ice environment of bpl in a wq model and to make recommendations for future wq monitoring of the reservoir 2 methods and model description 2 1 site description bpl is situated on the rural prairies of saskatchewan canada along the upper qu appelle river system bpl forms part of a landscape of lakes along a glacially formed hammer 1971 river basin residence time is highly variable at approximately 6 36 months buffalo pound water administration board 2015 the main inflows into bpl are through controlled releases from the upstream lake diefenbaker the upper qu appelle river channel between the two reservoirs is a combination of improved channelized river 35 km and meandering natural river channel 62

appelle drainage basin is primarily agricultural and the prairies have a high incidence of soil erosion and nutrient cycling meding and jackson 2003 the climate of the canadian prairies is extreme wheater and gober 2015 daily air temperatures range from 17 7 c to 26 2 c and approximately 30 of an annual mean precipitation of 365 3 mm falls as snowfall environment canada of key importance are the winter processes under ice cover range of 4 5 months to more than 6 months over a 39 year period bpl is a cold polymictic lake that mixes frequently through the open water season the morphology of bpl is unique being a long narrow reservoir with a relatively high throughflow fig 1 the reservoir is essentially split into two waterbodies at the upstream end by highway 2 which reaches down to the reservoir bed inflowing waters are first directed through an opening in a wave break built to protect the highway the flows are then pushed through a 45 m wide gap consisting of three connected 15 m sections under the highway and into the main body of the reservoir the upper section of the reservoir is weed choked and extremely shallow 2 2 available data gauged daily averaged inflows are provided by environment canada ec for marquis bridge approximately 3 km upstream of the top section of reservoir inflow temperatures are estimated by regression from long term historical spot sample data at marquis bridge and weekly in reservoir temperature measurements see terry et al 2017 inflow constituent data are from a monthly dataset belonging to the wsa for a site near the highway 2 underpass the wsa also provide monthly mean estimates for ungauged inflows for outflows dam releases are derived using two downstream ec flow gauges piped withdrawal volumes are provided by the bpwtp and by saskwater daily averaged water level measurements are provided by the wsa for an onsite gauge hourly meteorological data are from an ec station located approximately 30 km south of bpl the hourly data includes a description of the weather condition which is used to estimate cloud cover based on ec guidelines environment canada 2015 solar radiation is calculated by the model based on the estimated cloud cover air temperature longwave and w2 s computed angle of the sun s inclination shortwave precipitation rates are from a station at bpl and precipitation temperatures are set using dew point temperature historical records of the ice on and ice off dates for the reservoir over a 39 year period are provided by the bpwtp for the in reservoir observed data the bpwtp have a substantial long term data set of physicochemical variables and major constituents processed by the onsite laboratory the data spans between 10 30 years depending on the parameter and are sampled weekly throughout the year around 07 20 a m data pass a rigorous quality control sample procedure the sample site is located approximately four kilometres from the downstream end of the reservoir midway between the north and south shorelines and approximately one meter off the reservoir bed fig 1 water is withdrawn through an intake pipe to the south shore pumping house and samples are taken there before the water is drawn into the plant itself initial conditions for water temperature and constituents are from this long term database sediment temperature is set as the mean annual air temperature as per w2 recommendations cole and wells 2016 2 3 model set up our wq model is built on the temperature model presented in fig 2 of terry et al 2017 for a continuous seven year simulation period 1 april 1986 31 march 1993 in the earlier work the temperature model included an extended ice melt equation to account for the lack of snow in w2 s own ice model algorithm the simulation period was initially chosen due to the availability of ec flow data for gauges just above and below the reservoir we use the same bathymetric map that covers the reservoir downstream of highway 2 for our wq model we split the numerical grid into longitudinal segments of approximately 300 m with a total length of 25 834 m for 87 segments vertical layer depth is 0 75 m bounding layers are 0 25 m with a maximum depth of 10 layers in the reservoir s deepest section note that w2 s built in bounding layers and segments are included in these totals 2 4 model customization ice model in w2 s ice model albedo is a user defined constant rate that forms part of the equation for calculating the amount of solar radiation penetrating the ice see cole and wells 2016 the absorbance of solar radiation by the ice sheet and the water below it acts as the primary catalyst for the ice melt process and melt events are thus strongly dependent on the albedo value kirillin et al 2012 fig 2 illustrates the basic premise of the built in w2 ice model in the original w2 ice model the model reads a single albedo value at the onset of the simulation and uses this same value until the end of the run we have customised the ice algorithm in w2 to read the ice albedo as a time varying input file the modified ice algorithm now checks for a new albedo value during each iteration of the simulation we use w2 version 4 0 solar radiation is used in two ways in the wq model solar energy as heat and solar energy as light solar energy as heat is used to heat the water column and controls the kinetic rates of the wq constituents w2 includes a temperature rate multiplier in the equations of each constituent solar energy as light is used in the growth equations of algae w2 uses solar radiation to calculate available light for simulation of photosynthesis photoinhibition and light limitation 3 model calibration 3 1 ice model calibration the first step is testing the ice model s sensitivity to changes in albedo rates during the simulation albedo rates for lake snow and ice are highly variable and site specific e g svacina et al 2014 semmler et al 2012 vavrus et al 1996 svacina et al 2014 find lake ice and snow albedo values progressively increase through winter at three sample sites with different types of snow and ice cover each site has a total of 70 albedo measurements over the winter field season with snowfall events precipitating the greatest increases in value based on the authors findings for our sensitivity test we randomly generate 100 seven year time variable albedo files using matlab constraining the starting i e at ice on albedo values between 0 25 and 0 55 and ending at ice off albedo values between 0 65 and 0 95 we run 100 simulations using a different albedo file each time and plot the difference in days between the predicted and observed ice on and ice off dates for testing the connection between the ice model and the wq model we create an additional non randomised variable albedo file where we control the albedo rates for the initial simulations we assume an average starting albedo of 0 4 and an ending albedo value of 0 9 for all seven years we use matlab to linearly interpret between the values each winter based on the number of ice cover days for that year a more detailed year by year analysis of albedo rates will be made when the wq model is fully parameterised 3 2 water quality model calibration our model uses five wq constituents to represent eutrophication in bpl chlorophyll a chla orthophosphate po4 ammonia nh4 nitrate nitrite no3 and dissolved oxygen do parameter coefficients are set according to known lake processes literature reviews or default values recommended in the w2 manual table 1 the w2 equations for each constituent can be found in the w2 user manual cole and wells 2016 chla is calibrated based on three algal groups a fast growing low temperature group able to take advantage of spring conditions on ice off group 1 e g diatoms a fast growing but highly edible group group 2 e g green algae and a warm temperature adapted summer bloom group group 3 e g cyanobacteria algal rates are set as before based on data literature or w2 default values table 2 for this initial wq comparison we run three simulations using the same wq model parameters for everything other than the ice model albedo rates we first run two simulations using the original w2 ice model with fixed albedo rates of 0 5 and 0 8 respectively we then run the model again using our modified ice model and the variable albedo file 4 results 4 1 ice model sensitivity test we find the simulated ice on dates to be insensitive to changes in both the starting and ending albedo values there appears to be no connection between the albedo rates used and the date the model begins simulating ice cover the lack of dependence of ice on dates to albedo is found in other lake models martynov et al 2010 the simulated ice off dates are also found to be insensitive to the starting albedo values with no apparent relationship between the two variables the ice cover periods at bpl are lengthy and the influence of the starting albedo on the ice characteristics will be dominated by the time of ice breakup the simulated ice off dates however are shown to be highly sensitive to the ending albedo value fig 3 in both 1986 and 1987 the simulated ice off date improves at the top end of our chosen ending albedo range in 1988 and 1989 an ending albedo in the region of 0 75 0 8 simulates an ice off date closest to the observed what is interesting to see in1989 is that ice melt in w2 can occur more than 15 days in advance of the actual ice breakup date depending on the albedo value chosen 4 2 water quality simulation from a visual inspection of the fixed albedo results the model appears to capture spring and summer increases in chla that would relate to algal blooms in the reservoir fig 4 the model predictions for the timing of the blooms however are poor with most simulated spring blooms occurring too late in the season conversely the model is simulating the summer blooms mostly in advance of the observed dates switching to the variable albedo ice algorithm delays the timing of the simulated spring blooms this result is to be expected as the ice thickness is greater with the variable albedo just before ice off ice off is also delayed unfortunately as the fixed albedo model is already simulating the spring blooms too late in the season the variable albedo does not help with the chla calibration the effect of the variable albedo on the summer bloom predictions is mixed with four of the years showing no apparent difference in results and the remaining three years all responding differently po4 concentrations are slightly overestimated throughout the year and neither model captures the 1987 summer peak likewise both models miss certain autumn and winter concentrations in nh4 no3 predictions are within range autumn through spring but are overestimated before the onset of the summer blooms both models are able to capture summer do dynamics but not the depletion of oxygen in late winter overall the wq model we used for this study does perform reasonably well in light of the number of uncertainties encountered during calibration 5 discussion as a shallow reservoir on the canadian prairies bpl presents some unique modelling challenges a great source of uncertainty for the wq model has been capturing the timing and magnitude of water movement in bpl we have wind speed estimates on the lake surface based on a comparison of more recent data yet wind direction remains for the station 30 km south w2 may incorrectly measure fetch in wind induced motions such as shear stresses for flows the inflow gauge is upstream of ungauged tributaries draining into the river channel in addition we have no data to determine the impact of the shallow upper reservoir section wave breaker and highway 2 underpass on the flow velocities as the inflow constituents are measured at highway 2 which acts as the upstream boundary of our dem there is a timing disparity between the inflows and corresponding inflow constituents small or shallow lakes have a low buffer for inaccuracies in input data which makes a wq model sensitive to small amounts of error with bpl there is the extra complication that the reservoir receives backflows from downstream moose jaw river see fig 1 when flood waters at the confluence back up the qu appelle river and flow back over the dam into bpl the moose jaw river waters are a poorer quality than bpl and the contributions to constituent concentrations during flood events are challenging to calculate based on the two downstream flow gauges backflows into bpl were calculated on 12 days over the modelled period reaching a daily average high of 3 14 m3 s during july 1991 simple assumptions for wq variables may be complicated in these wet periods shallow lakes also react quickly to changes in meteorological conditions and variable weather patterns from year to year can increase the complexity of nutrient patterns and productivity taranu et al 2010 another sizable source of uncertainty is the wq boundary data inflow constituents are interpolated in w2 from monthly records provided by the wsa monthly samples are an extremely coarse frequency for wq constituents that can fluctuate greatly in just a matter of hours the performance of a wq model is restricted by the quality of its input and boundary data sadeghian et al 2018 hosseini et al 2017 and w2 has shown poor wq results due to boundary data limitations previously debele et al 2008 deliman and gerald 2002 inflow constituents can be interpolated or stepped between sample dates in w2 yet neither method will accurately describe the dynamics over our simulation period we are also unable to validate our simulated spatial and temporal distribution of constituents due to limited profile data for earlier years the weekly dataset of the bpwtp originates from sampling the plant s water withdrawals at the pumping house the very action of withdrawing a large quantity of water through a pipe close to the reservoir bed may distort the nearby hydrodynamics and potentially the observed constituent data the intake pipe is approximately 300 m to the sample point in the pumping house 3000 m in total to the bpwtp and data may begin to change as water is withdrawn from the reservoir the segment we are trying to calibrate is therefore a difficult one one of the most challenging aspects of modelling shallow lakes is correctly identifying sediment oxygen demand sod and the contribution of internal loading from the sediments to constituent concentrations due to their volume to sediment ratios shallow lakes have a relatively strong relationship with bottom decomposition chapra 1997 this is especially true under ice where shallow productive lakes become oxygen depleted due to high sod levels terry et al 2017 and the lower oxygen carrying capacity of a smaller volume of water the correct representation of sod is paramount and yet data is rarely available to parameterise a comprehensive sediment diagenesis module included in wq models such as w2 mooij et al 2010 likewise internal loading of nutrients can be substantially greater than external sources taranu et al 2010 our lack of understanding of the lagged response of internal loading in polymictic lakes to changes in external nutrient loads taranu et al 2010 makes shallow lake models susceptible to substantial error when internal loading data are missing for bpl phosphorus internal loading p flux data are available for the years 2014 and 2015 for three sites in the main reservoir body d silva et al unpublished data there are no data for other fluxes such as ammonia as we have insufficient data to run the sediment diagenesis model we use the zero order sediment compartment in our wq model in this compartment w2 calculates internal loading with a user defined flux coefficient that represents the fraction of the sod rate that is released under anoxic conditions coefficient sod flux as we have no spatial profile data for almost all of our variables the sod rate we use is the same throughout the model grid this means w2 would calculate the p flux as being the same over the reservoir and when under anoxic conditions the actual internal loading data show that the p flux rates vary spatially with the greatest flux occuring approximately two thirds of the way into the reservoir from the upstream direction the data also show that the p flux is high and occurs in substantial amounts in both summer and winter and in both anoxic and oxic conditions some of our uncertainty stems from assumptions and calculations in the w2 model w2 uses labile and refractory dissolved organic matter ldom and rdom and labile and refractory particulate organic matter lpom and rpom to account for organic phosphorus p nitrogen n carbon c and silica si cycling through the system the only inflow and in reservoir data we have available to us is dissolved organic carbon doc if error exists in our conversion of doc to the doms and poms then that error will be propagated through the model results uncertainty and error resulting from using organic matter pools in w2 have been discussed by other authors debele et al 2008 in general we find our model to be highly sensitive to slight adjustments in algae and nutrient coefficients the model results tend to rotate between high and low po4 no3 nh4 and chla concentrations making calibration difficult the bpwtp have collected algal count data since 1996 on review we see that the behaviour of the taxonomic groups can vary considerably from year to year we note that w2 s algal productivity equations have no connection with water movement other than the algae settling rates algal dynamics are quite unique in shallow well mixed lakes non motile species can remain suspended in the water column through wind stress turbulence upwelling and langmuir circulation for example kelley 1997 competitive advantage may then shift between species in respect to nutrients temperature light and water column stability yang et al 2016 taranu et al 2012 non motile species can still be at the mercy of turbulent vertical mixing that cycles them through the eutrophic zone and dictates their available light for photosynthesis jewson et al 2009 folkard et al 2007 this is also true of some motile species that can only retain their position up to a particular turbulence threshold huber et al 2012 with strong prairie winds blowing over the surface and high throughflow bpl likely owes part of the observed variability of algae to water movement the greatest challenge is attempting to resolve these uncertainties while modelling up to six months per year under ice cover knowledge of under ice processes in lakes is still relatively new and wq models are often based on open water limnology the denitrification rate in w2 for example is corrected with a temperature rate multiplier with default fractions being 1 denitrification at the lower temperature and 99 denitrification at the higher temperature recent work on bpl and other prairie lakes has found that despite large water temperature differences denitrification rates were similar in both summer and under ice cavaliere and baulch 2018 both ice and snow cover on lakes have a dynamic complex nature with little uniformity on which to estimate the constant coefficient values such as albedo that must be specified in w2 seasonal ice cover shows large variability and may be comprised of a transparent congelation ice black ice or white snow ice leppäranta 2015 snow may accumulate on top of the ice and be pushed into patchy drifts depending on wind strength and direction ice can melt partially in spring forming slush and then refreeze with new melt water into new ice formations flooding can occur when ice is pushed under the surface by the weight of snow when snow thickness 1 3 of ice thickness kirillin et al 2012 as a further complication ice breaks up first along the shoreline due to its shallower depth with the released ice then free to move around the lake and break up further as a function of wind and water movements leppäranta 2015 most wq models do not have the capacity to parameterise ice dynamics over a multi year run the ice formation and breakup dates provided by the bpwtp are for the portion of lake directly in front and thus visible of the shoreside pumping station ice on is defined to be the date when the visible portion of the reservoir is continuously ice covered and ice off the date when half of the visible portion is clear of ice total melting in front of the pumping station is rapid with only 1 or 2 days before the visible section of reservoir is clear of ice dan conrad personal communication recent landsat imagery indicates that this visible area becomes ice free well in advance of the rest of the reservoir ice cover could still be seen on most of the reservoir weeks after the ice off date provided by the bpwtp the observed area is also the location of the bpwtp intake pipe and we suggest that the altered hydrodynamics in the immediate surroundings of the pipe are causing the ice cover to melt more rapidly although the inclusion of a variable albedo rate improves the ice cover duration at our sample location it seems to have little influence on the main wq model on plotting the model s heat budget we can see that adding a variable albedo also has negligible impact on water temperature fig 5 the greatest effect is at the ice water interface although the temperature scale indicates just how little difference is made in summer solar radiation is a primary source of thermal energy reaching the water column sadeghian et al 2015 this energy gradually attenuates at depth dependent on the light extinction coefficient and the temperature rate multipliers in the kinetic equations of the wq constituents are affected over multiple layers when ice cover is present the solar radiation is attenuated by the ice extinction coefficient and a much reduced amount of thermal energy reaches the top surface layer of the water column much of this thermal energy is then used within the w2 ice melt equations the result is that very little changes in the temperature component of the wq constituent calculations the algae in bpl are driven by temperature water movement and light as nutrients are widely available michael kehoe personal communication on examination of the ice equations in w2 we see albedo has no connection to a light extinction coefficient the coefficient betai sets the fraction of light absorbed in the ice surface and gammai is the light decay through the ice using a variable albedo it is only possible to change the heat budget under ice but not the light environment to change both heat and light then the three coefficients albedo gammai betai must be calibrated individually within the ice model it would appear no matter how much we change the albedo it will have little impact on the modelled wq 6 recommendations model simulations are greatly influenced by the upstream boundary conditions hosseini et al 2017 high frequency wq sampling is required at marquis bridge immediately upstream of the top section of the reservoir and near highway 2 it is highly recommended that the marquis bridge flow gauge be reinstated manual flow measurements should be taken at the inflow to the top shallow section of reservoir and near highway 2 the combination of wq and flow data at marquis bridge and top section inflow will provide upper qu appelle river contributions and the ungauged inflows and nutrient run off in the remaining 3 km of river channel the wq and flow data from highway 2 will act as boundary data and reveal the buffering capacity of the top section of reservoir spot sample flow and constituent measurements are advised at the dam wall when moose jaw river waters are back flowing into bpl finally it is useful to monitor inflowing ephemeral streams around the reservoir perimeter during spring melt to consider nutrient run off from surrounding agricultural fields in addition to boundary data profile data of the reservoir is needed it is recommended that a sampling strategy is in place to map the spatial location of constituents in a range of environmental conditions ideally one sample location should be close to the current bpwtp sample site although outside the influence of the intake pipe for comparison spatial profiling of sediment nitrogen fluxes and sediment oxygen demand is particularly encouraged other research groups are studying the sediments in greater detail and there is an opportunity for data collaboration between institutions groundwater is not considered to be a significant contribution to the water balance however there are several small communities surrounding the reservoir that use septic tanks for domestic waste the potential for seepage and point source pollution should be re evaluated periodically in winter we advise that the bpwtp make note of ice type e g clear ice frazzle ice when they record the ice on date to assist the ice model parameterisation albedo measurements should be taken as often as logistically possible from various locations around the lake along with snow depth and ice thickness the entire reservoir ice formation should ideally be monitored in some form and not just the visible area in front of the pumping house since 2014 there has been an in reservoir data collecting buoy in the open water seasons the buoy includes a weather station and the relationship between wind direction at the reservoir surface and the ec weather station data should become clearer over time to protect the equipment the buoy is removed from the reservoir during ice cover periods it would be useful to have a weather station placed on top of the pumping house over winter 7 conclusions in seasonally ice covered lakes and reservoirs the connection between under ice processes and spring summer wq dynamics is becoming ever more important in response to changing ice phenology drinking water reservoirs are particularly at risk as unforeseen wq troubles can lead to expensive treatment costs and water restrictions wq models have yet to successfully model uninterrupted open water and under ice periods during multi year simulations the current stop start method of summer eutrophication and winter ice modelling leads to inaccurate assumptions during calibration efforts and models lose predictive capabilities as a result yet the solution is not simple here our attempt to improve the ice model of w2 with a variable albedo rate highlights challenges faced when modelling interannual dynamics in a cold polymictic shallow reservoir although the w2 model includes an ice algorithm of its own to represent ice cover the inflexibility of the coefficients and the under laying assumptions of the algorithm mean the under ice conditions in the model are not representative of the actual waterbody environment this means model calibration is somewhat of an exercise and limits the accuracy of multi year simulations our work is made the more difficult by the extreme variability in response mechanisms of shallow lakes and reservoirs to eutrophication problems scheffer 2004 most of the challenges stem from insufficient data to fully parameterise the model during calibration in conclusion a targeted monitoring program will go a long

by an interval of 8 for presentation purposes table 1 2 2 unsteady hydrodynamic model drift distance of asian carp eggs in a riverine environment depends on egg characteristics e g size density and developmental stage water temperature and streamflow dynamics chapman and george 2011 kocovsky et al 2012 murphy and jackson 2013 coulter et al 2016 george et al 2017 streamflow dynamics in the river reach were obtained through numerical simulations because the locations of gaging stations fig 1 alone do not provide sufficient integrated coverage of the entire iww to adequately model the flow dynamics the study determined such information by developing a one dimensional 1d unsteady hydrodynamic model of the iww using the hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras version 5 03 program hydrologic engineering center river analysis system 2017 after establishing the model it was calibrated with measured data to assure the simulated results were representative of realistic flow conditions the iww hec ras model generates time dependent hydraulic variables including water depth and flow velocity over the study domain as inputs to the fluegg program users specify egg information to design a run and fluegg reads in the time varying hydraulic outputs from the hec ras program fig 2 in fluegg users can perform egg drifting analysis or invoke the new rtpt module described below for back casting spawning locations from egg collection sites 2 2 1 hydrodynamic model development an 1d iww hec ras model was developed by combining seven individual hec ras navigation pool models obtained from usace rock island district u s army corps of engineers rock island district 2003 rating curves connecting individual pool models were developed for each l d in addition tributary inflows and upstream and downstream boundary conditions were included in the model the final hec ras model includes 1236 cross sections spanning over 464 km from the uppermost river station in the brandon road pool to grafton in the alton pool rating curves which are curvilinear relationships between stage and discharge at given locations were developed to approximate the flow discharge passing through each l d usace monitors the head and tail pool levels at each l d us army corps of engineers river gages 2017 discharges through each l d were first estimated by applying discharges from the nearest usgs gaging station to the site station numbers in table 2 national water information system 2018 and then adjusted iteratively with hec ras runs one limitation of this approach is that rating curves can provide inaccurate estimates in low gradient reaches where a specific discharge might correspond to various stage levels also when approximating the effects of a structure with a rating curve tailwater influences are not considered however under high discharges l d gates can be operated in their maximum setting lifted out of the water starved rock marseilles dresden island dams or lowered to the bottom la grange and peoria l ds u s army corps of engineers rock island district 2015 during june 10 18 of 2015 the illinois waterway acted as an open river from the marseilles pool to the confluence with the mississippi river under these circumstances using the rating curve approach is acceptable at brandon road l d the river stage levels are generally controlled therefore a linear relation between stage and discharge was assumed for the brandon road l d the model upstream boundary condition bc corresponds to the measured streamflow discharge from the usgs gage at the des plaines river at route 53 joliet il site 1 fig 1 usgs station number 05537980 and the downstream bc corresponds to the measured river stage at the usgs gage at the mississippi river at grafton il fig 1 usgs station number 05587450 national water information system 2018 when modeling a long stretch of a river the resulting hydraulics are representative only if the amount of streamflow in each segment of the river is representative for the present study tributary inflows are considered to be the primary contributor to changes in streamflow along the river fifteen of the iww tributaries are currently monitored by usgs see appendix which account for approximately 73 of the total drainage area of the illinois river basin inflows for 34 ungaged tributaries with drainage area equal to or larger than 10 4 km2 were estimated using the drainage area ratio method emerson et al 2005 2 2 2 model calibration the iww hec ras model was calibrated using measured stage and discharge data at usgs gaging stations along the iww national water information system 2018 nine active usgs gaging stations are available in the study domain see fig 1 and table 2 with five reporting both stage and discharge and the remaining four reporting stage only the automated calibration option in hec ras was used to perform the roughness factor calibration as the main objective of the hec ras modeling was to provide hydraulic input to the fluegg model the calibration covered the entire study period from 5 1 2015 to 6 30 2015 quantitative statistics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr along with graphical analyses were used to assess how well the simulated data matched measured data according to general performance evaluation criteria for a monthly time step moriasi et al 2007 the model is considered as a very good model if nse is in the range of 0 75 1 pbias is 10 and rsr is in the range of 0 0 5 the time step for hec ras output was specified at every 15 min far less than a monthly time step because more fluctuations in simulated outputs are expected in shorter time steps than in longer time steps engel et al 2007 the performance criteria developed for a monthly interval are rather strict for the current evaluation however these statistics indicate that the model performs very well for all usgs stations except stage data of station 1 see table 2 gage station 1 is located at the brandon road pool see fig 1 where stage level is controlled by the brandon road l d therefore a rating curve does not apply very well at this location simulated stage and flow hydrographs of two stations rkm 150 81 gage number 4 and rkm 70 04 gage number 3 agree with measurement data well fig 3 the simulation period 5 1 2015 6 30 2015 covers a range of discharges and the hec ras model performs well for both low and high flows the hydrograph began to rise around 6 10 2015 and peaked around 6 18 2015 encompassing dates when asian carp egg samples were collected in the field 2 3 fluvial egg drift simulator fluegg program the previous versions of the fluegg model treated the river hydraulic characteristics as steady state conditions constant in time the existing fluegg model was enhanced to be able to use unsteady state hydraulic characteristics the new version of the fluegg model fluvial egg drift simulator 2017 allows the user to import spatially distributed hydraulic time series directly from a hec ras model when simulating egg transport and distribution in the fluegg model the user specifies hydraulic inputs egg characteristics and a simulation scenario including the simulation starting time drifting hours and the number of eggs to release fluegg is a lagrangian model therefore every egg moves independently as a function of both the river flow characteristics and the egg characteristics therefore in natural turbulent flows eggs of identical characteristics that are released at the same location will not end up at the same location after a given drifting time fluegg simulates the effects of turbulent diffusion on egg transport distance with random walk and random displacement techniques garcia et al 2013 the location of eggs at the end of the simulation time is presented as a distribution of the egg mass plume the result is the span and distribution of the plume so the location of its centroid mean and the leading and trailing edges can be predicted since the egg mass plume is a statistic measure the number of eggs used in simulations should be large enough so that the targeted statistic parameters such as the location of the mean will not change appreciably with further incremental changes in egg numbers 2 4 reverse time particle tracking rtpt method a new reverse time particle tracking tool was developed into the fluegg program the new rtpt method allows the user to determine the spawning grounds of eggs collected at a given time and sampling location in a river environment generally water depth is much smaller than the width and length of the river hence it can be assumed that the vertical dynamic is independent of the horizontal position a method proposed by thygesen 2011 was implemented for one egg collected at a given location at time t backtracking its location at time t δt yields 1 x t δ t x t u δ t r 2 k h δ t 2 y t δ t y t v δ t r 2 k h δ t 3 z t δ t z t w v s δ t k v z t δ t r 2 k v z t 1 2 k v z t δ t δ t where x y z are coordinates in longitudinal lateral and vertical directions respectively u v w are velocities as functions of x y z t in the longitudinal lateral and vertical directions respectively v s is fall velocity of an egg at a specific post fertilization time r is a random number from a normal distribution having mean zero and standard deviation one k h and k v are turbulent diffusivity coefficients at time t in the horizontal and vertical direction respectively k v represents the gradient of k v visser 1997 garcia et al 2013 as velocity has a vertical profile in open channel hydraulics chow 1959 the vertical location of an egg is critical for calculating how far it can travel during a given period for example an egg that is located near the bottom would travel at lower velocities than an egg located near the surface therefore the egg located near the surface would travel longer distances than that located near the bottom during a given period the rtpt equation in the vertical direction eq 3 is the same as the forward particle tracking equation so that the vertical distribution of particles can be similar between the ftpt and rtpt modules therefore the traveling distance predicted by the two modes can be comparable 3 results 3 1 the performance of rtpt module the rtpt module s ability to predict the spawning location was examined with two constant discharges in a theoretical prismatic rectangular flume for this test the flume is assumed to be rectangular in shape with a cross section of 100 m wide and 5 m deep with length of 20 km and the longitudinal slope of 0 1 m km resembling that of a flat pool two constant flow rates were used in the evaluation one was 25 m3 s corresponding velocity 0 14 m s and the other was 125 m3 s corresponding velocity 0 25 m s these flow rates represent low and near full discharges for the given channel setting with the downstream boundary condition was normal depth the water temperature was 23 c and at this temperature it is approximated that a silver carp egg reaches hatching stage between 1 and 26 h george and chapman 2013 fourteen post fertilization hours were tested within this time range the fluegg program was applied in its ftpt mode in a manner that 5000 silver carp eggs were released from a fixed location hypothetical spawning location in the presumed flume then run for a post fertilization time in the range specified above for each run the location of the mean of the egg mass was recorded to represent the ending location of the eggs next the fluegg program was used in the rtpt mode to estimate the egg spawning location from each of the ending locations of the eggs 5000 eggs were released in each rtpt simulation and the location of the mean egg mass was used to represent the spawning location error in the predicted spawning location was calculated as centroid of the rtpt estimated location designated release site and it was normalized by the travel distance the distance from the egg releasing site to the centroid of the egg mass in the forward transport mode for each post fertilization time the rtpt method was applied for twenty runs and the mean of the twenty errors was used to represent its prediction error this procedure was applied to each of the 14 post fertilization times with the results showing that the prediction error of the rtpt method for this flume setting averages 3 and 4 respectively for the tested low and high flows the magnitudes of errors do not show a correlation with the post fertilization times tested with the rtpt method tending to overestimate egg drift distance and predict spawning locations upstream of the designated release site except for post fertilization times less 2 h under low flow conditions 3 2 comparison between rtpt and ftpt monte carlo methods using fluegg s ftpt capability embke 2017 developed a monte carlo based methodology to estimate spawning locations of grass carp in the lower sandusky river ohio using steady state flows the method involves initiating fluegg runs with randomly selected starting sites but with the spawning time calculated from the time of egg collection and the post fertilization time and for a time span equal to the post fertilization time each feasible spawning location is identified by judging if the predicted egg plume covers the location where the egg is collected and a probability calculated as the percentage of eggs that passed the collection location versus the total number of eggs released is assigned to this feasible site across all feasible spawning sites and their probabilities a probability distribution of spawning location associated with the egg is determined as presently there are no field data on asian carp spawning sites for validating the rtpt algorithm the ftpt monte carlo based method is a viable method for estimating the spawning locations and comparing with the results of the rtpt method in the comparison analysis we selected four egg specimens obtained from the ottawa sampling site from the inhs dataset with discrete development stages assuming these eggs were from silver carp and using the same unsteady streamflow as input in fluegg analysis for each egg the spawning locations were derived for each of the two methods the development stages of the four egg specimens ranged from 7 to 29 and their corresponding post fertilization time ranged from 2 7 to 23 8 hours probability distributions of feasible spawning locations are shown in fig 4 revealing that the results from the two methods generally are in good agreement the difference of mean predicted drift distance between the two methods was 1 0 0 9 2 7 and 2 5 km respectively the rtpt method is more efficient because it only needs one run for each egg while the ftpt monte carlo method needs extensive runs to cover all potential spawning locations for each egg 3 3 spawning grounds in the iww the rtpt method was used to estimate spawning locations of all 530 egg specimens collected on 6 10 2015 and 6 18 2015 that had developmental stages assigned a batch processing tool was developed in the fluegg program for simultaneously processing large numbers of eggs this process imports a csv file that includes information egg sampling time and location egg post fertilization time and water temperature at sampling location specified for individual eggs the spawning locations for all the eggs from each date at each site were processed as recurrence frequency histograms fig 5 these histograms represent a view of possible spawning locations along the river for all of the eggs studied a spawning ground in each pool is a field represented by the integral of spawning locations the spawning ground in each pool is generally at the tailwater section upper part of the pool fig 5 based on egg specimens analyzed from the ottawa site the predicted furthest upstream spawning locations are located in the marseilles pool although the upper tail of the egg distribution extended into the lower dresden island pool most of the eggs collected at ottawa are predicted to have been spawned below the dresden island l d or in the vicinity of the marseilles l d however peak probability of spawning locations on 6 10 2015 seems different from that on 6 18 2015 spawning locations on 6 10 2015 were predicted to be closer to the dresden island and marseilles l ds than those on 6 18 2015 likewise eggs collected at spring valley on 6 10 2015 were most likely spawned downstream of the starved rock l d but the modeling suggests that some eggs collected on 6 18 2015 are more likely to have been spawned upstream of the starved rock l d between the starved rock l d and ottawa most eggs collected at henry on 6 10 2015 were predicted to have been spawned in the uppermost peoria pool downstream of starved rock l d eggs collected at havana were predicted to have been spawned in the upper section of the la grange pool with the peak probability at 3 5 km downstream of the confluence of the mackinaw river and the second peak probability at the confluence of the copperas creek fig 1 4 discussion this study highlighted the challenges of applied biological physical interdisciplinary research with the large amount of eggs collected from the iww the need for a tool like the rtpt module in the fluegg program that can efficiently estimate spawning locations is evident the efficiency of the rtpt method can facilitate future research by allowing for analysis of eggs collected from different sites during different events potential spawning grounds can be identified by analyzing a large number of samples and examined by fish biologists and hydraulic engineers the distance that an egg drifts strongly depends on river hydraulics deters et al 2013 calculated the drift distance using river flow velocity measured from three usgs gages along an over 400 km reach of the missouri river however river velocity may vary substantially along a river by integrating the one dimensional hec ras hydraulic model with the fluegg egg transport model unsteady and non uniform river hydraulics are taken into account for predicting the drift distance field observations indicate that adult asian carp typically congregate in sections of the channel with morphological features that generate preferred hydraulic conditions during high flows yi and liang 1964 deters et al 2013 channel morphologic characteristics conducive to the formation of complex turbulent flows are reaches with rough bed forms such as boulders bars and islands river rapids meandering sections expansion and contraction sections pool and riffle sections with large depth differences and large tributary inflows in the iww the tailwater sections might be important spawning areas for asian carp due to the turbulent flow that is present in these areas which might help to keep eggs suspended until they have completed water hardening chapman and deters 2009 george and chapman 2013 alternatively because dams are at least partial barriers to upstream migrating fish and asian carp are known to make upstream movement associated with spawning abdusamadov 1987 the l ds might serve to congregate asian carp prior to spawning and therefore the majority of spawning may occur at the tailwater locations in river segments that do not have high densities of dams spawning locations might occur in areas with similar turbulent conditions e g downstream of the confluence of large tributaries near islands etc but might be more dispersed as deters et al 2013 found in the missouri river indeed in this study eggs collected at havana appear to have been spawned in at least two areas distant from any dams within the lagrange pool similarly eggs collected at spring valley on 6 18 2015 appear to be spawned between ottawa and the starved rock l d this section of river has many islands that might create turbulence and complex flow characteristics and the confluence of the fox river could also be a potential spawning location silver carp appear to be spawning immediately downstream of the dresden island l d which is within 40 km of the electric dispersal barriers this raises important questions about whether eggs spawned in the upper navigation pools are likely to be transported downstream of starved rock l d before hatching and reaching the gas bladder inflation stage because if these spawning locations are able to provide recruits into the populations in the upper navigation pools then this may have implications for the ability of control efforts to effectively reduce asian carp population levels in the upper pools through harvest alone continuing to determine developmental stages and post fertilization times for additional eggs is highly warranted particularly for eggs collected in the upper river to run additional modeling using the new rtpt method for understanding the chances that any spawning may be occurring in the dresden island pool the brandon road pool or even above the lockport l d differences of probable spawning locations between 6 10 2015 and 6 18 2015 events indicate that spawning grounds in the iww may also be dependent on flow hydrographs which is worth further investigation it is thought specific hydraulic conditions need to exist for adult asian carp to congregate and spawn in their native range yi and liang 1964 found turbulent flow patterns are common features at known spawning grounds and increasing velocity gradient appears to be the proximate spawning cue several studies have found that the magnitude of asian carp spawning in their adapted habitats is also linked to rising hydrographs that occur during periods with water temperatures above 18 c schrank et al 2001 lohmeyer and garvey 2009 deters et al 2013 however data from the illinois river s butler illinois natural history survey unpublished data as well as studies in other systems deters et al 2013 coulter et al 2013 2016 suggest that some spawning does occur during periods of stable or declining water levels asian carp are likely capable of multiple spawning events within a single year schrank and guy 2002 papoulias et al 2006 and although reproductive output does appear to be enhanced by rising water levels spawning activity does not appear to be entirely dependent on increasing discharge the proximate conditions that contribute to successful asian carp reproduction therefore appear to be more complex than currently understood the resulting spawning locations predicted with the application of rtpt module and egg biological data appear to be reasonable however the 530 eggs are a portion of the inhs egg data collected in 2015 the investigation of spawning grounds in each pool can be further refined by analyzing more egg data collected in additional years and sites under different flow regimes and seasons also there are a number of factors that could influence the model results that warrant further consideration because the objective of this paper is to develop the algorithm and demonstrate its applicability in predicting spawning locations based on hydraulic conditions and biological characteristics of sampled eggs the consequences of these factors are more appropriately discussed in future analyses using representative sets of egg samples according to field observations and surveys some asian carp eggs and larvae have been collected from the tributary rivers but in relatively low numbers s butler illinois natural history survey unpublished data a similar pattern was observed for missouri river tributaries deters et al 2013 although these observations do not necessarily preclude the possibility of asian carp spawning in smaller systems kocovsky et al 2012 chapman et al 2013 coulter et al 2013 embke et al 2016 the inhs field monitoring program does consider such possibilities and samples fish eggs both upstream and downstream of tributary junctions and in several iww tributaries however the subset of egg samples used for this study did not show appreciable differences in development stages between stations downstream and upstream of tributary confluences therefore the possibility that eggs were spawned in tributaries was not considered the current design of the hydrodynamic model only considers transport along the main stem of iww it seems that the contribution of asian carp eggs spawned in tributaries to the overall density of eggs in the mainstem iww is minor but further study in major tributaries of the iww would be worthwhile egg samples at each site tend to concentrate in one or two age groups but the sampled data also contain some outliers this can be caused by either a the eggs come from different spawning locations with the older subset of eggs having drifted farther before being collected at the same location as younger eggs that are transported from a less distant spawning location or b the eggs are spawned at the same location at different times but the older eggs are not transported as far as might be predicted due to local hydraulic mechanisms that slowed their downstream transport thereby resulting in them being collected at the same location as younger eggs when sampling occurred further study is required to understand how complex features of a river channel might affect the predictions of the model egg transport in areas such as side channels sloughs and backwater lakes which have longer residence times could not be accurately represented with a one dimensional hydrodynamic model higher dimensional hydrodynamic modeling quijano et al 2017 zhu et al 2017a b will be required to accurately represent egg transport through such areas egg developmental rates are highly temperature dependent chapman and george 2011 george and chapman 2013 2015 the present study did not include the temporal and spatial variations of water temperature and the post fertilization time was derived using the water temperature at the site and the time of data collection the water temperatures along the iww can vary due to power plants and effluents from wastewater treatment plants especially in the upper river and tributary inflows can lower water temperatures over a smaller gradient particularly after spring rain events even a 0 1 c difference could have a substantial influence on the predicted post fertilization time especially for later developmental stages how water temperature changes during egg transport and how temperature changes modify the egg s growth function warrants additional study 5 conclusions the new fluegg program is in the public domain and can be accessed through the github website fluvial egg drift simulator 2017 the developed rtpt algorithm is effective in back tracking the distance traveled by individual asian carp eggs although further evaluation of the method will need to be refined based on measurements from laboratory experiments or field collections with its implementation in the fluegg program the centroids of predicted spawning locations for multiple egg samples can be effectively estimated by using the centroid to represent the most likely spawning location and analyzing for spawning grounds from a large amount of egg samples the study showed that such results can provide estimates of the spawning grounds in multiple pools in the iww in a more efficient manner than a monte carlo method identification of asian carp spawning grounds is important for effective mitigation planning and will enable scientists to advance research in biological and physical processes governing the reproduction and recruitment of asian carp based on the 530 egg specimens analyzed the most upstream spawning locations for silver carp in june 2015 were likely downstream of the dresden island l d tailwater sections of each l d appeared to be the preferred areas for silver carp spawning the model also identifies the tailwater section downstream of starved rock l d as the preferred spawning grounds for egg samples collected from spring valley and henry on the two examined sampling dates overall these results agree with field observations of asian carp status in the iww iww 2017 and known asian carp spawning conditions yi and liang 1964 degrandchamp et al

information on abundances of asian carp eggs in the iww s navigation pools post fertilization times derived from egg development stages and water temperatures can be used to estimate spawning times of

eggs and determining their developmental stages and associated post fertilization times papoulias et al 2006 deters et al 2013 coulter et al 2013 embke et al 2016 identifying spawning locations however requires estimation of the distance that eggs have drifted prior to collection deters et al 2013 this paper describes a reverse time particle tracking rtpt algorithm that reverses the streamflow dynamics that move eggs downstream to predict the spawning location from where drifting eggs are collected in the river for practical applications the rtpt is implemented as a module of the existing fluvial egg drift simulator fluegg computer program garcia et al 2013 fluegg was developed to predict the transport and drift of asian carp eggs in rivers following spawning i e in forward time particle tracking ftpt mode fluegg is a viable platform for implementing the rtpt algorithm because fluegg consists of a hydrodynamic module influence of flow velocity shear dispersion and turbulence diffusion for transporting the eggs a biological growth module describing the development of eggs over time and the interactions between hydrodynamic and biological functions garcia et al 2013 murphy et al 2016 in its ftpt mode fluegg has been applied to simulate the transport and risk of hatching of silver carp eggs in the lower saint joseph river michigan under various water temperatures and hydrodynamic conditions garcia et al 2015 to assess the vulnerability of the caws and the lower des plaines river to asian carp spawning and recruitment using hypothetical spawning grounds and assigned flow conditions murphy et al 2016 and to estimate spawning locations of grass carp in the lower sandusky river ohio embke 2017 this paper demonstrates the applicability and efficiency of the rtpt module using a portion of the asian carp eggs collected by inhs in 2015 2 methodology 2 1 study area and the 2015 asian carp egg samples the study area for this project extends from the lockport l d to the confluence of the illinois river with the mississippi river at grafton illinois encompassing six other l ds fig 1 this study uses river kilometers rkm hereafter as a reference system beginning at the most upstream cross section rkm 0 and continuing downstream this system differs and should be distinguished from the river miles rm typically used for navigation purposes the overall hydraulics varies along the river due to the longitudinal gradient pattern river geomorphology and man made structures higher bed gradients 20 cm km and narrower floodplain feature the reach upstream of hennepin a town downstream of spring valley and upstream of henry not shown in fig 1 in the reaches downstream of hennepin the iww has much milder bed gradients 2 cm km and a broad floodplain free flowing transitional and impounded reaches commonly exist within individual navigation pools pools downstream of the starved rock l d however generally exhibit free flowing natural channel characteristics upstream of the dresden island l d the distinction of free flowing transitional and impounded reaches also becomes less obvious due to the high head height of the dams and the shorter extent of the navigation pools although turbulent conditions generally exist in the tailwater sections at upper part of a pool 2 1 1 asian carp egg sampling method inhs scientists

fertilization times water temperature data collected along the iww by southern illinois university siu were provided for this study mathew lubejko september 5 2016 water temperatures from reporting stations within 1 6 km of egg sampling locations were used for each sampling time period because egg samples that were subjected to genetic analysis were predominately identified as silver carp parameters specific to silver carp eggs were used for the purposes of this study george and chapman 2013 in the remaining text we use silver carp when discussing results pertinent to the fluegg analysis and asian carp when referring to information pertinent to the multiple species the majority of asian carp eggs collected in 2015 were from four sampling sites fig 1 and collected on two dates june 10 and 18 2015 a subset of these eggs n 530 were selected for estimation of spawning locations by the rtpt method egg specimens were grouped into four classes according to the development stages by an interval of 8 for presentation purposes table 1 2 2 unsteady hydrodynamic model drift distance of asian carp eggs in a riverine environment depends on egg characteristics e g size density and developmental stage water temperature and streamflow dynamics chapman and george 2011 kocovsky et al 2012 murphy and jackson 2013 coulter et al 2016 george et al 2017 streamflow dynamics in the river reach were obtained through numerical simulations because the locations of gaging stations fig 1 alone do not provide sufficient integrated coverage of the entire iww to adequately model the flow dynamics the study determined such information by developing a one dimensional 1d unsteady hydrodynamic model of the iww using the hydrologic engineering center river analysis system hec ras version 5 03 program hydrologic engineering center river analysis system 2017 after establishing the model it was calibrated with measured data to assure the simulated results were representative of realistic flow conditions the iww hec ras model generates time dependent hydraulic variables including water depth and flow velocity over the study domain as inputs to the fluegg program users specify egg information to design a run and fluegg reads in the time varying hydraulic outputs from the hec ras program fig 2 in fluegg users can perform egg drifting analysis or invoke the new rtpt module described below for back casting spawning locations from egg collection sites 2 2 1 hydrodynamic model development an 1d iww hec ras model was developed by combining seven individual hec ras navigation pool models obtained from usace rock island district u s army corps of engineers rock island district 2003 rating curves connecting individual pool models were developed for each l d in addition tributary inflows and upstream and downstream boundary conditions were included in the model the final hec ras model includes 1236 cross sections spanning over 464 km from the uppermost river station in the brandon road pool to grafton in the alton pool rating curves which are curvilinear relationships between stage and discharge at given locations were developed to approximate the flow discharge passing through each l d usace monitors the head and tail pool levels at each l d us army corps of engineers river gages 2017 discharges through each l d were first estimated by applying discharges from the nearest usgs gaging station to the site station numbers in table 2 national water information system 2018 and then adjusted iteratively with hec ras runs one limitation of this approach is that rating curves can provide inaccurate estimates in low gradient reaches where a specific discharge might correspond to various stage levels also when approximating the effects of a structure with a rating curve tailwater influences are not considered however under high discharges l d gates can be operated in their maximum setting lifted out of the water starved rock marseilles dresden island dams or lowered to the bottom la grange and peoria l ds u s army corps of engineers rock island district 2015 during june 10 18 of 2015 the illinois waterway acted as an open river from the marseilles pool to the confluence with the mississippi river under these circumstances using the rating curve approach is acceptable at brandon road l d the river stage levels are generally controlled therefore a linear relation between stage and discharge was assumed for the brandon road l d the model upstream boundary condition bc corresponds to the measured streamflow discharge from the usgs gage at the des plaines river at route 53 joliet il site 1 fig 1 usgs station number 05537980 and the downstream bc corresponds to the measured river stage at the usgs gage at the mississippi river at grafton il fig 1 usgs station number 05587450 national water information system 2018 when modeling a long stretch of a river the resulting hydraulics are representative only if the amount of streamflow in each segment of the river is representative for the present study tributary inflows are considered to be the primary contributor to changes in streamflow along the river fifteen of the iww tributaries are currently monitored by usgs see appendix which account for approximately 73 of the total drainage area of the illinois river basin inflows for 34 ungaged tributaries with drainage area equal to or larger than 10 4 km2 were estimated using the drainage area ratio method emerson et al 2005 2 2 2 model calibration the iww hec ras model was calibrated using measured stage and discharge data at usgs gaging stations along the iww national water information system 2018 nine active usgs gaging stations are available in the study domain see fig 1 and table 2 with five reporting both stage and discharge and the remaining four reporting stage only the automated calibration option in hec ras was used to perform the roughness factor calibration as the main objective of the hec ras modeling was to provide hydraulic input to the fluegg model the calibration covered the entire study period from 5 1 2015 to 6 30 2015 quantitative statistics nash sutcliffe efficiency nse percent bias pbias and ratio of the root mean square error to the standard deviation of measured data rsr along with graphical analyses were used to assess how well the simulated data matched measured data according to general performance evaluation criteria for a monthly time step moriasi et al 2007 the model is considered as a very good model if nse is in the range of 0 75 1 pbias is 10 and rsr is in the range of 0 0 5 the time step for hec ras output was specified at every 15 min far less than a monthly time step because more fluctuations in simulated outputs are expected in shorter time steps than in longer time steps engel et al 2007 the performance criteria developed for a monthly interval are rather strict for the current evaluation however these statistics indicate that the model performs very well for all usgs stations except stage data of station 1 see table 2 gage station 1 is located at the brandon road pool see fig 1 where stage level is controlled by the brandon road l d therefore a rating curve does not apply very well at this location simulated stage and flow hydrographs of two stations rkm 150 81 gage number 4 and rkm 70 04 gage number 3 agree with measurement data well fig 3 the simulation period 5 1 2015 6 30 2015 covers a range of discharges and the hec ras model performs well for both low and high flows the hydrograph began to rise around 6 10 2015 and peaked around 6 18 2015 encompassing dates when asian carp egg samples were collected in the field 2 3 fluvial egg drift simulator fluegg program the previous versions of the fluegg model treated the river hydraulic characteristics as steady state conditions constant in time the existing fluegg model was enhanced to be able to use unsteady state hydraulic characteristics the new version of the fluegg model fluvial egg drift simulator 2017 allows the user to import spatially distributed hydraulic time series directly from a hec ras model when simulating egg transport and distribution in the fluegg model the user specifies hydraulic inputs egg characteristics and a simulation scenario including the simulation starting time drifting hours and the number of eggs to release fluegg is a lagrangian model therefore every egg moves independently as a function of both the river flow characteristics and the egg characteristics therefore in natural turbulent flows eggs of identical characteristics that are released at the same location will not end up at the same location after a given drifting time fluegg simulates the effects of turbulent diffusion on egg transport distance with random walk and random displacement techniques garcia et al 2013 the location of eggs at the end of the simulation time is presented as a distribution of the egg mass plume the result is the span and distribution of the plume so the location of its centroid mean and the leading and trailing edges can be predicted since the egg mass plume is a statistic measure the number of eggs used in simulations should be large enough so that the targeted statistic parameters such as the location of the mean will not change appreciably with further incremental changes in egg numbers 2 4 reverse time particle tracking rtpt method a new reverse time particle tracking tool was developed into the fluegg program the new rtpt method allows the user to determine the spawning grounds of eggs collected at a given time and sampling location in a river environment generally water depth is much smaller than the width and length of the river hence it can be assumed that the vertical dynamic is independent of the horizontal position a method proposed by thygesen 2011 was implemented for one egg collected at a given location at time t backtracking its location at time t δt yields 1 x t δ t x t u δ t r 2 k h δ t 2 y t δ t y t v δ t r 2 k h δ t 3 z t δ t z t w v s δ t k v z t δ t r 2 k v z t 1 2 k v z t δ t δ t where x y z are coordinates in longitudinal lateral and vertical directions respectively u v w are velocities as functions of x y z t in the longitudinal lateral and vertical directions respectively v s is fall velocity of an egg at a specific post fertilization time r is a random number from a normal distribution having mean zero and standard deviation one k h and k v are turbulent diffusivity coefficients at time t in the horizontal and vertical direction respectively k v represents the gradient of k v visser 1997 garcia et al 2013 as velocity has a vertical profile in open channel hydraulics chow 1959 the vertical location of an egg is critical for calculating how far it can travel during a given period for example an egg that is located near the bottom would travel at lower velocities than an egg located near the surface therefore the egg located near the surface would travel longer distances than that located near the bottom during a given period the rtpt equation in the vertical direction eq 3 is the same as the forward particle tracking equation so that the vertical distribution of particles can be similar between the ftpt and rtpt modules therefore the traveling distance predicted by the two modes can be comparable 3 results 3 1 the performance of rtpt module the rtpt module s ability to predict the spawning location was examined with two constant discharges in a theoretical prismatic rectangular flume for this test the flume is assumed to be rectangular in shape with a cross section of 100 m wide and 5 m deep with length of 20 km and the longitudinal slope of 0 1 m km resembling that of a flat pool two constant flow rates were used in the evaluation one was 25 m3 s corresponding velocity 0 14 m s and the other was 125 m3 s corresponding velocity 0 25 m s these flow rates represent low and near full discharges for the given channel setting with the downstream boundary condition was normal depth the water temperature was 23 c and at this temperature it is approximated that a silver carp egg reaches hatching stage between 1 and 26 h george and chapman 2013 fourteen post fertilization hours were tested within this time range the fluegg program was applied in its ftpt mode in a manner that 5000 silver carp eggs were released from a fixed location hypothetical spawning location in the presumed flume then run for a post fertilization time in the range specified above for each run the location of the mean of the egg mass was recorded to represent the ending location of the eggs next the fluegg program was used in the rtpt mode to estimate the egg spawning location from each of the ending locations of the eggs 5000 eggs were released in each rtpt simulation and the location of the mean egg mass was used to represent the spawning location error in the predicted spawning location was calculated as centroid of the rtpt estimated location designated release site and it was normalized by the travel distance the distance from the egg releasing site to the centroid of the egg mass in the forward transport mode for each post fertilization time the rtpt method was applied for twenty runs and the mean of the twenty errors was used to represent its prediction error this procedure was applied to each of the 14 post fertilization times with the results showing that the prediction error of the rtpt method for this flume setting averages 3 and 4 respectively for the tested low and high flows the magnitudes of errors do not show a correlation with the post fertilization times tested with the rtpt method tending to overestimate egg drift distance and predict spawning locations upstream of the designated release site except for post fertilization times less 2 h under low flow conditions 3 2 comparison between rtpt and ftpt monte carlo methods using fluegg s ftpt capability embke 2017 developed a monte carlo based methodology to estimate spawning locations of grass carp in the lower sandusky river ohio using steady state flows the method involves initiating fluegg runs with randomly selected starting sites but with the spawning time calculated from the time of egg collection and the post fertilization time and for a time span equal to the post fertilization time each feasible spawning location is identified by judging if the predicted egg plume covers the location where the egg is collected and a probability calculated as the percentage of eggs that passed the collection location versus the total number of eggs released is assigned to this feasible site across all feasible spawning sites and their probabilities a probability distribution of spawning location associated with the egg is determined as presently there are no field data on asian carp spawning sites for validating the rtpt algorithm the ftpt monte carlo based method is a viable method for estimating the spawning locations and comparing with the results of the rtpt method in the comparison analysis we selected four egg specimens obtained from the ottawa sampling site from the inhs dataset with discrete development stages assuming these eggs were from silver carp and using the same unsteady streamflow as input in fluegg analysis for each egg the spawning locations were derived for each of the two methods the development stages of the four egg specimens ranged from 7 to 29 and their corresponding post fertilization time ranged from 2 7 to 23 8 hours probability distributions of feasible spawning locations are shown in fig 4 revealing that the results from the two methods generally are in good agreement the difference of mean predicted drift distance between the two methods was 1 0 0 9 2 7 and 2 5 km respectively the rtpt method is more efficient because it only needs one run for each egg while the ftpt monte carlo method needs extensive runs to cover all potential spawning locations for each egg 3 3 spawning grounds in the iww the rtpt method was used to estimate spawning locations of all 530 egg specimens collected on 6 10 2015 and 6 18 2015 that had developmental stages assigned a batch processing tool was developed in the fluegg program for simultaneously processing large numbers of eggs this process imports a csv file that includes information egg sampling time and location egg post fertilization time and water temperature at sampling location specified for individual eggs the spawning locations for all the eggs from each date at each site were processed as recurrence frequency histograms fig 5 these histograms represent a view of possible spawning locations along the river for all of the eggs studied a spawning ground in each pool is a field represented by the integral of spawning locations the spawning ground in each pool is generally at the tailwater section upper part of the pool fig 5 based on egg specimens analyzed from the ottawa site the predicted furthest upstream spawning locations are located in the marseilles pool although the upper tail of the egg distribution extended into the lower dresden island pool most of the eggs collected at ottawa are predicted to have been spawned below the dresden island l d or in the vicinity of the marseilles l d however peak probability of spawning locations on 6 10 2015 seems different from that on 6 18 2015 spawning locations on 6 10 2015 were predicted to be closer to the dresden island and marseilles l ds than those on 6 18 2015 likewise eggs collected at spring valley on 6 10 2015 were most likely spawned downstream of the starved rock l d but the modeling suggests that some eggs collected on 6 18 2015 are more likely to have been spawned upstream of the starved rock l d between the starved rock l d and ottawa most eggs collected at henry on 6 10 2015 were predicted to have been spawned in the uppermost peoria pool downstream of starved rock l d eggs collected at havana were predicted to have been spawned in the upper section of the la grange pool with the peak probability at 3 5 km downstream of the confluence of the mackinaw river and the second peak probability at the confluence of the copperas creek fig 1 4 discussion this study highlighted the challenges of applied biological physical interdisciplinary research with the large amount of eggs collected from the iww the need for a tool like the rtpt module in the fluegg program that can efficiently estimate spawning locations is evident the efficiency of the rtpt method can facilitate future research by allowing for analysis of eggs collected from different sites during different events potential spawning grounds can be identified by analyzing a large number of samples and examined by fish biologists and hydraulic engineers the distance that an egg drifts strongly depends on river hydraulics deters et al 2013 calculated the drift distance using river flow velocity measured from three usgs gages along an over 400 km reach of the missouri river however river velocity may vary substantially along a river by integrating the one dimensional hec ras hydraulic model with the fluegg egg transport model unsteady and non uniform river hydraulics are taken into account for predicting the drift distance field observations indicate that adult asian carp typically congregate in sections of the channel with morphological features that generate preferred hydraulic conditions during high flows yi and liang 1964 deters et al 2013 channel morphologic characteristics conducive to the formation of complex turbulent flows are reaches with rough bed forms such as boulders bars and islands river rapids meandering sections expansion and contraction sections pool and riffle sections with large depth differences and large tributary inflows in the iww the tailwater sections might be important spawning areas for asian carp due to the turbulent flow that is present in these areas which might help to keep eggs suspended until they have completed water hardening chapman and deters 2009 george and chapman 2013 alternatively because dams are at least partial barriers to upstream migrating fish and asian carp are known to make upstream movement associated with spawning abdusamadov 1987 the l ds might serve to congregate asian carp prior to spawning and therefore the majority of spawning may occur at the tailwater locations in river segments that do not have high densities of dams spawning locations might occur in areas with similar turbulent conditions e g downstream of the confluence of large tributaries near islands etc but might be more dispersed as deters et al 2013 found in the missouri river indeed in this study eggs collected at havana appear to have been spawned in at least two areas distant from any dams within the lagrange pool similarly eggs collected at spring valley on 6 18 2015 appear to be spawned between ottawa and the starved rock l d this section of river has many islands that might create turbulence and complex flow characteristics and the confluence of the fox river could also be a potential spawning location silver carp appear to be spawning immediately downstream of the dresden island l d which is within 40 km of the electric dispersal barriers this raises important questions about whether eggs spawned in the upper navigation pools are likely to be transported downstream of starved rock l d before hatching and reaching the gas bladder inflation stage because if these spawning locations are able to provide recruits into the populations in the upper navigation pools then this may have implications for the ability of control efforts to effectively reduce asian carp population levels in the upper pools through harvest alone continuing to determine developmental stages and post fertilization times for additional eggs is highly warranted particularly for eggs collected in the upper river to run additional modeling using the new rtpt method for understanding the chances that any spawning may be occurring in the dresden island pool the brandon road pool or even above the lockport l d differences of probable spawning locations between 6 10 2015 and 6 18 2015 events indicate that spawning grounds in the iww may also be dependent on flow hydrographs which is worth further investigation it is thought specific hydraulic conditions need to exist for adult asian carp to congregate and spawn in their native range yi and liang 1964 found turbulent flow patterns are common features at known spawning grounds and increasing velocity gradient appears to be the proximate spawning cue several studies have found that the magnitude of asian carp spawning in their adapted habitats is also linked to rising hydrographs that occur during periods with water temperatures above 18 c schrank et al 2001 lohmeyer and garvey 2009 deters et al 2013 however data from the illinois river s butler illinois natural history survey unpublished data as well as studies in other systems deters et al 2013 coulter et al 2013 2016 suggest that some spawning does occur during periods of stable or declining water levels asian carp are likely capable of multiple spawning events within a single year schrank and guy 2002 papoulias et al 2006 and although reproductive output does appear to be enhanced by rising water levels spawning activity does not appear to be entirely dependent on increasing discharge the proximate conditions that contribute to successful asian carp reproduction therefore appear to be more complex than currently understood the resulting spawning locations predicted with the application of rtpt module and egg biological data appear to be reasonable however the 530 eggs are a portion of the inhs egg data collected in 2015 the investigation of spawning grounds in each pool can be further refined by analyzing more egg data collected in additional years and sites under different flow regimes and seasons also there are a number of factors that could influence the model results that warrant further consideration because the objective of this paper is to develop the algorithm and demonstrate its applicability in predicting spawning locations based on hydraulic conditions and biological characteristics of sampled eggs the consequences of these factors are more appropriately discussed in future analyses using representative sets of egg samples according to field observations and surveys some asian carp eggs and larvae have been collected from the tributary rivers but in relatively low numbers s butler illinois natural history survey unpublished data a similar pattern was observed for missouri river tributaries deters et al 2013 although these observations do not necessarily preclude the possibility of asian carp spawning in smaller systems kocovsky et al 2012 chapman et al 2013 coulter et al 2013 embke et al 2016 the inhs field monitoring program does consider such possibilities and samples fish eggs both upstream and downstream of tributary junctions and in several iww tributaries however the subset of egg samples used for this study did not show appreciable differences in development stages between stations downstream and upstream of tributary confluences therefore the possibility that eggs were spawned in tributaries was not considered the current design of the hydrodynamic model only considers transport along the main stem of iww it seems that the contribution of asian carp eggs spawned in tributaries to the overall density of eggs in the mainstem iww is minor but further study in major tributaries of the iww would be worthwhile egg samples at each site tend to concentrate in one or two age groups but the sampled data also contain some outliers this can be caused by either a the eggs come from different spawning locations with the older subset of eggs having drifted farther before being collected at the same location as younger eggs that are transported from a less distant spawning location or b the eggs are spawned at the same location at different times but the older eggs are not transported as far as might be predicted due to local hydraulic mechanisms that slowed their downstream transport thereby resulting in them being collected at the same location as younger eggs when sampling occurred further study is required to understand how complex features of a river channel might affect the predictions of the model egg transport in areas such as side channels sloughs and backwater lakes which have longer residence times could not be accurately represented with a one dimensional hydrodynamic model higher dimensional hydrodynamic modeling quijano et al 2017 zhu et al 2017a b will be required to accurately represent egg transport through such areas egg developmental rates are highly temperature dependent chapman and george 2011 george and chapman 2013 2015 the present study did not include the temporal and spatial variations of water temperature and the post fertilization time was derived using the water temperature at the site and the time of data collection the water temperatures along the iww can vary due to power plants and effluents from wastewater treatment plants especially in the upper river and tributary inflows can lower water temperatures over a smaller gradient particularly after spring rain events even a 0 1 c difference could have a substantial influence on the predicted post fertilization time especially for later developmental stages how water temperature changes during egg transport and how temperature changes modify the egg s growth function warrants additional study 5 conclusions the new fluegg program is in the public domain and can be accessed through the github website fluvial egg drift simulator 2017 the developed rtpt algorithm is effective in back tracking the distance traveled by individual asian carp eggs although further evaluation of the method will need to be refined based on measurements from laboratory experiments or field collections with its implementation in the fluegg program the centroids of predicted spawning locations for multiple egg samples can be effectively estimated by using the centroid to represent the most likely spawning location and analyzing for spawning grounds from a large amount of egg samples the study showed that such results can provide estimates of the spawning grounds in multiple pools in the iww in a more efficient manner than a monte carlo method identification of asian carp spawning grounds is important for effective mitigation planning and will enable scientists to advance research in biological and physical processes governing the reproduction and recruitment of asian carp based on the 530 egg specimens analyzed the most upstream spawning locations for silver carp in june 2015 were likely downstream of the dresden island l d tailwater sections of each l d appeared to be the preferred areas for silver carp spawning the model also identifies the tailwater section downstream of starved rock l d as the preferred spawning grounds for egg samples collected from spring valley and henry on the two examined sampling dates overall these results agree with field observations of asian carp status in the iww iww 2017 and known asian carp spawning conditions yi and liang 1964 degrandchamp et al
